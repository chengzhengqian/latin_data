[10] Concerning Virgil, too, he offers the following words in the same passage: “Our Virgil too inserted some verses harsh and irregular and extending somewhat beyond the proper length for no other reason than that the crowd used to Ennius might find a touch of antiquity in the new poem.” [11] I am already weary of Seneca’s words, yet I will not pass by these jokes of that foolish and tasteless man: “There are,” he says, “some thoughts in Ennius of such lofty sentiment that, even though written among the unwashed [lit. ‘smelling like goats’], they can still give pleasure among the perfumed”; and, after he had criticized the lines we have quoted above about Cethegus: “You may observe,” he says, “that those who love verses of this kind are the same people who admire even Sotericus’ couches.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL294_51_3" id="target_note_LCL294_51_3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
