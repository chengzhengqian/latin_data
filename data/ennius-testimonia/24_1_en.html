<p class="noindent">I am not doing this [citing examples of obsolete words] now so diligently to show how much time I have wasted with a grammarian, but for you to understand from this how many words in Ennius and Accius have fallen into disuse, while in him [Virgil] too, who is studied daily, are some words that have been taken away from us.</p>
