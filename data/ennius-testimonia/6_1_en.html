<p class="noindent">Like that story about Nasica:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL294_13_1" id="target_note_LCL294_13_1"><sup>1</sup></a> when he went to visit the poet Ennius and asked for him at the door, the maid said that Ennius was not at home, but Nasica suspected she had said this on her master’s order and that he was inside. A few days later, when Ennius went to visit Nasica and asked for him at the door, Nasica called out that he was not at home. Then Ennius said: “What’s that? Don’t I recognize your voice?” Thereupon Nasica said: “You are shameless! When I asked for you, I believed your maid that you were not at home. Will you not believe me myself?”</p>

<p class="noindent">And above all it may be observed in the case of poets, who have a very close affinity to orators, how different Ennius, Pacuvius, and Accius are from each other, as among the Greeks are Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides, although all of them are granted almost the same praise for their different styles of writing.</p>

So as not to keep you dangling too long, he took the palm. But nothing so puny, nothing so without voice, nothing so—but keep this to yourself. In <span class="italic">Andromacha</span> at least he was taller than Astyanax, in the others he did not have anyone as his equal.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL294_13_2" id="target_note_LCL294_13_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
