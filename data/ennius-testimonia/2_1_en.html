<p class="noindent">In the book he wrote about poets, Sedigitus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL294_5_1" id="target_note_LCL294_5_1"><sup>1</sup></a> demonstrates in the following verses what he thinks of those who wrote comedies and whom he believes to surpass all others, and finally to which position of honor he assigns each individual: “we see that many debate this matter, being uncertain to which comic poet they should assign the victory palm. By my judgment, I will resolve this uncertainty for you, so that, if anyone thinks otherwise, that opinion has no value. I give the victory palm to the comic poet Caecilius Statius. Plautus, in second place, easily surpasses the others. Then Naevius, who is passionate, is in third position. If there is something to give to the one in fourth place, it will be given to Licinius. I have Atilius following Licinius. In sixth place Terence will follow them, Turpilius holds seventh, Trabea eighth position. I easily put Luscius [Lanuvinus] in ninth place. As the tenth poet I add Ennius by virtue of his antiquity.”</p>
