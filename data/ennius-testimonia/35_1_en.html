<p class="noindent">A number of us young men, friends of his, were spending the summer holidays in playful recreation at Puteoli, with literary diversions and modest and honorable pleasures with the rhetorician Antonius Iulianus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL294_71_1" id="target_note_LCL294_71_1"><sup>1</sup></a> a genuinely fine man and of distinguished eloquence. [2] And there it was then announced to Iulianus that a certain professional reader, a man not without learning, was reciting Ennius’ <span class="italic">Annals</span> in a quite refined and sonorous voice to the people in the theater. [3] “Let’s go,” he said, “to hear that ‘Ennianist,’ whoever he is”: for that was the name by which the man wished to be called.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL294_71_2-1" id="target_note_LCL294_71_2-1"><sup>2</sup></a> [4] When we had found him already reading to great applause—in fact, he was reading the seventh book of Ennius’ <span class="italic">Annals</span>—, we first heard him delivering these lines incorrectly: “then with great force the four-footed horse [<span class="italic">quadrupes ecus</span>] and the elephants rush forward,” and without adding many more verses after that, he departed to universal praise and applause. [5] Then Iulianus, as he was leaving the theater, said: “What do you think of this reader and the ‘four-footed horse’?” For so indeed did he read: “then with great force the four-footed horse [<span class="italic">quadrupes ecus</span>] and the elephants rush forward.”
