In the end, all those Maximi, Marcelli, and Fulvii are not glorified without communal praise for all of us. For that reason our ancestors received into the community the man who had done these things, a man from Rudiae. Shall we thrust out from our community this man from Heraclea,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL294_9_3" id="target_note_LCL294_9_3"><sup>3</sup></a> desired by many communities, though legally established in this one?</p>

For that reason, in a city where commanders practically under arms cultivated the name of poets and the shrines of the Muses, judges in civilian garb should not shrink from honoring the Muses and looking after poets.</p>
