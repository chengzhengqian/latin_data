<p class="noindent">The elder Scipio,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL294_79_1" id="target_note_LCL294_79_1"><sup>1</sup></a> who single-handedly diverted the Punic War from the Italian shores to their [the Carthaginians’] own capital, wielded arms not without the arts of the Pierides [Muses]: as leader, the cultivation of poets was always very important to him, [5] for prowess enjoys recruiting the Muses as witnesses for itself; whoever does things worthy of a poem loves a poem. Thus, whether, at a young age, he subjected the Spanish ocean to our laws as avenger of his father’s shade<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL294_79_2" id="target_note_LCL294_79_2"><sup>2</sup></a> or whether, to break Tyrian [Carthaginian] forces with a sure lance, [10] he brought to the Libyan sea standards to be feared, learned Ennius clung to his side and was accustomed in all campaigns to go right among the bugles. After the war trumpets, the infantry loved his singing, and the cavalry, bloody with fresh slaughter, praised him. [15] And when he [Scipio] celebrated triumphs, after the twin cities of Carthage<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL294_79_3" id="target_note_LCL294_79_3"><sup>3</sup></a> had been conquered (one he conquered as avenger of this father, the other of his country), when he at last, after the ruin of a long war, forced mournful Libya to walk before his chariot, Victory brought the returning Muses with her, [20] and Mars’ laurel was a garland for the poet.</p>
