<p class="noindent">In my daily studies as a very young man, I [the speaker Crassus] used to set for myself that exercise in particular which I knew Carbo,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL294_11_1" id="target_note_LCL294_11_1"><sup>1</sup></a> that old enemy of ours, used to employ: I would take verses that were as weighty as possible or read as much of an oration as I could retain in memory. Then I would express the very matter I had read, choosing words as different as I possibly could. But I later noticed the following flaw in this procedure, namely that those words most suited to each matter and most elaborate and best had been used by either Ennius, if I was practicing with his verses, or by Gracchus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL294_11_2" id="target_note_LCL294_11_2"><sup>2</sup></a> if I had happened to set an oration of his as my model: so, if I used the same words, the exercise was useless, if I used others, it was even an obstacle, since I was growing accustomed to using less appropriate ones.</p>
