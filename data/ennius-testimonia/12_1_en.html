as our poets have translated plays, I would do poor service, I believe, to my countrymen if I brought these divine intellects over for them to get to know! I have not done this so far, yet neither do I believe I am forbidden to do so. Still, I will only translate certain passages, if it seems right, and particularly from those I have just mentioned, when the appropriate occasion for doing so arises, just as Ennius is accustomed to do with regard to Homer, and Afranius to Menander.</p>

<p class="noindent">In learning and in every kind of literature Greece surpassed us: it was easy to prevail over those who did not offer resistance. For while among the Greeks the class of poets is the oldest of the learned ones, if, at any rate, Homer and Hesiod lived before the founding of Rome and Archilochus in the reign of Romulus, we admitted poetry rather later. About 510 years after the founding of Rome, Livius [Andronicus] produced a play in the consulship of Gaius Claudius, Caecus’ son, and Marcus Tuditanus [240 BC], in the year before the birth of Ennius. He [Andronicus] was older than Plautus and Naevius. Poets were thus recognized and welcomed late by our people. While it is said in <span class="italic">Origins</span> [a historical work by Cato] that guests at dinner parties were accustomed to sing to the accompaniment of a piper about the accomplishments of famous men, Cato’s speech in which he put forward as a criticism of Marcus Nobilior that he had taken poets to his province, nonetheless demonstrates that there was no honor for this class. That man [Nobilior], as consul, had in fact, as we know, taken Ennius to Aetolia.</p>
