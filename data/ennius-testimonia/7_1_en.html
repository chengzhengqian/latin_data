<p class="noindent">Of those, however, who are certainly on record and known to have been eloquent and recognized as such, the first is Cornelius Cethegus [cos. 204 BC], of whose eloquence Ennius is a witness and indeed, in my view, a suitable one, especially since he had heard him himself and writes about him after his death; there is thus no suspicion that he lied for the sake of friendship.</p>

So he [Ennius] says about himself, and he does not lie in glorifying himself: for the matter is like this. The Latin <span class="italic">Odyssey</span> [Livius Andronicus’ epic] is, as it were, like some work of Daedalus, and the dramas of Livius [Andronicus] are not worth a second reading.

In this Accius’ error was so great that under these consuls [Gaius Cornelius Cethegus and Quintus Minucius Rufus in 197 BC] Ennius was 40 years old; if Livius were a contemporary of his, he who was the first to produce a play [Livius] would be considerably younger than those who produced many before these consuls, both Plautus and Naevius.
