that the term <span class="italic">eudaimones</span> is applied to those blessed ones who have a good <span class="italic">daemon,</span> that is, a mind of perfect virtue. <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span>In our language, to give a translation that is perhaps not the best, but at any rate one I will venture to give, you could call a <span class="italic">daemon</span> a “genius,” because the god that is everyone’s soul, though immortal, nevertheless is jointly “engendered” with him as a human being. <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span>Hence those prayers that people address to the “genius” and to the knees seem to me to prove our interconnection and our link, since they use two nouns to cover soul and body, of which we are the combined and linked expression.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL534_377_28a" id="target_note_LCL534_377_28a"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
