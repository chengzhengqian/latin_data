<h2>VII. <span class="sc">Joseph Recognised by his Brethren</span></h2>
<p>The same boy who was sold by his brothers’ stratagem gives in his turn secret order that a bowl be hidden in a sack of corn; and when Joseph detains them on accusation of theft the treacherous sale is discovered. They recognise their brother and are put to shame by his forgiveness.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL398_351_a" id="target_note_LCL398_351_a"><sup>a</sup></a></p>

<h2>VIII. <span class="sc">The Fire in the Bush</span></h2>
<p>God in the form of fire playing on the thorn-bushes with flashing countenance accosts a young man who was at that time, as it chanced, the master of a herd. He being bidden takes his rod, and the rod becomes a serpent. He unlooses the ties on his feet, and hastens to Pharaoh’s court.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL398_351_b" id="target_note_LCL398_351_b"><sup>b</sup></a></p>

<h2>IX. <span class="sc">The Passage of the Sea</span></h2>
<p>The righteous man passes on his way in safety even through the great waters. Behold, the Red Sea yawns apart for the servants of God, while the same sea drowns the furious evil-doers. Pharaoh is overwhelmed, but the way was free and open for Moses.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL398_351_c" id="target_note_LCL398_351_c"><sup>c</sup></a></p>

<h2>X. <span class="sc">Moses Has Received the Law</span></h2>
<p>The mountain-top is smoking with the divine fire, where the tables of stone inscribed with the ten commandments are handed to Moses. Taking up the law he returns to his people, but their only god is in the shape of a calf, their god is gold.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL398_351_d" id="target_note_LCL398_351_d"><sup>d</sup></a></p>
