Now he died on the 25th day of September in the 716th year of the incarnation of the Lord, on the 6th day of the week, after the 9th hour, in the fields belonging to the afore-named city; and he was buried on the morrow toward the south of the said city at the first milestone, within the monastery of the Twins, in the presence of a great host, not only of the English which had come with him, but also of the brethren of the said monastery, and of the inhabitants of the city, which all sang psalms.
