<p>still is God. He goes through all the functions of mortal nature that He may turn again and bring up to the Father’s bosom all that was dead, and raise up the very bodies also. After the lyres of the old prophets had foretold these things, we, having found them come to pass, with our eyes and hands, meeting Him and hearing his voice and speech, understood at last the words of the valiant men of old and the prophecies that were made plain by the sight of Christ. This is our salvation, hence it is that we live and are quickened. This is the rule we follow, never to address the Father without naming the Son, never to know God the Son without naming the Father, never to call on the Son and the Father together but that the Holy Spirit, who is one with them, have part also; yet that these so exist as three that I must not make three Gods by separating them, but in these three is the being of one God. And He who is the Son is not the Father himself, that, since we know He was begotten of the un-begotten, there may be true Father and true begotten Son, and the Father be not Son to himself. It is very absurd and vain to suppose that He should have been born of himself, or a secondary growth upon himself, suddenly becoming for himself a new substance of birth, and that God should have brought forth himself and made himself his own Son. The divine names make no false or lying pretence. He who is the Father is Father by begetting, and the Son is Son for the reason that He was begotten and the supreme Father is the author of his being; though yet He himself is supreme also, for He is not less than the Father nor unequal with Him.
