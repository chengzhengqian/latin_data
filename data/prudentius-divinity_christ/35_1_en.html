palm? Has it finger-tips that can bend and close it or spread the hand out open? That is the shape of <span class="italic">our</span> hand; it belongs not to the infinite Lord; but a form familiar to human minds has been attributed to Him, to enable them to understand, so that we speak of God having in bodily form created the image of his body. It is in the same sense that that which is spiritual was in its turn created by an incorporeal breath and is called the work of his mouth, through which the finely-textured soul flashed and was conscious of its creation with power yet rudimentary. If our flesh is not the creation of his hand, neither is our soul the creation of his mouth, originating in the expiration of his breath and conducted into a particular place. For all that has a birth-time at which it is brought forth is received in some place; now what can be confined in any place is small, not being extended universally; and what is so small as to be set in a limited place of abode may be unsteady; and what is unsteady partakes of corruption; and the corrupt has become liable to stern punishment. This, believe me, is not God. Else, if the soul has divinity, show me what means it that it falls and is destitute of Christ until a new grace floods it and the Holy Spirit by baptism justifies it, ennobles it, and gives to it as the handmaid of God the honour it lacked. And since it is by desert that this is given or refused, it is irrational to say that the soul is God or a part of God, for at one time by obedience it drinks in the divine and supreme good from its everlasting source, and at another by sin and wickedness</p>
