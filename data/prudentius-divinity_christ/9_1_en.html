children from fear in the midst of the fire.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL387_132_a" id="target_note_LCL387_132_a"><sup>a</sup></a> Ever did the Word of the almighty Father come down to help and save man; ever did He of his own love cause his own being to take on humanity, that the flesh which was to be associated with Him and filled with the everlasting Lord, but was then animal in its nature and leading a debased life, might [change it after its Master’s example and in like body] learn to recognise Him as sharer of its earthly features, to know Him with the warranty of sight as partaker of its nature, and by degrees draw nearer to Christ its kinsman.
