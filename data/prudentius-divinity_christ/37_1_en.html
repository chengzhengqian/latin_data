vessel is made by generation from the parent stock. Souls do not give birth to souls, but by a mysterious law nature produces a work of her own to give the tiny vessels power to breathe, and supply the spark of life to the assembled parts. Yet though it is always a new soul that is infused into the new body, it is nevertheless said to be old after the sins of its fathers, since dirt unwashed is caked hard upon it. Then comes the second birth and the natural filth is washed away; our inner being is born again when we are baptised, so that the soul shines bright and puts off the old Adam. But as in its fellowship with the body it draws occasion to sin from the incitements of the flesh, and itself also at the same time provokes sin in its comrade, avenging punishment lays hold of both wrongdoers together since they sin with one mind, and burns the partners in sin with like torments. From these torments Christ sets us free, for He alone had a mother immaculate and wore a sinless body; Jesus put on a nature liable to punishment, but not a nature liable to the contagion of sin, and so He owed no debt to punishment, being un-defiled, without sin, free from all besmirching fault. What would punishment, which is the stern attendant on sin, do in the body of Christ? What could death do where there was no human wickedness? Naturally their efforts would be vain, they would fall to the ground strengthless and ineffectual where there was nothing to prompt sin. Death is nurtured on sin, and he who has no sin annihilates death because it is exhausted through the very want of what it feeds on. So was death annihilated in the body of Christ our Lord, so was it destroyed, being withered by want of its accustomed food. Reverence thereÂ­fore
