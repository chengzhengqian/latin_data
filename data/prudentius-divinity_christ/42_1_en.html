to death He returns again to the living, and having been buried He rises. Whosoever will say that Christ is God must also say that He is man, lest his majesty lose its strength.</p>
<p>I know that my body rises in Christ; why dost thou bid me abandon my hope? I shall come by the same paths by which He came again from trampling upon death; it is this we believe. And I shall come whole; for I shall be restored not less nor other than now I am; my features, natural force, complexion, will be the same as they are now in life; when the tomb is opened, the grave will send me forth again without the loss of even a tooth or a nail. He who bids me return will not give back aught infirm; for if it is infirmity that returns, then is there no restoration. What calamity has robbed me of, what illness or pain has drained away, what consuming age with wasting decline has cut off, all will return, at my coming again, to a body renewed. For conquered death must keep faith, not to give back, by the grave’s dishonesty, something that is maimed, albeit the bodies it devoured were maimed already; but then infirmity and vehement disease were the strength of death. It will so give back what it swallowed piecemeal in one way or another, that the dead shall not return less than entire, with something lacking to the body’s completeness. Cast fear out of your heart, my members, and believe that you will return with Christ who is God; for He wears you, and calls you back with himself. Laugh at the threats of disease, despise the blows of calamity, scorn the foul tomb. Whither Christ at his rising calls you, go.</p>
