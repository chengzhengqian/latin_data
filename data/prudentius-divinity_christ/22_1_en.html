Learn from thy ills, poor creature, by whose vengeance it is that vain superstition and carnal keeping of the law are punished, whose avenging power it is that tramples upon thee. Do not Solomon’s stones, that were built up by hand, lie in ruins, his metal-work destroyed? That famous temple lies in ruins. And why? Because it was a craftsman’s perishable hand that framed that perishable work of stone.

It is one whose mass does not rest high up on pillars, supported with delicate skill on curving arches. It is made from the Word of the Lord; not his loud-sounding voice, but his Word, which ever lived. The Word was made flesh.
