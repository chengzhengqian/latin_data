This is the temple that is everlasting and without end; this is the temple thou hast attacked, seeking to take it with scourge and cross and gall. It was cast down in destruction by tormenting pains. Be it so, for from the mother’s womb it had what could be destroyed: but that which, of the mother’s part, was undone in brief death, the third day restores to life by the majesty of the Father. Thou hast seen my temple, by whose protection I am saved, rise on high with companies of angels. Everlasting gates support its high top, glorious stairs rise through towers inviolate, and at the summit of the steps there shines a white pathway. But thy whole burnt offerings are entombed under heaps of ruins. What thou dost merit, Titus has taught thee, and Pompey’s armies<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL387_160_aa" id="target_note_LCL387_160_aa"><sup>a</sup></a> have taught thee with their rapine. Rooted out by them, thy members are carried over every region of land and sea. From place to place the homeless Jew wanders in ever-shifting exile, since the time when he was torn from the abode of his fathers and has been suffering the penalty for murder, and having stained his hands with the blood of Christ whom he denied, paying the price of sin. See what has become of the virtue of his forefathers of olden times! The noble race that was heir to the faithful men of old has scattered away from them and is enslaved, no longer noble; it is in captivity under the younger faith. Such is the strength the new belief possesses; a race that formerly was unfaithful now confesses Christ and triumphs, but that which denied Christ is conquered and subdued and has fallen into the hands of masters who keep the faith.</p>
