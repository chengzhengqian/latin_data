<p class="noindent">There is a third one similar to these [the verbs “I hate” and “I remember”], as some believe (for people were not lacking who said that this verb was of the present tense): “I have learned = know,” “you have learned = know,” “he / she / it has learned = knows”; and this is similar with respect to present and perfect, like “I remember.” . . . Others conjugate both tenses similarly, as if “to know” &lt;was&gt; like “to remember.” Among the ancients the present of this verb is found in the plural, as they say <span class="italic">nomus </span>[“we know”: unusual contracted form in first person plural with present meaning] for this that is <span class="italic">novimus</span> [“we have learned = know”], as Ennius in <span class="italic">Lytra</span>:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">it is right for us to be quiet; we both know Ulixes</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
