<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Both </span>Medea<span class="italic"> (F 89, 94, 97, 98, 99, 100) and </span>Medea exul<span class="italic"> (F 93, 95, 96) have been transmitted as titles for dramas by Ennius. Whether there was one tragedy by Ennius on Medea (with two titles denoting the same piece) or whether there were two, a </span>Medea exul <span class="italic">following Euripides’ </span>Medea<span class="italic"> and another </span>Medea<span class="italic"> (set in Athens) after another Greek tragedy (perhaps Euripides’ </span>Aegeus:<span class="italic"> F 1–13 </span>TrGF<span class="italic">), is therefore debated. It is also uncertain whether the title </span>Medea<span class="italic"> </span>exul<span class="italic"> is to be attributed to Ennius or to later grammarians. All fragments except F 94 can be fitted into a version of the plot of Euripides’ </span>Medea.<span class="italic"> Comparisons between the tragedies by Ennius and Euripides can be found in, e.g., Skutsch 1905, 2596; Röser 1939, 4–31; Fleckenstein 1953, 50–58; Dondoni 1958, 85–95; Kutáková 1969; Lennartz 2001.</span></p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Arcellaschi (1976; 1990, 38–44) argues that the play was first performed at the </span>Ludi Ceriales<span class="italic"> in about 204 BC. Lefèvre (2001, 48–49) suggests 194 BC as the date for the</span></p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">first performance (see also Vogt-Spira 2000). Fleckenstein (1953, 66–69) tentatively proposed about 200 BC.</span></p>
