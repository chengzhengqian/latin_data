<p class="noindent">The same thing happens to the insane, so that, when they are beginning to go mad, they feel and say that something that does not exist appears to them, and also when they are recovering, they feel it and say these words of Alcmeo:</p>

<p class="noindent">You said that the impressions of people sleeping and drunk and insane are weaker than those of people awake, sober and sane. In what way? Because, when he had awakened, Ennius did not say that he had seen Homer, but that he had seemed to [cf. T 27], but Alcmeo says: “but my heart does not agree at all”; similarly with regard to people drunk. . . . [89] What shall I say about the insane: . . . ; well, that Alcmeo of yours himself, who denies that “his heart agrees with the eyes,” does he not say in the same context, with madness aroused,</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">whence does this flame arise?</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">and then this:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">they come on, they come on, they are here, they are aiming for me</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p><span class="line">bring me help, drive away this plague from me,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
