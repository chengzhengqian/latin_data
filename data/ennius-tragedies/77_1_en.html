<p class="noindent">In this genre [of metaphor] dissimilarity is the first thing to be avoided:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">heaven’s immense vaults</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">Even though Ennius brought the globe to the stage, as is reported, still there can be no similarity to a vault in a globe.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL537_155_1" id="target_note_LCL537_155_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p class="noindent">But most people are so completely led astray when they rush into desire for power, honor, and glory that forgetfulness of justice catches them. For what is found in Ennius:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL537_155_1-1" id="target_note_LCL537_155_1-1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">there is no sacred fellowship or loyalty in kingship</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">has a rather wide application. For in any kind of thing in which not many can excel, such competition frequently arises that it is very difficult to preserve “a sacred fellowship.”</p>

Varro, on the other hand, does not seem to have problems with this expression. Other metaphors in Ennius (<span class="italic">Trag.</span> F 173; <span class="italic">Inc.</span> F 5) suggest that he could describe the sky as vaulted above the earth. Whether Cicero means that Ennius introduced the word <span class="italic">sphaera</span> to the general public or actually put a globe on stage as a prop is debated. At any rate the famous globe of Archimedes was brought to Rome in Ennius’ lifetime (cf. Cic. <span class="italic">Rep. </span>1.21; Jaeger 2011, 50–62).</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL537_155_1').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL537_155_1-1"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL537_155_1-1" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">1</sup>The fragment is sometimes associated with the tragedy <span class="italic">Thyestes</span>, since this is a play about power, but such a general statement could also occur in other tragedies.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL537_155_1-1').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
