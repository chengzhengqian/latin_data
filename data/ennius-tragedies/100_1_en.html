<p class="noindent">“should he hasten a beautiful death through wounds”: either “to go toward” is missing, or “toward” is missing, so that it would be “should hasten toward death”: or certainly &lt;he uses&gt; “he should hasten death” in an old-fashioned way, as Plautus [F 165 L.] “make haste over a meal.” Ennius:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL537_201_1" id="target_note_LCL537_201_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">saevae</span> [“ferocious”]: since Juno is derived from <span class="italic">iuvare</span> [“to help”], many ask why he [Virgil] has called her <span class="italic">saeva</span> [“ferocious”], and they believe that it is an occasional epithet, as if she were “ferocious” as regards the Trojans, not knowing that the ancients used <span class="italic">saeva</span> for <span class="italic">magna</span> [“large, great”]. Thus Ennius:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">she was clothed in a large garment</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>

<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">occumbere morti</span> [“to meet death”]: A form of a novel expression and far removed &lt;from ordinary usage&gt;. Ennius:</p>
<blockquote><p>that our sons defend you, meet death for the sake of your life</p></blockquote>
