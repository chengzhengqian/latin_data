<p class="noindent">Now I [Quintus Cicero, the author’s brother] will declare that I do not recognize &lt;the value of&gt; fortune-tellers nor those who prophesy for the sake of gain, not even places where the dead are conjured up, whom Appius [Appius Claudius], your friend, was accustomed to employ; hence I regard as nothing a Marsian<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL537_123_1-1" id="target_note_LCL537_123_1-1"><sup>1</sup></a> augur, as nothing diviners in villages, as nothing astrologers from the circus, as nothing soothsayers, worshippers of Isis, as nothing interpreters of dreams; for they are not diviners by either knowledge or skill, but superstitious seers and shameless prophets<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL537_123_2" id="target_note_LCL537_123_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
