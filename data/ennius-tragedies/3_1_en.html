<p class="noindent">Then suddenly very severe tempests arose, judges, so that Dolabella not only was unable to set off, as he wished, but could hardly remain in town</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">such great floods were being cast ashore</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">Here that ship of that thief, laden with religious statues, thrust out and cast ashore by the flood, is broken asunder; on the shore those statues of Apollo are found; on Dolabella’s orders they are put back. The tempest subsides; Dolabella sets off from Delos.</p>

<p class="noindent">It is therefore fitting that <span class="italic">subices</span> [“underlying parts”: <span class="italic">hapax legomenon</span>] too, which is formed in the same way as <span class="italic">obices</span> [“opposing parts”], should be pronounced with a short letter <span class="italic">u.</span> [14] In the tragedy that is entitled <span class="italic">Achilles</span> Ennius puts <span class="italic">subices</span> [“underlying parts”] for high air, which is placed just under the sky, in the following lines:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">I, by the liquid underlayers of the gods high up [i.e., clouds],</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">from where the rain comes with fierce sound and uproar, &lt;swear / pray?&gt;</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">still you would hear most people read this with a long letter <span class="italic">u.</span></p>
