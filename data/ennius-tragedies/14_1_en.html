In the view of ancient scholars, Ennius’ model was a tragedy by Euripides (F 25; T 24), but none of the known tragedies featuring Andromache displays equivalents of the content of all Ennian fragments preserved for this tragedy.</span></p>
<p><span class="italic">Skutsch (1967, 125–26) believed that Neptune spoke the prologue (cf. Plaut. </span>Amph.<span class="italic"> 41–45); since Plautus’ </span>Amphitruo<span class="italic"> alluded to Ennius’ tragedy, he concluded that Ennius’ play was first performed in ca. 195–191 BC. Auhagen (2000a) connected the play with the war fought by Titus Flamininus in Epirus in ca. 200 BC.</span></p>

<p class="noindent">But everything [concerning burial, body, and soul] is full of misconceptions. Achilles drags Hector fastened to his chariot: he believes, I think, that he [Hector] is being mangled and feels it. Thus he wreaks his vengeance, as it seems to him at least, but she [Andromache] grieves over it as if over a most terrible thing:</p>
