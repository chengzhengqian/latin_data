<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Telamon, king of Salamis, had two sons, Teucer and Ajax. Teucer, his illegitimate son by Hesione, was a strong warrior in the Trojan War, often fighting together with his half-brother Ajax. After the Trojan War and the assignment of Achilles’ arms to Ulixes rather than to Ajax, the latter killed himself while Teucer was away in Mysia. Upon his return Teucer challenged Agamemnon’s decision not to give Ajax a proper burial. When Teucer eventually came back to Salamis, his father refused to receive him, since he regarded him as responsible for the death of his half-brother or expected him to have avenged it.</span></p>
