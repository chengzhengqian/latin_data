<p class="noindent">There is therefore in human minds foreboding infused from outside and shut in by divine agency. If it has flared up rather sharply, it is called madness, when the mind, drawn away from the body, is excited by a divine impulse:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL537_157_1a" id="target_note_LCL537_157_1a"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

At <span class="italic">Orat.</span> 155 (see Enn. <span class="italic">Trag. </span>F 152) he gives a series of examples from three tragic poets (including a line from this fragment), the second and third ones being Pacuvius and Accius; therefore, in view of Cicero’s assessment of Livius Andronicus and Naevius (cf.

The time seems to be after the Judgment of Paris and before the outbreak of the Trojan War. Therefore, the attribution to Ennius’ <span class="italic">Alexander,</span> frequently suggested, seems likely.
