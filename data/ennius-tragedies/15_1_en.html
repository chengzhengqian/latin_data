Serv. ad Verg. <span class="italic">Aen.</span> 2.241], 2.499–505). The first two lines are attributed to a woman who laments Hector and declines the name “Hector” according to Latin conventions, as Ennius did in contrast to Accius (cf. <span class="italic">Trag. </span>F 179). The attribution to Ennius’ <span class="italic">Andromacha</span> and to the lamenting speech of the title character therefore is almost certain. In addition, the introduction <span class="italic">vidi </span>is picked up later. Euripides’ Andromache voices similar laments (Eur. <span class="italic">Andr.</span> 8–10, 107–8, 394–405, 523–25).</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL537_31_1').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
