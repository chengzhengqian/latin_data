<p class="noindent">And this Ennius &lt;says&gt;, who a few lines earlier voices the opinion that there are gods, “but” believes that “they do not care what the human race does.” But I, who believe that they care and also admonish and predict many things, approve of divination when unreliability, vanity, and wickedness have been excluded.</p>

<p class="noindent">And indeed he adds a reason why he thinks so; but there is no need to quote what follows; this much is sufficient to have it understood, that they embrace as certain what is doubtful and controversial.</p>
