Lamentation and mourning another one, varying in pitch, sonorous, interrupted, with a tearful voice [<span class="italic">Trag.</span> 231–32 R.<sup>2–3</sup>]: . . . and this [<span class="italic">Trag. </span>F 23.10]: . . . and what follows [<span class="italic">Trag. </span>F 23.15–16]: . . . [218] Fear yet another one, subdued, hesitating and downcast:</p>

<span class="line">then fear banishes all my wits from my senses, with me paralyzed.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Someone [my mother? my mind?] threatens my life with terrible torture and death;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">in view of this, nobody is of so firm a spirit and such confidence</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">that his blood does not leave him in his anxiety and he does not become pale with fear.</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
