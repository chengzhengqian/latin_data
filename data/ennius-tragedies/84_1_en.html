<p class="noindent">in comparison with these two diseases, to say nothing of others, distress and desire, which &lt;diseases&gt; concerning the body, then, can be more severe?</p>

<p class="noindent">What then? Could the idea and thought of such a life [a happy life according to the Epicureans] relieve Thyestes or Aeetes, about whom I spoke a little earlier [Cic. <span class="italic">Tusc. </span>3.26], or Telamon, expelled from his country, an exile, and in want? . . . [44] . . . Therefore one has to ask in what way we can free him from distress, who speaks thus:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL537_169_1-1" id="target_note_LCL537_169_1-1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line indent2">by Pollux, good fortune is lacking now for me more than noble descent.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">For I used to have a kingdom, so that you may know from what standing,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">from what power, from what riches fortune may lapse and fall down.</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>

The continuation of the passage with a quotation from Ennius’ <span class="italic">Andromacha</span> proves them to be Ennian. The speaker is clearly another <span class="italic">exemplum</span>, i.e., someone other than the mythical heroes mentioned. Therefore, an attribution to Ennius’ <span class="italic">Telamo</span> or <span class="italic">Thyestes,</span> which has been suggested, is unlikely (see also Jocelyn 1967, 394–95). Cf.
