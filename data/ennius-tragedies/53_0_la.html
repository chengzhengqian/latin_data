<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Melanippa, the daughter of Aeolus, was raped by Neptune and produced two sons (Aeolus and Boeotus). When her father learned this, he blinded her and put her into prison. The infants were cast out, but raised first by a cow and then by herdsmen. When Theano, the wife of Metapontus, king of Icaria, was pressed for offspring, she sent to herdsmen, who brought her the two boys. Later, Theano bore two sons of her own and wanted the other ones to be removed. In a fight instigated by Theano, however, Neptune’s sons killed the others; thereupon, Theano killed herself. Then Neptune appeared to the other pair and informed them about their parentage. This prompted them to free their mother and bring her to Metapontus, who then married her and adopted her sons. Neptune gave Melanippa back her sight (see, e.g., hypothesis to Euripides’ </span>Μελανίππη ἡ Σοφή<span class="italic"> </span>[TrGF<span class="italic"> V.1, pp. 525–26</span>]<span class="italic">; Dion.
