<p class="noindent">Thyestes curses with really splendid verses in Ennius,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL537_137_1" id="target_note_LCL537_137_1"><sup>1</sup></a> first that Atreus perish in a shipwreck. This is indeed harsh; for such a death is not without serious feeling. This is nonsense:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">he himself fixed to the top of rough rocks, disemboweled,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">hanging by his side, sprinkling the rocks with gore, filth, and black blood</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">The rocks themselves will not be freer of any feeling than the man “hanging by his side,” for whom he [Thyestes] thinks that he intends torment. How hard would they be if he [Atreus] had sensation! But &lt;they are&gt; nothing without sensation. This, however, is complete nonsense:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">and he shall not have a tomb where he can withdraw, a haven for the body,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">where, once human life has been dismissed, the body can rest from troubles</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>

Some scholars have tried to extract further Ennian fragments from the Ciceronian context, but how closely Cicero’s wording echoes Ennius’ drama is uncertain.
