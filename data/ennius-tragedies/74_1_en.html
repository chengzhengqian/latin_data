<p class="noindent">“Phrygian steel”: In Ennius this &lt;scene of the&gt; play is brought on stage at the time when Achilles, on account of Briseis, does not wish to fight together with the Greeks; at the time too when Hector sets their fleet on fire. In this battle Ulixes is brought on stage wounded and comes to Achilles in the course of his flight. When he is asked by Aiax why he has fled, he, in order to hide the unavenged dishonor, &lt;says&gt;: “For who &lt;was&gt; wounded by Phrygian steel?”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL537_149_1" id="target_note_LCL537_149_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p class="noindent">But those things seem to be shared among all humans that are of the kind that, described by Ennius for one thing, can be transferred to a great many:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">The man who, in a friendly manner, shows the way to someone wandering about</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">has an effect as if he kindles a light from his own light:</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">it shines for himself no less, when he has kindled it for the other.</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>

The names in the scholiast’s note have sometimes been emended, but the situation is not impossible. On the possible meaning of the quotation in Cicero, the Homeric basis, and the dramatic version(s), see Jocelyn 1972, 55–59; on the text and the potential context, see Ramsey 2014.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL537_149_1').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
