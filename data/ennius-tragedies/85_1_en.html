<p class="noindent">What is this love of friendship then? Why does no one love either an ugly young man or a handsome old man? To me this custom seems to have originated in the gymnastic schools of the Greeks, in which this kind of lovemaking is free and allowed. Well therefore &lt;does&gt; Ennius &lt;say&gt;:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">the beginning of disgrace is to bare bodies among citizens</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">Even though this &lt;kind of lovemaking&gt; may be decent, which I see can happen, yet it is accompanied by uneasiness and anxiety, and all the more because it curbs and restrains itself [i.e., there are no rules from outside].</p>

<p class="noindent">But Jupiter himself, i.e. “the helping father,” whom we call “Jove” in the oblique cases from “to help” [<span class="italic">iuvare</span>], is called by the poets [Inc. <span class="italic">Ann</span>. F 124] “father of gods and men,” but by our ancestors the best and the greatest, . . .—[65] him, then, Ennius, as I have said above [Cic. <span class="italic">Nat. D.</span> 2.4], calls, speaking thus [<span class="italic">Trag. </span>F 134] “look at this thing shining on high, whom all call Jupiter,” more explicitly than the same &lt;poet&gt; elsewhere</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">to whom I will vow as an offering whatever is in me, this [or: to this?] that shines whatever it is<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL537_171_1" id="target_note_LCL537_171_1"><sup>1</sup></a></span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">Him our augurs also &lt;mean&gt; when they say “when Jupiter lights and thunders”: for they say “when the sky lights and thunders.”</p>
