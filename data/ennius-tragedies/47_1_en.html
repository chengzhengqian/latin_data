<p class="noindent">Likewise faulty is exposition that is traced back too long, in this way: . . . Here, what was said last would have been sufficient to set forth, so that we do not imitate Ennius and other poets, for whom it is permissible to speak in this way:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">If only the firwood timber had not fallen</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">to the ground in the Pelian grove, hewn by axes,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">and if only the ship had not taken from there the first steps to a beginning</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">—the ship that is now known by the name of</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Argo, since selected Argive men traveling in her</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">sought the Golden Fleece of the ram</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">from the Colchians, at the behest of king Pelias, by trickery.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">For never would my mistress, Medea, going astray, set her foot outside the house,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">sick in her mind, wounded by savage love.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL537_95_1" id="target_note_LCL537_95_1"><sup>1</sup></a></span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">For here it would be sufficient to say, if the poets were concerned only with what was sufficient: “If only my mistress, Medea, going astray, would not set her foot outside the house, sick in her mind, wounded by savage love.”</p>
