<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Only fragments explicitly assigned to Ennius by an ancient source or for which Ennian authorship can be securely inferred are included here. These fragments are numbered as in </span>TrRF.</p>
<p><span class="italic">A number of additional fragments preserved without indication of authorship have sometimes been attributed to Ennius’ tragedies on the basis of style or content, the names of key figures, or assumptions concerning the plots. Since there is no clear evidence for the attribution in the transmission, these fragments appear among the tragic </span>Incerta<span class="italic"> in </span>FRL<span class="italic">. These include: </span>Trag.<span class="italic"> </span>inc. inc.<span class="italic"> 5–16, 21, 22, 23–24, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30–31, 43, 85–87, 132, 133–37, </span></p>
<span class="label"><span class="ac"><span class="italic">ACHILLES </span>(<span class="italic">ARISTARCHI</span>) (t 1; F 1–8)</span></span>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">The tragedy with the transmitted titles </span>Achilles<span class="italic"> and </span>Achilles Aristarchi<span class="italic"> apparently revolves around the embassy sent to the hero, when he had withdrawn in anger from the fighting before Troy, an incident narrated in Homer’s </span>Iliad <span class="italic">9.</span></p>
<p><span class="italic">The surviving fragments concern fighting (F 3), possibly including a philosophical or divine assessment (F 7), and perhaps point to a conversation among the envoys sent by Agamemnon (unsuccessfully) to persuade Achilles (F 5).</span></p>
