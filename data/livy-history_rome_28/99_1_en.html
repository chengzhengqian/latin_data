on hearing his name flocked together from all sides, <span class="marginNote right"><span class="sc">b.c.</span> 205</span>This fact, when it was made known to the senators through a letter of Spurius Lucretius,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL381_199_1" id="target_note_LCL381_199_1"><sup>1</sup></a> kindled great anxiety among them, for fear they had rejoiced in vain two years before over the destruction of Hasdrubal and his army, if another equally serious war with only a change of commander should break out from that quarter. So they ordered Marcus Livius, the proconsul, to bring his army of slave-volunteers from Etruria to Ariminum. Also they assigned to Gnaeus Servilius, the praetor, if he thought it to the advantage of the state, the duty of appointing at his discretion a commander for the two city legions and ordering them to be brought up from the city. Marcus Valerius Laevinus brought these legions to Arretium.</p>
<p>Just at that time about eighty Carthaginian transports were captured off Sardinia by Gnaeus Octavius, who was in command of that province. Coelius states that they were laden with grain sent to Hannibal and with provisions, Valerius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL381_199_2" id="target_note_LCL381_199_2"><sup>2</sup></a> that they were captured while carrying Etruscan booty and captive Ligurians and Montani to Carthage. In the land of the Bruttians virtually nothing notable was done that year. An epidemic, equally disastrous to both, had attacked Romans and Carthaginians, with this difference that in addition to disease hunger also weakened the Carthaginian army. Hannibal spent the summer near the temple of Juno Lacinia,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL381_199_3" id="target_note_LCL381_199_3"><sup>3</sup></a> and there he erected an altar and dedicated it together with a great record of his achievements in a Punic and Greek inscription.</p>
