order. The tribunes made this decree: “If the <span class="marginNote right"><span class="sc">b.c.</span> 205</span>consul permits the senate to assign the provinces, we decide that he must stand by the vote of the senate, and we will not allow a bill touching that matter to be brought before the people. If he does not permit, we will come to the defence of a man who refuses to express an opinion on that matter.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL381_191_1" id="target_note_LCL381_191_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>The consul begged for one day to confer with his colleague; on the next day he gave the senate his permission. The provinces were assigned by decree as follows: to one of the consuls Sicily and the thirty war-ships<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL381_191_2a" id="target_note_LCL381_191_2a"><sup>2</sup></a> which Gaius Servilius had commanded in the previous year;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL381_191_3" id="target_note_LCL381_191_3"><sup>3</sup></a> and permission to cross over to Africa was given, if he should consider that to be to the advantage of the state; to the other consul the land of the Bruttians and the war with Hannibal, together with the army which he preferred.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL381_191_4" id="target_note_LCL381_191_4"><sup>4</sup></a> Lucius Veturius and Quintus Caecilius were to decide between them by lot or by arrangement which of them was to wage war in the Bruttian land with the two legions which the consul should leave there, and whichever should have that province assigned to him was to have his command continued for one year. And for the rest who were to command armies and provinces—apart from consuls and praetors—their commands were continued. It fell to Quintus Caecilius by lot to wage war together with the consul in the Bruttian land against Hannibal.</p>
