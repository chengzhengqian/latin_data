hastened from Demetrias to Scotussa, whence he set <span class="marginNote right"><span class="sc">b.c.</span> 207</span>out in the third watch, dislodged the garrison and routed the Aetolians occupying the pass of Thermopylae. Then after driving the enemy in alarm into Heraclēa, he himself in a single day covered a distance of more than sixty miles to Elatīa<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL381_27_1" id="target_note_LCL381_27_1"><sup>1</sup></a> in Phocis. On about the same day the captured city of Opus was being sacked by King Attalus. Its booty had been given up to the king by Sulpicius because Oreum<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL381_27_2" id="target_note_LCL381_27_2"><sup>2</sup></a> had been sacked by Roman soldiers a few days before, while the king’s troops had no share in it. When the Roman fleet had returned to Oreum, Attalus, unaware of the coming of Philip, was spending his time in exacting money from leading citizens. And so unexpected was the attack that if some of the Cretans, who happened to have gone a long distance from the city to forage, had not caught sight of the enemy’s column in the distance, the king could have been overpowered. Attalus’ men, being unarmed and in disorder, rushed pell-mell to the sea and their ships; and as they were struggling to cast off, Philip came upon them and from the shore caused further confusion among the sailors. Then he returned to Opus, accusing gods and men because he had lost so great an opportunity, snatched away almost before his eyes. The men of Opus also were no less angrily upbraided because, although they could have dragged out the siege until his coming, at the first sight of the enemy they had almost willingly surrendered.</p>
