These horsemen at the very beginning of the battle put to flight the most active and those who had been the first to ride up close to the earthwork and even among the men at work. With the rest, who had advanced under their standards and in marching order, the battle was more protracted and for a long time indecisive. But when light cohorts at first drawn off from the outposts, and then soldiers withdrawn from work on the fortifications and ordered to take up arms, came up in increasing number, and fresh to assist the weary, while by this time a long column of men under arms was dashing out from camp into battle, Carthaginians and Numidians thereupon faced about in unmistakable retreat. And at first they were retiring by troops, while their ranks were not at all broken on account of fear or haste. Then when the Roman fell more fiercely upon their rear and the attack could not be withstood, no longer mindful of their ranks, they scattered in flight hither and thither, each taking the shortest way.

In Polybius it is Scipio who does the marching (XI. xx. 9). No long march of the Carthaginians
to meet him is mentioned, and near Baecula there is no open plain suited to this battle. Hence this was near modern Seville and not a “second battle of Baecula,” as Mommsen, Ihne and others have it.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL381_57_1a').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
