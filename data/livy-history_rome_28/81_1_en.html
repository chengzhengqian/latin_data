do not understand how Africa is already definitely <span class="marginNote right"><span class="sc">b.c.</span> 205</span>assigned to that brave and energetic man, the consul, since neither has the senate voted nor the people commanded<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL381_163_1" id="target_note_LCL381_163_1"><sup>1</sup></a> that it be a province for this year. In the second place, if it is his, I think that the consul who mocks the senate by pretending to bring before the house business upon which action has been taken is at fault, not a senator who in his proper order states his opinion on the matter under consideration. And I am quite certain that in opposing such haste to cross over into Africa I must expose myself to two charges, first, of an inborn habit of delay, which young men are free to call fear and lack of spirit, provided there are as yet no regrets that other men’s policies have always appeared at first sight more attractive, mine the better in practice. Secondly, they will accuse me of carping criticism and envy towards the daily increasing fame of a very brave consul. From this suspicion if neither my past life and my character nor my dictatorship and five consulships can defend me, together with so much glory won in the field and at home that I tend to be sated rather than to crave it, may my years at least bring exemption. For what rivalry can I have with a man who is not even my son’s contemporary? In my dictatorship, although I was still at the height of my powers and in the stream of great events, no one heard me refuse either in the senate or before the people to have the command of my master of the horse, who was inveighing against me, made equal to mine, a thing which never had been heard of before.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL381_163_2" id="target_note_LCL381_163_2"><sup>2</sup></a>
