Hasdrubal in Gaul on a day on which Hannibal had <span class="marginNote right"><span class="sc">b.c.</span> 207</span>believed the consul had his camp established facing his own in Apulia. Thus a single consul in defence of both regions of Italy had confronted two armies and two generals, here with his strategy and there in person. Nero’s name had been enough, they said, to keep Hannibal within his camp. As for Hasdrubal, what else than Nero’s arrival had overwhelmed and destroyed him? Thus let the other consul drive standing erect in a chariot drawn, if he wished, by many horses. The truly triumphant progress through the city was on a single horse; and Nero, even if he went on foot, would be memorable, be it for the glory won in that war, or for his contempt of it in that triumph. Such was the talk of the spectators who accompanied Nero all the way to the Capitol. As for money, the consuls carried into the Treasury three million sesterces and eighty thousand asses. To his soldiers Marcus Livius apportioned fifty-six asses apiece. Gaius Claudius promised the same amount to his absent soldiers when he should return to the army. It has been remarked that in the jesting of the soldiers on that day more of their songs were levelled at Gaius Claudius than at their own consul; that the knights highly extolled Lucius Veturius and Quintus Caecilius, the lieutenant-generals, and urged the commons to elect them consuls for the following year; also that to the knights’ preliminary choice the consuls on the next day added, their authority by an address to the people, stating what brave and faithful service they had had in particular from their two lieutenants.</p>
