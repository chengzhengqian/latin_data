cavalry with the light-armed against the Punic <span class="marginNote right"><span class="sc">b.c.</span> 206</span>outposts.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL381_61_1" id="target_note_LCL381_61_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Immediately afterwards he himself with the heavy column of the legions went forward, and contrary to the fixed idea of his own men and of the enemy, he formed strong wings of his Roman soldiers, while the allies were taken into the centre. When Hasdrubal, who was aroused by the shouts of the horsemen, sprang out of his tent and saw the uproar outside his earthwork and the excitement among his men, and in the distance the gleaming standards of the legions and the plain filled with the enemy, he forthwith sent out all his cavalry against the horsemen. As for himself, he marched out of the camp with the infantry column, and in drawing up his line made no change from the customary order. The cavalry engagement had long been uncertain, and by itself it could not be decisive because when repulsed—and this repeatedly happened almost by turns—they could safely retire into the infantry line. But when the lines of battle were not more than half a mile apart, Scipio sounding the recall and opening his ranks admitted all the cavalry and the light-armed into the centre; and dividing them into two sections he posted them as a reserve behind the wings. Then, when it was now time to begin the battle, he ordered the Spaniards—they formed the centre of the line—to advance at a slow pace. From the right wing—for he was himself in command there—he sent a message to Silanus and Marcius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL381_61_2" id="target_note_LCL381_61_2"><sup>2</sup></a> that they should prolong their wing towards the left, just as they had seen him pressing to the right, and with the light infantry and cavalry should engage the enemy
