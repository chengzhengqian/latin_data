<p>XXXVII. Mago, upon his return to Gades finding <span class="marginNote right"><span class="sc">b.c.</span> 206</span>himself shut out of the city, put in with his fleet to Cimbii,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL381_149_1" id="target_note_LCL381_149_1"><sup>1</sup></a> a place not far from Gades.
