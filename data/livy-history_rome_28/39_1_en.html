been Scipio’s constant reflection, his open complaint, <span class="marginNote right"><span class="sc">b.c.</span> 206</span>he added, that he was not waging war in Africa, as Hannibal was in Italy. Scipio, after making a treaty with Syphax, set sail from Africa, and tossed in open sea by unsteady winds, mostly violent, he reached the harbour of New Carthage on the fourth day.</p>
<p>XIX. Although the Spanish provinces were having a respite from a Carthaginian war, still it was evident that on account of a guilty conscience certain states were quiet out of fear rather than because of loyalty. Most conspicuous both for size and guilt among these were Iliturgi<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL381_79_1a" id="target_note_LCL381_79_1a"><sup>1</sup></a> and Castulo.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL381_79_2" id="target_note_LCL381_79_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Although in favourable times its citizens had been allies, Castulo, after the Scipios had been slain with their armies, had revolted to the Carthaginians. The men of Iliturgi, by betraying and slaying those who from that disaster had fled to them for refuge, had added a crime also to their revolt. On Scipio’s first coming, when the Spanish provinces were wavering, vengeance upon those states would have been deserved but not politic. Now, however, since in a time of peace the moment for exacting the penalty seemed to have arrived, he summoned Lucius Marcius from Tarraco and sent him with a third of his forces to lay siege to Castulo.

That was about 175 miles in a straight line from New Carthage, and in a quite unthinkable direction for retreating Romans. Amtorgis, where the two brothers separated, cannot be identified (XXV. xxxii. 5, 9). Iliturgi has taken the place here of a town less well known, perhaps that of Pliny’s Ilorci (the <span class="italic">rogus Scipionis</span>, i.e. of Gnaeus, <span class="italic">N.H.</span> III. 9; Ilurgia in App. <span class="italic">Hisp.</span> 32, Ilourgeia in Polybius, XI. xxiv. <span class="italic">sub. fin.</span>, a fragment which seems to belong here, Dindorf).
