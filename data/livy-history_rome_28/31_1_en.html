In the centre was a curve where the Spanish units were more slowly advancing.</p>
<p>By this time the wings were already engaged, while the main strength of the enemy’s line, the veteran Carthaginians and Africans, had not yet come within range, and did not dare to dash towards the wings to help the combatants, for fear of exposing the centre to the enemy directly advancing. The wings were being hard pressed by a double attack; cavalry and light-armed and skirmishers with enclosing wings were charging into their flanks, while the cohorts were pressing them in front, endeavouring to cut off the wings from the rest of the battle-line.</p>
<p>XV. And not only was the battle in general far from being evenly matched, but especially because the horde of Baliares and Spanish recruits had been made to face Roman and Latin soldiers. Besides, as the day now wore on their strength also began to fail Hasdrubal’s soldiers, who had been surprised by an early morning onslaught and compelled to go out into line in haste before they

Everything depends upon the interpretation
of τρεῖς σπείρας and a following parenthesis, “this infantry unit is called a cohort (κοόρτις) by the Romans” (XI. xxiii. 1). It remains debatable whether “this unit” refers to the single σπείρα, which must then be a maniple, or to the three combined to make a cohort. For <span class="italic">manipulus</span> the regular word was σημεία. Later on σπείρα, came to be cohort almost invariably. But in Polybius’ time one could use either σημείρα, or σπείρα, in the same meaning, as VI. xxiv. 5; so even in the same sentence, as <span class="italic">l.c.</span> § 8; III. cxiii. 3; XV. ix. 7.
