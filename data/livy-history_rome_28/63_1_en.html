Another ship, exposing its beam to the enemy, would suddenly be swung and turned bow foremost. While between the triremes an indecisive battle controlled by chance was in progress, the Roman quinquereme, whether because she was steadier by reason of her weight or more easily steered as her more numerous banks of oars<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL381_127_1a" id="target_note_LCL381_127_1a"><sup>1</sup></a> cleft the whirling waters, sank two triremes and shooting past another swept away the oars on one side.
