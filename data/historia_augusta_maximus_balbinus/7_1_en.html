Gauls, and at times had commanded an army<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL140_461_1" id="target_note_LCL140_461_1"><sup>1</sup></a>; he was less capable in military affairs, however, than in civil. Nevertheless, by his good, righteous, and modest life, he won himself great love. He came of a very ancient family—or so he himself asserted, tracing his descent from Cornelius Balbus Theo-phanes,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL140_461_2a" id="target_note_LCL140_461_2a"><sup>2</sup></a> who became a citizen through the aid of Gnaeus Pompey; this Balbus was very noble in his own country and likewise a writer of history.</p>
<p>He was equally tall of stature, remarkable for the excellence of his body and excessive in his pleasures. In this he was encouraged by his abounding wealth; for he was rich by inheritance on the one hand, and had himself accumulated a great deal through legacies on the other.
