Maximinus.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL140_467_1" id="target_note_LCL140_467_1"><sup>1</sup></a> So powerful among the Romans is the memory of noble deeds.</p>

<p>X. And now, after Maximum had set out to the war, the senate sent men of the rank of consul, praetor, quaestor, aedile, and tribune throughout the districts in order that each and every town should prepare provisions, arms, defences, and walls so that Maximinus should be harassed at each city.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL140_467_2" id="target_note_LCL140_467_2"><sup>2</sup></a> It was further ordered that all supplies should be gathered into the cities from the fields, in order that the public enemy might find nothing. Couriers<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL140_467_3" id="target_note_LCL140_467_3"><sup>3</sup></a> were sent out to all the provinces, moreover, with written orders that whosoever aided Maximinus should be placed in the number of public enemies.</p>
<p>At Rome, meanwhile, rioting between the populace and soldiers broke out a second time.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL140_467_4" id="target_note_LCL140_467_4"><sup>4</sup></a> And after Balbinus had issued a thousand edicts to which no one listened, the veterans, together with the guard itself, betook themselves to the Praetorian Camp, where the populace besieged them. Nor would amity have ever been restored had not the populace cut the water-pipes.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL140_467_5a" id="target_note_LCL140_467_5a"><sup>5</sup></a> In the city, however, before it was announced that the soldiers were coming peacefully, tiles were cast down from the roofs and all the pots in the houses were thrown out, so that thereby the greater part of the city was ruined and the possessions of many lost. For robbers mingled with the soldiers and plundered things that they knew where to find.</p>
