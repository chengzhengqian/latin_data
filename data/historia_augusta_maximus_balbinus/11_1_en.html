While this was taking place at Rome, Maximum (or Pupienus) was at Ravenna<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL140_469_1" id="target_note_LCL140_469_1"><sup>1</sup></a> making ready, with an enormous equipment, for war. He feared Maximinus mightily; very often, indeed, in referring to him he said that he was waging war against not a man but a Cyclops. As it happened, however, Maximinus was beaten so badly at Aquileia that he was slain by his own men,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL140_469_2" id="target_note_LCL140_469_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and his head, with that of his son, was brought to Ravenna, whence it was despatched by Maximum to Rome.
