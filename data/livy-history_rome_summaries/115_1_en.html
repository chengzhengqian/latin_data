Livius used to say that Miltiades the professor had put it neatly: “They have a passion for the dictionary.”</p>
<p>An alternative emendation gives: “They are raving against their neighbour.”</p>
<p>75. Quintilian, <span class="italic">Oratorical Studies</span> VIII. ii. 18: Certain persons even undergo toil to attain this evil, nor is this vice an innovation, since I find even in Titus Livius that there was a certain instructor who bade his students “darken” what they had to say, using the Greek word <span class="italic">skotison</span>. From the same source comes, if you please, that glorious praise, “So much the better; I didn’t understand it myself.”</p>
<p>76. Quintilian, <span class="italic">Oratorical Studies</span> X. i. 39: The safest thing, then, was the epigram written by Livy in a letter to his son, “Read Demosthenes and Cicero; after that, the more each author is like Demosthenes and Cicero, the better.”</p>
<p>Cf. also Quintilian II. v. 20 for an abbreviated version of this reference.</p>
<p>77. Quintilian, <span class="italic">Oratorical Studies</span> VIII. iii. 53: Long-windedness
is to be avoided, that is, any expression longer than is proper, as in Livy: “The envoys, having failed to obtain peace, returned back home, whence they had come.”</p>
<p>Substantially the same statement is found in Charisius, III p. 271K (and cf. p. 449K). Hertz points out that, while the exact words are not found in the extant books of Livy, similar expressions occur in IX. ii. 10; XXIV. xx. 3; XXIV. xl. 9; and XXXVIII. xvi. 6.</p>
<p>78. Anon. <span class="italic">On Nouns of Doubtful Gender</span>, p. 591K: <span class="italic">Scalper</span> (chisel) is of masculine gender, like <span class="italic">culter</span> (knife), as in Titus Livius, although some say <span class="italic">scalprum.</span></p>
