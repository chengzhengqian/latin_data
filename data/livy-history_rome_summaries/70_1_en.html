<p>An account is given of the panic and flight of the defeated
side to various parts of the world. When Gnaeus Pompeius made for Egypt, he was killed by Achillas, to whom the crime had been assigned, in a small boat before he set foot on land, by order of Bang Ptolemy, Pompey’s own ward, instigated by Pothinus and Theodotus the king’s tutor, whose influence with the king was great. Cornelia, Pompey’s wife, and Sextus Pompeius, his son, took refuge in Cyprus. The third day thereafter Caesar arrived in pursuit, and when Theodotus brought him Pompey’s head and ring, he was indignant and burst into tears.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL404_141_1" id="target_note_LCL404_141_1"><sup>1</sup></a> In spite of rioting, Caesar entered Alexandria safely. Caesar was made dictator, restored Cleopatra to the throne of Egypt, and when Ptolemy attacked him at the instigation of the same men at whose advice he had killed Pompey, Caesar won through after incurring great personal risk.

<p>When Pompey’s partisans had entrenched themselves strongly in Africa, supreme command was conferred on Publius Scipio, after Cato had declined an offer of joint command. A discussion took place as to rasing the city of Utica because this commonwealth favoured Caesar; Marcus Cato maintained that this should not be done, while Juba argued that it should be destroyed; Cato was appointed protector and warden of the city.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL404_141_5" id="target_note_LCL404_141_5"><sup>5</sup></a> Gnaeus Pompeius, the son of Pompey the Great, assembled forces
