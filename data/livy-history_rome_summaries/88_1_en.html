<p>5. Servius, note on <span class="italic">Aeneid</span> I. 343: Sichaeus is called Sicharbal; Belus, the father of Dido, Methres; Carthage was named from Cartha, as the name is given. This information is found in the history of the Carthaginians, and in Livy.</p>
<p>For the name which Vergil changed, presumably for metrical reasons, to Sichaeus, cf. Justinus XVIII. 4. 5, who draws on Timaeus, cf. <span class="italic">F.H.G.</span> I. 197, fr. 23. The city after which Carthage is supposed to have been named (but see below, fr. 6) is called Cartha in Servius, <span class="italic">Aeneid</span> IV. 670, Carthada in Solinus xxvii. 10. <span class="italic">Summary</span> XVI mentions the founding of Carthage.</p>

<p>This is one ancient etymology confirmed by modern scholars.</p>

<p>9. Charisius, p. 95K: Moreover, one speaks of “imberbi,”
not “imberbes.” For so says not only Varro in the fifth book of his <span class="italic">On Theatrical Performances</span>: “imberbi iuvenes” (beardless youths); but Cicero as well says “imberbum perduxit” (he induced the beardless boy), not “imberbem,” and in his speech of January first <span class="italic">On the Agrarian Law</span>, uses “imberba
