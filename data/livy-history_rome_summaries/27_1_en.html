the chickens flew out of the coop; when thereafter he was going aboard ship to leave for Spain, the cry was heard “Stay, Mancinus!” That these were omens of evil was demonstrated by the outcome. For Mancinus was both defeated by the Numantines and stripped of his camp; when no hope remained of saving his army, he made with them a disgraceful peace, confirmation of which was refused by the senate. Forty thousand Romans were beaten by four thousand Numantines.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL404_55_1a" id="target_note_LCL404_55_1a"><sup>1</sup></a> Decimus Junius thoroughly subdued Lusitania by storming its cities all the way to the Ocean.
