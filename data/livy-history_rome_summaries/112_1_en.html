magnificence; it is the custom to give these every hundred years, for that is the end of an age.</p>
<p>The year was 17 <span class="sc">b.c.</span> The interval was never regularly observed, in spite of Censorinus’ quotations (above, frs. 11 and 13) from Livy and others; Augustus seems to have conceived the proper interval as being 110 years.</p>
<h4><span class="sc">From Books not Identifiable</span></h4>
<p>57. Seneca, <span class="italic">On Wrath</span> I. xx. 6: As is said in the works of Titus Livius, a very talented gentleman, “A man of great, rather than good, character.”</p>
<p>58. Pliny, <span class="italic">Natural History</span> I, preface: I must say I am surprised that Titus Livius, that most famous author, in a certain book of his Histories, in which he went back to the beginnings of Rome, began as follows, “I have now earned fame enough, and might make an end, except that my restless mind feeds on the work.”</p>
<p>59. Pliny, <span class="italic">Natural History</span> III. i. 4: Titus Livius and Cornelius Nepos give as the width of the strait of Gibraltar seven miles, where it is narrowest, and ten miles where it is widest.</p>
<p>Modern measurement gives a minimum width of 14 kilometers, or about nine and a half Roman miles.</p>
<p>60. = 68.</p>
<p>61. Servius, note on <span class="italic">Aeneid</span> II. 148: These are the words, as we find in Livy, of a commander taking a deserter under his protection, “Whoever you are, you shall be ours.”</p>
<p>62. William of Malmesbury, <span class="italic">History of England</span> V. § 412, p. 488 ed. Stubbs:</p>
<p>“My mother bore me to be a general, not a warrior.”</p>
<p>This is given by William as a saying of Scipio, and might be from Livy.</p>
