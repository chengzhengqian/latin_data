<p>21. Frontinus, <span class="italic">Stratagems</span> II. v. 34: Livy relates that thirty-five thousand armed men (of the escaped slaves conquered by Crassus) were killed in that battle along with their commanders (Castus and Gannicus). Five Roman eagles were recovered and twenty-six military standards, and much booty, among which were <span class="italic">fasces</span> with axes.</p>
<p>This victory of Crassus is mentioned in <span class="italic">Summary</span> XCVII.</p>

<p>22. Plutarch, <span class="italic">Lucullus</span> xxviii. 7: Livy, moreover, has said that the Romans never entered a battle against foes so overwhelmingly superior in numbers; for, at a rough estimate, the victors were not even the twentieth part of the conquered, but rather less.</p>
<p>This refers to the battle for the relief of Tigranocerta, October 6, 69 <span class="sc">b.c.</span> The calculation of numbers may involve crediting the enemy with the total combined forces of Tigranes and Mithridates, though the latter was not present.</p>
<p>23. Plutarch, <span class="italic">Lucullus</span> xxxi. 8: Livy says that in the former battle greater numbers of the enemy fell and were captured, but in this battle, higher-ranking persons.</p>
<p>The second battle was in 68 <span class="sc">b.c.</span> , on the Arsanias River, as Lucullus was making for Artaxata. Cf. Dio XXXVI. v. f.</p>

<p>24. Servius, note on <span class="italic">Aeneid</span> III. 106: In early times, indeed, Crete had a hundred city-states; on this account it was called Hecatompolis (a hundred cities).
