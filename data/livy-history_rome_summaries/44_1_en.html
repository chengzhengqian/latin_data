<p>LXXI. Marcus Livius Drusus, tribune of the commons <span class="marginNote right"><span class="sc">b.c.</span> 91</span>
had undertaken to support the cause of the senate; in order to bring greater resources to the maintenance of this task, he stirred up the allies and the peoples of Italy to hope for Roman citizenship. With the assistance of the Italians he carried by force laws on the distribution of land and grain, and also pushed through a law on the courts, to the effect that control of the courts should be equally shared by the senate and the order of knights. When after these events the promised grant of citizenship for the allies could not be effected, the Italians were enraged and began to promote a revolt. Their gatherings and conspiracies, and the speeches in conference of their leading men are reported in the book. These events made Livius Drusus detested even by the senate as being a promoter of rebellion among the allies; he was cut down in his own home by an unknown assassin.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL404_89_1" id="target_note_LCL404_89_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>LXXII. The following Italian peoples rebelled: the Picentes, Vestini, Marsi, Paeligni, Marrucini, Samnites, and Lucanians.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL404_89_2" id="target_note_LCL404_89_2"><sup>2</sup></a> The opening move of the war was made by the Picentes; in the town of Asculum, Proconsul Quintus Servilius and all the Roman citizens who were in the town were killed.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL404_89_3" id="target_note_LCL404_89_3"><sup>3</sup></a> The Roman people donned military cloaks. Servius Galba was arrested by the Lucanians and was released from captivity by the action of a lone woman with whom he had been lodging. The colonies of Aesernia and Alba were besieged by the Italians. An account is given of the troops sent by the Latin Name and foreign nations to the relief of the Roman People; also recorded are campaigns and the storming of cities by both sides.</p>
