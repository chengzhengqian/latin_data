iuventute’ (beardless young men). But Titus Livius in his eighteenth Book uses “imberbes” commonly. Beda, <span class="italic">On Orthography</span>, p. 276K: Titus Livius, however, uses “imberbis” in the singular. Unknown author, quoted by C. von Barth, <span class="italic">Adversaria</span>, XXXVII. 14: Varro uses “imberbi iuvenes,” so does Cicero; but Titus Livius does the opposite.</p>
<p>The text of Charisius is somewhat uncertain, see the critical note, but the general, and somewhat minor, point that Livy treats <span class="italic">imberbis</span> as a third-declension word seems clear. No context is extant for Cicero’s words from <span class="italic">de Lege Agraria</span> I. fr. 1.</p>
<p>10. Valerius Maximus, I. viii. ext. 19: Let me mention also the serpent described by Titus Livius no less exactly than eloquently. For Livy says that in Africa at the Bagradas River, there was a snake of such size that it kept the army of Atilius Regulus from using the river. It caught many of the soldiers in its huge jaws, and crushed large numbers of them in the coils of its tail. Hurled missiles could not penetrate its skin, but at last when it was attacked on all sides with missiles from the catapults, it succumbed to the continuous heavy blows of the stones. Both legions and auxiliary troops without exception regarded it as more to be feared than Carthage itself. Even after death the pools were stained with its blood, and the area round about was defiled with the poisonous stench of the exposed body, till it drove the Roman camp away from there. Livy also says that the monster’s skin, measuring one hundred and twenty feet, was sent to Rome.</p>
