<h4><span class="sc">From Book</span> XIX</h4>
<p>11. Censorinus, <span class="italic">On the Birthday</span>, xvii. 10: The third Festival of the Age occurred, as (Valerius) Antias and Livy tell us, in the consulship of Publius Claudius Pulcher and Gaius Junius Pullus.</p>
<p>12. Servius, note on <span class="italic">Aeneid</span> VI. 198: The story is told in Livy that when a certain consul who was anxious to conduct a campaign was prevented from departing by a tribune of the commons, the consul ordered the chickens to be brought. When these failed to eat the grain scattered before them, the consul, mocking the omen, said, “Let them drink, then”, and flung them into the Tiber. After that as he was triumphantly returning in his fleet to Africa he lost his life at sea, along with all his men.</p>
<p>The year was 249 <span class="sc">b.c.</span> <span class="italic">Summary</span> XIX identifies the omen-defying
consul as the Claudius of this year, but makes his fate less directly a vindication of the omen. Cf. also XXII. xlii. 9; <span class="italic">Summary</span> XLIX, p. 31 and note 2; and especially Polybius I. xlix. 3–li. 12.</p>
<h4><span class="sc">From Book</span> XX</h4>
<p>12a. Note in margin of Paris Latin MS. 3858: Livy in Book XX: Publius Cloelius, a patrician, was the first to go against the ancient custom by marrying a wife within the seventh degree of relationship. On this account, Marcus Rutilius, a plebeian, complained that his betrothed was taken from him by an unprecedented sort of marriage; he stirred up a riot of the people so severe that the senators in terror took refuge on the Capitol.</p>
<p>The rule of marriage here recorded forbade marriage between second cousins, or those more closely related. Nothing further is known about this incident.</p>
