<h3><span class="ac">Fragments Sometimes Attributed to Livy</span></h3>
<p>81. Anon. <span class="italic">On the Seven Wonders of the World,</span> in Haupt, <span class="italic">Ovidii Halieutica, etc,</span> pp. xxviii and 70 f. = fr. 4W. This contains a list of the principal mountains of Sicily, and is assigned
to Livy; but elsewhere the quotation appears as from Julius Titianus, see Hertz I. xii.</p>
<p>82. Note on Lucan, <span class="italic">Pharsalia</span> I. 319 = fr. 28W. This is a comment on Pompey’s superintendence of the grain supply. The letters <span class="italic">lv</span> in the MS. represent the name of the author quoted, but the quotation is not from Livy, but Boethius, <span class="italic">Consolation</span> III, prose iv.</p>
<p>83. Appian, <span class="italic">Civil War</span> III. xi. 77 = fr. 44 Weissenborn. Perizonius proposed reading “Livy” in place of “Libo” in this passage, but the emendation is generally rejected.</p>
<p>84. Priscian VIII, p. 382K. = fr. 67W. Weissen born reads “Livius” for “Aelius” as the source for this quotation, but the rather technical legal language does not sound like Livy.</p>
<p>85. Nonius Marcellus, p. 308 L. Mueller, Leipzig, Teubner, 1888 = fr. 69W. A garbled quotation is assigned by the MSS. to Titus Livius, but Mueller assigns this to Livius Andronicus, since one MS. cites “Ajax Bearing a Whip” as the work cited, i.e., a tragedy after Sophocles (= Warmington, <span class="italic">Remains of Old Latin,</span> fr. 16–17).</p>
<p>86. Nonius Marcellus, p. 599 Mueller = fr. 70W. Again the MSS. name Titus Livius, but the quotation sounds poetic, and is assigned by Mueller to Andronicus.</p>
<p>87. Sallust, <span class="italic">Histories</span> II. 43 ed. Maurenbrecher = fr. 72W. This badly broken fragment shows the names of Publius Lentulus Marcellinus, King Apion, and Quintus Metellus Creticus, and was formerly assigned to Livy, cf. Weissenborn <span class="italic">ad loc,</span> but is now given to Sallust, cf. Hertz I. p. xii.</p>
<p>88. Anon. <span class="italic">de Dubiis Nominibus</span> p. 575K: Cancer, the swelling, is of neuter gender, as in Livy, “the evil is wont to hide—the incurable cancer.” It is tempting to put this
