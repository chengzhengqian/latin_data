should occupy more than a thousand acres of public land<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL404_63_1" id="target_note_LCL404_63_1"><sup>1</sup></a>; <span class="marginNote right"><span class="sc">b.c.</span> 133</span>
Gracchus then went so insane as to remove from office by special enactment his colleague Marcus Octavius, who was supporting the other side of the controversy<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL404_63_2" id="target_note_LCL404_63_2"><sup>2</sup></a>; Gracchus also had himself, his brother Gaius Gracchus, and Appius Claudius his father-in-law elected as the board of three in charge of distributing the land. He also proposed a second land law, in order to put more land at his disposal, that the same commissioners should judge which land was public and which private. Then when there was less land than could be divided up without incurring the hostility of the commons too, because Gracchus had stirred them up to be greedy enough to hope for a large amount, he declared that he would propose a law that the fortune which had belonged to King Attalus should be divided among those who ought to receive land under the Sempronian Law. For Attalus, son of Eumenes, King of Pergamum had made the Roman People his heir.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL404_63_3" id="target_note_LCL404_63_3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>The senate was deeply stirred by so many actions ignoring its prestige; the ex-consul Titus Annius was especially moved.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL404_63_4" id="target_note_LCL404_63_4"><sup>4</sup></a> After he had delivered a speech in the senate against Gracchus, he was summoned before the people by the latter, and accused before the commons; Annius again made a public address against Gracchus from the Rostra. When Gracchus wished to be elected tribune of the commons for the second time, he was killed on the Capitol by men of the “upper class” led by Publius Cornelius Nasica. Gracchus was first struck down with pieces of a bench, and then with others who were killed in the same riot was thrown unburied into the river. The book also contains an account of the campaigns conducted in Sicily against the fugitive slaves with varying success.</p>

Roman political tact—the instinct for adjusting to the grievances and rights of others—begins to break down at this point; the partisan spirit led to civil war within fifty years. Losses in Spain may have made acute the problems Tiberius was striving to solve.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL404_63_2').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL404_63_3"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL404_63_3" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">3</sup>Attalus died of disease (Strabo XIII. 624) or sunstroke (Justinus XXXVI. iv. 5).
