<p>LXI. Proconsul Gaius Sextius conquered the Salluvian <span class="marginNote right"><span class="sc">b.c.</span> 123–120</span>
tribe and founded the colony of Aquae Sextiae, which was named after the abundance of waters from hot and cold springs, and after the name of the proconsul.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL404_73_1" id="target_note_LCL404_73_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Proconsul Gnaeus Domitius fought successfully against the Allobroges before the town of Vindalium. The reason for waging war on them was that they received Toutomotulus the king of the Salluvii, when he had fled, and assisted him with all their power; also that they had devastated the land of the Aedui, allies of the Roman People.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL404_73_2" id="target_note_LCL404_73_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Gaius Gracchus, after passing a riotous tribuneship, proceeded also to seize the Aventine with an armed mob, and was routed and killed by Lucius Opimius the consul, in accordance with a decree of the senate, after the people had been summoned to arms. Along with Gracchus was killed Fulvius Flaccus, an ex-consul, and his comrade in like madness.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL404_73_3" id="target_note_LCL404_73_3"><sup>3</sup></a> Consul Quintus Fabius Maximus, grandson of Paulus, fought successfully against the Allobroges and Bituitus the king of the Arverni.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL404_73_4a" id="target_note_LCL404_73_4a"><sup>4</sup></a> One hundred and twenty thousand of Bituitus’ army were killed; after the king himself had set out for Rome to make his peace with the senate, he was placed in custody at Alba, because his return to Gaul seemed not to be in the interest of peace. It was also decreed that his son Congonnetiacus should be arrested and sent to Rome.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL404_73_5" id="target_note_LCL404_73_5"><sup>5</sup></a> The surrender of the Allobroges was accepted. Lucius Opimius was accused before the people by Quintus Decius, tribune of the commons, on the ground that he had cast citizens into prison without a trial, but he was acquitted.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL404_73_6" id="target_note_LCL404_73_6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
