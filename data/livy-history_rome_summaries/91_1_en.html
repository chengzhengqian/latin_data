<p>12b. Servius on Vergil, <span class="italic">Aeneid</span> VI. 860: Commentators advance various views on this line, forgetting the law of Numa, of which Livy also makes mention.</p>
<p>Servius quotes this law as decreeing that the first <span class="italic">spolia opima</span> (spoils taken by a Roman commander from an enemy commander) were to be dedicated to Jupiter Feretrius (as done by Romulus, cf. Livy I. x. 4–7), the second to Mars (as done by Cossus, cf. IV. xx. 5-11), and the third to Quirinus (as done by Marcellus). Since this law is not mentioned in the earlier passages, it must have appeared in the account of Marcellus’ feat, cf. <span class="italic">Summary</span> XX.</p>
<h4><span class="sc">From Book</span> XLIX</h4>
<p>13. Censorinus, <span class="italic">On the Birthday</span>, xvii. 11: As to the fourth Festival of the Age, three opinions are held. For (Valerius) Antias, Varro, and Livy have stated that the festival was revived in the consulship of Lucius Marcius Censorinus and Manius Manlius, in the six hundred and fifth year after the founding of Rome.</p>
<p>Cf. <span class="italic">Summaries</span> XLIX, pp. 23 and 31, and the note, p. 31, note 2, on variations in the reckoning as to the founding of Rome. The year was 149 <span class="sc">b.c.</span> </p>
<h4><span class="sc">From Book</span> LVI</h4>
<p>14. Priscian XVIII, p. 344K: Livy, <span class="italic">From the Founding of the City</span>, Book LVI: “They relate that Quintus Pompeius made illness his excuse, so that he might not inflame the spirits of the Numantines by being present at the surrender.”</p>
<p>This evidently was the Pompeius who had made a treaty with the Numantines that was repudiated by Rome, cf. <span class="italic">Summary</span> LIV. He returned to Spain as <span class="italic">legatus</span> in 136 <span class="sc">b.c.</span> ; cf. Valerius Maximus III. vii. 5.</p>
