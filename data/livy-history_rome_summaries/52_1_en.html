<p>LXXXIII Flavius Fimbria routed in battle several <span class="marginNote right"><span class="sc">b.c.</span> 85–84</span>officers of Mithridates in Asia, captured the city of Pergamum,
and narrowly failed to capture the King in the course of the siege. Fimbria stormed and destroyed the city of Ilium, which was waiting to hand itself over to Sulla, and recovered a large part of Asia.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL404_105_1" id="target_note_LCL404_105_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Sulla cut the Thracians to pieces in numerous battles. When Lucius Cinna and Gnaeus Papirius Carbo, self-appointed as consuls for two years, were preparing a campaign against Sulla, Lucius Valerius Flaccus, the chief of the senate, made a speech in the senate and with the help of those who were pressing for harmony brought it about that envoys were sent to Sulla to discuss peace.

Although this stipulation seemed fair to the senate, agreement was prevented by Carbo and his party, who thought that war was more to their interest. The same Carbo wished to demand hostages from all the towns and colonies of Italy, in order to secure their loyalty against Sulla, but he was prevented by the united sentiment of the senate.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL404_105_5" id="target_note_LCL404_105_5"><sup>5</sup></a> The right to vote was given by decree of the senate to the new
