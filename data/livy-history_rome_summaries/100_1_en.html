But those in charge of the sacrifices none the less continued their sacred service, and were not compelled to run away either by fear for their lives or by the multitude of those who were already being slaughtered. They deemed it better to await whatever suffering they must endure by the very altars, rather than to transgress any point of the law.

The “fast” was probably the sabbath, as interpreted by some Gentile, cf. Marcus <span class="italic">ad loc.</span> VII. 480 and 700–1. (L.C.L.).</p>
