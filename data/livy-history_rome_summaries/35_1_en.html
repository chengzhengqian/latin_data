<p>Gaius Gracchus, the brother of Tiberius and a better <span class="marginNote right"><span class="sc">b.c.</span> 126–12</span>
speaker than his brother, carried as tribune of the commons
several ruinous laws, among which were: a law on the grain supply, that grain should be sold for six and one-third <span class="italic">asses</span> to the commons; a second law concerning land, such as his brother also had carried; and a third law, as a means of seducing the order of knights, which was at that time in harmony with the senate, to the effect that six hundred of the knights should be joined to the body of the senate and, since at that time there were only three hundred senators, that these three hundred senators should be amalgamated with six hundred knights, which meant that the order of knights would have a two-to-one
majority in the senate. When Gracchus was continued as tribune for a second year, he passed land laws and brought about the foundation of several colonies in Italy and one on the site of destroyed Carthage; for the last, he himself was appointed to the Board of Three and founded the colony.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL404_71_1" id="target_note_LCL404_71_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>In addition, the book contains an account of the campaign of Consul Quintus Metellus against the Baleares, whom the Greeks call Gymnesians, because they spend the summer unclothed. They are called Baleares because of hurling missiles, or else after Balius, a companion left behind there by Hercules when he sailed after Geryon.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL404_71_2a" id="target_note_LCL404_71_2a"><sup>2</sup></a> An account is also given of the disturbances in Syria, during which Cleopatra put to death her husband Demetrius, and then her son Seleucus, because she resented his assuming the crown without her permission, after she had killed his father.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL404_71_3" id="target_note_LCL404_71_3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
