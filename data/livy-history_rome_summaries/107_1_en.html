<p>Bogud was a chieftain of Mauretania, recognized as king by Caesar, together with Bocchus, perhaps his brother, cf. frs. 37–9 above. Keil, Supplement p. 123, has a reference to the name as a type of ending.</p>
<p>44. See below, fr. 83.</p>
<p>45. Jerome, <span class="italic">Commentary on Hosea</span> II, preface: I should choose to have it true of me, as Titus Livius writes of Cato, that his fame was neither helped by anyone’s praise, nor hurt by anyone’s censure, although the authors of both were men endowed with the highest abilities. He means, of course, Marcus Cicero and Gaius Caesar, the former of whom wrote a eulogy, the latter an excoriation, of the aforesaid gentleman.</p>
<h4><span class="sc">From Book</span> CXVI</h4>
<p>46. Plutarch, <span class="italic">Caesar</span> Ixiii: For there was a gable ornament attached to Caesar’s house by vote of the senate as a decoration and mark of dignity, as Livy relates. Calpurnia in a dream saw this shattered, and thought that she called on the gods and wept; so when day broke, she begged Caesar, if it was possible, not to go out, but to postpone the session of the senate.</p>
<p>Cf. Obsequens 67.</p>
<p>47. Servius, note on <span class="italic">Georgics</span> I. 472: It has been an evil omen whenever Etna, the Sicilian mountain, has ejected balls of fire instead of smoke. As Livy tells us, before the death of Caesar such flame flowed from Mount Etna that not only the neighbouring cities, but even the town of Regium, which is a long distance from the mountain, felt the blast.</p>
<p>For an eruption of Etna as a bad omen, cf. Obsequens 26, 29, and 32.</p>
