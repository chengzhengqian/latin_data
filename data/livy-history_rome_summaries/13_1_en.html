<p>When Lucius Scribonius, tribune of the commons, proposed a resolution that freedom should be restored to Lusitanians who had been sold in Gaul by Servius Galba after having surrendered at discretion to the Roman People, Cato most vigorously supported the resolution. His speech survives, as part of his <span class="italic">History.</span> Quintus Fulvius Nobilior, who had often been assailed by Cato in the senate, answered him on behalf of Galba. Moreover, Galba himself, seeing that he was being condemned, spoke in his own defence so pitiably, clasping his two young sons and the son of Sulpicius Gallus, whose guardian he was, that the resolution was defeated. Three speeches by Galba survive: two were delivered against Libo the tribune of the commons and his resolution about the Lusitanians; the third was against Lucius Cornelius Cethegus, in which Galba admits that he massacred the Lusitanians who were encamped near him, because, he says, he had discovered that they had sacrificed a horse and a man according to their custom and planned to attack his army under cover of the truce.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL404_27_2" id="target_note_LCL404_27_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

Many followers rallied about his lying account as if it were true, and with the army he had collected he seized all of Macedonia either with the consent of the inhabitants or by force. This was the tale he had invented: he was the son of King Perseus and a concubine,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL404_27_1" id="target_note_LCL404_27_1"><sup>1</sup></a>
