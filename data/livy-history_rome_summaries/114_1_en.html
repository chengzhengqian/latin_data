preface, for Livy frequently makes a fresh start, as after the burning of the city by the Gauls, and at the end of a consular year.</p>
<p>For Livy’s fresh starts, cf. the opening of Book VI (as mentioned by Servius), Book XXI, and above, fr. 58. The annalistic practice of marking the start of each consular year hardly seems worthy of Servius’ attention in this connection, but I do not know how to interpret his final phrase in a different sense.

<p>Sallust’s epigram is found in the Oration of Lepidus (<span class="italic">Histories</span> I. 55 Maurenbrecher) sec. 24; the Greek quoted by Seneca, but not included above, does not appear in our Thucydides; the sentiment, in slightly different words, is found in [Demosthenes] <span class="italic">On the Letter of Philip</span> 13.</p>
<p>74. Seneca the Rhetorician, <span class="italic">Argumentation</span> IX. ii. 26 (xxv): Concerning orators who pursue obsolete and vulgar words and mistake obscurity for austerity, Titus
