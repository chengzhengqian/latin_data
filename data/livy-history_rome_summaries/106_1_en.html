<p>41. Note to Lucan, <span class="italic">Pharsalia</span> X. 521: Arsinoe was the sister of Ptolemy; she was brought over to the camp of Achillas by a certain eunuch, Ganymede, who was much favoured by the girl. On her order Achillas was killed and Ganymede put in charge of the army. Later on, he was led in Caesar’s triumph after the conquest of Egypt, as Livy mentions in the fourth book of the civil war.</p>
<p>Cf. Caesar, <span class="italic">Civil War</span> III. cxii; <span class="italic">Alexandrine War</span> iv, xxiii; Dio XLII. xxxix f.; xlii; XLIII. xix.</p>
<p>42. Seneca, <span class="italic">On Tranquillity of Mind</span> ix: Four hundred thousand volumes were burned at Alexandria, a most handsome memorial to royal wealth. Let someone else praise such a collection, as Livy does, who says that this was a distinguished achievement of the good taste and solicitude of kings.</p>
<p>This appears to be an early example of the false equation of the burning of some books during Caesar’s campaign—with the total destruction of the great Library.</p>
<h4><span class="sc">From Book</span> CXIII</h4>
<p>43. Priscian VI. 22, p. 214K: Likewise in Book CXIII (Livy) exhibited the name of a town ending in <span class="italic">d</span> in the accusative case and neuter gender: “And he himself was guarding the shore in the vicinity of Pulpud.”</p>
<p>In Keil, Supplement p. 123, the name appears as Pudpud. Weissenborn gives Palpud. It is not mentioned elsewhere.</p>
<h4><span class="sc">From Book</span> CXIV</h4>
<p>43a. Priscian V. 10, p. 146K: Also Bogud, a foreign name, which Livy in Book CXIV declined <span class="italic">Bogudis.</span></p>
