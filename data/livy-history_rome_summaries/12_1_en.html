They then ordered, on the authority of the senate, that the Carthaginians should build a town elsewhere, but not less than ten miles from the sea.

This valour of Scipio’s even Cato, a man whose tongue was readier for invective, praised in the senate so highly as to say that the others who were serving in the army in Africa were flitting shadows, while Scipio alone was alive; moreover, the Roman people hailed him with such approval
