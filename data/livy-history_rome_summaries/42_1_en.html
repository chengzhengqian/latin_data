The better class of citizens rallied to Metellus’ defence, but to avoid being a cause of strife, he went into voluntary exile at Rhodes, and there found distraction in hearing and reading distinguished philosophers.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL404_85_2" id="target_note_LCL404_85_2"><sup>2</sup></a> After Metellus left, Gaius Marius, the man responsible for the civil strife, who had bought his sixth consulship by strewing money among the tribes, banned Metellus from fire and water.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL404_85_3" id="target_note_LCL404_85_3"><sup>3</sup></a> The same Apuleius Saturninus, tribune of the commons, killed Gaius Memmius, a candidate for the consulship, because he feared him as an opponent of his proceedings.4 The senate was aroused at these crimes; and Gaius Marius too, being a man of shifting and changeable nature, and one to shift his policy as chance directed, had come over to their side. Saturninus, along with Praetor Glaucia and other comrades in the same madness, was put down by military force and killed in a sort of war.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL404_85_5" id="target_note_LCL404_85_5"><sup>5</sup></a> Quintus Caecilius Metellus was brought back from exile to the loud applause of the whole state.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL404_85_6" id="target_note_LCL404_85_6"><sup>6</sup></a> Proconsul Manius Aquilius put an end to a slave war which had arisen in Sicily.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL404_85_7" id="target_note_LCL404_85_7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
