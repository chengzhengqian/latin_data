<p>1. Servius, note on <span class="italic">Aeneid</span> 1. 456: Livy: “if Pyrrhus had not been a consummate master of tactics, but excellent in a battle rather than in a campaign.”</p>
<p>References to the campaigns of Pyrrhus in Italy are found in <span class="italic">Summaries</span> XII and XIII. The Roman opinion that Pyrrhus was weak on strategy may have arisen from their natural inability to perceive that war with Rome was to Pyrrhus a side issue, an excuse for establishing suzerainty over “Great Greece”—south Italy and Sicily.</p>

<p>2. Servius, note on <span class="italic">Aeneid</span> I. 476: Both Livy and Sallust
inform us that our ancestors used scythed chariots.</p>
<p>Archæological evidence for chariot fighting in Italy seems to be lacking, unless the use of a chariot as the general’s vehicle in a triumph is such evidence. The war with Pyrrhus would provide a good loophole for the insertion of such a picturesque detail by some annalist, especially a Greek who knew his Xenophon.</p>
<p>3. Priscian XV, p. 69K: Livy in Book XIII: “We should have kept out of public life.”</p>
