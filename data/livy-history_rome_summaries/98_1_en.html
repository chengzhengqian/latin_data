the threat from disaffected tribes sandwiched in among his allies, and so to establish a solid base area in north central Spain. He moved westerly, near the north boundary of this area at the Pyrenees, and sent his officers to the southwest. Cf. <span class="italic">Summary</span> XCI.</p>
<p>19. Frontinus, <span class="italic">Stratagems</span> II. v. 31: This was the first battle between Sertorius and Pompey. Ten thousand persons and all the baggage were lost by Pompey’s army, as Livy informs us.</p>
<p>19a. Asconius, note on Cicero, <span class="italic">pro Cornelio</span>: There is no reference, either in Sallust or in Livy or in Fenestella,
to any law passed by him (Gaius Cotta) other than the one which he passed in his consulship over the opposition of the office-holding class, but with the eager support of the people, to the effect that those who had been tribunes of the commons should be allowed to hold other magistracies too.</p>
<p>This occurred in 75 <span class="sc">b.c.</span> , and was Cotta’s measure of conciliation to prevent further rioting over a scarcity of grain.</p>

<p>20. Servius, note on <span class="italic">Aeneid</span> IX. 715: In his ninety-fourth book, Livy says that Inarime is in a portion of Maeonia, where for fifty miles the countryside is scorched with fire. Livy’s opinion is that Homer also meant this region.</p>
<p>Maeonia, synonymous with Lydia to the poets, meant north-east Lydia to the geographers, cf. Ptolemy V. ii. 16. In this area, along the Hermus River, Strabo (XIII. iv. 5 (626)) speaks of a region called Catacecaumene (“destroyed by fire”) which is no doubt the volcanic area Livy had in mind. The reference had some connection with the campaigns of Lucullus against Mithridates.</p>
<p>The ancient error by which Homer’s <span class="italic">ein Arimois, Iliad</span> II. 783, (among the Arimi) became “Inarime” is well known. Vergil’s Inarime was in the volcanic area near Naples.</p>
