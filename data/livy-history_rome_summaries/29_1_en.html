He was forbidden to accept this office by a law which ruled that no one should be consul a second time, but as in his first consulship, Scipio was exempted from legal restrictions.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL404_59_5" id="target_note_LCL404_59_5"><sup>5</sup></a> A slave revolt arose in Sicily, and when the praetors could not suppress it, command was assigned to Consul Gaius Fulvius.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL404_59_6" id="target_note_LCL404_59_6"><sup>6</sup></a> The instigator of this revolt was Eunus, a slave of Syrian nationality; he assembled a force of rural slaves, opened the workhouses, and raised his numbers to those of a regular army.

Breach of the arrangement by which Mancinus’ force was released from a trap was not in accord with Roman pride in Roman good faith; a sufficient commentary is furnished by the words credited by Livy to the Samnites after the similar occasion at the Caudine Forks (IX. xi).
