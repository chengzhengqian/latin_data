in early times, as Livy says, sailed around the whole extent of Britain, that did not prevent many people from delivering different opinions on the subject.</p>
<p>The author’s name also appears as Iornandes in the MSS. <span class="italic">Summary</span> CV ends with mention of Caesar’s campaign in Britain.</p>
<h4><span class="sc">From Book</span> CIX</h4>
<p>31. Orosius VII. 2: In the seven-hundredth year of its existence, Rome had fourteen of its streets devastated by a fire of unknown origin, nor was it ever ravaged by a greater blaze, so Livy says. As a result, Caesar Augustus several years later donated a large sum of money from the public treasury to the rebuilding of the structures consumed at that time.</p>
<p>32. Orosius VI. 15: When Caesar had crossed the Rubicon, he presently came to Ariminum, and there explained his plan of action to the five cohorts which were all that he had at that time—with which, as Livy puts it, he assailed the whole world.</p>
<p>Cf. Caesar, <span class="italic">Civil War</span> I. vii f.; Caesar’s force is usually referred to as one legion; whether the “five cohorts” is an estimate of actual strength present, or a piece of rhetoric without military foundation does not appear, but cf. <span class="italic">Civil War</span> I. xi. 4. William of Malmesbury, <span class="italic">Historia Novella</span> II § 478 Stubbs, follows Orosius.</p>
<p>32a. Note on Lucan, <span class="italic">Pharsalia</span> III. 182 (Usener, 100): In the first book on the civil war, Livy says: “for the Athenians barely mustered two ships as relics of their great reputation for sea-power.”</p>
<p>32b. Note on Lucan, <span class="italic">Pharsalia</span> III. 59 (Usener, 92): As Livy says, he drove Marcus Cato from the province.</p>
<p>The reference is to Curio, cf. Caesar, <span class="italic">Civil War</span> I. xxx. 5; Plutarch, <span class="italic">Cato</span> liii; Appian, <span class="italic">Civil Wars</span> II. vi. 40 f.</p>
