At the same time, the tower which was the city’s chief bulwark began to gape with great cracks as its foundations were undermined, and then was set on fire as blazing torches were thrown in. Terror-stricken by the threat of fire and collapse together, the people of Contrebia in panic fled back from the wall, and the whole crowd set up a shout that envoys should be sent to surrender the city. That same valour which had caused them to attack those who challenged them made the conqueror the readier to give terms. When he had received hostages, he exacted a moderate sum of money, and deprived them of all their weapons. He ordered the free deserters to be brought to him alive; the runaway slaves, whose number was far greater, he ordered the townspeople themselves to kill. The slaves’ throats were cut, and they were thrown from the wall.</p>
<p>Contrebia was reduced after forty-four days with a large loss of soldiers. Sertorius left Lucius Insteius in the town with a strong garrison, and led his own force to the Ebro River. There he constructed winter quarters by the town called Camp Aelia, and remained there with his forces; by day he held a conference in the town of the cities allied with him. He issued an order that throughout the province arms should be manufactured according to the capacities of the several peoples. After he had inspected the new weapons, he ordered his soldiers to turn in the arms they had which had become unserviceable either because of the frequent marches or because of sieges and battles. He distributed the new weapons to his men through their centurions, equipped his cavalry also with new arms, distributed clothing which had been previously prepared, and issued pay.
