born whose ways and manner of life are different, and for whom the gods care less than for the former race.</p>
<p>The whole passage is given as a quotation from the authors cited. It occurs almost word for word in Plutarch’s <span class="italic">Sulla</span> vii. 3–4, but Plutarch allows for a change to a more godly race, as well as the Hesiodic deterioration which stands alone in Suidas.

<p>The reference is to the sack of Troy by Fimbria, cf. <span class="italic">Summary</span> LXXXIII, Obsequens 56b.</p>
<h4><span class="sc">From Book</span> XCI</h4>
