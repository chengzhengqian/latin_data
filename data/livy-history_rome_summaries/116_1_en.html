<p>The last clause is not included by Keil, but appears in the citation by Haupt, <span class="italic">Ovid’s Halieutica, etc</span>., p. 101. The neuter scalprum appears, e.g., in XXVII. xlix. 1.</p>
<p>79. Pliny, <span class="italic">Natural History</span> III. xix. 132: Moreover, the width of the Alps is said to extend over one hundred miles by Cornelius Nepos, and three thousand stades by Titus Livius, each of whom refers to a different region.</p>
<p>As pointed out by Rackham, L.C.L., Pliny, vol. II, p. 98, the figure given for Livy’s measurement, 360 Roman or 333 English miles, assuming an Olympic stade of 178–6 metres, is too large; something like DL or DC would be preferable, as corresponding to the figure of seventy miles given by Pliny as a minimum, after he has mentioned one hundred miles as a somewhat under-estimated maximum. It seems likely that Livy took his Greek measurement from Polybius.</p>
<p>80. Jonah, <span class="italic">Life of Saint Columban,</span> Migne 87, 1015C As Livy says, nothing is made so holy by awe, or kept so remote by watchfulness, that lust cannot reach it.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL404_233_1" id="target_note_LCL404_233_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
