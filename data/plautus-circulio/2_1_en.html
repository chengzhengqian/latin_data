<p class="noindent">The stage represents a street in Epidaurus. In its middle is the
sanctuary of Aesculapius. To its left there is the pimpâ€™s house, in
front of which stands an altar for Venus. To the right of the sanctuary
of Aesculapius we find the house of Phaedromus. On this
side, the street leads to the market. On the other side, it leads
out of the city.</p>
