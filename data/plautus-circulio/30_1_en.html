she has belong to her.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">cap</span><p class="lineGroup">No one denies it.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">cur</span><p class="lineGroup">But still it’s better to remind you.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">lyco</span><p class="lineGroup">(<span class="italic">to Cappadox</span>) Remember that you promised that if anyone<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">490</span><span class="br"></span>
should claim the girl as free, all the money would be
returned to me, thirty minas.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">cap</span><p class="lineGroup">I shall remember, be calm on that front. Now I still say
the same.</p></div>

<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">cap</span><p class="lineGroup">I do remember it, and I’ll hand her over to you formally.</p></div>

own the ones you set free, you don’t own the ones you order
around, no one sells to you with authority, and you
don’t sell with authority to anyone. In my opinion the
class of pimps is among men like flies, gnats, bedbugs,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">500</span><span class="br"></span>
lice, and fleas: you’re a pest, a pain, and a nuisance, and
you aren’t of any use to anybody. Nobody decent dares to
stand beside you on the market; if anyone does, people
find fault with him, he’s seen and rebuked, and they say
he’s throwing away his money and reputation, even if he
hasn’t done anything.</p></div>
