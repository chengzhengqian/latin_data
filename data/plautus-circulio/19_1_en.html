my duty here: flee, all of you, go away and get off the
streets, so that while running I don’t hit anyone with my
head, my elbow, my chest, or my knee. So suddenly, fast,
and quickly has this business now been thrown my way,
that there’s no one anywhere so rich that he could afford
to block my way, not a general, not a despot, not a market<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">285</span><span class="br"></span>
inspector, not a district magistrate, not a village superintendent,
not anyone with such great fame: no, he’ll
fall, drop from the sidewalk and stand on his head in
the street. Then those Greeks in their cloaks, who wander
around with their heads covered, who prance about
stuffed with books and food baskets, who stop and palaver<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">290</span><span class="br"></span>
among each other, those runaway slaves, who stand in
your way and block your path, who prance about with
their clever sayings, whom you can always see drinking in
the tavern when they’ve stolen something; with their
heads covered they drink mulled wine and prance about
with a grave expression and drunk. If I meet them, I’ll<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">295</span><span class="br"></span>
drive the barley-fed farts out of every single one of them.
Then those slaves of the city bon vivants, who play ball in
the street, I’ll put all the throwers and players under the
ground. So let them stay at home and avoid a thrashing.</p></div>
