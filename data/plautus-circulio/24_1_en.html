<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">lyco</span><p class="lineGroup">I seem prosperous: I’ve done the reckoning of how much
money I have and how much debt I have. I’m rich if I
don’t return the money to those whom I owe something;
if I do return it to those whom I owe something, the debt
is greater. But seriously, when I think it through nicely,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">375</span><span class="br"></span>
if they push me harder, I’ll go to the praetor<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL061_273_19" id="target_note_LCL061_273_19"><sup>19</sup></a> for arbitration.
Most bankers have this custom of demanding

make his demands too vociferously. A man who has made<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">380</span><span class="br"></span>
money quickly goes hungry quickly unless he’s saved it

as a catamite to be lent out on interest now: I need
money.</p></div>

you. Be quiet. (<span class="italic">to himself</span>) Honestly, I filled myself properly
inside here, and I left place for one room in my belly
where I can store the remains of the remains. (<span class="italic">pauses</span>)
Who is that greeting Aesculapius with covered head?<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">390</span><span class="br"></span>
Goodness, the very man I was looking for! (<span class="italic">to slave boy</span>)
Follow me. I’ll pretend not to know him. (<span class="italic">loudly, to
