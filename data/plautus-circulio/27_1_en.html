Sinope is a city on the Black Sea. Caria is a region in southwest Turkey, next to Lycia. Peredia and Perbibesia are made-up names punning on food and drink. Centauromachia and Unomammia are also made up and pun on mythi cal fights with centaurs (half horse, half man) and Amazons (female
warriors who cut off their right breasts so as not to impede javelinthrowing).
On this interpretation Classia remains an unclear name;
others have taken it to mean “fleet” (like <span class="italic">classis</span>). Conterebromnia is an
invented toponym containing the words “wear down” and Bromius, an
alternative name of the god of wine.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL061_279_24a').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
