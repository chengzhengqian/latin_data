me know.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">cur</span><p class="lineGroup">Because whenever I’m drunk, I sure act like some anus.<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">415</span><span class="br"></span>
For that reason all men call me Summanus.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">lyco</span><p class="lineGroup">It’s better if you look for hospitality elsewhere: at my
house there’s definitely no place for Summanus. But I am
the man you’re looking for.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">cur</span><p class="lineGroup">Please, is it you, the banker Lyco?<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">420</span><span class="br"></span></p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">lyco</span><p class="lineGroup">Yes, that’s me.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">cur</span><p class="lineGroup">Therapontigonus told me to give you his best wishes, and
he told me to give these tablets to you.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">lyco</span><p class="lineGroup">To me?</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">cur</span><p class="lineGroup">Yes. Take them, examine the seal. (<span class="italic">hands them over</span>) Do
you recognize it?</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">lyco</span><p class="lineGroup">Why shouldn’t I? Where a man with a shield is cutting an
elephant in two with his sword.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">cur</span><p class="lineGroup">He told me to ask you to do what’s written there if you<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">425</span><span class="br"></span>
wanted his gratitude.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">lyco</span><p class="lineGroup">Step aside, I’ll look at what’s written.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">cur</span><p class="lineGroup">By all means, just as you like, so long as I take away from
you what I seek.</p></div>

<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">lyco</span><p class="lineGroup">“I ask you and request from you that the girl I bought at
your place be given to the man who brings these tablets
to you—business I transacted there in your presence and
with you as go-between—and also the jewelry and clothing.<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">435</span><span class="br"></span>
You already know how it was agreed: you are to give
the money to the pimp and you are to give the girl to this
man.” Where’s the man himself? Why hasn’t he come?</p></div>
