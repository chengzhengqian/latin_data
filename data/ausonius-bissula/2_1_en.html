<p>Make use of these verses, then, as freely, but not as confidently, as though they were your own: for your writings can face the public, mine make me blush even in private. Farewell.</p>

<h2><span class="ac"><span class="sc">I.—The Preface</span></span></h2>
<p>As you desired, Paulus, you have all the verses of my <span class="italic">Bissula</span>—playful verses which I have written in honour of a slip of a Swabian girl, rather amusing my idleness than aiming at renown. Tiresome you have been, so read these tiresome poems which you demanded: you must eat up all the mess you have compounded; or, as the old saw bids:—</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">“Let the smith who made them wear</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">The shackles which he did prepare.”</span><span class="linebreak"></span>

<p><span class="sc">You</span> who propose to read this booklet of unpolished verse, smooth out your frown. Weigh sober poems with a knitted brow: I follow Thymele.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL096_219_2" id="target_note_LCL096_219_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Bissula shall be sung in this rough sketch, not Erasinus.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL096_219_3" id="target_note_LCL096_219_3"><sup>3</sup></a> I warn you fairly: drink before you read. This is no reading for a fasting saint; whoso shall read this book after a cup or two, he will be wise. But he will be wiser still to sleep and think this is a dream sent to him.</p>
