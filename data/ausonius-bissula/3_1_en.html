<h2><span class="ac"><span class="sc">III.—Where Bissula was born, and how she came into her Master’s Hands</span></span></h2>
<p><span class="sc">Bissula</span>, born and bred beyond chilly Rhine, Bissula, privy to the secrets of the Danube’s birth, a captive maid, a free girl made,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL096_221_1" id="target_note_LCL096_221_1"><sup>1</sup></a> she queens it as the pet of him whose spoil of war she was. Lacking a mother, wanting a nurse, she who knows not a mistress’ control, who herself rules her master’s house, who for her lot and native land felt no disgrace, being straightway freed from slavery ere she felt it,—is not so changed by Roman blessings, but that she remains German in features, blue of eyes and fair of hair. A maid of either race now speech, now looks present her: the last declare her a daughter of the Rhine, the first a child of Latium.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Darling</span>, delight, my pet, my love, my joy! Barbarian and adopted you may be, but you surpass your Roman sister-lasses. Bissula! ’Tis a clumsy little name for so delicate a girl, an uncouth little name to strangers; but to your master, charming.</p>

<h2><span class="ac"><span class="sc">V.—To a Painter: on Bissula’s Portrait</span></span></h2>
<p><span class="sc">Bissula</span>, whom no wax nor any paint can imitate, adapts not her natural beauty to the shams of art. Vermilion and white, go picture other girls: the artist’s skill cannot so blend you as to match this face. Away, then, painter, mingle crimson roses and lilies, and let that colour which they give the air be the very colour of her face.</p>
