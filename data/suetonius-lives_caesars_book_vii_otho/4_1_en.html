admit those whom Nero sent to fetch her, but that on one occasion he even shut out the emperor himself, who stood before his door, vainly mingling threats and entreaties and demanding the return of his trust. Therefore Nero annulled the marriage<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL038_222_72" id="target_note_LCL038_222_72"><sup>72</sup></a> and under colour of an appointment as governor banished Otho to Lusitania, contenting himself with this through fear that by inflicting a severe punishment he would make the whole farce public; but even as it was, it was published abroad in this couplet:</p>

<p>Accordingly Otho let slip no opportunity for flattery or attention to anyone. Whenever he entertained the prince at dinner, he gave a gold piece to each man of the cohort on guard, and put all the soldiers under obligation in one form or another. Chosen arbiter by a man who was at law with his neighbour about a part of his estate, he bought the whole property and presented it to him. As a result there was hardly anyone who did not both think and openly declare that he alone was worthy to succeed to the empire.</p>
