chanted against that faithless head, and grief and anger play their parts. Give assent all in turn to my desires, and let no part of my supplication fall! And what I pray, may that be done: so that he deem them not my sayings, but the words of the lover of Pasiphae’s daughter.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL232_243_1" id="target_note_LCL232_243_1"><sup>1</sup></a> And whatever penalties I pass by, may he suffer those as well; let him be richer in misery than my wit can conceive! Nor may vows that doom a feigned name to perdition be less strong to harm, or move less powerful gods: that Ibis do I execrate whom the mind understands, who knows that his deeds have merited these curses.

Whosoever thou art that attendest at my rite, suit thy speech thereto;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL232_243_2" id="target_note_LCL232_243_2"><sup>2</sup></a> whosoever thou art that attendest at the rite, utter words of woe, and draw near to Ibis with tear-moistened cheeks; meet him with evil omens and with left feet foremost, and let black raiment hide your bodies!
