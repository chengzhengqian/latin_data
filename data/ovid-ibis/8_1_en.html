neither can I say how many flowers bloom in Sicilian Hybla, nor how many crocuses the Cilician earth doth bear, nor, when the fierce storm quivers upon the wings of the North wind, with how many hailstones Athos is made white; nor can all thy pains be recounted by my speech, though thou give me voices manifold. So many (woe upon thee!) and such destructions shall come on thee, that I ween I too could be compelled to weep. Those tears will make me happy without end; that weeping will be sweeter to me than laughter.</p>
<p>Thou wert born unfortunate (so willed the gods), no star was favourable or kindly at thy birth. Venus shone not, nor Jupiter in that hour, neither moon nor sun were fitly placed, nor did he whom shining Maia bore to mighty Jove set his fires in position to bring thee aught of profit.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL232_251_1" id="target_note_LCL232_251_1"><sup>1</sup></a> The savage star of Mars that promises naught peaceful bore thee down, and the star of the aged wielder of the scythe.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL232_251_2" id="target_note_LCL232_251_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Thy natal day too, that thou mightest see naught save gloom, was foul and black with pall of cloud. This is the day to which in our Annals deadly Allia gives her name,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL232_251_3" id="target_note_LCL232_251_3"><sup>3</sup></a> and the day which brought Ibis to birth, brought destruction to our people. So soon as, fallen from a mother’s impure womb, his unclean body lay on the Cinyphian<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL232_251_4" id="target_note_LCL232_251_4"><sup>4</sup></a> soil, a nocturnal owl sat over against him in a tree-top, and uttered dismal sounds with death-foretelling mouth. Forthwith the Furies washed him in the waters of the mere, where flowed a channel from the Stygian stream, and anointed his breast with poison of a snake of Erebus, and thrice smote their blood-stained hands together.
