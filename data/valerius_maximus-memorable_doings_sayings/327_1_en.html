Informed of his deception, Papirius believed that for himself
and his army a good omen had been given and began
the fray. But he placed the liar right in front of the battle
line, so that the gods might have someone on whose head
to visit their anger, if angry they were. Whether by chance
or the providence of divine power, the first missile discharged
from the opposing side was guided right into the
breast of the chicken keeper and laid him lifeless on the
ground. When the Consul learned of it, he confidently invaded
Aquilonia and took it. So quickly did he perceive

enemy to the other than both to the opposing camp.</p>
<p>When the same two were accused from the rostra by
Tribune of the Plebs Cn. Baebius because of their unduly
