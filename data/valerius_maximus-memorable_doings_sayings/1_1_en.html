<p>I have determined to select from famous authors and
arrange the deeds and sayings worthy of memorial of the
Roman City and external nations, too widely scattered in
other sources to be briefly discovered, to the end that
those wishing to take examples may be spared the labour
of lengthy search. Nor am I seized with ambition to be
all-embracing. Who should comprise the transactions of
all time in a moderate number of volumes? Or who in his
right mind should hope to transmit with closer care or superior
eloquence the procession of domestic and foreign
history recorded by the felicitous pens of predecessors?</p>
<p>Therefore I invoke you to this undertaking, Caesar,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_13_1" id="target_note_LCL492_13_1"><sup>1</sup></a>
surest salvation of the fatherland, in whose charge the
unanimous will of gods and men has placed the governance
of land and sea, by whose celestial providence the
virtues of which I shall tell are most kindly fostered and the
vices most sternly punished. Orators of old rightly began
from Jupiter Best and Greatest, the finest poets took their
start from some deity. My petty self shall betake me to your
goodwill all the more properly in that other divinity is inferred
by opinion whereas yours is seen by present certainty
