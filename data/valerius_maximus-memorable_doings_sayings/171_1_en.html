province of Syria he learned that two sons of his of outstanding
promise had been killed in Egypt by soldiers of
Gabinius. Queen Cleopatra sent him the killers in chains
so that he could take vengeance for his grievous calamity at
will. No greater favour could have been extended to a
mourner. But when offered it, he made grief yield to moderation
