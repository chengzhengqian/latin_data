been held five times by himself and often by his father, his
grandfather, his great-grandfather, and his ancestors, at
elections in which his son was by way of being chosen Consul
by a full consensus, did his resolute best to persuade
the people to give the Fabian clan a holiday from this office
at long last; not that he lacked confidence in his son’s fine
qualities (for he was a man of distinction) but so that the

pay due rewards to the elder Africanus, for they tried to
adorn his signal services with commensurate marks of distinction.
They wished to set up statues to him in the place
of assembly, the rostra, the senate house, finally in the very
sanctuary of Jupiter Best and Greatest; they wished to
place his effigy dressed in triumphal attire close to the
Capitoline couches; they wished to give him a Consulship
to continue through all the years of his life and a Dictatorship
in perpetuity. None of which would he suffer to be
conferred upon him either by popular resolution or by decree
of the senate, thereby showing himself almost as great
a man in refusing honours as in deserving them.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_341_6" id="target_note_LCL492_341_6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
