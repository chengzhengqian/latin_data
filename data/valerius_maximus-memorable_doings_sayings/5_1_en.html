<p>But a pupil of the Chief Virgin Aemilia was freed of all
blame by Vesta’s divine power. For when the fire went out,
she prayed and placed a linen cloth of fine quality which
she was wearing upon the hearth; and suddenly a flame
shot up.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_21_21" id="target_note_LCL492_21_21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>No wonder therefore if the indulgence of the gods has
persisted, ever watchful to augment and protect an imperial
power by which even minor items of religious significance
are seen to be weighed with such scrupulous
care; for never should our community be thought to have
averted its eyes from the most meticulous practice of religious
observances. In which community, when M. Marcellus,
taker first of Clastidium and then of Syracuse, desired
in his fifth Consulship<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_21_22" id="target_note_LCL492_21_22"><sup>22</sup></a> to consecrate a temple to
Honour and Virtue in due discharge of vows taken, he was
obstructed by the College of Pontiffs on the ground that a
single sanctuary could not properly be dedicated to two
deities, arguing that if some prodigy were to occur therein,
it would be impossible to determine to which of the two
an expiatory ceremony should be performed and that it
was not customary to sacrifice to two deities at once, with
certain exceptions. The pontifical admonition resulted in
Marcellus placing images of Honour and Virtue in two different
shrines. Thus neither the authority of so great a man
weighed with the College of Pontiffs nor the additional expense
with Marcellus so as to interfere with due course
and due observance rendered in matters of religion.</p>
