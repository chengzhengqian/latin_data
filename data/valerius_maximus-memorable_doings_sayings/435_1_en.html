<p>See now how violently anger acted in the bosom of the
entire Roman people when by their votes they gave the
dedication of the temple of Mercury to Chief Centurion
M. Plaetorius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_327_7" id="target_note_LCL493_327_7"><sup>7</sup></a> over the heads of the Consuls: Appius because
he had opposed relieving their debt, Servilius because
after taking up their cause he had proved a halfhearted

<p>Anger not only trod command under foot but exercised

them an easy target for looters, ordered the bows and arrows
of the Cretans to be broken and thrown into the river,
and forbade their rations to be given the elephants. By
these actions he indulged his spite but spoiled the glory of
his splendid campaigns and lost the honour of a triumph, a
braver victor over the enemy than over anger.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_327_9" id="target_note_LCL493_327_9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
