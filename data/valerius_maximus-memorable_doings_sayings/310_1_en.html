to the loyalty of those who saved their masters’ lives; for at
that time not life but death was a kindness for Marius.</p>
<p>Equally celebrated is what follows. To avoid falling into
the power of his enemies, C. Gracchus offered his neck for
severance to his slave Philocrates. When the latter had
beheaded him with a swift blow, he thrust the sword, dripping
with his master’s blood, through his own breast.</p>
<p>Others think that his name was Euporus. I make no
dispute about the name, I only admire the strength of the
servant’s fidelity.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_77_3" id="target_note_LCL493_77_3"><sup>3</sup></a> If the nobly born young man had imitated
his ready courage, he would have avoided the pains
ahead thanks to himself, not his slave. As it was, he so managed
it that Philocrates’ dead body made a better showing
than Gracchus’.</p>
<p>A different noble family, different frenzy, but an equal
example of fidelity. When C. Cassius was defeated at the
battle of Philippi, Pindarus, whom he had recently freed,
killed him at his own orders and rescued him from the
insults of his enemies. He then withdrew himself from
the sight of men by voluntary death, so that even Cassius’
body was not found after he was gone. Which of the gods
avenging a most heinous crime tied that hand, which had
flared up to kill the father of his country, with a numbness
such that it lowered itself in trembling to the knees of
Pindarus, lest at the arbitrament of pious victory it pay the
penalty for public parricide as it deserved? Surely, divine
Julius, you then wreaked the vengeance due to your celestial
wounds, forcing your betrayer to go suppliant for ignominious
aid, driven by such agitation of mind that he neither
wished to retain his life nor dared to end it with his
own hand.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_77_4" id="target_note_LCL493_77_4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
