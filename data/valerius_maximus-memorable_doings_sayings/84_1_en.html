<h3><span class="ac">7. Of Military Discipline</span></h3>
<p>I come now to the chief glory and mainstay of Roman
empire, preserved intact and safe up to the present time
with salutary steadfastness, the tenacious bond of military
discipline, in the bosom and protection of which rests our
serene and tranquil state of blessed peace.</p>
<p>P. Cornelius Scipio, to whom the destruction of
Carthage gave his grandfatherâ€™s surname, was sent to
Spain as Consul to beat down the insolent pride of the city
of Numantia, nourished by the fault of previous commanders.
The moment he entered the camp he issued orders
that all items assembled for pleasure be taken away and removed.
For it is established that a great number of pedlars
and sutlers then left the spot along with two thousand
prostitutes. Emptied of this shocking and shameful bilge
water, our army, which shortly before from fear of death
had sullied itself by the conclusion of an unseemly treaty,
now with valour raised and revived burned down and demolished
that bold, high-hearted Numantia, levelling her
with the ground. So the pitiable surrender of Mancinus
became the evidence of military discipline neglected and
the splendid triumph of Scipio the reward of the same
preserved.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_179_1" id="target_note_LCL492_179_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
