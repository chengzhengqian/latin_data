but questionable commendation, since any service
forced by authority redounds to the credit of him who requires
it rather than of him who renders it.</p>
<p>It is also to be recalled that the Tribunes of the Plebs
used not to be allowed to enter the senate house.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_145_14" id="target_note_LCL492_145_14"><sup>14</sup></a> Their
bench was placed in front of the door, and there they examined
the Fathers’ decrees with the greatest care so as not to
allow anything in them of which they disapproved to become
final. So the letter T<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_145_15a" id="target_note_LCL492_145_15a"><sup>15</sup></a> used to be subscribed to ancient
senatorial decrees, which mark indicated that the
Tribunes too had voted in their favour. Although they kept
watch for the interests of the common people and were
busy in holding down magisterial powers, they allowed
them to be furnished with silver vessels and golden rings
publicly provided, so that respect for magistrates be enhanced
by such accessories.</p>
<p>Even as their dignity was amplified, it was kept closely
in check by restraint. The entrails of the victims they
sacrificed were conveyed to the Treasury Quaestors and
sold.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_145_16" id="target_note_LCL492_145_16"><sup>16</sup></a> Thus in the sacrifices of the Roman people the cult
of the immortal gods went along with human continence
and those in command of us learnt at the very altars how
clean they should keep their hands. Such credit was given
for continence that the senate paid the debts of many because
they had administered their provinces incorruptibly.
For they judged it unworthy and discreditable to themselves
that persons through whom public authority had
kept its lustre in far-off places should suffer collapse of
standing at home.</p>

Valerius surely had T, though whether his information on this point is not due to some confusion of his own is another
matter.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL492_145_15a').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL492_145_16"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL492_145_16" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">16</sup>Not recorded elsewhere.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL492_145_16').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
