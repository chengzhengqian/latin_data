for to neglect a chance of successful action is the height of
folly, while to hold back from battle when forced unavoidably
into a tight corner brings an outcome of disastrous
inertia. Of those who make such mistakes, the one does not
know how to use Fortune’s kindness, the other how to
resist her injury.</p>
<p>Q. Metellus too made a speech in the senate not only
impressive but profound after the conquest of Carthage.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_109_3" id="target_note_LCL493_109_3"><sup>3</sup></a>
He affirmed that he knew not whether that victory had
brought more good or more harm to the commonwealth;
by restoring peace it had done good, but by removing
Hannibal it had done some measure of harm. For by his
passage into Italy the dormant energy of the Roman
people had been aroused and it was to be feared that freed
of its fierce rival it would sink again into the same slumber.
Thus he placed the burning of houses, the laying waste of
fields, the exhaustion of the treasury on an equal plane of
evils with the slackening of the sinews of former strength.
And again, how wise that action of L. Fimbria,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_109_4" id="target_note_LCL493_109_4"><sup>4</sup></a> the
Consular! He was assigned as judge to M. Lutatius Pinthia,
a distinguished Roman knight, concerning a wager he had
made with his opponent “that he was a good man.” Fimbria
chose never to end that trial with a pronouncement on his
part. He did not wish to rob a respected personage of reputation
by finding against him nor yet to swear that he was a
good man, that being something dependent on countless
virtues.</p>
<p>That shrewdness was shown in campaigns of the Forum,
what follows in those of the field. Consul Papirius
Cursor was besieging Aquilonia. He wished to join battle
and the keeper of the chickens reported excellent auspices,
though the birds were in fact far from encouraging.
