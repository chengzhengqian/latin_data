From Apollo’s oracle came the response that he
would find the horse but that it would throw him to his
death. As he returned thence in jesting mood, as having
cheated the good faith of holy prophecy, he fell in with king
Attalus, whom he had often provoked in absence with insulting
witticisms. At the king’s orders he was hurled from
a crag named Horse’s,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_121_33" id="target_note_LCL492_121_33"><sup>33</sup></a> thus paying a just penalty for his
mad spirit that did not stop at making mock of the gods.</p>
<p>By the same oracle<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_121_34" id="target_note_LCL492_121_34"><sup>34</sup></a> Philip king of Macedon was
warned to guard his life from the violence of a four-horse
chariot. So he gave orders that all chariots in his realm
be unyoked and he always avoided that place in Boeotia
which is called Chariot.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_121_35" id="target_note_LCL492_121_35"><sup>35</sup></a> Yet he did not escape the kind of
peril foretold. For Pausanias had a chariot engraved on the
hilt of the sword with which he killed the king.</p>
<p>Such obstinate fatality in the father’s case made a similar
showing in the son’s, Alexander’s. For when Callanus
the Indian was about to throw himself voluntarily on a
burning pyre, Alexander asked him whether he had any
commission, anything he wanted to say. “I shall see you
anon,” was the answer. And sure enough Alexander’s swift
death followed hard upon Callanus’ voluntary departure
from life.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_121_36" id="target_note_LCL492_121_36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<p>The fate of a rower equals in magnitude of wonder the
deaths of kings. He was bailing out the bilge in a Tyrian
hexeris when a wave swept him off the ship; but a contrary
wave catching him from the other side carried him back on
board. Thus for this unlucky and lucky being felicitation
mingled with condolence.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_121_37" id="target_note_LCL492_121_37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
