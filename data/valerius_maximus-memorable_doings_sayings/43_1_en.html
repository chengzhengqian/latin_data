realm. For he frustrated himself in trying to impede by human
counsels the good fortune of his grandson, destined as
it was by the decree of the celestials.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_97_23" id="target_note_LCL492_97_23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>While Dionysius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_97_24" id="target_note_LCL492_97_24"><sup>24</sup></a> of Syracuse still held himself in a private
station, a woman of Himera, one of no obscure family,
ascended into heaven, as she thought, in her sleep and
there, as she went round the dwellings of all the gods, saw a
powerfully built man with blond colouring and a freckled
face, bound in steel chains, prostrate below Jupiterâ€™s
throne and feet. On asking the young man who had been
her guide on her heavenly tour who this was, she was told
that he was the dire fate of Sicily and Italy and that once
freed of his bonds he would bring destruction to many cities.
Next day she spread that dream abroad in talk. Then
Fortune, hostile to the liberty of Syracuse and the lives of
the innocent, freed Dionysius from celestial custody and
hurled him like a thunderbolt upon peace and tranquillity.
When the woman saw him entering the walls of Himera
amid a crowd that had turned out to greet and look at him,
she cried out that this was the man she had seen in her
dream. Reported to the tyrant, that gave him cause to do
away with her.</p>

While she was carrying him a child in her womb,
she dreamt she was giving birth to an infant satyr. On consulting
an interpreter of prodigies she was told (with sure
event) that he would be the most famous and powerful of
the Grecian race.</p>
