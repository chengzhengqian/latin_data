Cornelius Scipio Asina, who as Consul was taken prisoner
by the Carthaginians at Lipara. By the laws of war he had
lost all, but aided anon by her more cheerful countenance
he regained everything, and was even elected Consul a
second time. Who would have believed that he would pass
from the twelve axes to Carthaginian chains? Who again
would have thought that he would pass from Punic bonds

by the dire hands of an executioner, was seen lying on the
Gemonian Steps to the great consternation of the whole
Roman Forum.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_91_16" id="target_note_LCL493_91_16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
