for the body of Aemilius Paullus, slain at Cannae, and so
far as lay with himself did not let it lie unburied.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_461_28" id="target_note_LCL492_461_28"><sup>28</sup></a>
Hannibal gave a most honourable burial to Ti. Gracchus
when he had been treacherously ambushed by the
Lucanians and handed over his bones to our soldiers to be
taken to his country.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_461_29" id="target_note_LCL492_461_29"><sup>29</sup></a> Hannibal buried M. Marcellus with
a regular funeral when he was slain in the Bruttian territory
as he reconnoitered the activities of the Carthaginians
with more eagerness than circumspection, and placed him
on the pyre with the gift of a Punic cloak and a golden
wreath.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_461_30" id="target_note_LCL492_461_30"><sup>30</sup></a> Thus the charm of humanity finds its way even
into the savage natures of barbarians, softening the grim,
fierce eyes of foes and inclining the insolent pride of victory.
Nor is it arduous and difficult for humanity to find a
peaceful path amid opposing arms and blades drawn at
close quarters. Humanity conquers anger, lays hatred low,
and mingles enemy blood with enemy tears. She it was who
drew from Hannibal an admirable utterance when he determined
expenses for the burial of the Roman commanders
*** because the burials of Paullus and Gracchus and
Marcellus brought him considerably more glory than their
killings: he tricked them with Punic guile, but honoured
them with Roman mildness. Brave and pious shades, you
too need find no fault with the obsequies that fell to your
lot. You would have prayed to succumb <span class="italic">in</span> your country,
but it was more glorious to die <span class="italic">for</span> her. The honour of the
last rites, lost by evil fortune, you regained by valour.</p>
