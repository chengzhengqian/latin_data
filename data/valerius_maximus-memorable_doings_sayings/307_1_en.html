<p>After the pitiable slaughter of the two Scipios in Spain
and as many armies of Roman race,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_71_7" id="target_note_LCL493_71_7"><sup>7</sup></a> the Saguntines were
driven by Hannibal’s victorious arms inside the walls of
their city. Unable to fend off the Punic power any longer,
they collected into their forum all that each one of them
held dearest and set inflammable substances around and
ignited them. Then, rather than defect from our alliance,
they threw themselves on top of the public and communal
pyre.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_71_8" id="target_note_LCL493_71_8"><sup>8</sup></a> I could believe that Faith herself on that occasion
watching the affairs of men wore a face of sorrow as she
saw her most persevering cult condemned by judgment of
unkind Fortune in so bitter an outcome.</p>
<p>By the same performance the people of Petelia earned
a like honourable acclaim. Invested by Hannibal because
they refused to defect from our friendship, they sent envoys
to the senate appealing for help. Because of the recent
disaster at Cannae none could be given them. But
they were authorized to do whatever they thought most
expedient for their own safety, so they were free to embrace
the favour of the Carthaginians. Instead, they emptied
the town of women and all who were not of fighting
age so that the men in arms could draw out their hunger
the longer, and obstinately stood on their walls, so that
their entire community perished before in any way discarding
its respect for the Roman alliance. So Hannibal
succeeded in taking, not Petelia, but Petelia’s faithful
tomb.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_71_9" id="target_note_LCL493_71_9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
