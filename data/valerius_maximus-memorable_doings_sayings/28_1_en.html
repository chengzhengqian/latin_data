the oracular instruction, according to which the Romans
were to spread the water let out by the lake over the countryside;
for so would Veii come under the power of the Roman
people. Before the envoys brought back their report,
a Veientian soothsayer, who had been seized by one of
our soldiers because Roman interpreters were lacking and
brought to the camp, had foretold how it would be. So the
senate, admonished by the double prediction, almost simultaneously
obeyed religion and gained possession of the

<p>Nor the did the following fail of a prosperous outcome.
Consul L. Sulla was performing a sacrifice in front of his
headquarters in the territory of Nola during the Social War
when he saw a snake suddenly glide forward from the lowest
part of the altar. After sight of it and at the urging of

occurred in our city in the Consulship of C. Volumnius and
Ser. Sulpicius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_67_5" id="target_note_LCL492_67_5"><sup>5</sup></a> in the first stirrings of wars. An ox changed
his lowing into human speech, terrifying hearers with the
novelty of the monstrous thing. Portions of flesh fell scattered
like a rain shower. Most of them were torn to shreds
by birds flying straight ahead (?); the rest lay on the ground
for several days unchanged, neither evil-smelling nor hideous
to look upon.</p>
