<p>The same community stubbornly renewed the fight a
number of times but finally, buffeted by battles that always
went against them, they were forced to surrender to Consul
Q. Lutatius. The Roman people wished to take violent
measures against them, but were instructed by Papirius,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_55_3" id="target_note_LCL493_55_3"><sup>3</sup></a>
by whose hand the words of the surrender were written at
