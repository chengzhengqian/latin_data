<p>Old age too carried to its furthest term has been viewed
in this same work among examples of diligence in a number

make himself more cheerful by contemplation of ancient
felicity. And let confidence ever and anon confirm the tranquillity
of our epoch, than which there never was a happier,
by prolonging the safety of our leader and saviour to the
longest limits allowed to the human condition.</p>

but also to the most thorough cultivation of his land:
an enviable example of both citizen and paterfamilias.</p>
