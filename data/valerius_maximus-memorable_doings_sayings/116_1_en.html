held and the priesthoods to which they had attained, so
that in their deaths they retained the splendour and ornaments
of their past lives and set the common folk an example
of how to bear their fates. At first the enemy revered
their aspect, impressed by the novelty, the magnificent attire,
and the very audacity. But who could doubt that Gauls
and victors would presently turn their amazement into ridicule
and every sort of insult? So C. Atilius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_243_11" id="target_note_LCL492_243_11"><sup>11</sup></a> did not wait
for such ripeness of outrage but brought his staff with a
vigorous blow down on the head of a Gaul who was stroking
his beard, and as the pain made the man rush to kill
him, eagerly offered his body. So valour knows no captivity,
ignores dishonourable patience, thinks submission to
Fortune worse than any fate, invents new and spectacular
ways to perish, if any man perish who is extinguished thus.</p>
<p>Now a due badge of glory must be rendered to Romeâ€™s
young warriors. When Consul C. Sempronius Atratinus
was unsuccessfully battling with the Volsci at Verrugo, to
save our line, already yielding, from rout, they dismounted
from their horses, arranged themselves in centuries, and
dashed into the enemy host. Dividing it, they occupied an
adjoining height and drew upon themselves the full onset
of the Volsci, thus giving our legions a saving respite in
which to recover their morale. And so, when they<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_243_12" id="target_note_LCL492_243_12"><sup>12</sup></a> were
already thinking of setting up trophies, night ended the
battle and they withdrew, uncertain whether they were
leaving as victors or as vanquished.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_243_13" id="target_note_LCL492_243_13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
