away from Rome, the might of the Gauls and Ligurians
brought under his control, the Alpine ridges laid open by
an unprecedented crossing, Lake Trasimene burned on
dire memory, Cannae the most famous memorial of Punic
victory, Capua occupied, Italy lacerated. He did not brook
calmly that his glory attested in long trial should yield to
the liver of a single victim. And in truth, if it came to exploring
war’s stratagems and estimating military leadership,
Hannibal’s brain would have outweighed all the braziers
and all the altars of Bithynia, let Mars himself be
judge.</p>
<p>This saying too of king Cotys housed a noble spirit.
Learning that the Athenians had given him their citizenship,
“I too,” he said, “will give them the franchise of my
nation.” He levelled Thrace with Athens, unwilling that by
judging the former unequal to the reciprocation of such a
boon he might be supposed to think meanly of his origin.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_317_36" id="target_note_LCL492_317_36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<p>Excellently too spoke two Spartans. One, being reproved
by somebody because he was going into battle
lame, replied that his intention was to fight, not to run
away.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_317_37" id="target_note_LCL492_317_37"><sup>37</sup></a> The other, when he was told that the Persian arrows
eclipsed the sun, said “Good, we shall fight in the
shade then.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_317_38" id="target_note_LCL492_317_38"><sup>38</sup></a> Of the same city and the same spirit was he
who said to his host who was showing him the wide and
lofty walls of his own town: “Fine, if you built them for
women; shameful, if for men.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_317_39" id="target_note_LCL492_317_39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
