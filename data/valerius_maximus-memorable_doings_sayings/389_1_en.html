view to bringing forward his own intellectual resources
with more concentration and rebutting those of Chrysippus
with greater vigour. What draughts did Diligence
make attractive to men anxious for true glory!</p>
<p>With what enthusiasm moreover do we suppose Anaxagoras
burned! Returning to his country after a long
absence abroad and seeing that his holdings had been
deserted, he said, “I should not be alive if these had not
perished.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_235_19" id="target_note_LCL493_235_19"><sup>19</sup></a> A saying possessed of the wisdom he sought.
For if he had spent his time cultivating his estates rather
than his mind, he would have stayed among his household
gods master of his property and would not have come back
to them the great Anaxagoras.</p>
<p>I should say that Archimedes’ diligence also bore fruit
if it had not both given him life and taken it away. At the
capture of Syracuse Marcellus had been aware that his
victory had been held up much and long by Archimedes’
machines. However, pleased with the man’s exceptional
skill, he gave out that his life was to be spared, putting almost
as much glory in saving Archimedes as in crushing
Syracuse. But as Archimedes was drawing diagrams with
mind and eyes fixed on the ground, a soldier who had
broken into the house in quest of loot with sword drawn
over his head asked him who he was. Too much absorbed
in tracking down his objective, Archimedes could not give
his name but said, protecting the dust with his hands, “I
beg you, don’t disturb this,” and was slaughtered as neglectful
of the victor’s command; with his blood he confused
the lines of his art. So it fell out that he was first
granted his life and then stripped of it by reason of the
same pursuit.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_235_20" id="target_note_LCL493_235_20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
