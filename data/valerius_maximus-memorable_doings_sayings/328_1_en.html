<p>The following is equally an example of the senate’s wisdom.
It punished with death Tribune of the Plebs Ti. Gracchus,
who had dared to promulgate an agrarian law. The
same senate commendably voted that land be divided individually
among the people by a Board of Three according

deserving ally and thrust away from its own doors Mauritania
and Numidia and the other nations of that region,
whose savagery never rested in a trustworthy peace.</p>

our empire takes its increase and maintenance from vigour
of mind rather than strength of body. So let Roman

and access given to alien-born instances of this kind.
Socrates, a sort of earthly oracle of human wisdom,
thought that we should ask nothing of the immortal gods
except that they give us good, because only they know what
is expedient for each individual, whereas we often seek
with vows something that were better not granted us.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_113_10" id="target_note_LCL493_113_10"><sup>10</sup></a> For
