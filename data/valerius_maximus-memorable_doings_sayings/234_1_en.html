be more unfitting than the necessity, more just than the
complaint, more moderate than the reprisal? He denied
his ashes to her whom he had not let collapse into ash. This
therefore was the only vengeance of Scipio’s felt by the ungrateful
city of Rome, a greater in truth than Coriolanus’
violence. He struck his country with terror, Scipio with
shame. He did not even bear to complain of her (such is
the resolution of true piety) until after his death.</p>
<p>Suffering as he did, I imagine<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_479_4" id="target_note_LCL492_479_4"><sup>4</sup></a> that what befell his
brother could have come to him as a consolation. The defeat
of king Antiochus, the addition of Asia to the empire of
the Roman people, and a most glorious triumph gave an
excuse to charge him with peculation and order him to

his death’s avenger in the Forum.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_479_6" id="target_note_LCL492_479_6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>Who is ignorant that Scipio Nasica earned as much
glory with the gown as either Africanus with their arms?
He did not allow the commonwealth to be strangled when
the murderous hand of Ti. Gracchus was at her throat.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_479_7" id="target_note_LCL492_479_7"><sup>7</sup></a> But
he too met with a grossly unjust appreciation of his merits
among his countrymen. Therefore under the pretext of a
commission he withdrew to Pergamus and there passed
the rest of his life<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_479_8" id="target_note_LCL492_479_8"><sup>8</sup></a> without any regret for his ungrateful
