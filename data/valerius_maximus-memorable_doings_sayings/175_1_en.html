<h3><span class="ac">2. Of Those Who From Enmity
Were Joined in Friendship
or Connection</span></h3>
<p>Since moderation has been illustrated by many famous
sponsors, let us pass to the admirable deflexion of the human
mind from hate to favour, and pursue it with rejoicing
pen. When the sea turns from rough to calm or the sky
from cloudy to clear, we perceive it with cheerful faces.
War changed to peace brings great happiness. So the putting
aside of bitter offence is to be celebrated in benevolent
recital.</p>
<p>M. Aemilius Lepidus, twice Consul and Chief Pontiff,
whose dignity of life matched the splendour of his offices,
maintained a violent enmity of long standing with Fulvius
Flaccus, a personage of the same high status. But when
they were elected Censors at the same time, he laid aside
their quarrel on the Campus, finding it improper for persons
joined publicly in the highest authority to be at odds
in private hostilities.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_361_1" id="target_note_LCL492_361_1"><sup>1</sup></a> This judgment of his was approved
by contemporaries,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_361_2" id="target_note_LCL492_361_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and the old writers of annals have
handed it down to us for commendation.</p>
<p>Just as they were unwilling that Livius Salinator’s
famous decision to end a feud should be unknown to posterity.
