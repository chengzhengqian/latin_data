<p>But since foreign notabilities can be taken into account
without derogation to the majesty of Rome, we shall pass

auditors that they held it a sin to make what they heard
from him a subject of debate. They even, when challenged
to give a reason, would answer only this, that <span class="italic">he</span> had said it.
A great honour, but extending no further than the school;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_289_21" id="target_note_LCL493_289_21"><sup>21</sup></a>
the following was paid by the votes of cities. The people of
Croton pressingly requested him to allow their senate,
numbering a thousand men, to avail itself of his advice; and
the very thriving community of Metapontus, which had
venerated him in his lifetime, made his house a shrine of
Ceres after his death. As long as the city flourished, the
goddess was worshipped in the remembrance of the man
and the man in the religious observance of the goddess.</p>
<p>Gorgias of Leontini was ahead of all his contemporaries

solid gold in the temple of Delphic Apollo, although up to
that time it had placed gilded statues of other men.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_289_23" id="target_note_LCL493_289_23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>The same nation laid itself out with the greatest unanimity
to honour Amphiaraus, converting his burial place
into the form and function of a temple and instituting the
taking of oracles therefrom.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_289_24" id="target_note_LCL493_289_24"><sup>24</sup></a> His ashes have the same
honour as is given to the Pythian tripod, the cauldron at
Dodona, and the fountain of Hammon.</p>
