do it, since as you yourself proclaim, the terms were that

<p>The following too was quite shrewdly done. A certain
person in Athens, who was universally disliked, was to
plead his case before the people on a capital charge. He
suddenly set up as a candidate for a very high office, not
because he hoped he could get it, but to give people a
means of discharging their first rush of anger, which is generally
the most violent. Nor did this cunning calculation let
him down. At the election he was assailed with hostile
shouts and frequent hisses from the whole assembly and
wounded with the stigma of office denied. A little later,
when his life was at stake, he found the votes of the same
populace most merciful. But if he had put his mortal danger
before them as they were still thirsting for vengeance,
ears stopped by hatred would have admitted no part of his
defence.</p>
<p>This stratagem is paralleled by the following piece of
cunning. An earlier Hannibal, defeated by Consul Duilius
in a naval battle, was afraid he would be punished for losing
his fleet and turned the resentment aside with a wonderful
stroke of cleverness. Before a report of the disaster
reached home from that unlucky battle, he sent one of his
friends, properly set up and primed, to Carthage. On entering
the senate of that community, the emissary said:
“Hannibal wants your advice. When the Roman commander
arrives bringing a large naval force along with him,
ought he to join battle?” The entire senate cried out that he
certainly ought. Then said the messenger: “He did join
