<p>Nothing too could be wiser than an action of Agesilaus.
Learning one night that a conspiracy was afoot against
the Lacedaemonian commonwealth, he immediately abrogated
the laws of Lycurgus which forbade the taking of
punitive measures against persons not convicted of offence.
Then, having arrested and executed the guilty, he
