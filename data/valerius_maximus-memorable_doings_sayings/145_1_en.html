so full of confidence he beat down the minds of the enemy
before their arms.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_301_6" id="target_note_LCL492_301_6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>To come, however, to his domestic acts of exceptional
confidence, when L. Scipio was called upon in the senate
house for an account of four million sesterces, part of the
money from Antiochus, he produced a ledger of sums received
and paid from which the hostile accusation could
have been disproved. Africanus tore it up in indignation
that a matter which had been supervised by himself as Legate
should be called in question. Moreover he spoke as
follows: “Conscript Fathers, I am not rendering to your
treasury as the servant of another man’s authority an account
of four million sesterces, a treasury which by my
leadership and auspices I made richer by two hundred million.
For I do not think malignity has reached such a pitch
that my innocence needs investigation. For when I subjected
all Africa to your power, I brought nothing back
to be called mine except a surname. So I was not made
greedy by Punic treasures nor my brother by those of Asia,
but each of us is richer by envy than by money.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_301_7" id="target_note_LCL492_301_7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>The entire senate approved Scipio’s resolute defence,
as they did another act of his. When need arose to withdraw
money from the treasury for a necessary public purpose
and the Quaestors did not dare to open it because
the law seemed to stand in the way, Scipio as a private
citizen demanded the keys and opened up the treasury,
compelling law to yield to utility. The consciousness that
in his memory he had kept all the laws gave him that
confidence.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_301_8" id="target_note_LCL492_301_8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
