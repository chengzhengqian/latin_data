and the following story will be no small argument in
support of that opinion. Phryne, a celebrated courtesan in
Athens, lay at an all-night revel by his side when he was
heavy with wine, having made a wager with some young
men that she would be able to seduce his temperance. He
did not rebuff her either with touch or words, but let her
stay in his arms as long as she wished and then let her go
foiled of her purpose. An abstemious act of a mind steeped

the king wanted to buy the philosopher’s friendship, but
the philosopher did not want to sell it to the king.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_383_24" id="target_note_LCL492_383_24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>Alexander had won the surname “undefeated” but he
