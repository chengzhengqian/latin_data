leaving time to study the teachings of Chrysippus by day,
and instructing your pupils with the closest care until your
ninety-ninth year.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_239_24" id="target_note_LCL493_239_24"><sup>24</sup></a> For you occupied the space of one
century in a double labour, making it doubtful whether you
deserved more praise as pupil or as teacher.</p>
<p>Sophocles too had a glorious contest with the Nature of
Things, producing his marvellous works for her as unstintingly
as she generously provided the time to compose
them. For he almost attained his century, writing
“Oedipus at Colonus” just at the point of passing from life
to death; a play by which in itself he was able to preempt
the glory of all poets in the same genre. Sophocles’ son
Iophon did not wish posterity to be ignorant of this, engraving
what I have related on his father’s tomb.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_239_25" id="target_note_LCL493_239_25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p>The poet Simonides himself boasts that in his eightieth
year he taught his poems and personally attended the
competitions.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_239_26" id="target_note_LCL493_239_26"><sup>26</sup></a> Nor was it unfair that he should long take
pleasure in his genius since he was to hand it on for the
enjoyment of all time.</p>
<p>With what diligence Solon was inspired, he put into the
verses in which he tells us that he grew old learning something
every day,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_239_27" id="target_note_LCL493_239_27"><sup>27</sup></a> and he confirmed it on the last day of his
life. His friends who were sitting by his side were talking
about some matter among themselves, when he raised a
head already weighed down by the fates. Asked why he did
so he replied: “So that as soon as I find out what you are discussing,
whatever it is, I may die.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_239_28" id="target_note_LCL493_239_28"><sup>28</sup></a> Surely sluggishness
would have departed from men if they had entered life in
the same spirit as Solon left it.</p>
