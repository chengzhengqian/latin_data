colleague of the elder Cato<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_545_3" id="target_note_LCL492_545_3"><sup>3</sup></a> in the Consulship, lost a most
dutiful and promising son, and (no small addition to the calamity)
an only one. Although he saw himself undermined
and overturned by the death, he so restrained his grief by
profundity of counsel that he went straight from the young
man’s pyre to the senate house and convoked the senate,
which he was legally due to hold that day. Had he not
known how to bear grief bravely, he would not have been
able to divide the light of a single day between afflicted
father and conscientious Consul without failing in duty on
either side.</p>

<p>Pericles, the leading man in Athens, was robbed within
the space of four days of two wonderful young sons. In the
course of those very days he addressed a meeting with a
countenance that showed no change and speech quite unimpaired.
He even bore to wear a garland on his head in
the customary style, so that he detracted nothing from ancient
practice because of his domestic hurt.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_545_4" id="target_note_LCL492_545_4"><sup>4</sup></a> Not without
reason, therefore, did a mind of such strength rise to the
surname of “The Olympian.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_545_5" id="target_note_LCL492_545_5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>Xenophon, who for abundant and happy eloquence is
the next step to Plato so far as the Socratic school is concerned,
was conducting a regular sacrifice when he
learned that the elder of his two sons, Gryllus by name, had
fallen in battle at Mantinea. He did not think that the worship
of the gods, already begun, should be left off on that
account, but was content merely to doff his garland. But
even that garland he replaced on his head when he heard,
on asking how his son had died, that he had been killed
