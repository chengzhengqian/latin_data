was sacrificing at the altar. But in pursuit of his brave and
patriotic undertaking he was overpowered; nor did he conceal
the reason for his presence, but with marvellous fortitude
declared his contempt for torture. Hating his right
hand, as I suppose, because he had been unable to use its
service in the slaughter of the king, he laid it on a brazier
and let it be consumed by fire. Surely the immortal gods
never watched worship brought to their altars with more
attentive eyes. He made Porsenna himself forget his danger
and turn his vengeance to admiration. “Return to your
people, Mucius,” he said, “and tell them that though you
sought my life, I granted you yours.” Mucius gave no adulation
to his clemency, more sorry for Porsenna’s survival
than happy for his own. With the eternally glorious surname
of Scaevola he restored himself to Rome.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_273_1" id="target_note_LCL492_273_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

course of duty as an envoy he was captured by king Gentius
and told to betray the counsels of the senate. Putting his
finger to a burning lamp he let it be consumed and by that
fortitude both made the king despair of learning anything
from him by means of torture and inspired him with a great
desire to seek the friendship of the Roman people.</p>
<p>And lest by probing too often for further examples of
this sort at home I be forced to advance into the abominable
memory of the civil wars, I shall content myself with
my two Roman examples, which bring credit to very illustrious
