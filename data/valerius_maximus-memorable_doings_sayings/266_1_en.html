he heard that his son was dead. He neither took his hand
from the post, lest he interrupt the dedication of so great a

<p>Aemilius Paullus is the most famous model of a very
happy father suddenly turned very miserable. Of his four
sons he transferred two, both of them remarkably handsome
and outstandingly gifted, to the Cornelian and Fabian
clans by right of adoption, thus denying them to himself.
