<p>Censor Q. Fulvius Flaccus too expelled Fulvius, his
brother and coheritor,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_183_5" id="target_note_LCL492_183_5"><sup>5</sup></a> from the senate because he had
dared to send home the legion in which he was Military
Tribune without the Consul’s orders.</p>
<p>These examples did not deserve so brief a treatment
were I not under pressure from others more important.
For what harder to do than to pronounce upon a bond of
common heritage and family masks an ignominious return
to country, or to inflict humiliating lashes of rods upon a
shared name and family linked by a line of ancient kinship,
or to unsheath the censorial frown against brotherly
affection?</p>
<p>Give any one of these to communities no matter how
famous and they will seem amply furnished with the glory
of military discipline. But our city, that has filled the
entire globe with every kind of marvellous examples, received
from camp axes streaming with commanders’ own
blood, shed lest punishment be wanting for disturbance of
good military order, axes publicly shining, privately lugubrious;
received them with dubious countenance, uncertain
which duty to perform first, congratulation or condolence.
Therefore I too, Postumius Tubertus and Manlius
Torquatus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_183_6a" id="target_note_LCL492_183_6a"><sup>6</sup></a> strictest guardians of warlike concerns, feel
hesitation as I include you in memorial narrative, because
I perceive that overwhelmed by the weight of the glory you
have deserved I shall reveal the insufficiency of my abilities
