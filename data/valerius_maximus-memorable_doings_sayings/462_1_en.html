very comparison how much not only braver but wiser is
sometimes the desire for death than for life.</p>
<p>M’. Aquillius could have died for himself gloriously; instead
he preferred to be a slave to Mithridates shamefully.
Might he not deservedly be said to be more worthy of
Pontic execution than of Roman authority, since by his behaviour
he caused a private reproach to become a public
scandal?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_381_1" id="target_note_LCL493_381_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Cn. Carbo too is a great embarrassment to Latium’s
annals. In his third Consulship he was led to execution
in Sicily by Pompey’s orders. Abjectly and tearfully he
begged the soldiers to let him relieve himself before he
died, so that he might longer enjoy his miserable daylight,
and he dragged out the delay until his head was cut off as
he sat in the squalid place.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_381_2" id="target_note_LCL493_381_2"><sup>2</sup></a> As I narrate such a disgrace my
very words are at odds with themselves, not partial to
silence because they do not deserve to be hidden nor easy
with the narrative because they are revolting in the utterance.</p>
<p>Again: at what price of dishonour did D. Brutus buy a
meagre and miserable moment of life! Arrested by Furius,
whom Antony had sent to kill him, he not only pulled his
neck away from the sword but when told to present it more
steadily swore in these very words, “On my life, I’ll give
it.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_381_3" id="target_note_LCL493_381_3"><sup>3</sup></a> What a wretched postponement of fate! What a stupid
oath-backed guarantee! But the immoderate sweetness of
continuing to breathe prompts such follies, driving out the
measure of sane reason, which tells us to love life but not to
fear death.</p>
