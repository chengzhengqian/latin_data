<p>For five hundred and fifty-eight years the senate attended
the spectacle of the games mingled with the people.
That practice was brought to an end by the Aediles
Atilius Serranus and L. Scribonius when they put on games
in honour of the Mother of the Gods.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_153_5" id="target_note_LCL492_153_5"><sup>5</sup></a> Following the advice
of the younger Africanus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_153_6" id="target_note_LCL492_153_6"><sup>6</sup></a> they separated the places
of senate and people, a step which offended the populace
and dealt a severe blow to Scipio’s popularity.</p>
<p>Now let me recall from the beginning the reason why
games were instituted. In the Consulship of C. Sulpicius
Peticus and C. Licinius Stolo<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_153_7" id="target_note_LCL492_153_7"><sup>7</sup></a> a pestilence broke out with
insupportable violence, calling our community away from
military activities and crushing it with care for an internal
mischief. And now it appeared that more help was to be
found in a carefully chosen new religious practice than in
any human device. So the people, who hitherto had been
content with the circus show first put on by Romulus under
the name of Consualia after the rape of the Sabine virgins,
now lent vacant<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_153_8" id="target_note_LCL492_153_8"><sup>8</sup></a> ears to poems composed to placate celestial
power. But as it is the way of mankind to follow up
small beginnings with zealous persistence, the young men
added to the worshipping words addressed to the gods
playful gestures with rude and clumsy body movements,
and that gave rise to the summoning of a dancer from
Etruria. His graceful agility, after the ancient manner of
the Curetes and Lydians from whom the Tuscans drew
their origin, charmed the eyes of the Romans with its
welcome novelty; and because a dancer was called “ister”
in Etruria, the name of “histriones” was given to actors.
