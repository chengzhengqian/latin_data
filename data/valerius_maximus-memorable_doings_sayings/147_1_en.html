of a saying that expressed his confident spirit? The
price of corn was on the rise and Tribune of the Plebs C.
Curiatius brought the Consuls before a public meeting
and urged them to make a motion in the senate about buying
grain and sending envoys to arrange the matter. Nasica
began to speak in a contrary sense, in order to obstruct this
highly inexpedient course of action. Then, when the people
shouted in protest, he said: “Be silent, citizens, if you
please. I understand better than you what is for the public
good.” When they heard that, all fell reverently silent, paying
more regard to his authority than to their own nutriment.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_305_12" id="target_note_LCL492_305_12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>Livius Salinator’s spirit too should be handed down to
eternal memory. When he had destroyed Hasdrubal and
an army of Carthaginians in Umbria, he was told that Gauls

<p>That was ready courage in war, this in peace, but no less
praiseworthy, exhibited in the senate by Consul P. Furius
Philus.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_305_14" id="target_note_LCL492_305_14"><sup>14</sup></a> When Q. Metellus and Q. Pompeius, men of consular
rank and his bitter enemies, kept taxing him with
greedy eagerness to set out for Spain, his allotted province,
he obliged them to go with him as his Legates. Confidence
not only brave but well-nigh rash, that dared to gird his
flanks with two violent animosities and actually sought
from the midst of enemies the use of a service not without
risk even among friends!<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_305_15" id="target_note_LCL492_305_15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
