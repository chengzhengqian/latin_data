<p>How diligent moreover was Themistocles! Preoccupied
as he was with attention to matters of the greatest importance,
he nonetheless embraced in his memory the
names of all his fellow citizens.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_241_29" id="target_note_LCL493_241_29"><sup>29</sup></a> Driven by a gross injustice
from his country, he was forced to go for refuge to
