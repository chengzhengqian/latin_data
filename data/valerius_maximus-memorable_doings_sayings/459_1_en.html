P. Rupilius in Henna, a bandit stronghold which we had
captured. When asked about the strength and enterprises
of the runaways, he took some time to collect himself, then
covered his head, fell on his knees, and stopped his breath;
so in the very hands of his guards and in the presence of
highest command he found rest in the security for which

bosom. And indeed that blessing is not worth too much
effort to retain, whose fragile possession could slip away at
