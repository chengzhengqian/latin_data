loud clamour and excited threats of the assembly could not
be forced to sponsor the public insanity. Barred by his opposition
from proceeding by the path of law,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_333_17" id="target_note_LCL492_333_17"><sup>17</sup></a> they persisted
in polluting their hands with the wrongful blood
of the commanders. Nor was Socrates afraid that his death
would make an eleventh madness of his frantic country.</p>
<p>What comes next does not have the same reclame but
can be considered an equally sure test of resolution.
Ephialtes,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_333_18" id="target_note_LCL492_333_18"><sup>18</sup></a> an effective attorney of acknowledged integrity,
was made public prosecutor and obliged to lay charges
against Demostratus among others, whose son Demochares,
a singularly handsome boy, lodged in Ephialtes’
heart with a passionate fondness. Thus by the lottery of
public office a ferocious prosecutor but by circumstance of
private feeling a pitiable defendant, he could not bring
himself to repulse the boy when he came to beg him to
bear lightly on the charges against the father nor yet to look
at him as he fell in supplication at his knees, but with covered
head, weeping and groaning, let him set forth
his entreaties. None the less he prosecuted Demostratus
in good faith and secured a conviction; a victory whether
gained with more glory than torment I know not. For
before crushing the guilty man, Ephialtes conquered
himself.</p>
<p>Him Dio of Syracuse outweighs in the austerity<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_333_19" id="target_note_LCL492_333_19"><sup>19</sup></a> of his
example. He was warned by certain persons to be more
on his guard against Heraclides and Callippus, whom he
trusted implicitly, as spinning plots against him. He replied
that he would rather take leave of life than put friends on a
level with foes in fear of a violent death.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_333_20" id="target_note_LCL492_333_20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
