the fighting Romans. Such was Punic bravery,
equipped with tricks and treacheries and deceit. That is
now the surest excuse for our hoodwinked valour, since we
were deceived rather than vanquished.</p>
<h3><span class="ac">5. Of Electoral Defeats</span></h3>
<p>A presentation of what happens on the Campus will be
a useful preparation for those entering on the path of public
office. It will help them bear adverse election results
with more fortitude, for when rejections of men of great
renown are placed in front of them, they will seek offices
not with less hope but with shrewder judgment. They will
bear in mind that there is no sin in the denial of something
to an individual by the community, since individuals have
often thought it right to resist the wishes of the generality.
They will know too that what cannot be won by favour
should be sought by patience.</p>
<p>Q. Aelius Tubero was asked by Q. Fabius Maximus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_157_1" id="target_note_LCL493_157_1"><sup>1</sup></a>
who was giving a feast to the people in the name of his uncle
P. Africanus, to fit out a dining room. He spread Punic
couches with goatskins and put out Samian utensils instead
of silver. This shabby proceeding gave such offence that although
he otherwise passed for an excellent person and
went down to the Campus as a candidate at the praetorian
elections relying on his grandfather L. Paullus and his maternal
uncle P. Africanus, he left it with the stigma of rejection.
For while they always approved of private frugality,
publicly they set much store on a handsome show. So the
city felt that its whole entity, not just the complement of
one dinner party, had lain on those skins and by its votes
took its revenge for the shame of the banquet.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_157_2" id="target_note_LCL493_157_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
