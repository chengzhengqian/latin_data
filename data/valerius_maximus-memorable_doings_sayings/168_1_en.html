which the immortal gods were asked to make the state of
the Roman people better and greater, “It is good and great
enough,” said Scipio. “So I pray the gods to keep it safe in
perpetuity.” And on the words he gave order that the formula
in the public tables be emended accordingly.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_307_11" id="target_note_LCL492_307_11"><sup>11</sup></a> From
that time on Censors have used this modest form of prayer
in winding up censuses. For he wisely realized that increase
for Roman empire was to be asked for in the days
when triumphs were sought on the near side of the seventh
milestone, but for a people that possessed the greater part
of the whole globe it would be greedy to ask for more and
abundantly fortunate if they lost nothing of what was
already theirs.</p>
<p>Nor did his censorial moderation show itself less clearly
on his tribunal. In reviewing the centuries of knights, he
observed C. Licinius Sacerdos come forward as his name
was called and said that he knew him to have committed
perjury in set terms; therefore if anyone wished to charge
him, his, Scipio’s, testimony would be at his disposal. But
when nobody took the matter up, “Lead your horse across,
Sacerdos,” he said, “and go free of the censorial stigma.
For I must not seem to have played the role of prosecutor
cum witness cum jury in your particular.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_347_12" id="target_note_LCL492_347_12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>This mental balance was also noted in the excellent Q.
Scaevola.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_347_13" id="target_note_LCL492_347_13"><sup>13</sup></a> Brought forward as a witness against a defendant,
he gave an answer which seemed likely to be highly
prejudicial to the prospects of the accused. But as he left
he added that he should be believed only if others made
the same assertion, since for anyone to be convicted on the
evidence of a single witness would be a very bad precedent.
