An ungrateful freedman convicted by his former master
is stripped of his right of freedom.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_169_8" id="target_note_LCL492_169_8"><sup>8</sup></a> “I cease,” says she,
“to consider you a citizen, the undutiful appraiser of so
great a boon, neither can I be persuaded to believe you of
use to the city whom I perceive to be a villain to your
house. Get you gone then, and be a slave, since you did not
know how to be free.”</p>
<p>The Massilians<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_169_9" id="target_note_LCL492_169_9"><sup>9</sup></a> also to this day practice this same; especially
remarkable as they are for gravity of discipline and
observance of ancient custom and devotion to the Roman
people. They allow three revocations of a manumission in
the same individual if they find that he disappointed his
master three times. They do not think it proper to come to
the rescue of a fourth mistake, since one who exposed himself
so often to injury suffered it by his own fault.</p>
<p>The same community is a most strict guardian of morals,
not allowing mimes access to the stage, as their themes
for the most part involve the enactment of illicit intercourse,
lest the habit of watching such things take licence
to imitate them. It closes its gates to all who by some pretence
of religion seek sustenance for sloth, holding that
false and fraudulent superstition should be ousted.</p>
<p>Also, from the foundation of the city there is a sword
therein to kill the guilty. It is eroded by rust and scarcely
adequate to its function, but a sign that even in the smallest
details the monuments of ancient custom are to be preserved.</p>
<p>Also two coffins lie before their gates. In one the bodies
of freemen, in the other of slaves are carried in a cart to
the place of burial without wailing or breast-beating.
