any man of them who made back for camp in flight should
be killed as an enemy. Daunted by such severity, the soldiers,
though their bodies were weary and their minds
seized with despair of life, yet overcame the adversity of
the ground and the number of the enemy. Thus the most
effective hardener of human weakness is necessity.</p>
<p>In the same province Q. Fabius Maximus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_191_12" id="target_note_LCL492_191_12"><sup>12</sup></a> desiring to
crush and enfeeble the spirit of a fierce people, forced his
most merciful nature into severity somewhat cruel, laying
clemency aside for the time being. For he cut off the hands
of all who had deserted from the Roman ranks to the enemy
and been taken prisoner, so that bearing their mutilated
arms before them they should strike fear of defection
into the rest. So the renegade hands torn free from their
bodies and scattered on the bloody ground were a warning
to others not to dare to make the same mistake.</p>
<p>The elder Africanus was the mildest of men. Yet for the
confirmation of military discipline he thought proper to
borrow some harshness from a cruelty quite alien to himself.
When he had conquered Carthage and brought into
his power all those who had deserted from our armies to
the Carthaginians, he punished the Roman deserters more
severely than the Latins, crucifying the former as runaways
from their country and beheading the latter as faithless
allies.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_191_13" id="target_note_LCL492_191_13"><sup>13</sup></a> I shall not pursue this action farther, both because
it is Scipioâ€™s and because there is no need to insult
Roman blood that suffered the punishment of slaves, however
well deserved, especially as I am free to pass to doings
which can be narrated without injury to national sentiment.</p>
