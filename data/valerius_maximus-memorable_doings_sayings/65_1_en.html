the studies of M. Cicero.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_141_7" id="target_note_LCL492_141_7"><sup>7</sup></a> For we know that he before
any other of foreign nationality was heard in the senate
without an interpreter. Nor was he undeserving of the honour,
since he had aided Roman eloquence at its highest
power. Conspicuous was the good fortune of the township
of Arpinum, whether we choose to look at the most glorious
scorner of letters or their most abounding fountain.</p>
<p>Our ancestors maintained with the utmost care the custom
that no man should interpose himself between a Consul
and his Proximate Lictor,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_141_8" id="target_note_LCL492_141_8"><sup>8</sup></a> even though walking with
the Consul in the course of duty. Only a son, and a boy at
that, had the right to walk in front of his father, the Consul.
This custom was so obstinately maintained that when Q.
Fabius Maximus, five times Consul, one who had for a long
time been held in the highest respect and was at this time
in extreme old age, was invited by his son, who was Consul,
to walk between himself and the lictor, so that he should
not be jostled by a crowd of enemy Samnites whom they
were on their way to meet, he refused.</p>
<p>The same,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_141_9" id="target_note_LCL492_141_9"><sup>9</sup></a> when sent by the senate as Legate to his
son,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_141_10a" id="target_note_LCL492_141_10a"><sup>10</sup></a> the Consul, at Suessa, saw that he had come forth
outside the town walls to pay his respects. Annoyed because
none of the eleven lictors11 had told him to dismount
from his horse, he wrathfully kept his seat. Seeing this, his
son ordered his Proximate Lictor to command his father

Rullianus and Verrucosus (Cunctator). The first served as “Legate

of the first anecdote. The Cunctator’s son was Consul in 213;

the senate as its representative. So Combès renders “reçevant du
