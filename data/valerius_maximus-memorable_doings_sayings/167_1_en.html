Scipios, Africanus and Asiaticus. Asiaticus was unable to
give security for a sum adjudged and on that account the
Consul ordered him to be taken to gaol. He appealed to
the board of Tribunes, but none of them was willing to
intervene on his behalf. Gracchus then drew apart from
his colleagues and composed a decree. Nobody doubted
that in drafting it he would use expressions flavoured with
animosity against Asiaticus. But Gracchus first stated on
oath that he had not resumed friendly relations with the

<p>Nor does the younger Africanus let us keep silent about
