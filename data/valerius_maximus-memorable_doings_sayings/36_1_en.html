carried into the fray on a litter. And while he there kept
vigil beyond his bodily strength for gaining victory, his
camp was captured by Brutus.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_83_2" id="target_note_LCL492_83_2"><sup>2</sup></a> What else then do we think
but that by the work of divine power the head already destined
to immortality felt no violence of Fortune unmeet
for a celestial spirit?</p>
<p>Augustus now, besides his mind’s natural vigour in subtle
perception of all matters, was admonished by a recent
domestic example to comply with Artorius’ dream. For he
had heard that Calpurnia, his father the divine Julius’ wife,
on the last night<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_83_3" id="target_note_LCL492_83_3"><sup>3</sup></a> her husband spent on earth saw him in
her sleep lying in her lap prostrate with many wounds, and
that badly frightened by the horror of the dream she kept
on begging him to stay away from the senate house next
day. But unwilling to let it be thought that he did so in
alarm at a woman’s dream, he persisted in holding a senate,
in which the hands of the parricides were raised against
him.4 Between father and son no sort of comparison is to
be made, especially as they are joined together on the summit
of divinity; but the one had already raised for himself
an access to heaven by his works, while a lengthy round of
earthly achievements still remained for the other. Therefore
the immortal gods chose that the former should only
be made aware of the coming change in his condition,
while the other should also postpone it, so that the one
glory be given to heaven, the other promised.</p>
<p>Another dream also of great marvel and clear outcome:
two Consuls, P. Decius Mus and T. Manlius Torquatus, had
it on the same night in the grave and dangerous Latin War
