Consuls, municipalities, legions, and the greater part of
the equestrian order. If Marius himself had been set in that
place, he would have thought about how to get away himself
sooner than about killing Sulla.</p>
<p>Sulla’s son Faustus at school was lauding his father’s
proscription and threatening to do the same himself when
he was old enough, at which a schoolfellow, C. Cassius,
boxed his ears.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_235_4" id="target_note_LCL492_235_4"><sup>4</sup></a> Such a hand ought never to have defiled
itself with a public parricide.</p>

<p>To take something from the Greeks: the famous
Alcibiades, of whom I know not whether his good qualities
or his bad did more harm to his country (for he deceived
his countrymen with the one and ruined them with the
other), was still a boy when he came one day to his uncle
Pericles and saw him sitting in solitary gloom. He asked
why he looked so troubled. Pericles told him that as commissioned
by the state he had built the propylaea of Minerva
(that is, the doorway to the citadel) and that having
spent a vast sum on the work he could not think how to render
an account of his stewardship; hence his distress. “Well
then,” said his nephew, “look instead for a way <span class="italic">not</span> to render
an account.” And so the great and sagacious Pericles,
unable to advise himself, took the advice of a boy: he so
managed that the Athenians became involved in a war
close to home and had no time to demand accounts.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_235_5" id="target_note_LCL492_235_5"><sup>5</sup></a> Let
Athens decide whether to lament Alcibiades<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_235_6" id="target_note_LCL492_235_6"><sup>6</sup></a> or to glory in
him, since hitherto the mind fluctuates in doubtful judgment
between execration of the man and admiration.</p>
