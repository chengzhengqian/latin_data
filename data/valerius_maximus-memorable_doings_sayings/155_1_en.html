of his victory. For if you estimate him, dividing the credit
within itself, you will find him greater by the punishment
of Capua than by her capture.</p>
<p>Admirable was that resolution in severity, this in patriotism,
which Q. Fabius Maximus rendered indefatigably to
his country. He had paid money to Hannibal on behalf of
prisoners and was publicly cheated of that money: he was
silent.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_321_2" id="target_note_LCL492_321_2"><sup>2</sup></a> The senate had made Master of Horse Minucius
equal in magisterial power to him, the Dictator:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_321_3" id="target_note_LCL492_321_3"><sup>3</sup></a> he held
his peace. Provoked by a number of other slights, he remained
in the same frame of mind and never permitted
himself to be angry with the commonwealth. Such was his
resolution in loving his countrymen; was it not equal in the
conduct of war? He saw that Roman empire, almost destroyed
in the battle of Cannae, was hardly capable of raising
armies. Therefore he thought it better to foil and elude
the attacks of the Carthaginians rather than engage them
with his full force. Often he was irritated by Hannibal’s
threats, not seldom presented with the appearance of an
opportunity to gain a success, but he never drew back
from his salutary policy, not even risking a small skirmish,
showing himself everywhere superior to anger and hope, a
difficult achievement indeed. So as Scipio by fighting, so
Fabius by avoiding battle was thought to have come mightily
to the aid of our community. The one overwhelmed

Rome could not be overwhelmed.</p>
