and benefits. But this great kindness they turned to the injury
of the city which had befriended them by attempting
to set up a despotism. So they were put in public custody
and kept for capital punishment. This according to the ancient
practice of the Spartans they were to suffer at night.
Their wives, of illustrious birth in Sparta, begged access

<p>Now let us look at the tie of friendship. Powerful it is
and very strong, no whit inferior to the force of blood, even
more reliable and safe in that the latter is contracted by the
accident of birth, a work of chance, the former by will beginning

friend, because the one severance is not necessarily open
to the charge of injustice, whereas the other is necessarily
open to that of levity. For since a man’s life will be deserted
if not surrounded by the protection of any friendship, so
needful a recourse ought not to be rashly taken up, but
once properly grasped, ought not to be spurned. Truly
loyal friends are most recognized in time of trouble, when
whatever is rendered proceeds entirely from steady good
will. The cult of good fortune is paid more to adulation
