<p>Metellus equalled Corvinus’ life span and in the fourth
year following his consular power when quite an old man
was made Chief Pontiff. For twenty-two years he took care
of public rituals with a voice that never faltered in the
taking of vows and a hand that never quavered in the
performance of sacrifices.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_265_2" id="target_note_LCL493_265_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Q. Fabius Maximus supported his priestly office of Augur

of clients, and finally the commonwealth. What is more, already
weary of living, he had himself carried to the senate
house in a litter in order to prevent the conclusion of a discreditable
peace with Pyrrhus. Call him blind if you will,
