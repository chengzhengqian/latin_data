<p>Campanian luxury was highly advantageous to our
community, for embracing Hannibal, undefeated in arms,
in its seductions, it handed him over for defeat to the
soldiers of Rome. It lured a very vigilant general and a
very brave army with lavish feasts, abundant wine, the fragrance
of unguents, and unrestrained sexual indulgence
into sleep and enjoyment. Punic savagery was broken and
battered at last when Seplasia and Albana became its
camps.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_303_11" id="target_note_LCL493_303_11"><sup>11</sup></a> So what can be fouler, what more ruinous than
those vices, by which manliness is worn away, victories
grow languid, glory falls asleep and turns into disgrace, the
forces alike of mind and body are destroyed? So much so
that it is a question whether capture by enemies or by these
should be accounted the more pernicious.</p>
<p>They involved the city of Volsinii too in grievous and
shameful calamities. It was rich, well organized in manners
and laws, regarded as the capital of Etruria. But after
it degenerated with luxury, it fell into an abyss of outrage
and turpitude ending in subjection to the insolent rule of
slaves. At first quite a small number of these dared to enter
the senatorial order, presently they took over the entire
commonwealth, had wills written at their pleasure, forbade
the freeborn to meet for dinner or otherwise, took
their masters’ daughters to wife. Finally they made it law
that their rapes of widows and wives alike should go unpunished
and that no virgin should marry a free man who
had not first been deflowered by one of their number.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_303_12" id="target_note_LCL493_303_12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
