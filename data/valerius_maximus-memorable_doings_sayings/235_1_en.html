<p>I am still busy with the same name and have not yet
exhausted the grievances of the Cornelian clan. For P.
Lentulus, a most illustrious and patriotic citizen, put to
flight the villainous attempts and army of C. Gracchus in a
pious and brave fight on the Aventine, in which he received
serious wounds.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_481_9" id="target_note_LCL492_481_9"><sup>9</sup></a> His reward for that battle, by which he

of words does the impious head of Sextilius deserve to be
overwhelmed! He had been zealously and also successfully
defended on a very serious charge by C. Caesar. When
Caesar was a fugitive at the time of the Cinnan proscription,

Sextilius’ protection at his property near Tarquinii and to
