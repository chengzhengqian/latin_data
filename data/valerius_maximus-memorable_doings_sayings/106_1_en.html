let him not grudge to show himself to strangers<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_223_5" id="target_note_LCL492_223_5"><sup>5</sup></a> without
fear for them to gaze upon. His servants so reported to
Scipio, who ordered the door unbarred and the men admitted.
They did reverence to the doorposts as to some
holy altar or sacred temple, then eagerly took Scipio’s hand
and kissed it for a long while. Finally, after leaving gifts
such as are customarily consecrated to the divinity of the
immortal gods in front of the vestibule, they went back to
their ships rejoicing that they had had the good fortune to
see Scipio. What could be more exalted than this product
of majesty and what more gratifying? He pacified the enemy’s
anger by the admiration he inspired and saw the
brigands’ eyes revelling in the spectacle of his presence. If
stars were to come down from the sky and offer themselves
to men, they will receive no greater reverence.</p>
<p>That happened to Scipio alive, this to Aemilius Paullus
dead. At the time his obsequies were being celebrated the
principal men of Macedonia were staying in Rome on an
embassy. Of their own accord they put themselves under
the bier. That will appear the more extraordinary if one
learns that the front of that bier was decorated with Macedonian
triumphs. What a tribute to Paullus, for whose sake
they did not shudder to carry the tokens of their national
disasters before the eyes of the populace! The spectacle
gave the funeral the aspect of a second triumph. For twice
over, Paullus, did Macedonia display you in glory to our
city: by her spoils when you were alive, by her shoulders after
your passing.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_223_6" id="target_note_LCL492_223_6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
