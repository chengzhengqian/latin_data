<p>Equally outrageous was the banquet which Gemellus, a
tribunician messenger free by birth but by employment
base below servile condition, prepared for Consul Metellus
Scipio and the Tribunes of the Plebs to the signal shame
of the community. He set up a brothel in his house and in it
as prostitutes Mucia and Fulvia,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_301_8" id="target_note_LCL493_301_8"><sup>8</sup></a> both famous through
their fathers and husbands, and a boy of noble birth,
Saturninus.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_301_9" id="target_note_LCL493_301_9"><sup>9</sup></a> Bodies infamously patient, destined to be
playthings for drunken lust! Feast for a Consul and Tribunes
not to attend but to punish!</p>
<p>But especially criminal was the lust of Catiline. Seized
with an infatuation for Aurelia Orestilla, he saw his son, an
only child already past puberty, as the only obstacle to their
union in marriage. He removed the lad by poison, kindling
the nuptial torch from his pyre and offering his own childlessness
as a gift to his new bride.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_301_10" id="target_note_LCL493_301_10"><sup>10</sup></a> Then playing citizen in
the same spirit as he had played father, he paid penalty
equally to the shades of his son and to the country he had
wickedly assailed.</p>

overcareful on such a point (cf.VM6.4.2). The proscribed Sentius
