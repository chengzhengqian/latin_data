with what was given to the rest was no fit member of

<p>Fabricius Luscinus was of the same mind. In his day
he excelled all the community in offices and authority, but
in wealth he was on a par with the poorest. When the
Samnites, all of whom were his clients, sent him ten thousand
pieces of bronze and five pounds of silver and ten
slaves, he sent them back to Samnium. In virtue of his continence
he was a very wealthy man without money, abundantly
attended without use of an establishment, because
it was not large possessions that made him rich but moderate
desires. So his house contained no bronze and silver
and slaves of the Samnites but was full of glory gained from
them.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_373_8" id="target_note_LCL492_373_8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>Fabricius’ prayer fitted well with the spurned gifts. As
an envoy to Pyrrhus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_373_9" id="target_note_LCL492_373_9"><sup>9</sup></a> he heard in the king’s dwelling Cineas
of Thessaly relating that in Athens there was one celebrated
for his wisdom who recommended that men should
not choose to do anything except for the sake of pleasure.
He took that saying as something monstrous and immediately
prayed that such wisdom might come to Pyrrhus
and the Samnites. Let Athens boast of her learning, a wise
man will prefer Fabricius’ execration to the precepts of
Epicurus. The event so declared. For the city that gave
first place to pleasure lost a great empire, whereas the city
that delighted in hard work took it; the one was unable to
protect freedom, the other could even make a gift of it.</p>
