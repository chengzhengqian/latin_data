<p>The misdeed that comes now will be narrated in a
calmer frame of mind since it is external. Scipio Africanus
was giving a gladiator show in New Carthage in memory of
his father and uncle. Two king’s sons whose father had recently
died came into the arena and promised to do battle
there for the throne in order to enhance the spectacle by
their combat. Scipio urged them to settle which should be
king with words rather than the sword, and the elder was
inclined to obey his advice. But the younger, relying on his
physical strength, persisted in his madness. The fight
began, and by Fortune’s decree the more pertinacious
impiety was punished with death.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_365_8" id="target_note_LCL493_365_8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>Mithridates<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_365_9a" id="target_note_LCL493_365_9a"><sup>9</sup></a> was much more criminal. He did not war
with a brother about a paternal throne but with his father
himself about which should rule. How he found men to assist
him therein or how he dared invoke the gods is equally
matter for astonishment.</p>
<p>Yet why should we wonder at this as though it was
something unfamiliar to those nations when Sariaster conspired
with his friends against his father Tigranes, king of
Armenia, all of them letting blood from their right hands
and sucking it in turn?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_365_10" id="target_note_LCL493_365_10"><sup>10</sup></a> I should find it hard to tolerate one
making so sanguinary a pact in a conspiracy for his father’s
welfare.</p>
<p>But why do I upbraid these doings or dwell on them
