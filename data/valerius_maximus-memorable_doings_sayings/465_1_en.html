born similar to their parents. Others deny that this is a fixed
law of Nature, maintaining that the aspects of mortals are
assigned as the random chance of conception presents
them and that for that reason ugly offspring are often
produced from handsome parents and weak from sturdy.
Therefore, since this question remains in doubt, I shall
mention a few examples of striking resemblance between
persons unconnected.</p>
<p>Vibius, of free descent, and Publicius, a freedman, bore
such a resemblance to Pompeius Magnus that if they had
exchanged conditions Pompey could have been greeted in
their persons and they in Pompey’s. Certainly, wherever
Vibius or Publicius went, they drew people’s eyes to themselves,
as everybody noticed the appearance of the great
man in these nobodies.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_387_1" id="target_note_LCL493_387_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p>A young man of outstandingly noble birth, Cornelius
Scipio, with many illustrious family surnames to choose

him from this insulting aspersion.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_387_3" id="target_note_LCL493_387_3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>The combination of Lentulus and Metellus made a very
aristocratic Consulship.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_387_4" id="target_note_LCL493_387_4"><sup>4</sup></a> Both of them were almost spectacles
