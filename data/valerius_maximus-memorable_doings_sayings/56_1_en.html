<p>And should we not take the following for Nature’s jests
in human bodies? We can bear them, since there is no cruelty
in them, but they too are to be numbered among wonders.
The son of Prusias king of Bithynia,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_123_38" id="target_note_LCL492_123_38"><sup>38</sup></a> whose name
was the same as his father’s, instead of an upper row of
teeth had a single bone evenly extended. It was not unsightly
nor in any way inconvenient to use.</p>
<p>The daughter of king Mithridates, Drypetine, child of
queen Laodice, had a double row of teeth, very ugly. She
accompanied her father’s flight after his defeat by Pompey.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_123_39" id="target_note_LCL492_123_39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
<p>Deserving too of no small wonder are the eyes of a person
who is known to have had such keen and sure vision
that from Lilybaeum he saw fleets leaving Carthage harbour.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_123_40" id="target_note_LCL492_123_40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<p>More wonderful than <span class="italic">his</span> eyes is the heart of Aristomenes
of Messene. Because of his extraordinary craftiness
the Athenians cut it out and found it full of hair, having
captured him after he had escaped by cunning from several
earlier captivities.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_123_41" id="target_note_LCL492_123_41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>
<p>The poet Antipater of Sidon fell sick of a fever every
year for one day only, the day of his birth. And having
reached extreme old age, he died on his birthday of the
disease as it came round in its regular course.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_123_42" id="target_note_LCL492_123_42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>
<p>At this point it is appropriate to recall the philosophers
Polystratus and Hippoclides.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_123_43" id="target_note_LCL492_123_43"><sup>43</sup></a> They were born on
the same day and followed the system of the same teacher
