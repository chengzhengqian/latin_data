had denied him at birth, the son cried out, “Don’t kill king
Croesus,” and so recalled the blade that was already almost

<p>The same affection armed with strength of mind and
body a young man of Pinna, surnamed Pulto, in the Italian
War. He was in charge of the defences of his besieged
town, and the Roman commander had placed his father,
who was a prisoner, before his eyes surrounded by soldiers
with drawn swords, threatening to kill him unless Pulto let
his assault party through. Single-handed, Pulto snatched
the old man out of their clutches. He is to be commemorated
for a double piety, because he was both his father’s
preserver and no traitor to his fatherland.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_507_15a" id="target_note_LCL492_507_15a"><sup>15</sup></a></p>

I was born I dwelt in the same domicile, I spent my
time of infancy in the same cradle, called the same persons

pride from the masks of our ancestors. My wife is dear to
me, my children sweet, my friends pleasant, my relations
by marriage well liked, but no fondness accruing to later
acquaintance ought to drain away that which came before.</p>
