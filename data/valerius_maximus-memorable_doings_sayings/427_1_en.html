by C. Marius. For he too wreaked his wrath wickedly in his
overeagerness to pursue his enemies, butchering with ignoble
ferocity the noble body of C. Caesar, ex-Consul and
ex-Censor, and that at the tomb of a thoroughly base and
seditious individual. For only this calamity was then wanting
to the hapless commonwealth, that Caesar should fall
as an expiatory offering to Varius. Marius’ victories almost
cost too dear. Forgetful of them, he deserved more blame
at home than praise in the field. He also held the severed
head of M. Antonius for some time between his exultant
hands at dinner, in gross insolence of mind and words, and
allowed the rites of the table to be polluted with the blood
of an illustrious citizen and orator. And he even took to his
bosom P. Annius, who had brought it, bespattered as he
was with the marks of recent slaughter.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_311_2a" id="target_note_LCL493_311_2a"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Damasippus had no glory to spoil, so his memory is
scored with more outspoken indictment. By his orders
the heads of leaders of the community were mingled with
the heads of sacrificial victims and the mutilated body of
Carbo Arvina was borne around fastened to a gibbet.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_311_3" id="target_note_LCL493_311_3"><sup>3</sup></a> So

his younger brother Gaius (aed. cur. 90), but the latter is likely to
be intended, as particularly obnoxious to Marians: his clash with
Sulpicius Rufus in 88 in Asconius’ view (25.7 Clark) was the cause
of the civil war. Varius was condemned under his own law and
went into exile; according to H. Gundel (RE VIII A 388.18) he
died in exile. But on Valerius’ showing here he must have been
brought back to Rome (presumably by Sulla in 88) and executed
there, which seems in line with Cicero’s statement (<span class="italic">Nat. deor.</span>
3.81) that he was put to death in a most painful manner. Nobody
but Valerius, however, says anything about Caesar’s slaughter at the tomb. Florus in a corrupt passage (2.9.14), followed by Augustine
<span class="italic">Civ. Dei</span> 3.27, seems to say that the Caesars were killed in
their homes. Their severed heads were displayed on the rostra
(Cic. <span class="italic">De orat.</span> 3.10; cf. <span class="italic">Tusc.</span> 5.55, Livy <span class="italic">Per.</span> 80). The parallel with
Marius Gratidianus’ torture and death at the tomb of Catulus,
mentioned in the preceding section, can hardly be coincidence if
Valerius’ story is true; rather a deliberate tit-for-tat. Even after
E. Badian’s discussion in “Quaestiones Variae,” <span class="italic">Historia</span> 18
(1969).447–91 (see 463–65), which makes some good points but
overlooks Valerius, the matter remains problematic. On Antonius:
