uncomplainingly because the frugal habits he loved kept
him in this way of life which he thoroughly enjoyed.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_379_15" id="target_note_LCL492_379_15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>The younger Cato came down a long way from the old
continence in space of years, born as he was in a now rich
and luxury-loving community. All the same, when he took
part in the civil wars bringing his son along with him, he
had twelve slaves, a larger number than the elder but
fewer with regard to the changed manners of the times.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_379_16" id="target_note_LCL492_379_16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>My mind leaps up as it runs through the memory of the

spoils of Carthage and Numantia, had he not preferred
that the glory of his achievements redound to him, but the
booty to his country. And so, as he travelled through allies
and foreign nations, his victories, not his servants, were
counted, and the weight assessed, not of the gold and silver
he carried with him, but of the greatness.</p>
<p>Often too continence has been found in the hearts of
the entire populace, but it will suffice abundantly to relate
two of these examples from periods far apart. When the
terror of Pyrrhus’ onset had been relaxed and the arms of
Epirus were flagging, wishing to buy the Roman people’s
good will since he had been unable to weaken their valour,
he transferred to our city almost the entire pomp of his
royal wealth. His envoys carried from house to house gifts
