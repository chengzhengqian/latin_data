<p>Nobody saw a gilded statue either in Rome or any other
part of Italy until an equestrian one was placed in the
temple of Piety by M’. Acilius Glabrio in honour of his
father.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_161_1" id="target_note_LCL492_161_1"><sup>1</sup></a> The latter had himself dedicated that temple in
the Consulship of P. Cornelius Lentulus and M. Baebius
Tamphilus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_161_2" id="target_note_LCL492_161_2"><sup>2</sup></a> for the granting of his vow when king
Antiochus was defeated at Thermopylae.</p>
<p>For many centuries the civil law was hidden among the
rituals and ceremonies of the immortal gods and known
only to the Pontiffs. Then Cn. Flavius, son of a freedman
and a scribe, was elected Curule Aedile to the vast indignation
of the nobility and made it public, displaying the calendar
all over the Forum so to speak.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_161_3" id="target_note_LCL492_161_3"><sup>3</sup></a> On his arriving to
visit a sick colleague, a crowd of nobles who filled the bedroom
did not offer him a seat; so he ordered a curule chair
brought in and sat down on that, thus avenging both his
office and the personal slight.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_161_4" id="target_note_LCL492_161_4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>The Court of Poisonings, previously unknown in Roman
manners and laws, came into existence after the crime
of a number of married women had been revealed. They
had poisoned their husbands in a secret plot and were
brought to book on the information of one slave girl. Some
were condemned on a capital charge to the number of one
hundred and seventy.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_161_5" id="target_note_LCL492_161_5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>The corporation of flute players is apt to draw the eyes
of the crowd when it makes music in the Forum during
serious transactions, public and private, with heads concealed
