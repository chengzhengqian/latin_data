He had gone into exile burning with hatred for
Nero, by whose testimony he had been especially damaged.
But after he was recalled and his countrymen gave
him to Nero as his colleague in the Consulship, he prevailed
upon himself to forget his own disposition, which
was of the harshest, and the injury he had received, which
was of the gravest. For if he shared authority with a colleague
with whom he was at loggerheads, he feared that in
showing himself a determined enemy he would be behaving
like a bad Consul. Thus bending his mind to a more
pacific attitude, he greatly contributed to the salvation of
Rome and Italy at a dangerous and difficult juncture. For
striving in equality of valorous effort, they beat down the
formidable power of Carthage.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_363_3" id="target_note_LCL492_363_3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>Famous too was the example of grudges laid aside in
the case of the elder Africanus and Ti. Gracchus. They
came to the rites of a common table as enemies hating one
another, they left it joined in amity and affinity. For not
content with reconciling himself to Gracchus by the senate’s
behest on the Capitol at the banquet of Jupiter, Scipio
forthwith betrothed his daughter Cornelia to him on the
spot.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_363_4" id="target_note_LCL492_363_4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>Good nature of this sort also showed itself conspicuously
in M. Cicero. For he vigorously defended A.
Gabinius on a charge of extortion, who in his Consulship
had driven him out of Rome. He also protected P. Vatinius
in two public trials, who had always been inimical to his
own public standing; this without incurring the charge of
levity, rather with some credit, for injuries are more handsomely
overcome by kindness than balanced in pertinacity
of mutual hate.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_363_5" id="target_note_LCL492_363_5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
