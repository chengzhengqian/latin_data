<p>The younger members of the equestrian order filled
Rome twice annually with a showing of themselves, for
which they had high authority. The custom of the
Lupercalia<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_147_17" id="target_note_LCL492_147_17"><sup>17</sup></a> was begun by Romulus and Remus, exultant
because their grandfather Numitor, king of Alba, had
given them permission to found a city in the place of their
upbringing under the Palatine mountain which Evander
the Arcadian had consecrated. After sacrifice and slaughter
of goats, carried away by the merriment of a feast and
large draughts of wine, they divided the shepherd gathering

elections that had come into the control of the lowest
elements. For this salutary act Fabius, who was otherwise
distinguished for his achievements in war, received the
surname “Maximus.”</p>

<p>Laudable also is the modesty of the people,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_147_1" id="target_note_LCL492_147_1"><sup>1</sup></a> who by
