their patron. What is more, when C. Caesar, after crushing
Cn. Pompeius the younger in Spain, admitted the public in
his suburban estate, the pretender was greeted on the
other side of the column<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_393_2" id="target_note_LCL493_393_2"><sup>2</sup></a> with almost equal enthusiasm
by the throng. And if the divine might of Caesar had not
opposed this shameful commotion, the commonwealth
would have suffered a wound similar to that which it received
in Equitius’ case. Banished from Italy by his decree,
