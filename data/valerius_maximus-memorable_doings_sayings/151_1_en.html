<p>So the answer he gave to the tragic poet Alcestis<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_313_28" id="target_note_LCL492_313_28"><sup>28</sup></a> is
also to be approved. He complained to this man that in the
past three days he had been able to compose no more than
three verses with infinite expense of labour. The other
boasted that <span class="italic">he</span> had written a hundred quite easily. “But
there is a difference,” said Euripides. “Your lines will be
good for three days only, mine for all time.” For the writings
of the one in their fecund career collapsed before
memory’s first mark, the other’s work lucubrated with hesitant
pen shall be wafted with sails full of glory through the
ages.</p>
<p>I will add an example from the same stage. Antigenidas
the flute player said in everybody’s hearing to a pupil who
had made great progress but lacked success in popular approval,
“Play to me and the Muses.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_313_29" id="target_note_LCL492_313_29"><sup>29</sup></a> He clearly meant
that consummate art failing the blandishments of Fortune
is not stripped of well-founded confidence and by its own
private judgment credits itself with the praise it knows it
deserves, even if that is denied it from others.</p>
<p>When Zeuxis had painted Helen,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_313_30" id="target_note_LCL492_313_30"><sup>30</sup></a> he did not think he
should wait to see what the public would think of that
work, but then and there added these verses himself:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">No blame that Trojans and well-greaved Achaeans</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Should suffer pains so long for such a woman.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_313_31" id="target_note_LCL492_313_31"><sup>31</sup></a></span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p></blockquote>
<p>Did the painter claim so much for his hand as to believe
that it had captured all the beauty that Leda could bring
forth by divine delivery or Homer express by godlike
genius?</p>
