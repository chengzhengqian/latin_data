when I see all crimes surpassed by the thought of a single
parricide?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_367_11" id="target_note_LCL493_367_11"><sup>11</sup></a> So I am swept by an emotion more pious than
potent, with all the energy of my mind, all the forces of indignation,
to rend that deed. For who with words of due
execration sufficiently effectual could drive into the abyss
an attempt to bury the human race in bloody darkness, extinguishing
the loyalty of friendship? Could you, more ferocious
than the brutality of savage barbary, have taken the
reins of Roman empire which our leader and father holds
in his saving hand? Or if you had achieved your madness,
would the world have stayed in place? Rome captured by
the Gauls, the river Cremera disfigured by the slaughter of
three hundred warriors of a famous clan, the day of the
Allia, the Scipios destroyed in Spain, Trasimene lake, Cannae,
the blades of the civil wars streaming with domestic
blood: all these you wished to manifest and surpass by the
crazy designs of your delirium. But the eyes of the gods
were awake, the stars maintained their potency, the altars,
sacred couches, temples were fenced with present deity,
and nothing that was in duty bound to watch over that august
life and our fatherland permitted itself torpor. And
above all the author and guardian of our safety saw to it
in his divine policy that his most excellent benefactions
should not collapse amid the ruins of the whole world. So
peace stands, the laws are valid, the course of private and
public duty remains unimpaired. But he who essayed to
subvert all this, violating the bonds of friendship, was
trampled down along with all his race by the might of the
Roman people, and in the underworld too, that is if it takes
him in, he suffers the punishment he deserves.</p>
