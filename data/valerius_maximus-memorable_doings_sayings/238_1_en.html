neither the strict uprightness of his life nor his unfailing
patriotism nor the salutary laws of his devising could save
him from experiencing his countrymen’s hostility. He was
often the target of stones, sometimes thrown out of the
Forum, even deprived of an eye, finally driven from his native
city itself.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_487_16" id="target_note_LCL492_487_16"><sup>16</sup></a> What should other cities do when even this
one, that claims special credit for steadfastness, moderation,
and gravity, proved so ungrateful to so deserving a
citizen?</p>
<p>Take Theseus away from the Athenians and Athens will
not exist or not be so famous, since it was he who brought
his countrymen scattered in villages into a single city of
their own and gave the form and semblance of a great community
to a people living separately and in rustic fashion.
He also when scarcely more than a boy repudiated the
cruel commands of Minos, a very powerful king. He also
tamed the unbridled insolence of Thebes. He also gave aid
to the children of Hercules and by the valour of his soul
and the strength of his right hand pulverized monsters and
crimes wherever they existed. But the Athenians banished
him, and Scyros, an island too small for an exile, took his
bones in death.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_487_17" id="target_note_LCL492_487_17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>And Solon? He who proposed such splendid and useful
laws for the Athenians that if they had chosen to practise
them in perpetuity they would have kept their empire
forever; who recovered Salamis, which threatened their
safety from close by like an enemy citadel; who was the
first to see Pisistratus’ tyranny rising and the only one
who dared to say openly that it should be crushed by
arms—Solon spent his old age as a fugitive in Cyprus and
did not find burial in the country from which he had deserved
so much.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_487_18" id="target_note_LCL492_487_18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
