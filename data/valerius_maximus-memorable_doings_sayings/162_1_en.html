<p>What follows is illustrious by reason both of admiration
for the thing itself and the celebrity of the doer. Alexander,
king of the Macedonians, having beaten down the preeminent
power of Darius in a famous battle,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_335_21" id="target_note_LCL492_335_21"><sup>21</sup></a> was in Cilicia.
Overheated by the weather and the stress of travel, he
plunged his body into the Cydnus, which flows through
Tarsus, remarkable for the limpidity of its stream. Then
suddenly from drinking too much his muscles were
numbed with cramps and his limbs dulled in paralysis; and
to the utmost consternation of the whole army he was carried
into the town, which was close to the camp. There he
lay sick in Tarsus and the prospect of imminent victory faltered
at his distemper. So doctors were summoned and
with sedulous deliberation looked about for remedies to
cure him. Among these they fixed on one potion, which
Philippus, a doctor, mixed with his own hands and offered
to Alexander, whose friend and companion he was. At that
moment a letter arrived from Parmenio with a warning
that the king should beware of Philippus’ treachery as having
been bribed by Darius. When Alexander read the letter,
he drank the medicine without any hesitation and then
handed it to Philippus to read. For so resolute a confidence
in his friend he received a most fitting reward from the immortal
gods, who would not let the saving antidote be
thwarted by false information.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_335_22" id="target_note_LCL492_335_22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
