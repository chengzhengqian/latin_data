all those distinctions that he had gathered from early youth
even to the arousing of ill will. It is accepted that on that
day statues of the gods in temples turned about of their
own motion, soldiers’ shouting and the clash of arms were
heard so loud in Antioch and Ptolemais that the people ran
to the walls, at Pergamus a sound of drums came out of the
hidden recesses of a temple, at Tralles a sizable green palm

both were contained in the heart.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_77_21" id="target_note_LCL492_77_21"><sup>21</sup></a> Then there broke out

from the number of men, added you to the council of the
gods.</p>
