a citizen of the highest nobility, when he painted the walls
in the temple of Welfare which C. Junius Bubulcus had
dedicated and inscribed his name thereon?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_275_6" id="target_note_LCL493_275_6"><sup>6</sup></a> <span class="italic">That</span> was the
only distinction lacking in a family abounding in Consulates
and priesthoods and triumphs! However, his mind devoted
to a base pursuit did not wish that labour of his,
whatever its nature, to be shrouded in silence. No doubt he
was following the example of Phidias, who put his own likeness
into Minerva’s shield so that if it were dislodged the
whole interconnection of the work would be dissolved.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_275_7" id="target_note_LCL493_275_7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>

<p>But if he was taken with the fancy to imitate foreigners,
he had better have emulated Themistocles’ enthusiasm.
They say of him that he was agitated by the pricks of great
achievements and so spent restless nights. To those who
enquired why he went about in public at that time he replied:
“Because Miltiades’ trophies rouse me from my
sleep.” Doubtless Marathon urged his soul with silent
goads to make Artemisium and Salamis illustrious, names
fertile in naval glory.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_275_8" id="target_note_LCL493_275_8"><sup>8</sup></a> The same Themistocles was asked on
his way to the theatre whose voice he would most like to
hear and answered, “Whosoever will best sing my skills.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_275_9" id="target_note_LCL493_275_9"><sup>9</sup></a>
Ah sweetness of glory—I had almost added “vainglorious”!</p>
<p>Alexander’s appetite for fame was insatiable. He said to
his companion Anaxarchus, who was retailing on the authority
of his teacher Democritus the existence of innumerable
worlds: “Alas for me, I have not yet made myself
master of one!” A holding that suffices for the domicile of
all the gods was not large enough for one glory-hungry
man.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_275_10" id="target_note_LCL493_275_10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
