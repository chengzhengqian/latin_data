prostrated their bodies on the ground, Sulla had them
killed and forthwith scattered over the countryside. Four
thousand seven hundred were slaughtered by an edict of
dire proscription; he entered them in public records, presumably
to make sure that the memory of so splendid a
feat should not be washed away. Not content with savaging
those who had fought against him, he added even peaceloving
citizens to the number of the proscribed on account
of their wealth, searching them out through a nomenclator.
He drew swords even against women, as though the
slaughter of men was not enough for him. Another sign of
insatiable savagery: he had the severed heads of the victims,
still all but retaining expression and breath, brought
into his presence, so that he could chew them with his
eyes, since it was forbidden to do it with his mouth. How
cruelly, moreover, he behaved in the case of Praetor M.
Marius! He had him dragged before the eyes of the populace
to the tomb of the Lutatian clan and did not take his
life away before he gouged out the wretched man’s eyes
and broke his body limb by limb. I feel I am narrating the
barely believable: he actually slew M. Plaetorius on the
spot because he had fainted away at Marius’ execution, a
novel chastiser of pity, with whom to look upon a crime reluctantly
was to commit one. But at least he spared the
shades of the dead? Far from it. He dug up the ashes of C.
Marius, whose Quaestor he had once been though afterwards
his enemy, and scattered them over the channel of
the Anio. Such were the acts by which he thought it proper
to claim the name of “Fortunate.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_309_1" id="target_note_LCL493_309_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
