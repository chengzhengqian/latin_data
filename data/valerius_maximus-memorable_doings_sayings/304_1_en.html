<p>Nothing could be braver than the following examples of
justice. Zaleucus16 protected the city of Locri with very
salutary and useful laws. His son was convicted on a charge
of adultery and according to a law constituted by Zaleucus
himself was due to lose both eyes. The whole community
wished to spare the young man the necessity of punishment
in honour of his father. For some time Zaleucus resisted,
but in the end, overborne by the people’s entreaties,
he first gouged out one of his own eyes, then one of his
son’s, leaving the faculty of sight to them both. Thus he
rendered to the law a due measure of retribution, by admirable
balance of equity dividing himself between compassionate
father and just lawgiver.</p>
<p>The justice of Charondas of Thurii was considerably
harsher and more abrupt. He had pacified the assemblies
of the citizens, which were strife-ridden to the point of violence
and bloodshed, by making a law that anyone who
came into them armed should immediately be put to
death. Some time later he was coming home from a distant
place in the country wearing his sword, when an assembly
was suddenly announced. He went into it just as he was
and was admonished by the person standing next to him
that he had broken his own law. “And I shall ratify it too,”
he said, and forthwith drew the weapon he was carrying
and fell upon it.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_65_17" id="target_note_LCL493_65_17"><sup>17</sup></a> He might have concealed his fault or defended
it as an error, but he preferred to pay the penalty
outright, so that justice should not be compromised.</p>
