and silver, and so brought home the future reward of his
own death. No question, he did not possess riches but was
possessed by them, in title the king of an island, in mind a
miserable slave of pelf.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_335_4" id="target_note_LCL493_335_4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<h3><span class="ac">5. Of Arrogance and Outrageousness</span></h3>
<p>And to put arrogance too and outrageousness conspicuously
in view, Consul M. Fulvius Flaccus, colleague of M.
Plautius Hypsaeus, was introducing laws highly detrimental
to the commonwealth about granting citizenship and
about appeal to the people by persons unwilling to change
their citizenship status. With difficulty he was compelled
to come to the senate house, but then gave no answer to
the senate as it partly warned and partly entreated him to
give up his program. A Consul would be thought to have
the spirit of a tyrant if he behaved to one senator in the
manner adopted by Flaccus in contempt of the majesty of
the whole most honourable order.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_335_1" id="target_note_LCL493_335_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>That order was also harassed in the most insulting fashion
by Tribune of the Plebs M. Drusus. He was not content
with throttling Consul L. Philippus (using a client of his
own, not an orderly) because he had dared to interrupt
him as he was addressing a public meeting and driving him
headlong to prison with such violence that a quantity of
blood gushed from his nostrils.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_335_2" id="target_note_LCL493_335_2"><sup>2</sup></a> He actually said when the
senate sent him a message to come to their house, “Why
don’t <span class="italic">they</span> come to the Curia Hostilia close to the rostra,
that is to say, to me?” It pains me to write what follows. The
Tribune despised the command of the senate, the senate
obeyed the words of the Tribune.</p>
