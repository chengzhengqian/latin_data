in case Metellus might interfere. Then he made for that
Celtiberian as he insolently rode up and slew him, after
which he carried the spoils stripped from his body back to
camp in high fettle. Challenged too by Pyresus, who excelled
all the Celtiberians in nobility and valour, to a duel,
he forced him to yield. Nor did that fiery-hearted young
man blush to hand over to Occius his sword and cloak in
sight of the army. He even begged that they might join in a
bond of guest-friendship when peace had been restored
between Romans and Celtiberians.</p>
<p>Nor can we pass over Acilius,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_257_37" id="target_note_LCL492_257_37"><sup>37</sup></a> a soldier of the tenth legion,
who was fighting on C. Caesar’s side in a naval battle.
When his right hand, which he had laid upon a Massilian
ship, was cut off, he grasped the poop with his left and did
not stop fighting until he had taken her and sunk her in the
deep. His deed is not as widely known as it ought to be. But
Greece, lavish of words in singing her own praises, has, by
the proclaiming voice of literature, impressed upon the
memory of all ages Cynegirus of Athens, who showed a like
pertinacity in attacking the enemy.</p>
<p>The naval glory of Acilius is followed with terrestrial
renown by M. Caesius Scaeva, a Centurion of the same
general. He was fighting in front of the fort of which he was
in command,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_257_38a" id="target_note_LCL492_257_38a"><sup>38</sup></a> while Justuleius, a Prefect of Cn. Pompeius,

nomen seems to have been Cassius (<span class="italic">RE</span> Cassius 87), under which
he is coupled with Acilius in Suetonius and Plutarch (see above). Suetonius mentions only the Dyrrachium episode, Plutarch has
the British one as well, but his anonymous στρατιώτης can hardly
be identical with Scaeva, whom he has just named. And Valerius
too in 23b evidently introduces a new figure with <span class="italic">tuum vero.</span>
Kempf’s conjecture <span class="italic">Scaevi</span> was based on Dio 37.53.3, where the
same story is told of one P. Scaevius (Scaefius? See <span class="italic">RE</span> Scaefius)
and located in Lusitania during Caesar’s Propraetorship in 60.
Plutarch’s transfer to Britain is easily understandable.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL492_257_38a').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
