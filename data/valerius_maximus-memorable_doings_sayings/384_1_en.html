<p>His marvellous progeny, a Cato nearer to our own time,
was so aflame with desire for learning that even in the senate
house, while the members were assembling, he did not
refrain from reading Greek books.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_225_4" id="target_note_LCL493_225_4"><sup>4</sup></a> By such diligence he
showed that some lack time, whereas others are superior
to times.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_225_5" id="target_note_LCL493_225_5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>Terentius Varro, to be celebrated for the example he
gave of human life and for his length of it, was no more longeval
in his years, with which he equalled the duration of a
century, than in his pen. For his breath and the series of his
excellent works ended in the same bed.</p>
<p>Livius Drusus was similarly persevering. Failing both
in the strength of youth and in his eyesight, he quite ungrudgingly
interpreted civil law for the public and composed
works of the greatest use to those wishful to learn it.
Nature could make an old man of him, Fortune a blind
man, but neither the one nor the other could interrupt his
mind’s sight and activity.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_225_6" id="target_note_LCL493_225_6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>When the senator Publilius and the Roman knight
Lupus Pontius, well-known pleaders in their day,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_225_7" id="target_note_LCL493_225_7"><sup>7</sup></a> went
blind, they carried on their forensic activities with the
same diligence. And so they drew even larger audiences as
people gathered, some because they took pleasure in their
oratorical gift, others because they admired their resolution.
For others, who seek retirement when so afflicted,
double their darkness, adding voluntary to fortuitous.</p>
