the Rhine, traveling day and night and changing horses at
intervals, he covered at full stretch two hundred miles
through a barbarous country recently conquered, with his
guide Antabagius as his sole companion. But in this very
time of stress and danger, left without mortal attendance,
the most holy power of Piety and the gods who favour
preeminent virtues and Jupiter, most faithful guardian of
Roman empire, bore him company. Drusus too, though
closer to his own fate than to duty towards anyone, in the
collapse of spiritual vigour and bodily strength, yet at the

legions with their ensigns to go to meet his brother, so that
he be saluted as Commander-in-Chief. He further gave

his own and wished him to use the title of Consul and
Commander-in-Chief. He bowed to his brotherâ€™s majesty

him in battle. Stripping him as he lay, he recognized that it
was his own brother. Bitterly and long he upbraided the
gods for their gift of an impious victory, then carried the
body close to the camp, covered it with a costly cloth, and
placed it on a pyre. Next he set a torch below and forthwith
ran the same sword with which he had slain his brother
