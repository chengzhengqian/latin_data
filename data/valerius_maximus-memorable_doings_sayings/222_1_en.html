crushed Darius’ power he placed the body doubled up
with cold on his own seat, remarking that what was a capital
offence among the Persians, to have sat on the royal
throne, would be salutary to him. So it is not surprising that
men found it pleasant to serve for so many years under a
commander who set more store by the survival of a common
soldier than by his own high dignity.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_455_20" id="target_note_LCL492_455_20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>The same Alexander, yielding not to any human being
but to Nature and Fortune, though he was falling apart
from the violence of his sickness, raised himself up on his
elbow and stretched out his right hand for all who wished
to touch it. Who would not have run to kiss that hand,
which already in death’s grip sufficed for the embrace of a
great army, more vital with humanity than with breath?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_455_21" id="target_note_LCL492_455_21"><sup>21</sup></a>
Humanity of a character less robust but nonetheless
deserving to be put on record on the part of the Athenian
tyrant Pisistratus shall be related. When a young man fired
by love for his unmarried daughter had kissed her as she
came in his way in public, his wife urged Pisistratus to have
him put to death, but he answered: “If we kill those who
love us, what shall we do with those who hate us?” An utterance
by no means fitting the rider that it came from the
lips of a tyrant!<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_455_22" id="target_note_LCL492_455_22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>That was how he bore an insult to his daughter; one to
himself he bore in a much more praiseworthy fashion. His
friend Thrasippus lashed him with endless abuse during
dinner. Pisistratus restrained his mind and his tongue from
anger (you might have thought a courtier was being
scolded by a tyrant), and as the man was on his way out,
fearing that he was leaving the banquet early because he
was afraid, he tried to hold him with a friendly invitation.
