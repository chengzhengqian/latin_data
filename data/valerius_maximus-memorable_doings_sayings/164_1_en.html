<p>With some reluctance I leave Publicola, but I am glad
to come to Furius Camillus. So moderate was his passage
from deep disgrace to the highest authority that when he
was in exile at Ardea and his countrymen besought his aid
after the capture of the city by the Gauls, he did not go to
Veii to take command of the army until he had ascertained
that everything concerning his appointment as Dictator
