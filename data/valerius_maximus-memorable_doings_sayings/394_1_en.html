<h3><span class="ac">9. How Great is the Force
Of Eloquence</span></h3>
<p>Although we have already seen that the power of eloquence
is mighty, it may properly be reviewed in examples
of its own so that its strength may be the better attested.</p>
<p>After the expulsion of the kings the plebians quarrelled
with the patricians and settled in arms on the hill which is
called “Sacred” by the bank of the river Anio. The state of
the commonwealth was not only sorry but quite wretched,
with the head divided from the rest of the body by internecine
strife. And if Valerius’ eloquence had not come to the
rescue, the hope of so great an empire would have collapsed
almost at birth. For by a speech he brought the people,
which was rashly exulting in its new, unaccustomed
freedom, back to better and saner counsels and subjected
it to the senate; that is, he joined Rome to Rome. So by eloquent
words anger, confusion, and arms subsided.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_245_1a" id="target_note_LCL493_245_1a"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Such words also checked the Marian and Cinnan
blades, mad with the lust of shedding the blood of countrymen.
Soldiers sent by the ruthless leaders to slaughter M.
Antonius, struck with amazement by his speech, returned
their swords already drawn and flashing unbloodied to
their scabbards. After they left, P. Annius (for he alone
standing at the entrance had been outside the range of
Antonius’ eloquence) carried out the cruel order in savage
obedience.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_245_2" id="target_note_LCL493_245_2"><sup>2</sup></a> How eloquent are we to think him whom none
even of his enemies could bear to kill, none that is who was
willing to let the orator’s voice enter his ears?</p>
