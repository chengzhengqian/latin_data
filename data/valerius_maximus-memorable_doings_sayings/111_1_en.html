came Latins to discuss their demand for the franchise.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_233_2" id="target_note_LCL492_233_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Q.
Poppaedius, their leader and a guest of Drusus, asked
Cato to put in a word for the allies with his uncle. Cato
firmly replied that he would do no such thing, and when
solicited a second and a third time, stuck to his resolve.
