hiring his services to the allies. Later the whole of Sicily accepted
laws from him as Consul9 and was freed from a very
bitter war with pirates and runaway slaves. I think the very
harbours, if dumb things have feelings, were astonished
at such a variety of status in the same individual. They
watched a man they had seen pulling in his daily takings
sitting in judgment and commanding fleets and armies.</p>
<p>To this elevation, great as it was, I shall add a greater.
When Asculum was captured, Cn. Pompeius, father of
Magnus, subjected P. Ventidius, still a child, to the eyes of
the people at his triumph. This is the Ventidius who later
triumphed in Rome over the Parthians and through the
Parthians over the shade of Crassus lying miserably on enemy
soil.10 So as a captive he had shuddered at the prison,
as a victor he crowded the Capitol with his felicity. He was
also extraordinary in having been made Praetor and Consul
in the same year.</p>
<p>Let us now look at the variety of men’s fortunes. L.
Lentulus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_89_11" id="target_note_LCL493_89_11"><sup>11</sup></a> a Consular, after conviction on a charge of extortion
under the Caecilian law,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_89_12" id="target_note_LCL493_89_12"><sup>12</sup></a> was elected Censor<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_89_13" id="target_note_LCL493_89_13"><sup>13</sup></a>
with L. Censorinus. Fortune turned him this way and that
between honours and disgraces, following Consulship
with conviction, conviction with Censorship, suffering him
neither to enjoy lasting good nor bewail unchanging bad.</p>
