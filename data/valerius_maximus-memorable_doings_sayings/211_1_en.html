they do not disdain to give a careful reading to the senatorial

<p>I think the Roman people has been expostulating with
me this while because in seeking out the munificence of individuals
I say nothing of theirs. For it is pertinent to their
highest credit that the spirit they have shown to kings and
cities and nations be reviewed, since all the glory of a fine
action grows green again in itself by frequent remembrance.
They handed over Asia, taken in war, into the possession
of king Attalus4 by way of gift, believing that empire
for our city would gain in loftiness and splendour if
they chose to make a benefaction rather than a profit to
themselves out of the richest and most delightful part of
the world. A gift more happy than the victory itself, since a
major acquisition might have provoked envy, whereas so
large a bounty could not fail of glory.</p>
<p>But no writing will attend with adequate encomiums
the celestial spirit of the following example of Roman liberality.
After the defeat of king Philip of Macedonia, all
Greece gathered for the Isthmian spectacle. A trumpet
call made silence, and through a herald T. Quinctius
Flamininus ordered these words to be proclaimed: “The
senate and people of Rome and T. Quinctius Flamininus,
commander-in-chief, order that all Grecian cities formerly
under the dominion of king Philip, be free and exempt
from tax.” Hearing these words, men were overcome with
a mighty unlooked-for joy. At first they kept silent as
though not believing their ears. Then, when the herald’s
pronouncement was repeated, they filled the heavens with
so enthusiastic a shout that according to general and sure
report birds flying overhead fell to the ground in stupefaction
