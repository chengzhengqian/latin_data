The piety of posterity, however profound, cannot pretend
that it was not foully stained with the blood of its founder.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_477_1" id="target_note_LCL492_477_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>To a like error of stumbling mind on the part of our
community succeeds a repentance. Furius Camillus, alike
the happiest scion and surest safeguard of Roman power,
could not protect his own survival in the city whose safety
he had stabilized, whose felicity he had enhanced. Accused
by Tribune of the Plebs L. Appuleius of embezzling
the booty of Veii, he was sent by hard, I might say iron,
votes into exile, and that at a time when robbed of his son,
an excellent young man, he should have been relieved with
solace rather than loaded with calamity. But his country,
unmindful of the great man’s signal services, joined the father’s
condemnation to the son’s obsequies. “Ah, but,” it
may be said, “the Tribune complained that fifteen thousand
asses was missing from the treasury; for that was the
amount of the fine.” An unworthy sum that the Roman
people should lose such a leader for it!<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_477_2" id="target_note_LCL492_477_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>As our former protest still reverberates, another rises to
succeed it. The commonwealth was not only bruised and
broken by the arms of the Second Punic War but already
almost bloodless and dying: the elder Africanus made her

with insults, his countrymen made him the inhabitant
of an ignoble hamlet and a deserted swamp. He did
not carry the bitterness of his voluntary exile in silence to
those below, but ordered inscribed on his tomb “Ungrateful
country, you do not even have my bones.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_477_3" id="target_note_LCL492_477_3"><sup>3</sup></a> What could
