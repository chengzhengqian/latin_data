<h3><span class="ac">6. Of Public Faith</span></h3>
<p>When her image is set before our eyes the venerable divinity
of Faith displays her right hand, the most certain
pledge of human welfare. That she has always flourished in
our community all nations have perceived; let us recall it
with a few examples.</p>
<p>When king Ptolemy left the Roman people guardian to
his son, the senate sent M. Aemilius Lepidus, Chief Pontiff
and twice Consul, to Alexandria to look after the boy’s tutelage,
desiring that the probity of a very eminent and upright
personage, versed in the usages and rituals of the
commonwealth, should take time for an external charge,

mentality, thought there was nothing of that sort to be
afraid of and went in full confidence for a conference with
the Romans. While he was talking to them about ending
the war, a Military Tribune said it would serve him right
if what had befallen Cornelius were to happen to him.
Thereupon both the Consuls told the Tribune to hold his
