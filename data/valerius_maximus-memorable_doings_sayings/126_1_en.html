<p>At Cales the blood from many bodies was mingled together
to great wonderment. In that town Fulvius Flaccus
took vengeance for Campanian perfidy by inflicting capital
punishment on the leaders of that community before his
tribunal, but was obliged by a letter received from the senate
to set an end to their suffering. To that suffering T.
Vibellius Taurea the Campanian voluntarily offered himself,
crying out as loudly as he could: “Fulvius, since you
are seized with so strong a desire to drain our blood, why
are you so slow to draw your gory axe against me, so that
you can boast that a rather braver man than yourself has
been killed by your orders?” Fulvius then averred that he
would have done that with pleasure, if he were not prevented
by the will of the senate. “But I have had no instructions
from the Conscript Fathers,” said Vibellius. “Look at
me as I show you action welcome to your eyes but greater
than your spirit.” And straightway he killed his wife and
children and fell upon his sword. What kind of man should
we think him, who chose to testify by the slaughter of himself
and his that he would rather blacken Fulvius’ cruelty
than avail himself of the senate’s mercy?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_263_42" id="target_note_LCL492_263_42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>
