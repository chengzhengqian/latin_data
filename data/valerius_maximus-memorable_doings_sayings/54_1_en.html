<p>No less favoured by the immortal gods was Simonides,
whose life, protected from imminent shipwreck,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_119_30" id="target_note_LCL492_119_30"><sup>30</sup></a> was also

none be ignorant how much better it was to have sung the
praises of the gods than to have belittled their divinity. A
follower of that pursuit whose professors are called sophists,
an idle and mordacious notion-mongering, he consulted
Apollo at Delphi in mockery, enquiring whether he
could find his horse, when in fact he possessed no such animal.
