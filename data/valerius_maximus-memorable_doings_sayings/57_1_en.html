Epicurus. They also shared property and held school
jointly, and in extreme old age died in the same moment of
time. Who but would think that such equal association in
fortune and friendship was born, fostered, and terminated
in the bosom of celestial Concord herself?</p>
<p>Why Nature played these particular tricks on the children
of powerful kings or an illustrious leader or a notably
talented poet or men of great learning or a man of obscure
estate, not even she herself, fertile artificer of all substance
good and bad, could explain. No more than why she so
dearly loved the wild goats born in Crete, whom when shot
by arrows she almost leads with her own hands to the healing
aid of the herb dittany and brings to pass that after eating
it they immediately reject the darts and the power of
the poison from their wounds.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_125_44" id="target_note_LCL492_125_44"><sup>44</sup></a> Or why, while all other animals
everywhere are refreshed by a daily drink of water, in
the island of Cephallania she has made the goats slake their
thirst for most of the year by taking in winds from the sky
with open mouth.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_125_45" id="target_note_LCL492_125_45"><sup>45</sup></a> Or why at Croton in the temple of Juno
Lacinia she bestowed an altar with ashes that no wind can
stir.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_125_46" id="target_note_LCL492_125_46"><sup>46</sup></a> Or especially why she wished a water in Macedonia
and another in the district of Cales to possess the property
of wine whereby men are made drunk.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_125_47" id="target_note_LCL492_125_47"><sup>47</sup></a> We should not
wonder at these things but record them, since we know
that much licence is rightly claimed by her with whom
rests the infinite task of engendering all things.</p>
