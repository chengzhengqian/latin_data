<p>For what was Metellus Pius about, the leading man of
his time, when in Spain he allowed his comings to be
greeted by his hosts with altars and incense? When he
gazed happily at walls draped in curtains of cloth of gold?
When he permitted elaborate games to be interposed
between enormous feasts? When he attended dinners in
palm-embroidered garments and received golden garlands
let down from the ceilings on his head as though it
were divine?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_299_5" id="target_note_LCL493_299_5"><sup>5</sup></a> And where all this? Not in Greece or Asia,
whose luxury could corrupt Austerity herself, but in a
rough, warlike province, and that when a relentless enemy,
Sertorius, was dazzling the eyes of Roman armies with
Lusitanian spears. So completely had his father’s Numidian
warfare faded from his mind. Thus it is evident with
how swift a passage luxury flowed in; his youth saw the old
morals, his old age began the new.</p>
<p>A similar revolution appeared in the house of the Curios.
Our Forum saw the father’s solemn frown and the
son’s sixty millions of debt, contracted by infamous outrage
upon noble youths. Thus at the same time and in the same
residence diverse epochs dwelt, one most frugal, the other
most profligate.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_299_6" id="target_note_LCL493_299_6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>With what extravagance and lust did the trial of P. Clodius
abound! In it, to the end that a defendant manifestly
guilty of the charge of impurity might be acquitted, nights
of married women and young noblemen were bought for a
great sum and paid out as bribes to members of the jury.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_299_7" id="target_note_LCL493_299_7"><sup>7</sup></a>
In this abominable and manifold outrage it is hard to know
which to execrate first, him who devised this form of corruption,
those who allowed their chastity to become a
bribery agent for perjury, or those who bartered their oath
for illicit sex.</p>
