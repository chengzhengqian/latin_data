partial memory of her husband that was to have been
found a fierce chastiser in her brother and a father in
agreement with so harsh a chastisement.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_39_11" id="target_note_LCL493_39_11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>With similar severity later on the senate commissioned
Consuls Sp. Postumius Albinus and Q. Marcius Philippus
to investigate women who had made impure use of Bacchanalian
rites. Many were found guilty by them and all
were executed in their homes by their kinsfolk. The disgrace
of the scandal spread wide, but it was rectified by the
severity of the retribution. The women brought as much
credit to our community by their heavy punishment as
they had put shame upon it by their misconduct.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_39_12" id="target_note_LCL493_39_12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>

Albinus, and Licinia, who had done the same to
Claudius Asellus, were strangled by sentence of their kinsfolk.
For those men of severity did not think that in so
evident a crime they should await a lengthy public enquiry.
So they made speed to punish the guilty ones, in whose defence
they would have stood had they been innocent.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_39_14" id="target_note_LCL493_39_14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>Their severity was roused to exact punishment by a
heinous crime, that of Egnatius Mecennius, by a much
slighter cause. He cudgelled his wife to death because she
had drunk wine. His action found none to prosecute or
even to reprehend it. All agreed that the penalty she paid
to injured Sobriety was an excellent precedent. And true it
is that any female who seeks the use of wine past moderation
closes the door to every virtue and opens it to every
sin.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_39_15" id="target_note_LCL493_39_15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
