acquitted him by vote of the council and also his own. Had
he been carried away by angry impulse into violent action,
he would have committed a crime rather than punished
one.</p>
<p>Q. Hortensius, who in his day was an ornament of Roman
eloquence, showed admirable patience towards his
son. So much did he suspect the latter of undutiful behavior
and so offended was he by his worthlessness that he intended
to make his sister’s son Messalla his heir and in defending
him on a charge of electoral misconduct he told
the jury that if they condemned him he, Hortensius, would
have no comfort left except the kisses of his grandchildren.
With that sentiment, which he also included in his published
speech, he evidently placed his son among his afflictions
rather than his delights. Nonetheless, rather than
confuse Nature’s order, he left his son as his heir, not his
grandsons, controlling his feelings with discretion, in that
he both in his lifetime bore true testimony to his son’s character
and in death rendered due respect to the claims of
blood.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_539_2" id="target_note_LCL492_539_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Q. Fulvius, a man of illustrious family and high standing,
did the same, but in the case of a considerably nastier
son. He was suspected of parricide and on that account was
in hiding. His father appealed for help to the senate to
have him searched for by the Triumvir as suspect of parricide
and hiding on that account; and by order of the Conscript
Fathers he was apprehended. Not only did his father
not censure him, but when he died left him his entire estate,
making the man he had begot his heir, not the man he
had known.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_539_3" id="target_note_LCL492_539_3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>To the merciful actions of great men I shall add the device
of an obscure father, of strange and unusual nature.
