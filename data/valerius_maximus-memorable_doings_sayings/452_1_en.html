with eternal infamy but the street itself with the name of

<p>The deed and saying of C. Fimbria is less atrocious, but
considered in themselves both are of the most audacious.
He had intended that Scaevola should be murdered at C.
Marius’ funeral. Learning that he had recovered from his
wound, Fimbria set about prosecuting him before the
people. Then, asked what he was going to say against one
whose blameless character could not be praised highly
enough, he replied that he would charge him with receiving
the weapon in his body too gingerly. Extravagance of
madness, to be accompanied by the groans of the ailing
commonwealth!<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_361_2" id="target_note_LCL493_361_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>As M. Cicero was talking in the senate about the fire
started by L. Catilina, “I feel it,” said the latter, “and if I
can’t put it out with water, I’ll do it with the falling house.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_361_3" id="target_note_LCL493_361_3"><sup>3</sup></a>
What are we to think but that driven by the goads of conscience
he proved himself guilty of the parricide he had
begun?</p>
<p>Magius Chilo’s mind too was confused by madness. An
old friend of M. Marcellus and his companion in the Pompeian
service, with his own hand he snatched away the life
Caesar had granted, out of resentment that some other
friends were preferred by Marcellus to himself. As Marcellus
was returning to Rome from Mitylene, where he had
betaken himself, in the harbour of Athens, Magius stabbed
him with a dagger and went straight on to slaughter the
provocations of his lunacy: an enemy of friendship, an
interceptor of the divine benefaction, a sad defilement of a
sacred public obligation so far as concerned the restoration
of a most illustrious citizen.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_361_4" id="target_note_LCL493_361_4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
