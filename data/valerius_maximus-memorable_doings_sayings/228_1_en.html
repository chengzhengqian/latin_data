was divided into two and Minucius had separately clashed
with Hannibal in Samnium. The engagement rashly begun
would have ended in disaster, but he was saved by Fabius
coming to the rescue. Minucius personally called him “father”
and had his legions greet him as “patron.” Putting
down the yoke of equal command, he subordinated the
Mastership of Horse to the Dictatorship, as was proper,
