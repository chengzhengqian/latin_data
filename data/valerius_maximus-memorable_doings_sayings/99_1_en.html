cruel and insolent beyond others, when he celebrated a
triumph after consummating and consolidating his power,
bore many cities of Greece and Asia in procession but no
town of Roman citizens.</p>
<p>Revulsion and weariness forbid further advance
through the hurts of the commonwealth. The senate gave
no man a laurel nor did any wish to be given one with part
of the community in tears. But hands are readily stretched
forth to receive the oak, when a crown is to be granted for
countrymen saved. With it the doorposts of the August
dwelling triumph in eternal glory.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_209_14" id="target_note_LCL492_209_14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<h3><span class="ac">9. Of The Censorial Stigma</span></h3>
<p>The binding link of camp discipline and the careful observance
of the military system admonish me to press on to
the Censorship, mistress and guardian of peace. For as the
resources of the Roman people have risen to so high a level
through the high qualities of its generals, so uprightness
and self-restraint flourish when scrutinized by the Censorâ€™s
frown, an achievement equal in effect to the glories
of war. For what use is good work abroad if life at home
is lived amiss?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_209_1" id="target_note_LCL492_209_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Cities may be stormed, nations snatched
up, hands laid on kingdoms, but unless duty and modesty
be fittingly established in Forum and senate house, the
skyscraping mass of acquisitions will have no firm foundation.
Therefore it is to our purpose to know and, what is
more, to record the acts of censorial power.</p>
