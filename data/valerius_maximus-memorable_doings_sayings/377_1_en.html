found guilty of theft who had ridden a horse, the use of
which he had been loaned to go to Aricia, up a hill beyond
that town. What should we do at this point but praise the
scrupulousness of a period in which such minute departures
from honourable conduct were penalized?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_211_5" id="target_note_LCL493_211_5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<h3><span class="ac">3. Women who pleaded before
Magistrates for themselves
Or for others</span></h3>
<p>Nor should I be silent about those women whose natural
condition and the modesty of the matron’s robe could
not make them keep silent in the Forum and the courts
of law.</p>
<p>Maesia of Sentinum pleaded her own case as defendant
with Praetor L. Titius as president of the court and a great
concourse of people, going through all the forms and
stages of a defence not only thoroughly but boldly. She was
acquitted at the first hearing and by an almost unanimous
vote. Because she bore a man’s spirit under the form of a
woman, they called her Androgyne.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_211_1" id="target_note_LCL493_211_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Carfania, wife of the senator Licinius Buccio, was ever
ready for a lawsuit and always spoke on her own behalf before
the Praetor, not because she could not find advocates
but because she had impudence to spare. So by constantly
plaguing the tribunals with barkings to which the Forum
was unaccustomed she became a notorious example of
female litigiousness, so much so that women of shameless
habit are taunted with the name Carfania by way of reproach.
