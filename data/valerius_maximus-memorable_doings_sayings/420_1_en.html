what a pitch the insistent urge for unaccustomed finery
was leading or how far audacity victorious over the laws
would spread. If their minds could have envisaged those
feminine displays to which some more expensive novelty
has been added every day, they would have blocked the
career of extravagance at the very outset.</p>
<p>But why do I speak further of women, who are encouraged
by their mental infirmity and the denial of opportunity
for serious work to put all their efforts into the refining
of their personal adornment, when I see men of earlier
times, outstanding both in name and spirit, sliding into this
deviation unknown to ancient frugality, and when this is
evident from a quarrel between themselves?</p>
<p>Cn. Domitius reproached his colleague L. Crassus with
having columns of Hymettian marble in the portico of his
house. Crassus immediately asked him how much he considered
his own house to be worth. “Six million sesterces,”
was the reply. “Well then,” said Crassus, “how much less do
you think it will be worth if I cut down ten of your trees?”
“Just three million,” said Domitius. “So which of us is the
more extravagant, I, that bought ten columns for a hundred

with three million sesterces?”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_297_4" id="target_note_LCL493_297_4"><sup>4</sup></a> A conversation oblivious
of Pyrrhus, forgetful of Hannibal, already yawning at the
abundance of transmarine taxes! And yet how much more
restrained than the buildings and groves of subsequent
epochs * * * which they introduced! But they preferred to
leave to posterity the sumptuousness they initiated rather
than the continence they had received from their forebears.</p>
