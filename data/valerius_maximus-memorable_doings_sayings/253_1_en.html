on rose to the topmost pinnacle of empire.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_517_5a" id="target_note_LCL492_517_5a"><sup>5</sup></a> No doubt Sulla
and Marius and Cinna laughed at these examples, deeming
them foolish.</p>
<p>In the Latin War P. Decius Mus, who was the first to
bring the Consulship into his family, seeing the Roman line
of battle bending and almost laid low, devoted his life for
the salvation of the commonwealth and forthwith urging
on his horse broke into the midst of the enemy ranks, seeking
salvation for his country and death for himself. After
making a great slaughter, he fell on top of it, overwhelmed
with a multitude of missiles. From his wounds and blood
emerged an unhoped-for victory.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_517_6" id="target_note_LCL492_517_6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>The example of such a general would be unique had he
not begotten a son with a soul corresponding to his own.
For he in his fourth Consulship followed his father’s pattern:
with a similar devotion, an equally vigorous fight, and
a like end he restored the power of our city from collapse
and ruin.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_517_7" id="target_note_LCL492_517_7"><sup>7</sup></a> Thus it is hard to tell whether the Roman community
was more fortunate to have the Decii as generals or
to lose them; their lives were a bulwark against defeat,
their deaths brought victory.</p>
<p>The elder Scipio Africanus did not die for the commonwealth
but with admirable spirit saw to it that the commonwealth
should not die. Cast down by the disaster at
Cannae, our city seemed only booty for the conqueror
Hannibal, and so the remnants of the prostrated army

Livy 41.8.1, but that is preposterous; surely they were father and
son). If the story is to be taken seriously, the hero must be an earlier
P.
