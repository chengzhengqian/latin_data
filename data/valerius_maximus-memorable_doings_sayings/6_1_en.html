<p>L. Furius Bibaculus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_23_23" id="target_note_LCL492_23_23"><sup>23</sup></a> is overwhelmed by so many illustrious
Consulships and coming after Marcellus with difficulty
finds a place among our examples; yet he must not
be cheated of the credit due to his filial and religious spirit.
As Praetor, at the direction of his father who was head of
the College of Salii, he bore the sacred shields, preceded
by his six lictors, even though by virtue of his magistracy he
was entitled to exemption from this office. For our community
has ever held that all things must yield to religion,
even in the case of personages in whom it wished the
splendour of most exalted dignity to be displayed. So holders
of state power<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_23_24" id="target_note_LCL492_23_24"><sup>24</sup></a> never hesitated to minister to holy
things in the belief that theirs would be the governance of
human affairs only if they gave good and faithful service to
the power of the gods.</p>

them, they crossed the Pons Sublicius and began to ascend
the slope that leads to Janiculum. L. Albanius, who was
carrying his wife and daughters in a cart, saw them. Public
religion being closer to him than private affection, he told
his family to get down from the cart and put the Virgins and
cult objects into it, and abandoning the journey he had begun
took them to the town of Caere, where they were received
with profound reverence. Grateful memory bears
