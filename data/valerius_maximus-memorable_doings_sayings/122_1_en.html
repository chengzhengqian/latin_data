Tribune of the third legion, turned to his men. “We came
here, I see,” said he, “to be spectators of others’ valour. But
far be that dishonour from our blood that we Romans
should let ourselves yield in glory to Latins. I for one pray
to die with distinction or dare with a happy ending. Even

that nation, he left the table (one had been placed for him
to take luncheon as it chanced) and ordered his arms to be
carried outside the rampart and his horse led out secretly,
