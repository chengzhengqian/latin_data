dared a famous deed almost at the same time, certainly
against the same enemy and in the same Tiber. She had
been given hostage to Porsenna with other girls. Passing
the enemy guard at night, she mounted a horse and, swiftly
crossing the river, freed not only herself from the condition
of a hostage but her country from fear—a girl, holding
the light of valour before men.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_239_2" id="target_note_LCL492_239_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>I now come back to Romulus. Challenged to mortal
combat by Acro, king of Caenina, although he believed
himself to have the advantage both in numbers and in the
valour of his troops, and it would have been safer to go into
battle with his whole army than on his own, he preferred to
seize the omen of victory with his own right hand. Nor did
Fortune fail his undertaking. With Acro slain and the
enemy put to flight, Romulus brought <span class="italic">spolia opima</span> from
his foe to Jupiter Feretrius.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_239_3" id="target_note_LCL492_239_3"><sup>3</sup></a> So much for that; valour consecrated
by public religion needs no private encomium.</p>
<p>Next to Romulus, Cornelius Cossus consecrated spoils
to the same god when as Master of Horse he met in
battle and killed the leader of the Fidenates.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_239_4" id="target_note_LCL492_239_4"><sup>4</sup></a> Great was
Romulus, for he began this kind of glory at its inception.
Cossus too acquired much in that he was capable of imitating
Romulus.</p>
<p>Nor must we separate from these examples the memory
of M. Marcellus. Such vigour of courage was in him
that by the Po he with a few horsemen attacked the king of
the Gauls, who was surrounded by an enormous host, and
straightway slew him, stripped him of his arms, and dedicated
them to Jupiter Feretrius.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_239_5" id="target_note_LCL492_239_5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
