enemy would not take him, it ordered that he be put to
death in the public gaol. The majesty of empire was violated
once, but in how many ways did the senate persistently
wreak its wrath! It undid his act, took away his
liberty, extinguished his breath, maltreated his body with
the contumely of prison and the abhorred stigma of the
Gemonian Steps.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_35_6" id="target_note_LCL493_35_6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p><span class="italic">He</span> had earned the senate’s censure. Cn. Cornelius
Scipio, son of Hispalus, experienced it before he could
earn it. When the province of Spain fell to him by lot, the
senate decreed that he should not go there, giving as reason
that he did not know how to do the right thing. So because
he had led a discreditable life Cornelius was all but
found guilty under the extortion law without any provincial
service.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_35_7a" id="target_note_LCL493_35_7a"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>Nor was the senate’s severity idle in the case of C.
Vettienus, who had cut off two fingers of his left hand to
avoid service in the Italian War. It decreed that his property
be confiscated and himself punished with chains in
perpetuity. By its action he wore out disgracefully in bonds
the life which he had not been willing to give honourably in
battle.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_35_8" id="target_note_LCL493_35_8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>Consul M’. Curius imitated that action. He was obliged
to proclaim a sudden levy, and none of the juniors answered.
So he put all the tribes into a lottery and ordered
that the first name in the Pollia, whose lot had come out
first, should be drawn from the urn and called. When there
was no answer, he put the young man’s property up for auction.
