keep from his house the stain of outrage, did not spare his
own flesh and blood. For when the Decemvir Ap. Claudius,
relying on the power of his office, persistently sought
to ravish his daughter, he brought the girl to the Forum
and killed her, preferring to be the slayer of a chaste
daughter than the father of a defiled one.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_5_2" id="target_note_LCL493_5_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>No less strong-minded was Pontius Aufidianus, a Roman
knight. Learning that his daughter’s virginity had
been betrayed to Fannius Saturninus by her tutor, he was
not content to punish the rascally slave, he also killed the
girl herself. Rather than celebrate a disgraceful marriage,
he gave her an untimely funeral.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_5_3" id="target_note_LCL493_5_3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

prove! He put to death a freedman, a great favourite of his,
on learning that he had given a kiss to his daughter, a girl of
marriageable age, even though he could seem to have done
it in error, not lust. But Maenius thought it important that
the discipline of chastity be implanted in the girl’s still tender
feelings by the harshness of the punishment; and by so
terrible an example he taught her that she must bring to
her husband not only unsullied virginity but pure kisses.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_5_4" id="target_note_LCL493_5_4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>Q. Fabius Maximus Servilianus, who consummated offices
which he had filled with the utmost distinction by the
grave function of Censor, exacted punishment from a son
of dubious chastity and paid penalty to him he punished,
shunning the sight of his country in voluntary retirement.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_5_5a" id="target_note_LCL493_5_5a"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
