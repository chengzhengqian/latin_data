<p>To this cruelty no addition seems possible, but C.
Toranius outdid it in the ferocity of his parricide.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_363_5" id="target_note_LCL493_363_5"><sup>5</sup></a> A partisan
of the Triumvirs, he gave the Centurions who were in
pursuit of his proscribed father, an ex-Praetor and a man of
note, details of his hiding place, age, and bodily marks
by which he could be recognized. The old man, who was
more concerned about his son’s life and advancement than
about what was left of his own breath, started to ask them
whether he was safe and in good standing with the generals.
One of them replied: “Your son, whom you love so
dearly, pointed you out. You die on his information,” and
forthwith ran him through the heart with his sword. So the
unfortunate man collapsed, more unhappy in the author of
his murder than in the murder itself.</p>
<p>L. Villius Annalis fell upon the same bitter fate. Coming
down to the Campus to his son’s quaestorian elections,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_363_6" id="target_note_LCL493_363_6"><sup>6</sup></a> he
learned that he himself had been proscribed and took refuge
with a client. The latter’s loyalty could not save him because
of the crime of the wicked young man, who led the
soldiers along his father’s very tracks and put him in their
way to be killed in his sight; twice a parricide, first by intent
and again by eyewitness.</p>
<p>The end of the proscribed Vettius Salassus too was
bitter enough. As he was in hiding, his wife—shall I say
handed him over to be killed or slaughtered him herself?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_363_7" id="target_note_LCL493_363_7"><sup>7</sup></a>
Is a crime which lacks only the hand less a crime?</p>
