joined one to another by the bond of affection and also by
partnership in all virtues, just as they followed the path of
active life with equal tread, so did they find relief together

up shells and pebbles wandering on the beaches of Caieta
and Laurentum, and P. Crassus often declared that he
had learned this from his father-in-law Scaevola, who was
Laelius’ son-in-law.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_243_1" id="target_note_LCL493_243_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Scaevola, who was the most reliable witness to their repose
and relaxation, is reported to have been an excellent
ball player; no doubt because he used to divert his mind to

between his legs.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_243_3" id="target_note_LCL493_243_3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>Homer too, poet of celestial genius, felt no differently
when he put the tuneful lyre into Achilles’ violent hands to
relax their soldierly strength in a mild pursuit of peace.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_243_4" id="target_note_LCL493_243_4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
