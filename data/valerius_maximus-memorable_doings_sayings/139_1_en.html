<p>Whom Euripides had for a father or Demosthenes for a

From Famous Parents</span></h3>
<p>The part of my twofold promise that follows must be
delivered after the masks of illustrious men have been
veiled, since I have to tell of those who degenerated from
their splendour, noble monsters steeped in the foulest filth
of sloth and rascality.</p>

Africanus?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_289_1a" id="target_note_LCL492_289_1a"><sup>1</sup></a> Born into so much domestic glory, he let
himself be captured by a tiny detachment of king Antiochus’

Cicero (<span class="italic">Brut.</span> 77, <span class="italic">Sen.</span> 35, <span class="italic">Off.</span> 1.121) and is probably due to confusion
with another Scipio, though Velleius too is unfavourable (1.10.3). For the capture by Antiochus III cf.VM2.10.2a. Münzer
(RE Cornelius 325) held that Valerius’ target was another son of
Africanus, L. Scipio, Praetor in 174. But another son, with a remarkable
and scandalous record, would surely have emerged in
other sources, especially Cicero. VM 3.5.1b, however, does seem
to refer to this L. Scipio; see VM 4.5.3 and Broughton I.406 n. 2.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL492_289_1a').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL492_289_2"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL492_289_2" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">2</sup>Africanus and Asiaticus.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL492_289_2').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
