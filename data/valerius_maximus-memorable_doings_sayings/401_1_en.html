<span class="label"><span class="sc">that some things cannot be
effected by any art</span></span>
<p>Even as Nature often allows Art to emulate her powers,
so sometimes she lets her go frustrated with labour
in vain, as the hands of the great artist Euphranor discovered.
When he was painting the twelve gods in Athens, he
endowed the image of Neptune with the most striking
colours of majesty he could muster, as though intending to
exhibit Jupiter in guise yet more august. But he had exhausted
all the force of his imagination in the earlier work
and his later attempts could not rise to their objective.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_259_8" id="target_note_LCL493_259_8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>Consider too that other no less famous painter who
portrayed the grievous sacrifice of immolated Iphigenia,
placing a sad Calchas, a mournful Ulysses, and a lamenting
Menelaus around the altar. Did he not confess by veiling
Agamemnon’s head that the bitterness of deepest grief
cannot be expressed in art? So his painting is wet with the
tears of the soothsayer and the friend and the brother, but
left the father’s weeping to be judged by the emotion of the
spectator.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_259_9" id="target_note_LCL493_259_9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>And to add an example from the same field of endeavour,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_259_10" id="target_note_LCL493_259_10"><sup>10</sup></a>
a painter of outstanding quality presented in his industrious
toil a horse, almost alive, returning from exercise.
Wishing to add foam to the horse’s nostrils, great artist
that he was, he laboured much and long in vain upon so
petty a subject. Then in a fit of anger he seized a sponge
impregnated with all colours which happened to be beside
him and dashed it against the panel as though to destroy
his work. Fortune directed it right at the horse’s nostrils
