then a civil one. But as he played the role of a pernicious
Tribune of the Plebs before that of a well-established citizen,
his own law carried him off, caught in a noose of his
own tightening.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_223_5" id="target_note_LCL493_223_5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<h3><span class="ac">7. On Study And Diligence</span></h3>
<p>Why do I delay to record the power of Diligence? By
her active spirit military service is fortified, civilian glory
fired, all studies are received in her faithful bosom and
nourished, whatever is admirable in mind, hand, or tongue
is brought to the acme of excellence. By diligence virtue
even at its most perfect is confirmed through a hardening
of itself.</p>
<p>In his eighty-sixth year Cato took part in public affairs
with the spirit of a young man. Prosecuted by his enemies
on a capital charge, he pleaded his own case, nor did anyone
notice that his memory was slower or the strength of
his lungs in any degree enfeebled or his mouth impeded by
hesitation.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_223_1" id="target_note_LCL493_223_1"><sup>1</sup></a> For by steady and perpetual diligence he used
to keep all these things in going order. Even at the very end
of his extremely long life he countered the defence of
Galba, a very eloquent orator, with his accusation on behalf
of Spain.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_223_2" id="target_note_LCL493_223_2"><sup>2</sup></a> He also formed a wish to be instructed in
Greek literature,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_223_3" id="target_note_LCL493_223_3"><sup>3</sup></a> at how late in the day we may judge from
the fact that he was almost an old man when he learned
Latin literature. And although he had won great fame in
eloquence, he made himself a past master of civil law as
well.</p>
