destruction was portended by the celestial warning, Pericles
came forward and discoursed on what he had learned
from his teacher Anaxagoras pertaining to the courses of
the sun and moon. Nor did he let his countrymen tremble
any longer in their baseless fear.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_257_3" id="target_note_LCL493_257_3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>Moreover, how great do we suppose was the respect
paid by king Alexander to the dignity of art, who would
have himself painted only by Apelles and sculpted only by
Lysippus?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_257_4" id="target_note_LCL493_257_4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>Vulcan, fabricated by the hands of Alcamenes, engrosses
visitors in Athens. Besides other outstanding manifestations
of artistic perfection in that statue, they are
struck with how in its stance it offers a gentle hint of lameness
disguised under the drapery, not reproaching as a

<p>Praxiteles set up Vulcan’s consort breathing as it were in

providing some excuse for the mistake of a stallion which
on seeing the picture of a mare could not help neighing, or
of the dogs which the sight of a dog in a painting caused to
bark, or of the bull in Syracuse that was driven to erotic
intercourse with a bronze cow7 by the stimulus of too close
a likeness. For why should we be surprised that animals
void of reason should be deceived by art, when we see a
human being’s sacrilegious lust excited by the outlines of
voiceless stone?</p>
