<p>Xerxes now, in whose name dwells pride and outrageousness,
was insolent as of right, in that when he was
about to declare war on Greece, he summoned the leading
men of Asia and said: “I have brought you together so I
might not seem to have used only my own counsel. Remember,
however, that your function is to obey rather than
to advise.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_339_7" id="target_note_LCL493_339_7"><sup>7</sup></a> An arrogant speech, even if he had had the luck
to return to his palace victorious; in the mouth of one so
disgracefully vanquished, whether more insolent or more

<p>Elated by his victory at Cannae, Hannibal did not give
admission to any of his countrymen in camp or reply to
anyone except through an intermediary. Even when Maharbal
announced in a loud voice in front of his tent that he
had seen a way for him to dine on the Capitol in Rome in a
few days time, he rebuffed him.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_339_8a" id="target_note_LCL493_339_8a"><sup>8</sup></a> So hard is it for good fortune
and moderation to share quarters.</p>
<p>There was a sort of competition in insolence between
the senates of Carthage and Campania. The former used
baths separated from the common folk, the latter a different

quite a long time is evident <span class="italic">inter alia</span> from C. Gracchus’
speech against Plautius.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_339_9" id="target_note_LCL493_339_9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>

dragged from its lurking place. Its most effective strength
