<p>The outstanding successes of Spartan valour are followed
by pitiable failure. Epaminondas was Thebes’ greatest
felicity and Lacedaemon’s first disaster. When he had
hammered that city’s ancient glory and hitherto undefeated
public valour in battles won at Leuctra and
Mantinea, he was run through by a spear. As blood and
breath failed, he asked those who were trying to rally him,
first whether his shield was safe, and then whether the enemy
had been thoroughly routed. Learning that these matters
were as he wished, he said: “Comrades, this is not the
end of my life, but a better and bigger beginning. For
now your Epaminondas is being born because he is dying
thus. I see Thebes made head of Greece by my auspices
and leadership. The brave, proud Spartan state lies low,
cast down by our arms. Greece has been freed from a
harsh despotism. I die childless, and yet not without children
since I leave my wonderful daughters, Leuctra and
Mantinea.” Then he ordered the spear drawn out of his
body and expired with the countenance with which, had
the immortal gods permitted him to enjoy his victories, he
would have lived to enter his country’s walls.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_267_46" id="target_note_LCL492_267_46"><sup>46</sup></a></p>

of the Thirty Tyrants and playfully dashed what was left
