fought with distinction and came out a hero.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_447_10" id="target_note_LCL492_447_10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>And now, how illustrious and memorable an example
should the mercy of M. Marcellus be accounted! After taking
Syracuse he established himself in the citadel, so that
he could survey from aloft the condition of the city, once so
powerful but then in affliction. But gazing on her sad fate,
he could not check his tears.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_447_11" id="target_note_LCL492_447_11"><sup>11</sup></a> If someone not knowing the
man had seen him, he would have thought that the victory
had been another’s. And so, community of Syracuse, mingled
with your dire calamity you had some cause for rejoicing,
since if it was not your destiny to stand intact, your fall
was soft under so compassionate a conqueror.</p>
<p>Q. Metellus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_447_12" id="target_note_LCL492_447_12"><sup>12</sup></a> while fighting the Celtiberian War in
Spain, was besieging the city of Centobriga. He had already
moved up an engine and seemed on the point of demolishing
the only part of the wall that could be shattered;
but he preferred humanity to the victory within his grasp.
The Centobrigians had put the sons of Rhoetogenes, who
had deserted to him, in the way of the batterings of the machine.
Rather than let the boys die a cruel death before
their father’s eyes, although Rhoetogenes himself assured
him that he was not hindering the completion of the assault
even if it meant the destruction of his own flesh and
blood, Metellus raised the siege. By so merciful an act he
won, not the walls of a single community, but the hearts of
all Celtiberian cities, with the result that he did not need
many sieges to bring them under the dominion of the
Roman people.</p>
