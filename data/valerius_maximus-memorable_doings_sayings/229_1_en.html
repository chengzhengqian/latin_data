by victories, did not scruple as Consul to beg the people on
behalf of Q. Calidius, a candidate for the Praetorship,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_469_8" id="target_note_LCL492_469_8"><sup>8</sup></a> because
as Tribune he had carried a law restoring his father
to the community. Indeed he always referred to Calidius as
the patron of his house and family. Nor did he thereby detract
in any way from the position of leadership which was
his beyond question, because he lowered his outstanding
dignity before the signal desert of one much his inferior
not in a spirit of humility but of gratitude.</p>
<p>To C. Marius came an impulse of gratitude not only
preeminent but prepotent. In the heat of battle he gave
citizenship contrary to treaty terms to two cohorts of
Camertes who were resisting the assault of the Cimbri
with extraordinary valour. He excused his action with a
true and excellent saying, that in the din of weapons he
could not hear the words of civil law. And indeed the time
was such that it behoved to defend the laws rather than to
hear them.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_469_9" id="target_note_LCL492_469_9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>Everywhere L. Sulla treads upon the footsteps of C.
Marius in rivalry of glory. As Dictator he always uncovered
his head and rose from his chair and dismounted from his
horse before Cn. Pompeius, who was still a private citizen,
and stated openly at a public meeting that he did this
gladly, remembering that Pompey at eighteen years of age
had brought his father’s army to aid the Sullan cause. Many
distinctions came Pompey’s way, but perhaps none more
admirable than this, that by the magnitude of his benefaction
he made Sulla forget himself.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_469_10" id="target_note_LCL492_469_10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>In utmost splendour let there be a place even for
humble gratitude. Praetor M. Cornutus was letting out a
contract by order of the senate for the funeral of Hirtius
