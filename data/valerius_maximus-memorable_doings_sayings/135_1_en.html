<p>Among the Indians the exercise of fortitude is believed
to be practised with such determination that some of them
spend their entire lives naked, now hardening their bodies
with the icy cold of Mount Caucasus, now exposing them
without a groan to flames. No small glory do they acquire
by contempt of pain and are granted the title of wisdom.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_281_8" id="target_note_LCL492_281_8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>These examples come from high and learned breasts,
but one no less admirable was compassed by the soul of a
slave. A barbarian slave, angry with Hasdrubal because he
had killed his master, suddenly attacked and slew him.
Apprehended, he suffered all manner of torments, but
resolutely maintained upon his face the joy his vengeance
had given him.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_281_9" id="target_note_LCL492_281_9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>So Virtueâ€™s access is not fastidious. She suffers lively
dispositions stirred to action to enter her presence and
gives them a draught of herself that is not generous or
grudging from discrimination of persons. Equally available
to all, she assesses the desire you bring, not your station,
and in the taking in of her good things she leaves the
weight for you yourself to determine, so that you carry
away with you just so much as you can bring your mind to
sustain. So it happens on the one hand that persons born in
humble circumstances rise to the highest dignity and on
the other that offshoots of the noblest family trees fall back
into some disgrace and turn the light they received from
their ancestors to darkness. This will be made plainer by
relevant examples. First I shall begin with those whose
change of status for the better provides matter that shines
in the telling.</p>
