<p>To these fatalities C. Plotius Plancus, brother of ex-
Consul and Censor Munatius Plancus, added himself. Proscribed
by the Triumvirs, he was hiding in the Salernum
district, but his somewhat luxurious way of living and the
odour of perfume uncovered his life’s concealed safekeeping.
For by these traces the keen attention of those in pursuit
of such unfortunates was drawn and got wind of the secret
lair of the fugitive. They arrested his slaves as he lay
hidden and tortured them much and long, but they maintained

imagine the sudden inrush of the soldiers, the door bolts
forced, the threatening words, the fierce visages, the
gleaming weapons, we shall make a true estimate of the
case, nor think that in the time it takes to say that one man
chose to die for another the thing could actually have been
done so easily. Panapio acknowledged how much he owed
