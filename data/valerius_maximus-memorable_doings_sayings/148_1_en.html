<p>Whoever approves his action must not disapprove the
plan of L. Crassus, who was most famous for eloquence in
our ancestors’ time. After his Consulship<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_307_16" id="target_note_LCL492_307_16"><sup>16</sup></a> he governed
the province of Gaul.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_307_17" id="target_note_LCL492_307_17"><sup>17</sup></a> To that province came C. Carbo,
whose father he had convicted, to spy upon his doings.
Not only did Crassus not remove him from the scene, he
went further, assigning him a place on his platform and
taking cognizance of nothing without putting Carbo on his
advisory board. So the keen and bitter Carbo got nothing

brought up by them before a public court he asked that Ti.
Gracchus, with whom he had disagreed on public affairs to

<p>M. Scaurus had the same fortune, an old age equally

of taking a bribe from king Mithridates to betray the commonwealth,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_307_20" id="target_note_LCL492_307_20"><sup>20</sup></a>
