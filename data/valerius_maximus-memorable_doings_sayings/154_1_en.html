<h3><span class="ac">8. Of Resolution</span></h3>
<p>Now that I have been through the open and highspirited
soul of good confidence, another task is, as it were,
due: to portray resolution. For Nature has so arranged it
that whoever is confident that he has rightly and properly
set his mind on something will defend it vigorously against
criticism if it is already accomplished and if not yet realized
will bring it into effect without hesitation in the face of
any obstruction.</p>
<p>But as I look for examples of what I have in mind and
cast widely around, the resolution of Fulvius Flaccus offers
itself before all others. He had taken Capua by force of
arms, which city had been persuaded by Hannibal’s deceptive
promises to bargain for rule over Italy in return for her
wicked defection. As just in assessing enemies’ guilt as he
was brilliant in victory, he determined to wipe out utterly
the Campanian senate, author of that impious decree. So
he loaded them with chains and divided them between
two prisons, one in Teanum, the other in Cales, intending
to carry out his resolve as soon as he had disposed of matters
which seemed to need prior handling. But a rumour
arose about a more lenient decision by the senate. On this,
lest the criminals escape due punishment, Fulvius took
horse at night and galloped to Teanum. When those in custody
there had been killed, he immediately passed on to
Cales to accomplish the task on which his mind was set.
The enemies had already been bound to the stake when he
received a despatch from the Conscript Fathers sparing
the Campanians—but in vain. For Fulvius put it by in his
left hand as it had been delivered and ordered the lictor to
do his duty, opening it only after it could no longer be complied
