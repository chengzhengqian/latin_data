<p>Providence brought it about that when the city had
been broken up by the Gauls and the Conscript Fathers
were deliberating whether to migrate to Veii or restore
their own buildings,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_57_1" id="target_note_LCL492_57_1"><sup>1</sup></a> at that time some cohorts<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_57_2" id="target_note_LCL492_57_2"><sup>2</sup></a> chanced to
