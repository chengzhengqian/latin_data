Hephaestion bearing him company. At his coming the
mother of Darius revived, raised her prostrate head from
the ground and saluted Hephaestion with homage in the
Persian fashion, taking him for Alexander because in stature
and appearance he had the advantage. Advised of her
mistake, she cast about in the utmost trepidation for words
of apology. “You have no need,” said Alexander, “to be embarrassed
on this account. He too is Alexander.” Which of
the two are we to congratulate first? Him who had the will
to say this or him who had the good fortune to hear it? The
magnanimous monarch, who had already embraced the
entire globe by his victories or expectations, in so few
words shared himself with his companion. Oh gift of famous
utterance, honourable to the giver as to the receiver!</p>
<p>Privately too I reverence this with good reason, having
experienced the readiest of benevolence toward me
from a most illustrious and eloquent gentleman.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_427_13" id="target_note_LCL492_427_13"><sup>13</sup></a> Nor am
I afraid lest it be amiss for my friend Pompeius to be for
me the like of Alexander, seeing that to him his friend
Hephaestion was another Alexander. But I should be open
to the gravest reproach if I passed through the examples of
constant and affectionate friendship without any mention
of Pompeius. In his mind as in the hearts of loving parents
my life’s happier condition thrived, its sadder found comfort.
From him I received, freely presented, increase of every
benefit, through him I stood less vulnerable against
turns of Fortune. Under his leadership and auspices my
studies became brighter and keener. And so I gratified the
envy of some by the loss of the best of friends, because I
had no doubt tormented them by my enjoyment of the
friendship—not that I deserved this, since I always shared
any interest I might have with those who wished to use it.
