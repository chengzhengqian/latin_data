he seized the latter’s ear between his teeth and did
not let go until he himself had been deprived of his life and
the other of a part of his body.</p>
<p>His fortitude was emulated by Anaxarchus. Tortured by
the tyrant of Cyprus, Nicocreon, no violence could stop
him from torturing the tyrant in his turn with lashings of
the most wounding insults. At last Nicocreon threatened
to cut off his tongue, to which Anaxarchus replied: “Womanish
young man, this part of my body at least will not be in
your power,” and straight away he cut off his tongue with
his teeth, chewed it up, and spat it into the other’s mouth,
which was open in fury. That tongue had held the ears of
many lost in admiration, above all king Alexander’s, as it
wisely and eloquently expounded the state of the earth, the
condition of the sea, the movements of the stars, in fine the
nature of the entire universe. But it perished almost more
gloriously than it flourished, because by so brave an end it
validated the illustrious performance of what it professed
and not only adorned Anaxarchus’ life but rendered his
death more renowned.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_279_6" id="target_note_LCL492_279_6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>On Theodotus too, a highly respected personage, the
tyrant Hieronymus vainly wearied the hands of torturers.
He broke the scourges, relaxed the cords, loosened the
rack, and extinguished the hot plates before he could make
him reveal his accomplices in tyrannicide. More than that,
Theodotus smeared with false accusation a henchman on
whom the entire despotism turned as on a hinge and so
tore a loyal guardian from the tyrant’s side, not only by virtue
of fortitude covering what lay concealed but avenging
his own torments, torments through which Hieronymus in
eagerly mangling his enemy rashly lost his friend.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_279_7" id="target_note_LCL492_279_7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
