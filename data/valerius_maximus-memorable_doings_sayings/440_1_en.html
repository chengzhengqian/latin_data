<p>How insolent, moreover, the conduct of Cn. Pompeius!
Coming from his bath he left Hypsaeus, who was under
prosecution for electoral malpractice, a nobleman and a
friend, lying at his feet after trampling him with an insult.
For he told him that he was doing nothing but hold up his
(Pompey’s) dinner; and with this speech on his mind he
could dine without a qualm.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_337_3" id="target_note_LCL493_337_3"><sup>3</sup></a> But even in the Forum he did
not blush to ask the jury to acquit his father-in-law P. Scipio
as a present to himself when Scipio was answerable to the
laws that Pompey himself had carried, and that too when a
great many illustrious defendants were coming to grief.
The blandishments of the nuptial bed made him violate
the stability of the commonwealth.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_337_4" id="target_note_LCL493_337_4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>Horrible was a dinner of Mark Antony’s in act and word
alike. The head of Caesetius Rufus, a senator, being
brought to him as Triumvir, the rest of the company
averted their eyes but Antony ordered it moved closer and
contemplated it long and carefully. Then, as they all waited
to hear what he would say, he remarked, “I didn’t know this
fellow.” In speaking of a senator an arrogant admission, in
speaking of one put to death an outrageous one.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_337_5" id="target_note_LCL493_337_5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

<p>Enough of native examples, let external ones now be
added. The prowess and good fortune of king Alexander
ran riot in three conspicuous stages of insolence.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_337_6" id="target_note_LCL493_337_6"><sup>6</sup></a> Despising
Philip he adopted Jupiter Hammon as his father;
wearying of Macedonian manners and attire he took up
Persian dress and customs; scorning mortal state he imitated
divine. He was not ashamed to falsify his identity as a
son, a citizen, and a human being.</p>
