breathed his last just as he was meditating upon his wicked
deceit and ingratitude. It was like a torturer tormenting his
mind within, as he saw that his passage from life to death
was hateful to the gods above and would be detestable to
those below.</p>
<p>M. Popillius, a man of senatorial rank, had a close
friend from boyhood, Oppius Gallus. While he lay dying,
as befitted their longstanding bond of amity, he looked at
Gallus lovingly and spoke to him in words evincive of great
affection. Of many who were present he judged Gallus
alone worthy of his last embrace and kiss. Furthermore, he
gave Gallus his rings, presumably to make sure he lost
nothing of that inheritance which he was not about to receive.
Gallus, one who loved those close to him but the object
of his dying friend’s contumelious mockery, put them
in a purse, had them sealed by those present, and gave
them with all care to Popillius’ heirs, of whom he was not
one. A most shabby and untimely jest! A senator of the Roman
people, just out of the senate house, a man presently
to lose life’s enjoyments, chose the sacred ties of friendship
as something to abuse with a scurrilous jape, even as death
weighed upon his eyelids and his breath gave its final
gasps.</p>
