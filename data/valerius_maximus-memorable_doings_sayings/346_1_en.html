same time as their supports were defecting. Therefore
Tullus took measures to prevent that. Spurring his horse,
he rode through all the knots of combatants calling out that
Mettius had withdrawn on his orders and would attack the
rear of the Fidenates when he himself gave the signal. By
this device of generalship he changed fear into confidence
and filled the hearts of his men with eagerness instead of
terror.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_149_1" id="target_note_LCL493_149_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>And not to leave our kings just yet, Sex. Tarquinius, son
of Tarquin, took it hard that Gabii could not be stormed by
his father’s power. So he thought of a method stronger than
arms whereby to capture the town and add it to Roman
empire. He suddenly betook himself to the Gabini as
though fleeing from his parent’s cruelty and stripes, which
he had suffered of his own accord. Step by step, with false,
manufactured blandishments he won the good will of each
individual so as to become highly influential with them all.
He then sent a comrade to his father to tell him how he had
everything in his own hands and to ask what he wished
done. The old man’s astuteness matched the young man’s
cunning. Tarquin was highly delighted by the message, but
not altogether trusting the honesty of the messenger he
gave no answer but drew him aside into the garden and
there with his stick struck down the heads of the largest
and tallest poppies. Young Sextus, hearing of his father’s silence
and of what he did, understood the reason for the
one and the meaning of the other, not failing to realise that
he was being advised to get rid of the most prominent citizens
of Gabii by banishment or liquidate them by death. So
he virtually handed over the community with hands bound
to Tarquin, stripped of its loyal defenders.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_149_2" id="target_note_LCL493_149_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
