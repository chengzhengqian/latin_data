over whom L. Scipio would presently display a splendid
triumph before the eyes of gods and men.</p>
<p>The same as a candidate for the Praetorship brought his
white gown into the Campus so debased by spots of turpitude
that had he not been assisted by the influence of
Cicereius, who had been his father’s secretary,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_291_3" id="target_note_LCL492_291_3"><sup>3</sup></a> it looked as
though the people would not have given him the honour.
And yet what difference did it make whether he brought
home a rejection or a Praetorship so obtained? Aware that
he defiled the office, his relatives saw to it that he should
