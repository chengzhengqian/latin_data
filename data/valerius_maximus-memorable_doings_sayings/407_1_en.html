hundredth year without any sign of old age. But Xenophon,
whose “Circumnavigation” is read, is much more
generous, giving the king of Latmos island eight hundred
years of life. And so that his father should not seem hardly
done by, he assigned him too six hundred years.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_271_14" id="target_note_LCL493_271_14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<h3><span class="ac">14. Of Appetite for Glory</span></h3>
<p>Whence comes glory? What is it like? How should it be
gained? Is it better neglected by virtue as unnecessary? I
leave these questions to those who take pains in contemplating
such matters and who have the faculty to express
eloquently what they have wisely observed. In this work I
am content to give to deeds their doers and to doers their
deeds, and shall attempt to show by appropriate examples
how strong the appetite for it is wont to be.</p>
<p>The elder Africanus wanted the portrait of the poet
Ennius placed among the monuments of the Cornelian
clan because he judged that by Ennius’ genius his own performances
had been illuminated. He was not ignorant that
as long as Roman empire flourished and Africa lay subject
at Italy’s feet and the citadel of the Capitol possessed the
topmost pinnacle of the globe their memory could not be
extinguished, but he thought it of great moment that the
light of letters too should accrue to them. A man worthy to
be celebrated by Homer rather than in rude, unpolished
strains.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_271_1" id="target_note_LCL493_271_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>D. Brutus, a famous general in his own time, showed a
similar disposition to honour the poet Accius. Pleased with
his familiar attentions and ready encomiums, he decorated
the approaches to the temples which he had consecrated
out of his spoils with Accius’ verses.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_271_2" id="target_note_LCL493_271_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
