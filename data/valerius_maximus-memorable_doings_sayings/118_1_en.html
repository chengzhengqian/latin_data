<p>This spirit of the soldier in adversity was as extraordinary
and manly as the general’s which I am about to relate.
P. Crassus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_247_18" id="target_note_LCL492_247_18"><sup>18</sup></a> was waging war in Asia against Aristonicus,
when he was captured between Elaea and Myrina by
Thracians, of whom Aristonicus had a large number in his
army. To avoid falling into his power Crassus escaped dishonour
by a mode of death of his own inviting. He thrust a
rod which he had used for governing his horse into the eye
of one of the barbarians. Infuriated by the violence of the
pain, the man drove his dagger deep into Crassus’ side, and
in avenging himself freed the Roman general from the disgrace
of lost majesty. Crassus showed Fortune how little
the man on whom she had wished to inflict so grievous a
humiliation deserved it, breaking the pitiable bonds she
had laid on his liberty no less wisely than bravely. Already
given over to Aristonicus, he returned himself to his dignity.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_247_19" id="target_note_LCL492_247_19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>Scipio Metellus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_247_20" id="target_note_LCL492_247_20"><sup>20</sup></a> acted with the same determination.
He had unsuccessfully defended the cause of his
son-in-law Cn. Pompeius in Africa and was making for
Spain by sea. Seeing that the ship in which he was sailing
had been taken by the enemy, he ran a sword through his
breast. Then as he lay prostrate in the poop, he answered
the Caesarian soldiers who asked where the general was,
“The general is all right.” He could speak just so much
as sufficed to testify to his bravery for his everlasting
renown.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_247_21" id="target_note_LCL492_247_21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>Utica is a monument to your illustrious end, Cato,
where from your bravest of wounds more glory flowed
