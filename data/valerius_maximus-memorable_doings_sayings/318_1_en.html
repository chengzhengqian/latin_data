and body. Judged too humble for the honours of Arpinum,
he ventured to stand for the Quaestorship in Rome. Then
by his patience under rebuffs he did not so much enter the
senate as break into it. In standing for the Tribunate and
the Aedileship too he met with a similar electoral stigma,
and as a candidate for the Praetorship hung on in the last
place, which however he held not without risk; for accused
of malpractice, he won an acquittal from the jury with the
utmost difficulty. From that Marius, so lowly in Arpinum,
so inglorious in Rome, so contemptible a candidate,
emerged the Marius who subdued Africa, drove king
Jugurtha before his chariot, destroyed the hosts of the
Teutones and Cimbri, whose two trophies are seen in the
city, whose seven Consulships are read in the Fasti, to
whom it fell to become Consul after exile and to make a
proscription after having been proscribed. What more unstable
or changeable than his condition? If you put him
among the wretched, he was wretched indeed; if among
the fortunate, none will be found as fortunate as he.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_93_17" id="target_note_LCL493_93_17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>

of Pharmacussa and ransomed himself for fifty talents.
So Fortune willed that the brightest star in the universe
should be exchanged for a small sum in a pirate
galley. So why should we complain of her any more if she
does not spare even her partners in deity? But the celestial
power avenged itself for the insult; for presently Caesar
captured the pirates and crucified them.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_93_18" id="target_note_LCL493_93_18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
