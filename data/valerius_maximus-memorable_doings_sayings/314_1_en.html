<p>Scipio Africanus the elder, whom the immortal gods
wished born so that there might be a man in whom virtue
could effectively show herself to mankind in all her aspects,
is said to have led a rather loose life in his first years
as a young man; they were well removed to be sure from
the reproach of dissipation but still not quite tough enough
for the Punic trophies and the yoke planted on the neck of
vanquished Carthage.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_85_2" id="target_note_LCL493_85_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>C. Valerius Flaccus too at the time of the Second Punic
War began with a youth of ruinous extravagance. But when
he was made a Flamen by Chief Pontiff P. Licinius,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_85_3" id="target_note_LCL493_85_3"><sup>3</sup></a> to
withdraw from his vices the more easily he turned his mind
to the care of sacred things and ceremonies, using religion
as his guide to good conduct. Earlier an example of dissipation,
he later became no less a pattern of propriety and
purity.</p>
<p>Our community had no more disreputable member at
that time than Q. Fabius Maximus in his young days, who
by victory in Gaul<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_85_4" id="target_note_LCL493_85_4"><sup>4</sup></a> won for himself and his descendants
the surname of Allobrogicus; and none in that era was
more distinguished or respectable than the same in old
age.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that Q. Catulus’ reputation stood at a
lofty level in a great plenty of illustrious men. If his earlier
life were to be reviewed, many frolics and indulgences
would be found. They did not hinder him from becoming
the leading man in the country or prevent his name shining
at the summit of the Capitol<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_85_5" id="target_note_LCL493_85_5"><sup>5</sup></a> or stop him from burying by
his valour the mighty upheaval of a rising civil war.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_85_6" id="target_note_LCL493_85_6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
