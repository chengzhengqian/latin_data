<p>Well done too that flower of the equestrian order
through whose extraordinary valour Master of Horse
Fabius Maximus Rullianus in war against the Samnites escaped
the reproach of battle badly joined. When Papirius
Cursor left for the city to seek new auspices, Fabius was
put in command and forbidden to lead the army into
battle. None the less he engaged the enemy, but no less
unsuccessfully than rashly; beyond a doubt he was getting
the worst of it. But our noble warriors took the bridles off
their horses and spurring vigorously drove them into the
Samnite ranks. Thus by determination and ready courage
they wrested victory from the enemies’ grasp and restored
it along with the promise of a great citizen to their country.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_245_14" id="target_note_LCL492_245_14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>And then how stout were those soldiers who pulled
back to shore a Punic ship urged in flight by vigorous
oarstrokes, as they swam in the slippery places of the sea
(?) like infantry on solid ground!<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_245_15" id="target_note_LCL492_245_15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>Of the same period and stripe was a soldier at the
battle of Cannae, in which Hannibal battered the Romans’
strength rather than broke their spirit. His wounded hands
were useless for holding arms, so clasping the neck of a
Numidian<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_245_16" id="target_note_LCL492_245_16"><sup>16</sup></a> who was trying to despoil him, he gnawed
the man’s nose and ears, disfiguring his face, and expired
vengefully biting. Put aside the iniquitous outcome of the
battle, how much braver was the slain than the slayer! Vulnerable
in victory, the Carthaginian consoled his dying foe,
the Roman in the final moments of his life became his own
avenger.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_245_17" id="target_note_LCL492_245_17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
