his pulse as it grew rapid or languid discovered the nature
of his sickness. At once he told Seleucus, who did not hesitate
to turn his wife, who was very dear to him, over to his
son, regarding the latter’s falling in love as the work of Fortune
but crediting to his modesty his readiness to conceal
that love to the point of death. Imagine the old man, a king
and a lover; it will soon be plain how many and difficult
were the obstacles over which the fondness of a father’s

<p>Seleucus gave up his wife, whereas Ariobarzanes
yielded the kingdom of Cappadocia to <span class="italic">his</span> son in the presence

saw his son in the scribe’s corner, occupying a place beneath
his rank. He could not bear to see him placed below
himself, but at once got down from his chair and transferred
the diadem to his son’s head, telling him to move to

could not go where he was told; and, what almost surpasses
credibility, he who was resigning monarchy was happy, he
to whom it was being given was sad. So noble a conflict
would never have ended if Pompey’s authority had not
come to the aid of the paternal wish. For he addressed the
son as king, told him to put on the diadem, and forced him
to sit in the curule chair.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_531_5" id="target_note_LCL492_531_5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
