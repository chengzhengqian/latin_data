<p>What then? Freedom without Cato? No more than
Cato without freedom. He was sitting on a jury trying a
guilty senator and an infamous defendant. Tablets had
been produced containing a testimonial by Cn. Pompeius
which would doubtless have proved effective in favour of
the offender. But Cato removed them from the case, reciting
