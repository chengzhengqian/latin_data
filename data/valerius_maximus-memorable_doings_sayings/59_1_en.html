<h2><span class="ac">Book II</span></h2>
<p>Having scrutinized the rich and powerful kingdom of
Nature, I shall try my pen on ancient and memorable institutions
both of our city and of foreign nations. For it behooves
us to learn what were the origins of the happy life
we lead under our best of leaders, so that a backward look
at them may yield some profit to modern manners.</p>
<h3><span class="ac">1. Of Ancient Institutions</span></h3>
<p>Among the men of old nothing was done either publicly
or even privately without prior taking of auspices. From
that usage even in our time takers of auspices are given a
place at weddings. Although they no longer seek auspices,
by the name itself they preserve in use a trace of the old
custom.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_129_1" id="target_note_LCL492_129_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Women used to dine seated with their reclining men-folk,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_129_2" id="target_note_LCL492_129_2"><sup>2</sup></a>
a custom which made its way from the social gatherings
of men to things divine. For at the banquet of Jupiter
he himself was invited to dine on a couch, while Juno and
Minerva had chairs, a form of austerity which our age is
more careful to retain on the Capitol than in its houses,
no doubt because it is more important to the commonwealth
