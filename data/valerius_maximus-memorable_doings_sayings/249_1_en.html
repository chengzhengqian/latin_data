<p>This I say with Scipio Africanus as my witness. Although
linked to Laelius in closest intimacy, he begged the
senate in supplication that the lot of a province withdrawn

promised to go to Asia as Legate to L. Scipio, elder brother
to younger, hero to unwarlike, preeminent in glory to unpraised,
