voluntary death.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_417_2" id="target_note_LCL492_417_2"><sup>2</sup></a> What fine soldiers the Gracchi might
have had if they had chosen to follow in the footsteps of
their father or their maternal grandfather!<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_417_3" id="target_note_LCL492_417_3"><sup>3</sup></a> With what
energy, with what determination would Blossius and Pomponius
and Laetorius, so vigorous companions of their
mad enterprise, have assisted in their trophies and triumphs!
Under sinister auspices they followed friendship
as it came, examples of its faithful service, the more hapless
the surer.</p>
<p>L. Reginus must be torn by the reproaches of posterity
if he be judged by the canon of fidelity due to the public
service; but if he be assessed according to faithful pledge
of friendship, he must be left in the best of havens, a laudable
conscience. As Tribune of the Plebs, mindful of an
old and close friendship, he liberated from public custody
Caepio, who had been thrown into prison because he
was held to blame for the destruction of our army by the
Cimbri and Teutones. And not content to play the friend
so far, he also became Caepio’s companion in exile. Ah
Friendship, mighty and insuperable is your strange power!
From one side the commonwealth laid its grasp upon him,
from the other your right hand drew him. The commonwealth
demanded that he choose to be inviolable, you (so
gently you exercise your authority!) condemn him to exile.
He chose the punishment before the office.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_417_4a" id="target_note_LCL492_417_4a"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>An admirable work of yours, this; but what follows<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_417_5" id="target_note_LCL492_417_5"><sup>5</sup></a> is a
good deal more praiseworthy. Recall how far you pushed
Volumnius’ steadfast affection for his friend without any
