Thrasippus, overcome by an impulse of excitement and intoxication,
spat full in his face, but even so could not rouse
him to retaliate. On the contrary, he even held back his
sons, who were eager to rally to their father’s outraged dignity.
The next day Thrasippus wanted to punish himself by
committing suicide. Pisistratus came to him and turned
him from his purpose, giving his word that he would remain
on the same friendly footing.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_457_23" id="target_note_LCL492_457_23"><sup>23</sup></a> If he had done nothing
else worthy of the honour of memory, with these actions
he would have abundantly commended himself to
posterity.</p>
<p>Equally mild was the temper of king Pyrrhus. He had
heard that he had been spoken of disrespectfully at a dinner
in Tarentum. Summoning those who had been present,
he asked whether they had said the things that had
come to his ears. Then one of them said: “If our wine had
not given out, these things that were reported to you would
have seemed mere child’s play compared to what we <span class="italic">would</span>
have said about you.” The witty excuse of intoxication and
the guileless confession of the truth turned the king’s anger
into laughter. By that clemency and moderation he
made the Tarentines thank him when sober and pray for
him when drunk.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_457_24" id="target_note_LCL492_457_24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>From the same lofty level of humanity he sent Lyco the
Molossian to meet Roman envoys who were coming to his
camp to ransom prisoners, so that they should be safer on
the road. And for their more honourable reception, he
went himself in his royal attire with a mounted escort to
welcome them outside the gate. Uncorrupted by favourable
Fortune and success, he wished to pay regard to civility
in the persons of those who at that very time were in
arms against him.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_457_25" id="target_note_LCL492_457_25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
