<h3><span class="ac">2. Of Bravery</span></h3>
<p>Since we have now laid open the beginnings and first
sallies of valour, we shall treat of the action itself. Its most
weighty force and most effective muscle consist in bravery.</p>
<p>Nor does it escape me, Romulus, founder of our city,
that the first place in this category of praise ought to be assigned
to you. But suffer yourself, I beg you, to be preceded
by one example, to which you yourself owe a due of
honour, since thanks to it Rome, your noble work, did not
fall asunder.</p>
<p>The Etruscans were breaking into the city by the Pons
Sublicius. Horatius Cocles took the end of it and in tireless
combat sustained the whole force of the enemy until the
bridge was broken off behind his back; and when he saw
that his country had been freed from her imminent peril,
he threw himself in full armour into the Tiber. The immortal
gods in admiration of his bravery kept him safe and
sound. Not shaken by the height of the fall, nor crushed by
the weight of his arms, nor driven by some whirling current,
nor harmed by the weapons flung at him from every
side, he swam safely to land. So he alone turned the eyes of
so many countrymen, so many enemies, upon himself, the
latter stunned with amazement, the former hesitating between
joy and fear; and he alone separated two armies
locked in fierce combat, driving back the one, fighting
in front of the other. In fine, alone he brought as effective
a defence to our city with his shield as did Tiber with
his channel. Therefore the Etruscans could say as they
left: “We vanquished the Romans, we were vanquished by
Horatius.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_237_1" id="target_note_LCL492_237_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
