<h3><span class="ac">8. Of the Fidelity of Slaves</span></h3>
<p>It remains to relate the fidelity of slaves towards their
masters, the more praiseworthy as the less expected.
M. Antonius, a very famous orator in our forefathers’
time, was accused of impurity. In his trial the prosecutors
insistently demanded a slave for interrogation, contending
that he carried a lantern in front of Antonius when he went
to commit the crime. He was still beardless and stood
there among the spectators realizing that the matter pertained
to his own torture; yet he did not run away from
it. When they got home, he spontaneously urged Antonius,
who was much upset and worried on this account, to
hand him over to the jury for torture, assuring him that no
word would pass his lips detrimental to his master’s case.
And he kept his word with marvellous endurance. Lacerated
with many stripes, put on the rack, burned with hot
plates, he guarded the defendant’s safety and destroyed all
the force of the prosecution. Fortune can deservedly be
blamed for enclosing so loyal and brave a spirit in the body
of a slave.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_75_1" id="target_note_LCL493_75_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

make him safe from Sulla’s cruelty, though he saw that
great rewards awaited him if he surrendered his master to
the victors.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_75_2" id="target_note_LCL493_75_2"><sup>2</sup></a> The timely service of his hand does not yield
