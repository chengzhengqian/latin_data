<p>And now how execrable the following rashness of soldiers!
It caused A. Albinus, a citizen distinguished in birth,
character, and the accumulation of all offices, to be overwhelmed
with stones by his army in camp because of false,
baseless suspicions; and, what admits of no increment of
indignation, the general though begging and imploring

divided by so small a space, he accused the navigator of
treachery and put him to death. Afterwards on more careful
inspection of the truth he acquitted him, when his innocence
could be granted nothing except the honour of
burial. And so a statue looks from a high mound over the
narrow, stormy sea, placed before the eyes of those sailing

<p>The Athenian community was rash to the point of madness
