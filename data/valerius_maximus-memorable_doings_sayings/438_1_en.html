greed for money neither of the two repudiated the gift of
another’s misdeed. What guilt, how lightly here reported!
Luminaries of the senate house, ornaments of the Forum,
lured by the getting of disgraceful gain they covered with
their authority a crime that they ought to have punished.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_333_1" id="target_note_LCL493_333_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>But avarice showed considerably greater power in the
person of Q. Cassius. In Spain Silius and Calpurnius were
caught with daggers intending to assassinate him. He released
them, at the price of five million sesterces from the
one and six million from the other.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_333_2" id="target_note_LCL493_333_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Doubt if you can that,
if as much again had been forthcoming, he would willingly

<p>Septimuleius’ avarice deserved hatred, that of Ptolemy,
king of the Cypriots, was laughable. With anxious cheeseparings
he had amassed great wealth and saw that on account
of it he was likely to perish. He therefore placed all
his money on ships and put out to sea, intending to scuttle
