<p>Terentius Varro shattered the commonwealth by rashly
entering upon the battle of Cannae. By his sense of decency
in not feeling able to accept the Dictatorship that
was offered to him by the entire senate and people he
made amends for his culpability in that great disaster, with
the result that the battle was ascribed to the anger of the
gods, his modesty to his own character. So the Dictatorship
declined can be inscribed on the title of his mask to more
handsome effect than can the same office administered be

<p>Let us pass to a splendid act of modesty. Fortune was
much blamed for bringing Cn. Scipio, son of Africanus the
elder, and the scribe C. Cicereius onto the Campus at the
praetorian elections. In the talk of the common folk she
was criticized as too unconscionable in confounding the
blood and the clientele of so great a man in an electoral
contest. But Cicereius turned Fortune’s reproach to his
own credit. For seeing that he was ahead of Scipio in all the
centuries, he came down from the platform and putting off
his white gown began to canvass for his competitor, thus
better yielding the Praetorship to Africanus’ memory than
if he had claimed it for himself. Could you deny that modesty
has its great reward? Scipio gained the office on that
occasion, but the congratulations went more to Cicereius.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_399_5" id="target_note_LCL492_399_5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>Not to leave elections just yet, when L. Crassus stood
for the Consulship and was obliged to go round the Forum
begging the people as was customary for all candidates,
he could never be induced to do this in the presence of
the very wise and the highly respected Q. Scaevola, his
father-in-law. So he used to ask Scaevola to leave him while
he lent himself to this foolish practice. He had more reverence
