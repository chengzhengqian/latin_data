antecedents, had attained the Praetorship, stripped their
gold rings from their fingers and the trappings from their
horses and threw them away, advertising their lack of
self-control by almost open mourning.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_325_3" id="target_note_LCL493_325_3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>Such was the stirring of anger against the whole people
on the part of one individual or a few; of the multitude
against leaders and commanders, thus: Manlius Torquatus
brought back to the city a great and glorious victory over
the Latins and Campanians. All the older folk met him in
high rejoicing, but none of the younger ones came out to
his passing because he had beheaded his son, a young man
who had fought most bravely in combat against his orders.
They pitied their coeval, too harshly punished. Nor am I
defending their action, but I am showing the force of anger
that could split the generations and emotions of one community.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_325_4" id="target_note_LCL493_325_4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>The same sentiment had the power to keep the entire
cavalry<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_325_5" id="target_note_LCL493_325_5"><sup>5</sup></a> of the Roman people motionless when despatched
by Consul Fabius in pursuit of an enemy force,
although they could safely and easily have destroyed it, because
they remembered that he had blocked an agrarian
law. Anger too made an army hostile to its commander
Appius, whose father in championing the prestige of the
senate had energetically assailed the interests of the plebs.
Not wishing to earn a triumph for their general, they
turned their backs in voluntary flight.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_325_6" id="target_note_LCL493_325_6"><sup>6</sup></a> How often has anger
been victorious over victory! It made congratulation
worthless in the case of Torquatus, caused omission of its
fairest part in that of Fabius, and in that of Appius let it be
totally sacrificed to rout.</p>
