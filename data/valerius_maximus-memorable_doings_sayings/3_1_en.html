<p>Such was the zeal of the ancients not only for the observance
but for the expansion of religion that when Rome
was highly flourishing and wealthy, ten sons of leading men
were handed over to each of the peoples of Etruria by decree
of the senate to learn sacred lore.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_17_7" id="target_note_LCL492_17_7"><sup>7</sup></a> Also they sought a
priestess named Calliphana for Ceres, whom they had
commenced to worship after the Greek fashion,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_17_8" id="target_note_LCL492_17_8"><sup>8</sup></a> from
Velia, before that town had been given citizenship, so that
the ancient rites of the goddess should not want for a
skilled ministrant.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_17_9" id="target_note_LCL492_17_9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>And although they had a splendid temple of hers in
Rome, they sent a delegation of fifteen<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_17_10a" id="target_note_LCL492_17_10a"><sup>10</sup></a> to Henna (since
her worship was believed to have originated there) to propitiate
her, admonished by the Sibylline Books during the
Gracchan upheaval to appease “most ancient Ceres.”
Likewise when our generals had gained victories they often
travelled to Pessinus and paid the vows they had taken
to the Mother of the Gods.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_17_11" id="target_note_LCL492_17_11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>When the Consul Postumius, who was also Flamen of
Mars, purposed to go to Africa<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_17_12" id="target_note_LCL492_17_12"><sup>12</sup></a> to wage war, the Chief
Pontiff Metellus named a fine and would not allow him
to leave Rome, lest he depart from his religious duties.
The highest state power yielded to religion; for it seemed
Postumius would not safely commit himself to martial conflict
after abandoning Mars’ rituals.</p>
