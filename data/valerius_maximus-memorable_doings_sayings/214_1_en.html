<h3><span class="ac">1. Of Humanity And Mercy</span></h3>
<p>What more suitable companions should I give to liberality
than humanity and mercy, since they seek the same
kind of praise? The first is vouchsafed to poverty, the second
to occasion, the third to perilous fortune; and though
it is hard to say which should most be approved, yet commendation
of that one whose name was taken from mankind
itself seems to have precedence.</p>
<p>First of all I shall relate most humane and merciful actions
of the senate. When Carthaginian envoys came to
Rome to ransom prisoners,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_439_1" id="target_note_LCL492_439_1"><sup>1</sup></a> they immediately gave them
back the men without any money received to the number
of 2,743, if you want the truth. So large an army of enemies
let go, so large a sum of money despised, so many Punic injuries
forgiven! I think the envoys themselves were thunderstruck
and said to one another: “Oh munificence of the
Roman nation to be matched with the benignity of the
gods! And oh this mission of ours, successful beyond our
prayers! We have received a benefaction which we would
never have given.”</p>
