<p>The following measure too of our ancestors was shrewd
in the conception and fortunate in the result. After capturing
the city the Gauls besieged the Capitol and saw that
their only hope of taking it lay in starving out the defenders.
So by a very cunning kind of ruse the latter stripped
the victors of their only incentive to persevere: they started
to throw loaves of bread from various points. The Gauls
were amazed at the sight and in the belief that our men still
had an endless abundance of grain they were driven to
come to an agreement to raise the siege. Surely Jupiter
took pity then on Roman valour, as it borrowed aid from
cunning, when he saw the defences against want thrown

the junction of the forces of the two brothers,
which together would have placed an intolerable load on
Rome’s weary back. Nero had Hannibal cooped up in Lucania.
Falsely pretending to the enemy that he was on the
spot, he marched with extraordinary speed over the long
route to bring aid to his colleague, since that was what
war’s logic called for. Salinator was in Umbria at the river
Metaurus, intending to give battle the following day. With
the utmost concealment he took Nero into his camp during
the night. For he ordered Tribunes to take in Tribunes,
Centurions Centurions, horsemen horsemen, footmen
footmen, and without any confusion put another army
