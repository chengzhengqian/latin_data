is the value of dear piety cheapened; on the contrary, the
more unhappy in the trial, the more certain.</p>
<p>A Praetor had handed over a woman of free birth found
guilty at his tribunal of a capital crime to the Triumvir to be
executed in prison. Received there, the head warder had
pity on her and did not strangle her immediately. He even
allowed her daughter to visit her, but only after she had
been thoroughly searched to make sure she was not bringing
in any food, in the expectation that the prisoner would
die of starvation. But after a number of days had passed, he
asked himself what could be sustaining her so long. Observing
the daughter more closely, he noticed her putting
out her breast and relieving her mother’s hunger with the
succour of her own milk. This novel and remarkable spectacle
was reported by him to the Triumvir, by the Triumvir
to the Praetor, by the Praetor to the board of judges; as a
result the woman’s sentence was remitted.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_501_7" id="target_note_LCL492_501_7"><sup>7</sup></a> Whither does
Piety not penetrate, what does she not devise? In prison
she found a new way to save a mother. For what so extraordinary,
so unheard of, as for a mother to be nourished by
her daughter’s breasts? This might be thought to be against
nature, if to love parents were not Nature’s first law.</p>

<p>Let the same be considered as predicated concerning
the piety of Pero, whose father Myco was in a like sorry
plight and equally under prison guard. A man in extreme
old age, she put him like a baby to her breast and fed him.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_501_8" id="target_note_LCL492_501_8"><sup>8</sup></a>
Men’s eyes are riveted in amazement when they see the
painting of this act and renew the features of the long bygone
incident in astonishment at the spectacle now before
