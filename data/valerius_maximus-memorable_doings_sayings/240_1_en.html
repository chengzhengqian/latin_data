cast out of those boundaries within which he had lived as

<p>What is wanting then that we should judge it public insanity
to punish by general consent the greatest of merits
like the worst of offences and to repay benefactions with
injuries? That should seem intolerable anywhere, but particularly
in Athens, in which city prosecution of ingrates
was legalized and rightly so, since whoever neglects to
make equal return to a benefactor abolishes the interplay
of giving and receiving benefits without which life would
be hardly livable. How severe a censure then do they deserve
who, having most fair laws but most unfair natures,
have preferred to follow their characters rather than their
statutes! If by some divine providence it could have been
brought about that the excellent personages whose fates I
have just recounted could haul their country into court before
another community, reciting the law that penalizes ingratitude,
would they not have struck that clever, voluble
people mute and dumb with the following arraignment?
“Your disunited hearths and huts divided among rural districts
became the crown of Greece. Marathon shines with
Persian trophies. Salamis and Artemisium are scored up<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_491_23" id="target_note_LCL492_491_23"><sup>23</sup></a>
as Xerxes’ shipwrecks. Buildings razed by hands all too
strong rise in works of greater beauty. Where did the authors
of all this live? Where do they lie? Answer! In your ingratitude
you forced, did you not, Theseus to be buried on
a little rock, Miltiades to die in prison, Cimon to put on his
father’s chains, Themistocles the victor to clasp the knees
of the vanquished enemy, Solon and Aristides and Phocion
