in error, and the parallel nature of their deaths draw me
from Ti. Gracchus to the memory of M. Marcellus. Fired
by the glory of Syracuse captured and Hannibal for the
first time routed by him before the walls of Nola,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_73_14" id="target_note_LCL492_73_14"><sup>14</sup></a> he

in Italy or to drive it out of Italy. As he enquired the will of
the gods in a ceremonial sacrifice, the liver of the first victim
