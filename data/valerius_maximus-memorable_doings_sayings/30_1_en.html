his way as he was about to go to Spain as Consul: when he
was minded to offer sacrifice at Lanuvium, the chickens on
being let out from their coop fled into a nearby wood and
could not be found though most diligently searched for.
When he was going aboard ship from Harbour of Hercules,
where he had arrived on foot, a voice from nowhere
came to his ears: “Mancinus, remain!” Frightened by this,
he changed route and made for Genua, where he boarded
a boat; a snake of extraordinary size appeared and then disappeared.
So he equalled the number of portents with the
number of his disasters: a lost battle, a disgraceful treaty, a
lamentable handover.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_71_10" id="target_note_LCL492_71_10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>Such temerity in a man of little judgment is rendered
less strange by the sad end of a most respected citizen, Ti.

two snakes suddenly slid from hiding, ate the liver of the
victim he had immolated, and withdrew into the same lair.
He then on that account repeated the sacrifice, and the
same prodigy befell. A third victim was slaughtered and its
entrails more carefully guarded, but the approach of the
reptiles could not be blocked nor their withdrawal prevented.
Although the soothsayers said that the life of the
general was concerned, Gracchus allowed himself to be
brought by the treachery of a false friend, Flavus, to a
place where the Carthaginian commander Mago lay in ambush
with an armed band, and was there killed unarmed.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_71_12" id="target_note_LCL492_71_12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
