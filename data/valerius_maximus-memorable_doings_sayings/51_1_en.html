herself should have blushed and, though unaware of
Pompey’s fate, spoke thus to his comrades in arms: “How
do we know whether Cn. Pompeius is not being cremated
in this fire?” The utterance was divinely inspired, a wonder.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_113_15" id="target_note_LCL492_113_15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>

but comes from the mouth of Apollo himself, in which the
truth-telling oracle of the Pythia’s prophecy anticipated
