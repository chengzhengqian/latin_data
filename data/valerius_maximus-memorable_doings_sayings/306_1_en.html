you from any such apprehension.‚Äù The power to have put
in bonds so important an enemy general had made them
famous, but their unwillingness to do so made them much
more famous.</p>
<p>The Conscript Fathers showed equal faith in protecting
ambassadorial rights in relation to the same enemies.
In the Consulship of M. Aemilius Lepidus and L. Flaminius
they had L. Minucius and L. Manlius surrendered
by Praetor M. Claudius through Fetials to Carthaginian
envoys because they had used violence against the same.
The senate on that occasion looked at itself, not at those to
whom it was making this amend.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_69_4" id="target_note_LCL493_69_4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>Following its example the elder Africanus dismissed
unharmed many distinguished Carthaginians who were on
board a ship which he had got into his power, because they

embassy to avoid the danger they were in.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_69_5" id="target_note_LCL493_69_5"><sup>5</sup></a> He preferred it
thought that the faith of a Roman general had been imposed

no means to be passed over. Q. Fabius and Cn. Apronius,
former Aediles, struck some envoys sent to Rome from the
city of Apollonia in a quarrel. When the senate learned of
this, it immediately surrendered them through Fetials to
the envoys and ordered a Quaestor to accompany the latter
to Brundisium, so that no harm should come to them on
the way from relatives of the persons surrendered.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_69_6" id="target_note_LCL493_69_6"><sup>6</sup></a> Who
would call that senate house a council of mortals and not a
temple of Faith?</p>
