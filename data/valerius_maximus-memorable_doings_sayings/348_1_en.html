onto ground that was hardly big enough for one. As a result
Hasdrubal did not know that he would be fighting with two
Consuls until after the valour of them both had laid him
low. Thus that Punic cunning, infamous the world over,
was outwitted by Roman shrewdness. It gave Hannibal to
Nero and Hasdrubal to Livius to be duped.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_153_4" id="target_note_LCL493_153_4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>Memorable also was the policy of Q. Metellus. He was
waging war as Proconsul in Spain against the Celtiberi and
was unable to take the city of Contrebia, the capital of that
nation, by force. After much and lengthy turning over of
plans in his mind, he found a way to bring his purpose to
fruition. With great energy he set about marches, then
headed for this region and that. He would occupy mountains
only to pass over to other mountains a little later; and
all the while the reason for his unlooked-for, sudden restlessness
was as unknown to all his own men as it was to the
enemy themselves. Questioned by a close friend why he
was prosecuting so desultory and fidgety a campaign, he
replied: “Don’t ask. For if I find that my shirt knows about
this plan of mine, I shall have it burned immediately.”
What then was the upshot of this masquerade, how did it
end? Having involved his own army in ignorance and the
whole of Celtiberia in his wandering, he took a different
direction, then suddenly turned back on Contrebia, and
catching the place unsuspecting and surprised, took it. So
if he had not forced his mind to examine trickery, he would
have had to go on sitting in arms at the walls of Contrebia
into ultimate old age.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_153_5" id="target_note_LCL493_153_5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
