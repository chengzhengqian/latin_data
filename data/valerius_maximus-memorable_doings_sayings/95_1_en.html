flowed from disciplineâ€™s bosom, it follows that I
proceed to speak of triumphal law.</p>
<span class="label"><span class="sc">of triumphal law </span></span>
<p>Certain generals wished triumphs decreed them for
insignificant battles. To oppose them, it was enacted by law
that no one should triumph who had not killed five thousand
of the enemy in a single engagement.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_201_2" id="target_note_LCL492_201_2"><sup>2</sup></a> For our ancestors
held that the dignity of our city would be heightened
not by the number of triumphs but by their glory. And lest
so excellent a law be effaced by greed for laurels, it was
propped up by another law, put through by Tribunes of the
Plebs L. Marius and M. Cato.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_201_3" id="target_note_LCL492_201_3"><sup>3</sup></a> It threatens with a penalty
generals who venture in dispatches to report to the senate
a false number either of enemies killed in battle or of citizens
lost, and requires that as soon as they enter the city
they take an oath before the City Quaestors that both numbers
have been stated by them to the senate truthfully.</p>
<p>After these laws it will be opportune to mention a trial
in which triumphal law was canvassed and thrashed out
between persons of the highest quality. Consul C. Lutatius
and Praetor Q. Valerius had annihilated a major Punic fleet
off Sicily,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_201_4" id="target_note_LCL492_201_4"><sup>4</sup></a> on which account the senate decreed a triumph
to Consul Lutatius. When Valerius wanted it decreed to
himself also, Lutatius said that would be improper, for the
higher authority should not be put on a level with the lower
in the honour of a triumph. The dispute was pertinaciously
