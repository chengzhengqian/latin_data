<p>So deserving of approval did Cicero’s action appear that
even his sworn enemy P. Pulcher did not scruple to imitate
it. Accused of profanation by three Lentuli, he protected
one of them on a bribery charge with his advocacy and
brought himself to act as Lentulus’ friend, with the jury
and the Praetor and the temple of Vesta before his eyes,
