<h3><span class="ac">9. Of Change of Character
Or Fortune</span></h3>
<p>Recognition of change of character and fortune in
famous men can add much confidence to our minds and
take away much anxiety, whether we look at our own situations
or those of our neighbours. For when in watching the
fortunes of others we see how brilliance emerged from abjection
and contempt, why shall we too not always have
better thoughts about ourselves, mindful that it is foolish
to sentence oneself in advance to perpetual infelicity and
in the meanwhile convert hope, which it is right to foster
even if uncertain, to certain despair?</p>
<p>Manlius Torquatus in the early stages of his adult life
was supposed to be of so blunt and dull an intellect that his
father L. Manlius, a man of the highest consequence,
banished him to the country and wore him out with farm
labour, because he appeared to be useless for both domestic
and public employments. Later on he released his
father, who was under prosecution, from the danger of a
trial, he beheaded his victorious son for having fought with
an enemy against his orders, and by a splendid triumph revived
his country wearied with a Latin turmoil. Malignant
Fortuneâ€™s cloudy face, I suppose, doused him with contempt
of his youth in order that the glory of his old age
might shine the brighter.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_83_1" id="target_note_LCL493_83_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
