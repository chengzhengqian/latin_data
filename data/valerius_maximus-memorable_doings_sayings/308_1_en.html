<h3><span class="ac">7. Of the Fidelity of Wives
Towards Their Husbands</span></h3>
<p>To touch also upon wifely fidelity, Tertia Aemilia, wife
of the elder Africanus and mother of Cornelia of the Gracchi,
was so accommodating and patient that although she
knew that one of her slave girls had found favour with her
husband, she pretended to be ignorant of it, lest she, a
woman, charge a great man, world-conquering Africanus,
with lack of self-control. And she was so far from any
thought of revenge that after Africanusâ€™ death she freed
the girl and gave her in marriage to one of her freedmen.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_73_1" id="target_note_LCL493_73_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Proscribed by the Triumvirs, Q. Lucretius was hidden
by his wife Turia between the ceiling and the roof of their
bedroom. So with one slave girl for accomplice she kept
him safe from imminent death not without great risk to
herself. When others of the proscribed barely escaped in
alien and hostile regions at the price of cruel tortures of
body and mind, he, thanks to her extraordinary fidelity,
kept his life in his bedroom and the bosom of his spouse.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_73_2" id="target_note_LCL493_73_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Sulpicia was held in close custody by her mother Julia
to prevent her following Lentulus Cruscellio, her husband
proscribed by the Triumvirs, to Sicily. Nonetheless she
reached him in a secret flight dressed as a servant along
with two slave girls and as many slaves. She did not baulk at
proscribing herself in order to maintain her fidelity to her
proscribed husband.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_73_3" id="target_note_LCL493_73_3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
