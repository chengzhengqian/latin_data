<p>I shall not weary in relating Scipio’s deeds again and
again, since he too did not weary of showing his virtues in
similar style. Tribune of the Plebs M. Naevius, or as some
have it, the two Petillii, had summoned him to trial before
the people. Escorted to the Forum by a huge concourse,
he mounted the rostra and placing the triumphal wreath
upon his head, spoke thus: “On this day, citizens, I ordered
Carthage in her pride to accept our terms. Therefore it is
fitting that you should go with me to the Capitol to give
thanks.” This magnificent utterance was followed by a no
less famous sequel; for seeking the couch of Jupiter Best
and Greatest he was accompanied by the senate, the entire
equestrian order, and all the common folk. The upshot was
that the Tribune made his plea before the people without
any people; deserted, he remained alone in the Forum, his
false charge covered with derision. To escape the shame of
it, he repaired to the Capitol and from Scipio’s accuser became
his reverent admirer.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_303_9" id="target_note_LCL492_303_9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>Scipio Aemilianus, a fine successor to his grandfather’s
spirit, was besieging a strongly fortified city. Certain
persons<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_303_10" id="target_note_LCL492_303_10"><sup>10</sup></a> urged him to scatter iron caltrops around its
walls and strew all passages with leaded boards studded
with nails pointing upward, so that the enemy would not be
able to attack our positions in a sudden sortie. Scipio replied
that it was not for the same person to want to capture
people and to be afraid of them.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_303_11" id="target_note_LCL492_303_11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>To whatever quarter of memorable examples I turn,
like it or not, I must stick fast in the surname of the Scipios.
For how at this point can I pass over Nasica, the famous author
