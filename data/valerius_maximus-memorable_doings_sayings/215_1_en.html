<p>This too is no small token of the senate’s humanity.
They decreed that Syphax, once the very powerful king of
Numidia, who died a captive in prison at Tibur, should be
buried with a public funeral, thus adding the honour of
sepulture to the gift of life.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_441_2" id="target_note_LCL492_441_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>They showed similar clemency in Perses’ case. When

health provided, and expenses liberally paid both for him
and his whole following; also that ships be looked for to
transport him and his men to Africa in comfort and safety.

young man had died, his father might more easily have
