footmen but could not equip them at such short notice. So
what the shortage of time denied, he achieved by sagacity
of counsel. He had with him the noblest and richest young
men from the whole of Sicily, but they were unarmed. He
ordered three hundred of them to make ready handsome
arms and picked horses as soon as possible, as though he
intended to take them with him at once to the siege of

the arms and horses to his soldiers. The unwarlike and
timid young men caught at the offer and eagerly yielded
their equipment to our men. Thus the cunning of our commander
so managed that what would have been a burden

in the middle. Then having fixed the boundaries as the
parties themselves had determined them, he awarded
whatever ground remained to the Roman people. Though
tricked, the Nolans and Neapolitans could make no complaint
