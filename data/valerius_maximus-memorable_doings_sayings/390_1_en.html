<p>Socrates too is believed to have begun to learn to play
the lyre when well on in years, thinking it better to acquire
proficiency in that art late than never. And how slight an
addition would that knowledge have been to Socrates! But
the man’s persevering diligence wished the trivial rudiments
of musical science to accrue to his vast wealth of
erudition. So always believing himself a poor man as to
learning, he made himself a very rich one as to teaching.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_237_21" id="target_note_LCL493_237_21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>To bring our examples of long and fruitful diligence as

down the monuments of his intellect was equal to so much
effort and labour that it takes a long life to master his writings
thoroughly.</p>
<p>You too, Cleanthes, so laboriously taking in wisdom and
