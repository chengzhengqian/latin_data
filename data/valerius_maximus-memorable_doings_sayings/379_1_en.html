of the murder of C. Flavius, a Roman knight. Tortured
six times, he continued to deny any part in that
crime, but as though he had confessed he was convicted by
a jury and crucified by the Triumvir L. Calpurnius.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_215_2" id="target_note_LCL493_215_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Likewise when Fulvius Flaccus was on trial, his slave
Philippus, on whose evidence the whole case depended,
was tortured eight times and uttered no word prejudicial
to his master. Nevertheless the defendant was found
guilty, although one man tortured eight times provided a
more reliable proof of innocence than eight men tortured
once would have furnished.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_215_3a" id="target_note_LCL493_215_3a"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<h3><span class="ac">5. Of Witnesses</span></h3>
<p>I next proceed to examples pertaining to witnesses.
Cn. and Q. Servilius Caepio, born of the same parents
and advanced to the highest eminence by progress
through all stages of official rank, likewise the brothers
Metelli, Quintus and Lucius, ex-Consuls and ex-Censors,
one of them a triumphator, spoke very strongly in evidence
against Q. Pompeius, son of Aulus, accused of extortion.
Pompeius was acquitted, not because they were disbelieved
but to counter the impression that they had crushed
an enemy by their influence.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_215_1" id="target_note_LCL493_215_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>M. Aemilius Scaurus too, Leader of the Senate, attacked
C. Memmius, on trial for extortion, with damning

Fulvius Flaccus, defeated by Hannibal in
212 and condemned in 211 on that account: a slave would not have
been the key witness in that trial. The case will have concerned a
private offence, perhaps sexual, running parallel with that of M. Antonius (VM 6.8.1). Very probably the accused was Ser. Fulvius,
who was defended in 121 by C. Scribonius Curio in a celebrated
speech (Cic. <span class="italic">Inv</span>. 1.80, <span class="italic">Brut.</span> 122). Fulvii Flacci seem to have survived
