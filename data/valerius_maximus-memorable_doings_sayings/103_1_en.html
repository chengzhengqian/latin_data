his reason that by one or the other action they must necessarily
be guilty of irresponsibility or of perjury. One tribe
only, the Maecia, he left free of stigma, which by its votes
had judged him deserving neither of condemnation nor of
office. What a resolute, powerful character he must have
had! The unhappy outcome of trials could not compel nor
the magnitude of official honours induce him to take a
gentler line in the conduct of public affairs.</p>
<p>A good substantial part of the equestrian order, four
hundred men of military age, patiently suffered a censorial
stigma. Ordered in Sicily to go and finish some fortification
work, they had neglected to do so, in consequence of
which Censors M’. Valerius and P. Sempronius deprived
them of their public horses and relegated them to the lowest
category.</p>
<p>Censors also imposed punishment for cowardice
with the utmost severity. M. Atilius Regulus and L. Furius
Philus took away the public horses of Quaestor M.
Metellus and a number of Roman knights and had them
relegated to the lowest category, who after the unfortunate
battle of Cannae had sworn to leave Italy along with him.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_217_12" id="target_note_LCL492_217_12"><sup>12</sup></a>

had come into Hannibal’s power. They had been sent by
him as envoys to the senate to negotiate an exchange of
prisoners, and having failed in their mission, stayed on in
the city. For to keep faith was fitting to Roman blood, and
the Censor who stigmatized their perfidy was M. Atilius
Regulus, whose father had preferred to die in agonizing
torments rather than break his word to the Carthaginians.
