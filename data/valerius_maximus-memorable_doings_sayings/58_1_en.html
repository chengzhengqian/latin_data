<p>Since we have touched upon these items transcending
normal reason, let mention be made of a snake recorded
with no less particularity than eloquence by T. Livius.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_127_48" id="target_note_LCL492_127_48"><sup>48</sup></a> He
says that in Africa at the river Bagrada there was a snake of
such great size that it forbade the use of the river to the
army of Atilius Regulus. Many a soldier was seized by its
vast mouth, a number were crushed by the coils of its tail.
When it could not be pierced by the casting of spears,
it was finally attacked from all sides with catapult machines
and fell forward from the frequent weighty blows of
stones. All the cohorts and legions feared the sight of it
more than Carthage itself and moved the Roman camp
away, because the neighbouring district was polluted by
the waters infected with the creatureâ€™s blood and the pestilential
vapour from its prostrate body. He adds that the
skin of the beast measuring one hundred and twenty feet
was sent to Rome.</p>
