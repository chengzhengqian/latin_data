placed in view on the one hand and on the other the sequence
of what I have related; men will not know which of
the two spectacles they enjoy more. For if it is a fine thing
to cast an enemy down, it is no less laudable to know how to

<p>This humanity on the part of L. Paullus reminds me
not to omit to mention the clemency of Cn. Pompeius.
Tigranes, king of Armenia, had waged major wars against
the Roman people on his own and protected with his
power a sworn enemy of our city, Mithridates, when he was
driven out of Pontus. Pompey did not let him lie before his
eyes in supplication for long, but revived him with kindly

Pompey, his own and his daughter’s too; and he had the
head cremated with an abundance of the costliest perfumes.
