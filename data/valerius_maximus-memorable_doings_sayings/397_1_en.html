behind him. With an ivory pipe the man secretly shaped
Gracchus’ elocution. When the rhythm was too relaxed, he

<p>Q. Hortensius believed that a great deal depended on
graceful bodily movement and devoted almost more effort
to its elaboration than to striving after eloquence itself. So
it was a question whether people flocked more eagerly to
hear him or to watch him. So well did his appearance set

<p>M. Cicero showed the importance of the two factors of
which I speak in the speech he delivered in defence of
Gallius. He taunted the prosecutor M. Calidius in that,
while asserting his intention to prove by witnesses, writings,
and interrogations that the defendant had prepared
to poison him, he spoke with a relaxed countenance, languid
voice, and a slack oratorical style. At one and the same
