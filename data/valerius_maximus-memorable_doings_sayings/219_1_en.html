<p>The humanity of the younger Africanus too was splendidly
and widely displayed. After Carthage had been
stormed, he sent a circular letter to the communities of
Sicily, telling them to recover through envoys the ornaments
of their temples stolen by the Carthaginians and
have them replaced in their old locations. A benefaction as
welcome to the gods as to men!<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_449_13" id="target_note_LCL492_449_13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>Equal to this action was a piece of humanity on the part
of the same personage. His Quaestor was auctioning prisoners
under the spear and a very handsome boy of gentlemanly
bearing was put up. Scipio found out that he was
a Numidian, left an orphan by his father and brought
up with his uncle Masinissa, and that without the latter’s
knowledge he had precociously taken service against
Rome. He considered that the boy’s error should be pardoned
and due respect accorded to the friendship of a king
most loyal to the Roman people. So he gave the boy a ring,
a gold brooch, a tunic with the broad stripe, a Spanish
cloak, and a horse with harness, and sent him to Masinissa
with a mounted escort.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_449_14" id="target_note_LCL492_449_14"><sup>14</sup></a> He thought that the greatest rewards
of victory lay in returning temple ornaments to the
gods and their kith and kin to men.</p>
<p>We must also catch hold of the memory of L. Paullus in
such a category of credit. When he heard that Perses, a
king one minute a prisoner the next, was being brought
to his presence, he met him arrayed in the trappings of
Roman authority. The king tried to fall at his knees, but
Paullus raised him up with his right hand and speaking in
Greek urged him not to despair. He even had the king ushered
into his tent and told him to sit next to himself at
his council, and thought him not unworthy of the honour
