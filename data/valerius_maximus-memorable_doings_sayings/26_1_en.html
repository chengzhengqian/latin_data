not the effigy of the Sun, which was all he had granted to
the suppliants, but the sun itself in very deed.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_63_12" id="target_note_LCL492_63_12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>Worthy also of note is the omen after which Consul
Petillius lost his life campaigning in Liguria. He was besieging
a mountain named Letum (death)<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_63_13" id="target_note_LCL492_63_13"><sup>13</sup></a> and in an exhortation
to his troops he said: “Today I shall take Letum
without fail.” Then, fighting recklessly, he confirmed the
chance utterance by his own death (<span class="italic">letum</span>).<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_63_14" id="target_note_LCL492_63_14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>

for aid against the Carians by the men of Priene, prompted

of the fates they had her as their leader in victory.</p>
<p>Nor yet were the men of Apollonia<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_63_16" id="target_note_LCL492_63_16"><sup>16</sup></a> sorry. Hard
pressed in war with the Illyrians, they begged the Epidamnians
to come to their aid. These said that they were
sending a river near their walls called Aeas<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_63_17" id="target_note_LCL492_63_17"><sup>17</sup></a> to Apollonia’s
