Spain<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_299_1" id="target_note_LCL492_299_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and all the tribes of that province sought friendship
with Carthage and none of our generals dared to proceed
there to retrieve the situation, P. Scipio, then in his
twenty-fourth year, volunteered to go.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_299_2" id="target_note_LCL492_299_2"><sup>2</sup></a> His confidence
gave hope of salvation and victory to the Roman people.</p>
<p>And he showed the same confidence in Spain itself.
When he was besieging the town of Baria, he told those
who came before his tribunal to bind themselves to appear
the following day in a temple situated inside the enemy’s
walls. Straight away he made himself master of the city and
setting up his chair gave them judgment at the time and
place predicted.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_299_3" id="target_note_LCL492_299_3"><sup>3</sup></a> No confidence more noble, no prediction

judgment in the matter rather than that of the Conscript
Fathers, no end to the Second Punic War would have been
found.</p>
<p>Equal to this action was the confidence exhibited in the
following. After he landed on the coast of Africa, spies of
Hannibal were caught in his camp and brought before
him. He neither punished them nor interrogated them as
to the plans and forces of the Carthaginians but had them
led meticulously around all his units. He then enquired
whether they had sufficiently considered the items which
they had been ordered to spy out, gave them and their pack
animals a meal, and dismissed them unharmed. By a spirit
