<p>In line with the above is the judgment of Demosthenes.
When somebody asked him what factor in oratory counted
for most, he answered: “The acting”; challenged a second
and a third time, he said the same, confessing that he owed
almost all he was to that. So Aeschines was right. After his
judicial humiliation he left Athens and went to Rhodes,
where, at the request of the community he recited first his
own speech against Ctesiphon, then that of Demosthenes
on behalf of the same in very loud and melodious tones.
Everyone admired the eloquence of both works, but that
of Demosthenes somewhat the more of the two. “What if
you had heard himself?” said Aeschines.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL493_253_4" id="target_note_LCL493_253_4"><sup>4</sup></a> So great an orator
and recently so bitter an adversary, he had so high an
esteem for his enemy’s oratorical force and ardour as to declare
himself ill qualified to read his writings aloud. He had
experienced the piercing force of the eyes, the formidable
gravity of the countenance, the timbre of the voice accommodated
to the several words, the arresting movements
of the body. So although nothing can be added to
his work, yet a great part of Demosthenes is absent in
Demosthenes because he is read, not heard.</p>

<p>Recognition of the effects of the arts can bring pleasure,
and it will at once appear how usefully they have been
devised, things worthy of remembrance will be placed in
full light, and the labour which went into their production
will not lack its reward.</p>
