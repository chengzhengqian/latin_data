M’. Manilius, governing Africa as Proconsul, begging him
to send Scipio Aemilianus, who was serving under him at
the time; for he thought that his death would be happier if
he left his last breath and commissions clasping Scipio’s
hand. But his end coming faster than Scipio’s arrival, he instructed
his wife and children that they should know one
people on earth, the Roman, and one house among the Roman
people, Scipio’s; they should reserve all matters clear
for Aemilianus, making him arbiter in the division of the
kingdom, and maintain what he decided like a testamentary
provision, unalterable and sacred. In affairs so many
and various did Masinissa stretch his life to his hundredth
year in an unflagging course of gratitude.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_475_16" id="target_note_LCL492_475_16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>By these and similar examples the beneficence of the
human race is nourished and increased. These are its
torches, its spurs, by reason of which it burns with desire to
help and win favour. And assuredly the most ample and
splendid wealth is the power to be widely registered with
benefactions happily disbursed. Since we have instituted a
religious cult of such, we shall now relate the neglect of it
in order to denounce the same, so that it be prized the
more.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL492_475_17" id="target_note_LCL492_475_17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<h3><span class="ac">3. Of Ingrates</span></h3>
<p>The father of our city was torn to pieces in the senate
house by the senate which he had placed on the highest
level of dignity, nor did they think it a sin to take the life of
him who had engendered everlasting vitality in Roman
empire. Rude and fierce, it seems, was that generation.
