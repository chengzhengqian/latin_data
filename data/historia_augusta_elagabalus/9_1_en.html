of the Syrian cult—thereby foreshadowing his own impending doom. In fact, he asserted that all gods were merely the servants of his god, calling some its chamberlains, others its slaves, and others its attendants for divers purposes. And he planned to carry off from their respective temples the stones which are said to be divine, among them the emblem of Diana, from its holy place at Laodicea,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL140_121_1" id="target_note_LCL140_121_1"><sup>1</sup></a> where it had been dedicated by Orestes.</p>
<p>Now Orestes, they say, dedicated not merely one image of Diana in one place, but many and in many places. And after he purified himself at the Three Rivers in the Hebrus region in obedience to a divine response, he founded the city of Oresta<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL140_121_2a" id="target_note_LCL140_121_2a"><sup>2</sup></a>—a city destined to be often stained with human blood. As for this city of Oresta, Hadrian, after he had begun to suffer from madness, ordered that it should be called after his own name—also acting in obedience to a divine response, for he had been told to steal into the house or into the name of some madman. Thereupon, they say, he recovered from his madness, which had caused him to order the execution of many senators, all of whom, however, were saved by Antoninus; for he won the surname of Pius by leading them into the senate after all supposed that they had been put to death by the Emperor’s order.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL140_121_3" id="target_note_LCL140_121_3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

The tutelary goddess of the place was assimilated to the Greek Artemis Ταυροπόλος, who, as a result of the similarity in name, was blended with the Tauric goddess, brought to Attica, according to Euripides, by Orestes and Iphigenia. The sacred image at Laodicea, presented by King Seleucus, was alleged, like many others in various sanctuaries, to be the original one brought by Orestes, which, it was claimed, had been carried away from Attica to Susa by the Persians; see Pausanias, iii. 16, 8.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL140_121_1').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL140_121_2a"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL140_121_2a" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">2 </sup>An ancient Thracian town called by various names, among them Orestias, re-founded by Hadrian as Hadrianopolis, now Adrianople.

Both these battles seem to be alluded to in this passage, and this has been used as an argument for the theory that the <span class="italic">Historia Augusta</span> was written at the end of the fourth century; see Intro, to vol. ii. p. viii f.
