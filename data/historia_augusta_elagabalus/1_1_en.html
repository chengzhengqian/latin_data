<p>I. The life of Elagabalus Antoninus, also called Varius,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL140_105_1a" id="target_note_LCL140_105_1a"><sup>1</sup></a> I should never have put in writing—hoping that it might not be known that he was emperor of the Romans—, were it not that before him this same imperial office had had a Caligula, a Nero, and a Vitellius. But, just as the selfsame earth bears not only poisons but also grain and other helpful things, not only serpents but flocks as well, so the thoughtful reader may find himself some consolation for these monstrous tyrants by reading of Augustus, Trajan, Vespasian, Hadrian, Pius, Titus, and Marcus. At the same time he will learn of the Romans’ discernment, in that these last ruled long and died by natural deaths, whereas the former were murdered, dragged through the streets, officially called tyrants, and no man wishes to mention even their names.</p>

He was the son of Julia Soaemias (or Symiamira, see note to c. ii. 1) and Sex. Varius Marcellus (see <span class="italic">C.I.L</span>., x. 6569 = Dessau, Ins. <span class="italic">Sel</span>., 478). In order to strengthen his claim to the throne his grand-mother Maesa declared that he was the natural son of Caracalla (see <span class="italic">Carac</span>., ix. 2; <span class="italic">Macr</span>., ix. 4), and he became emperor under the name of M. Aurelius Antoninus, by which he was officially known; in his inscriptions he is regularly styled son of Antoninus (Caracalla) and grandson of Severus. As the hereditary priest of Elagabalus, the patron-deity of Emesa (see note to § 5), he was called by the name of his god, but this name was never official, and there is no evidence that it  was applied to him during his lifetime; see O. F. Butler, <span class="italic">Studies in the Life of Heliogabalus</span> (New York, 1910), p. 119. This name the Latin writers <span class="italic">(Hist. Aug</span>., Victor, Eutropius) always reproduce in the erroneous form Heliogabalus. He is sometimes called Bassianus (e.g. <span class="italic">Macr</span>., viii. 4; ix. 4; Herodian, v. 3, 6), but there is no real evidence that he ever bore this name.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL140_105_1a').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
