<p>During his reign Zoticus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL140_127_2" id="target_note_LCL140_127_2"><sup>2</sup></a> had such influence that all the chiefs of the palace-departments treated him as their master’s consort. This same Zoticus, furthermore, was the kind to abuse such a degree of intimacy, for under false pretences<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL140_127_3" id="target_note_LCL140_127_3"><sup>3</sup></a> he sold all Elagabalus’ promises and favours, and so, as far as he could, he amassed enormous wealth. To some men he held out threats, and to others promises, lying to them all, and as he came out from the Emperor’s presence, he would go up to each and say, “In regard to you I said this,” “in regard to you I was told that,” and “in regard to you this action will be taken”. That is the way of men of this kind, for, once admitted to too close an intimacy with a ruler, they sell information concerning his intentions, whether he be good or bad, and so, through the stupidity or the innocence of an emperor who does not detect their intrigues, batten on the shameless hawking of rumours.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL140_127_4" id="target_note_LCL140_127_4"><sup>4</sup></a> With this man Elagabalus went through a nuptial ceremony and consummated a marriage, even having a bridal-matron and exclaiming, “Go to work, Cook”—and this at a time when Zoticus was ill. After that he would ask philosophers and even men of the greatest dignity whether they, in their youth, had ever experienced what he was experiencing—all without the slightest
