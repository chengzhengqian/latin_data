are present and has been lost by many a mediocre emperor.</p>
<p>In short, when Elagabalus’ message was read in the senate, at once good wishes were uttered for Antoninus and curses on Macrinus and his son,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL140_111_1" id="target_note_LCL140_111_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and, in accordance with the general wish and the eager belief of all in his paternity, Antoninus was hailed as emperor. Such are the pious hopes of men, who are quick to believe when they wish the thing to come true which their hearts desire.</p>
<p>As soon as he entered the city,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL140_111_2" id="target_note_LCL140_111_2"><sup>2</sup></a> however, neglecting all the affairs of the provinces, he established Elagabalus as a god on the Palatine Hill close to the imperial palace<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL140_111_3" id="target_note_LCL140_111_3"><sup>3</sup></a>; and he built him a temple, to which he desired to transfer the emblem of the Great Mother, the fire of Vesta, the Palladium, the shields of the Salii, and all that the Romans held sacred, purposing that no god might be worshipped at Rome save only Elagabalus.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL140_111_4a" id="target_note_LCL140_111_4a"><sup>4</sup></a> He declared, further-more, that the religions of the Jews and the Samaritans and the rites of the Christians must also be transferred

He particularly desired to form a union between his god and Vesta as the representative of the Roman state, and to this end he transferred to the Eliogabalium the fire of  Vesta and the sacred objects kept in her temple, such as the <span class="italic">Ancilia</span> and the Palladium. The latter, an image of Pallas, supposedly of Trojan origin, he seems to have regarded as the image of Vesta, who, in fact, was not represented in image-form. He further symbolised the union between the two deities by his own marriage with a Vestal; see c. vi. 6 and note. Since his combination of these cults aroused the greatest indignation in Rome, he divorced the Vestal and chose a new consort for his god in the Carthaginian deity Caelestis (see note to <span class="italic">Pert</span>., iv. 2), whose image was brought to Rome and placed in the Eliogabalium; see Dio, lxxix. 12, 1.
