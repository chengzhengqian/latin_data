another time he would fill one with fish. One summer he made a mountain of snow in the pleasure-garden attached to his house, having snow carried there for the purpose. When on the sea-coast he never ate fish, but in places most remote from the sea he regularly served all manner of sea-food, and the country-folk in the interior he fed with the milt of lampreys and pikes.</p>

<p>XXIV. The fish that he ate were cooked in a bluish sauce that preserved their natural colour, as though they were still in the sea-water. He supplied swimming-pools that he used for the moment with essence of roses and with the flowers themselves, and when he bathed with all his courtiers he would furnish oil of nard for the hot-rooms; he also furnished balsam-oil for the lamps. He never had intercourse with the same woman twice except with his wife, and he opened brothels in his house for his friends, his clients, and his slaves. He never spent less on a banquet than one hundred thousand sesterces, that is, thirty pounds of silver<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL140_153_1a" id="target_note_LCL140_153_1a"><sup>1</sup></a>; and sometimes he even spent as much as three million when all the cost was computed. In fact, he even outdid the banquets of Vitellius and Apicius.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL140_153_2" id="target_note_LCL140_153_2"><sup>2</sup></a> He would take fish from his ponds by the ox-load, and then, as he passed through the market, bewail the public poverty. He used to bind his parasites to a water-wheel and, by a turn of the wheel, plunge them into the water and then bring them back to the surface again, calling

The evaluation of 100,000 <span class="italic">sestertii</span> = 30 lbs. silver, however, presents a difficult problem, for the biographer is not using the system in vogue under Elagabalus. According to Mommsen <span class="italic">(Ges. Schr</span>., vii. p. 316), he has confused the <span class="italic">sestertius</span> with the depreciated <span class="italic">denarius</span> of the time of Diocletian, of which 50,000 = 1 lb. gold, or approximately 3700 = 1 lb. silver. Seeck, on the other hand, who contends that the <span class="italic">Historia Augusta</span> was composed in the fifth century (see Intro, to Vol. ii. p. ix), pointed out <span class="italic">(Jahrbb</span>., cxli. p. 629 f.) that in the time of Constantine (when this <span class="italic">vitae</span> purports to have been written) 432,000 den. = 1 lb. gold, an evaluation which is, of course, incompatible with this passage.  He argued, therefore, that the system here presupposed is that introduced in 445 by Valentinian III., according to which 1750 den. = 1 lb. silver, and that the half-denarius is meant here by the term <span class="italic">sestertius</span>.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL140_153_1a').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL140_153_2"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL140_153_2" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">2</sup>See c. xviii. 4.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL140_153_2').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
