The body was also dragged around the Circus before it was thrown into the Tiber.</p>
<p>His name, that is to say the name Antoninus, was erased from the public records by order of the senate<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL140_141_2" id="target_note_LCL140_141_2"><sup>2</sup></a>—though the name Varius Elagabalus was left<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL140_141_3" id="target_note_LCL140_141_3"><sup>3</sup></a>—, for he had used the name Antoninus without valid claim, wishing to be thought the son of Antoninus. After his death he was dubbed the <span class="italic">Tiberine,</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL140_141_4" id="target_note_LCL140_141_4"><sup>4</sup></a> the <span class="italic">Dragged,</span> the <span class="italic">Filthy,</span> and many other such names, all of which were to signify what seemed to have been done during his rule. And he was the only one of all the emperors whose body was dragged through the streets, thrust into a sewer, and hurled into the Tiber. This befell him as the result of the general hatred of all, against which particularly emperors must be on their guard, since those who do not win the love of the senate, the people, and the soldiers do not win the right of burial.</p>
<p>No public works of his are in existence, save the temple of the god Elagabalus (called by some the Sun, by others Jupiter), the Amphitheatre<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL140_141_5" id="target_note_LCL140_141_5"><sup>5</sup></a> as restored after its destruction by fire, and the public bath in the Vicus Sulpicius,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL140_141_6" id="target_note_LCL140_141_6"><sup>6</sup></a> begun by Antoninus, the son of Severus. This bath, in fact, had been dedicated by Antoninus Caracalla, who bathed in it himself and opened it to the public, but the portico was left unbuilt, and this was added after his death by this spurious Antoninus, though actually completed by Alexander.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL140_141_7" id="target_note_LCL140_141_7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
