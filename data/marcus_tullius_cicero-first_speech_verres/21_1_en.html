Manius Glabrio recently when the challenging of judges was taking place, and which I could see made a profound impression upon the people of Rome. I said that I believed the day would come when our foreign subjects would be sending deputations to our people, asking for the repeal of the existing law and the abolition of the Extortion Court. Were there no such Court, they imagine that any one governor would merely carry off what was enough for himself and his family: whereas with the courts as they now are, each governor carries off what will be enough to satisfy himself, his advocates and supporters, and his judges and their president: and this is a wholly unlimited amount.

Would Verres, indeed, ever have cherished fair hopes for himself, had his mind not been saturated with this foul opinion of you? An opinion that should make him yet more loathsome, if that be possible, to you than to the Roman people, this man who believes you to be as avaricious, as criminal, as false and perjured as he is himself.</p>
