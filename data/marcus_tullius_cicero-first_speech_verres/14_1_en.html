consul-elect sent for the Sicilians, and some of them came, remembering that Lucius Metellus was now praetor in Sicily. He talked to them in this sort of way: “I am consul; one of my brothers is governing Sicily, the other is going to preside over the Extortion Court; many steps have been taken to secure that no harm can happen to Verres.”</p>

<p>X.<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">28</span><span class="br"></span> To attempt to intimidate witnesses, especially these timorous and calamity-stricken Sicilians, not merely by your personal influence, but by appealing to their awe of you as consul, and to the power of the two praetors—if this is not judicial corruption, Metellus, I should be glad to know what is. What would you not do for an innocent kinsman, if you forsake duty and honour for an utter rascal who is no kin of yours at all, and make it possible for those who do not know you to believe in the truth of his allegations concerning you? For Verres was reported to have been saying that you<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">29</span><span class="br"></span> were made consul, not, like the rest of your family, by fate,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL221_95_a" id="target_note_LCL221_95_a"><sup>a</sup></a> but by his own exertions. Well then, he will have the two consuls, and the president of the Court, to suit him. He says to himself: “We shall not only escape having Manius Glabrio as President of the Court—a man who is far too conscientious and too subservient to considerations of the national honour. We shall also gain in the following ways. At present one of the judges is Marcus Caesonius, who is the colleague<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL221_95_b" id="target_note_LCL221_95_b"><sup>b</sup></a> of our prosecutor, and whose behaviour as a judge has already been publicly tested and approved; a man whom it would be most undesirable to have as member of any court that we may try in any way to corrupt; for before this, when he was a judge in the court over which Junius presided, he did not simply take to heart the scandalous wickedness then committed,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL221_95_a" id="target_note_LCL221_95_a"><sup>a</sup></a>
