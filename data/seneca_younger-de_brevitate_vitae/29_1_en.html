feeling has led kings to weep over the power they possessed, and they have not so much delighted in the greatness of their fortune, as they have viewed with terror the end to which it must some time come. When the King of Persia,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL254_343_a" id="target_note_LCL254_343_a"><sup>a</sup></a> in all the insolence of his pride, spread his army over the vast plains and could not grasp its number but simply its measure,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL254_343_b" id="target_note_LCL254_343_b"><sup>b</sup></a> he shed copious tears because inside of a hundred years not a man of such a mighty army would be alive.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL254_343_c" id="target_note_LCL254_343_c"><sup>c</sup></a> But he who wept was to bring upon them their fate, was to give some to their doom on the sea, some on the land, some in battle, some in flight, and within a short time was to destroy all those for whose hundredth year he had such fear.

Moreover, what is doomed to perish brings pleasure to no one; very wretched, therefore, and not merely short, must the life of those be who work hard to gain what they must work harder to keep.
