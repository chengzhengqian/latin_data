the threats of my enemies, the hostility of the consul, who was my relative by marriage and his own by blood, and his duties as quaestor in Pontus and Bithynia. No decree was ever passed by the senate in the matter of Publius Popilius;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL158_99_a" id="target_note_LCL158_99_a"><sup>a</sup></a> never in this house was a word uttered concerning Quintus Metellus.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL158_99_b" id="target_note_LCL158_99_b"><sup>b</sup></a> No; but it was on the motion of the tribunes that they were in the end restored, after their enemies had been put to death; and this was not until the former had complied with the senateâ€™s wishes, and the latter had escaped a violent and bloody end. Gaius Marius, indeed, the third exconsul who, in the memory of men yet living, was banished from the state through civil disturbance, so far from being restored by the senate, even all but abolished the senate after his return. In the cases of these, there was no unity of action among the magistrates, no rallying of the Roman people to the defence of their constitution, no outbreak in Italy, no decrees passed by municipalities and colonies.</p>
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">39</span><span class="br"></span><p>Wherefore, since it is your authoritative voice which has summoned me, the Roman people which has called out for me, the state who has become my suppliant, and united Italy that has brought me back, I might almost say, upon her shoulders, I shall not be so careless, now that those things have been restored to me which lay outside my own power, as to fail to hold that which my own efforts can secure, above all since, while <span class="italic">they</span> were recovered after having been lost, my virtue and my honour were never lost at all.</p>
