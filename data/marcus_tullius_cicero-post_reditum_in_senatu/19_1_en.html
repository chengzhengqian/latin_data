an act of hostility to the commonwealth, the safety of patriots, and the unity of citizens, and that the man responsible for it would be made the subject of an immediate motion to your body; furthermore, you ordered me to return forthwith, even though their misrepresentations should continue. What of the fact that you decreed that thanks should be accorded to those who had gathered from the corporate townships? And that a request should be made to them to assemble with undiminished fervour on the day appointed for the resumption of public business? Finally, what of the fact that upon the day which Lentulus made a day of new birth for myself, my brother, and my children, a day destined not to die with the present age, but to be held on record for all eternity,—the day, I mean, whereon he, in the assembly of the Centuries, which above all other assemblies our ancestors wished to be called and considered most authoritative, summoned me back to my country,—what of the fact that the same Centuries which had made me consul now expressed <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">28</span><span class="br"></span> their approval of my consulship?
