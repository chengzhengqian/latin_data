Sariolenus was also under the burden of recent charges, for he had tried the same course under Vitellius; nor did the senate cease threatening him with personal violence until he left the senate house. They then turned on Paccius Africanus and drove him out also, because he had suggested to Nero the ruin of the brothers Scribonii, who were eminent for their fraternal concord and their wealth.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL249_79_1" id="target_note_LCL249_79_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Africanus did not dare to confess his crime nor could he deny it: but turning upon Vibius Crispus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL249_79_2" id="target_note_LCL249_79_2"><sup>2</sup></a> who was harassing him with questions, he implicated him in acts that he could not deny, and so by making Vibius a partner in his guilt he diverted the indignation of the senate.</p>

So Messala had offered no defence on the case or for the accused, but by facing himself the dangers that threatened his brother, had succeeded in moving some of the sena-tors.</p>
