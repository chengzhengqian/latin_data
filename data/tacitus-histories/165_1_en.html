<p>II. In answer Antonius Primus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL111_331_1" id="target_note_LCL111_331_1"><sup>1</sup></a> the most enthusiastic partisan of war, argued that haste was helpful to them, ruinous to Vitellius. “The victorious side,” he said, “has gained a spirit of sloth rather than confidence, for their soldiers have not been kept within the bounds of camp; they have been loafing about all the municipal towns of Italy, fearful only to their hosts; the savagery that they once displayed has been matched by the greed with which they have drunk deep of their new pleasures.
