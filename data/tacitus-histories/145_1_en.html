many civilians were bound to the soldiers by ties of friendship and of marriage, and the soldiers from their long service had come to love their old familiar camps as their very hearths and homes.</p>
<p>LXXXI. Before the fifteenth of July all Syria had sworn the same allegiance. Vespasian’s cause was now joined also by Sohaemus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL111_291_1" id="target_note_LCL111_291_1"><sup>1</sup></a> with his entire kingdom, whose strength was not to be despised, and by Antiochus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL111_291_2" id="target_note_LCL111_291_2"><sup>2</sup></a> who had enormous ancestral wealth, and was in fact the richest of the subject princes. Presently Agrippa,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL111_291_3" id="target_note_LCL111_291_3"><sup>3</sup></a> summoned from Rome by private messages from his friends, while Vitellius was still unaware of his action, quickly crossed the sea and joined the cause. Queen Berenice showed equal spirit in helping Vespasian’s party: she had great youthful beauty, and commended herself to Vespasian for all his years by the splendid gifts she made him.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL111_291_4" id="target_note_LCL111_291_4"><sup>4</sup></a> All the provinces on the coast to the frontiers of Achaia and Asia, as well as all the inland provinces as far as Pontus and Armenia, took the oath of allegiance; but their governors had no armed forces, since Cappadocia had as yet no legions.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL111_291_5a" id="target_note_LCL111_291_5a"><sup>5</sup></a> A grand council was held at Berytus.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL111_291_6" id="target_note_LCL111_291_6"><sup>6</sup></a> Mucianus came there with all his lieutenants and tribunes, as well as his most distinguished centurions and soldiers; the army in Judea also sent its best representatives. This great concourse of foot and horse, with princes who rivalled one another in splendid display, made a gathering that befitted the high fortune of an emperor.</p>
