pyre, praising him amid their tears and kissing his wound and his hands. Some soldiers slew themselves near his pyre, not because of any fault or from fear, but prompted by a desire to imitate his glorious example and moved by affection for their emperor. Afterwards many of every rank chose this form of death at Bedriacum, Placentia, and in other camps as well. The tomb erected for Otho was modest, and therefore likely to endure. So he ended his life in the thirty-seventh year of his age.</p>
<p>L. Otho was born in the municipal town of Ferentinum<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL111_243_1" id="target_note_LCL111_243_1"><sup>1</sup></a>; his father had held the consulship, his grandfather had been praetor. His mother’s family was not the equal of his father’s, but still it was respectable.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL111_243_2" id="target_note_LCL111_243_2"><sup>2</sup></a> His boyhood and youth were such as we have already described. By two bold deeds, the one most outrageous, the other glorious,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL111_243_3" id="target_note_LCL111_243_3"><sup>3</sup></a> he gained with posterity as much fame as evil reputation. While I must hold it inconsistent with the dignity of the work I have undertaken to collect fabulous tales and to delight my readers with fictitious stories, I cannot, however, dare to deny the truth of common tradition. On the day of the battle at Bedriacum, according to the account given by the people of that district, a bird of unusual appearance settled in a much-frequented grove near Regium Lepidum,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL111_243_4" id="target_note_LCL111_243_4"><sup>4</sup></a> and neither the concourse of people nor the other birds which flew about it frightened it or drove it away, until Otho had committed suicide; then it disappeared from view. And they add that when people reckoned up the time, they found that the beginning and end of this marvel coincided with Otho’s death.</p>
