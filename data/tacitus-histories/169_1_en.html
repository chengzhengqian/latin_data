that three cohorts of the Vitellian forces and the squadron of cavalry called Sebosian had occupied Forum Alieni<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL111_339_1" id="target_note_LCL111_339_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and built a bridge over the stream there. Primus and Varus decided that this was a good opportunity to attack the Vitellians, who were wholly off their guard; for this fact also had been reported. At daybreak they cut down many of them quite unarmed. They had been advised that if they killed a few, they could force the rest by fear to change their allegiance; and there were some who surrendered at once. The larger part, however, broke down the bridge and so, by cutting off the road, blocked their foes’ advance. The opening of the campaign was favourable to Vespasian’s side.</p>
<p>VII. When the news of the victory was noised abroad, two legions, the Seventh Galbiana and the Tenth Gemina, marched with all speed to Padua under their commander Vedius Aquila. There they rested for a few days during which Minicius Justus, prefect of the camp of the Seventh legion, whose discipline had been somewhat too strict for civil war, was withdrawn from the soldiers’ resentment by being sent to Vespasian. An act long desired was now received with delight and given a flattering interpretation beyond its deserts, when Antonius gave orders that in all the towns Galba’s statues, which had been thrown down in the disorders of the times, should again be honoured. His real motive was that he believed that it would dignify Vespasian’s cause if this were accounted an approval of Galba’s principate and a revival of his party.</p>
<p>VIII. Then Vespasian’s commanders considered what place they should select as the seat of war.
