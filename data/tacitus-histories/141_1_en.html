or to the force of the opposing army, but to his own hasty despair, Vitellius has already made seem a great emperor whom men regret; and in the meantime he is scattering his legions, disarming his cohorts, and every day sowing new seeds of war. All the enthusiasm and courage that his soldiers ever had is being dissipated in taverns, in debauches, and in imitation of their emperor. You have in Syria, Judea, and Egypt nine legions at their full strength, not worn out by fighting, not infected by mutiny, but troops who have gained strength by experience and proved themselves victorious over a foreign foe.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL111_283_1" id="target_note_LCL111_283_1"><sup>1</sup></a> You have strong fleets, cavalry, and cohorts, princes wholly loyal to you,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL111_283_2" id="target_note_LCL111_283_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and an experience greater than all others.</p>
<p>LXXVII. “For myself I shall make no claim save not to be reckoned second to Valens and Caecina; yet I beg you not to despise Mucianus as partner in your enterprise because you do not find in him a rival. I count myself superior to Vitellius and you superior to me. Your house has the honour of a triumphal name;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL111_283_3" id="target_note_LCL111_283_3"><sup>3</sup></a> it possesses two young men, one of whom is already equal to ruling the empire; he also enjoys a high reputation with the forces in Germany because his first years of service were spent there.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL111_283_4" id="target_note_LCL111_283_4"><sup>4</sup></a> It would be absurd for me not to bow before the throne of a man whose son I should adopt if I myself held it. Besides, you and I shall not stand on the same footing in success as in failure, for if we win, I shall have simply the position you choose to give; but risks and dangers we shall share alike. Rather—and this is better—do you command your forces here; leave to me the conduct of the actual war and the risks of battle.
