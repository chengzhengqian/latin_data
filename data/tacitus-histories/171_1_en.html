no advantage to either side. Presently Caecina established his camp between Hostilia,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL111_343_1" id="target_note_LCL111_343_1"><sup>1</sup></a> a village in the district of the Veronese, and the marshes of the river Tartarus.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL111_343_2" id="target_note_LCL111_343_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Here he was protected by the situation itself, his rear being covered by the river and his flanks by the marshes. If he had only been loyal to Vitellius, with the combined forces of the Vitellians he might have crushed the two legions at Verona, for the troops from Moesia had not yet joined them; or at least he could have driven them back and made them abandon Italy in disgraceful flight.

To these forces, which were by no means a match for those of Vitellius, since thus far only three legions had concentrated at Verona, Caecina now wrote, reproving them for their rashness in taking up arms after defeat. At the same time he praised the valour of the German army, but made only slight and casual reference to Vitellius, with no derogatory mention of Vespasian; and he said nothing that was calculated to win over or frighten his opponents.
