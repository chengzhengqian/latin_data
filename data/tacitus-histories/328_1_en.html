He asked the priests whether Basilides had entered the temple on that day; he questioned the passers-by whether he had been seen in the city; finally, he sent some cavalry and found that at that moment he had been eighty miles away: then he concluded that this was a supernatural vision and drew a prophecy from the name Basilides.</p>
<p>LXXXIII. The origin of this god has not yet been generally treated by our authors: the Egyptian priests tell the following story, that when King Ptolemy,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL249_163_1" id="target_note_LCL249_163_1"><sup>1</sup></a> the first of the Macedonians to put the power of Egypt on a firm foundation, was giving the new city of Alexandria walls, temples, and religious rites, there appeared to him in his sleep a vision of a young man of extraordinary beauty and of more than human stature, who warned him to send his most faithful friends to Pontus and bring his statue hither; the vision said that this act would be a happy thing for the kingdom and that the city that received the god would be great and famous: after these words the youth seemed to be carried to heaven in a blaze of fire. Ptolemy, moved by this miraculous omen, disclosed this nocturnal vision to the Egyptian priests, whose business it is to interpret such things. When they proved to know little of Pontus and foreign countries, he questioned Timotheus, an Athenian of the clan of the Eumolpidae,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL249_163_2" id="target_note_LCL249_163_2"><sup>2</sup></a> whom he had called from Eleusis to preside over the sacred rites, and asked him what this religion was and what the divinity meant. Timotheus learned by questioning men who had travelled to Pontus that there was a city there called Sinope, and that not far from it there was a temple of Jupiter Dis,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL249_163_3" id="target_note_LCL249_163_3"><sup>3</sup></a>
