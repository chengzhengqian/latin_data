</span> (<span class="italic">with a sneer</span>) You couldn’t praise your brave deeds as
I could, praise the bad things you did at home and in
the field. Your list of achievements is too long to be recounted:<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">560</span><span class="br"></span>
occasions where you cheated someone trusting
you, where you were unfaithful to master, where you
knowingly and happily gave a false oath with solemn
words, where you dug holes through walls, where you
were caught stealing, where you often had to plead your
cause hanging before eight hefty, bold men, valiant rod-wielders.</p></div>

hands on something sacred, where you often created
damage, embarrassment, and shame for your masters,
where you denied receiving what you had been entrusted
with, where you were more faithful to your female friend
than to your male, where you often exhausted eight
strong lictors<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL060_203_26" id="target_note_LCL060_203_26">

How did I praise my colleague?</p></div>
