</span> Bad luck to you! Compensation should be given to <span class="italic">you</span>
from <span class="italic">us</span>, you thug?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">

</span> What, you thug? Do you say so, you villain? Do you think<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">484–5</span><span class="br"></span>
we’re running away from master? Go to our master
now, which is where you’re calling us and where you’ve
wanted to go for some time now.</p></div>

</span> Now at last? Still, you won’t ever get so much as one silver

insult another man and not be insulted yourself? I am a<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">490</span><span class="br"></span>
human being as much as you.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">mer</span>
</span> (<span class="italic">also more calmly</span>) Of course. Quite so.</p></div>

</a> I could say this
now: no one’s accused me deservedly yet and there isn’t
any other man in Athens these days who people believe
can be trusted equally well.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">mer</span>
</span> Perhaps. Still, you’ll never get me to entrust you with this
money today because I don’t know you. Man is a wolf and<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">495</span><span class="br"></span>
not a man toward a man when he doesn’t know what he’s
like.</p></div>

</span> Now you’re obliging me already. I knew you’d give satisfaction
