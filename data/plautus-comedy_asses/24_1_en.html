chap, who always sets me on fire with rage. Not a single
thing can I ever order this thief to do just once; no, a hundred
times I have to command and bark the same things
at him. Despite all my shouting and anger I am no longer

I tell you to remove the cobwebs from the columns?
(<span class="italic">points to the door</span>) Didn’t I tell you to make those doorknobs

walk around with a cane. Just because I have business at
the market which cannot be interrupted for a mere three
days, trying to find someone looking for money on interest,
you servants in the meantime sleep here at home and
master has to live in a pig-sty, not a house. Take that now!<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">431</span><span class="br"></span>
