quiet? I’d rather die than not reveal this to his wife.
(<span class="italic">shouting into the house</span>) You say so? At your mistress’s
place you want to do a young man’s job, and to your wife
you want to make excuses and say you’re an old bloke?
You want to snatch a prostitute from her lover and throw
money at the madam? You want to filch things from your
wife at home? (<span class="italic">muttering to himself</span>) I’d rather hang myself<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">816</span><span class="br"></span>
than let you get away with this untold. This instant I’ll
go to her from here, to the woman you will shortly, I know
it, murder—unless of course she manages to murder you
first—just so that you can supply the funds for your luxurious
lifestyle!</p></div>

</span> (<span class="italic">calmly, judiciously</span>) I think one should act like this: it’s<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">820</span><span class="br"></span>
more honorable for me to reveal this matter than it is for
you to do so, so that she doesn’t think you were upset and
did it out of love rather than for her sake.</p></div>

</span> Yes, you’re right. So make sure you stir up chaos and<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">824</span><span class="br"></span>
strife for him; would he be drinking at the same mistress’s
place with his own son in broad daylight, and would he
rob his wife?</p></div>

</span> Immediately; stop lecturing me. I’ll take care of that.</p></div>
