</span> That’s my job, mother. My tongue asks, my body earns,
my mind prompts, the circumstances urge.</p></div>

</span> I’m not accusing you and I don’t think it would be right
for me to do so. But I do moan about my fate since I’m<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">515</span><span class="br"></span>

</span> I grant you both my share of speaking and yours; you’ll
give the signal<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL060_199_24" id="target_note_LCL060_199_24">

</span> What are you saying? You’re the most impudent girl I’ve<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">521</span><span class="br"></span>
ever seen! How often did I forbid you to speak to Argyrippus,
the son of Demaenetus, or to fondle him, to
chat with him or to look at him? What did he give? What
did he have brought to us? Do you think flattery is gold
for you, witty words instead of gifts? Of your own accord<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">526</span><span class="br"></span>
you make love to him, of your own accord you run after
him, of your own accord you have him brought to you.
You laugh at those who give, and those who trick you you

rich if his mother dies? Heavens above, while we’re waiting<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">530</span><span class="br"></span>
for her death a great peril appears for the household:
