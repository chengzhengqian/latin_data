</span> And I sent you the girl. A fair return has been given for a
fair price, service for money.</p></div>

</span> You’re treating me badly.</p></div>

</span> Why do you accuse me if I do my duty? It has never been<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">174</span><span class="br"></span>
recorded in sculpture or picture or poetry that a madam
who wants to be any good treats any lover well.</p></div>

</span> Don’t you know? A woman who is generous to her lover is
not being generous enough to herself. For a madam a
lover is just like a fish: if he’s not fresh, he’s worthless. A<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">179</span><span class="br"></span>
fresh one has juice, a fresh one has sweetness, a fresh one
you can prepare any way you wish, done in a pan or
baked, you can turn it any way you like. A fresh one wants
to give, a fresh one wants to be asked for something, because
then you take it from a full store. And he doesn’t
know what he’s giving and what loss he’s making; he’s
put his heart into it. He wants to please his girlfriend,
he wants to please me, he wants to please the waiting woman,
he wants to please the servants, he even wants to
please the maids; and a new lover even tries to make
friends with my little dog so that it’s happy when it sees
him. I’m telling you the truth: everyone ought to be clever<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">186</span><span class="br"></span>

</span> I’ve learnt that this is true by making a great financial
loss.</p></div>

</span> Seriously, if you had something to give now, you’d be using
other words; now that you don’t have anything you
demand to take her off in exchange for abuse.</p></div>
