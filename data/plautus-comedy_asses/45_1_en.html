</span> Perfect. Of course she will act like this. But in the bedroom—take that out—I’m really keen on her moving. I
don’t want her to have an excuse and to say she’s been forbidden
to do so.</p></div>

</span> “She shall not use any ambiguous word and she shall not
know how to speak any language save Attic. If by chance<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">794</span><span class="br"></span>
she begins to cough, she shall not cough in such a way
that she sticks out her tongue to anyone while coughing.
But in case she pretend she has a running nose, she shall
not do it like this (<span class="italic">demonstrates</span>): you shall wipe clean her
lip rather than that she should openly blow anyone a kiss.
And her mother, the madam, shall not come to the wine
meanwhile, and she shall not say one abusive word to<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">800</span><span class="br"></span>
anyone. If she does, then this shall be her punishment:
she shall not have wine for twenty days.”</p></div>

wreaths, or perfumes to Venus or Cupid, your slave shall<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">805</span><span class="br"></span>
watch whether she is giving them to Venus or to a man.
If by chance she says she wants to spend some nights
chastely, she shall give you as many unchaste nights as
she had chaste ones.” This is no nonsense: these are no
dirges.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL060_229_36" id="target_note_LCL060_229_36">
