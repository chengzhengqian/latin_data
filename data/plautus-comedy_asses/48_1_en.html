</span> I know of course why you think I’m upset with you now,
father: because she’s with you. And to tell you the truth,
father, that does make me feel down; but not because I
wouldn’t wish you to have what you want; but I love her. I<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">845</span><span class="br"></span>
can easily handle it if another girl is with you.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">dem</span>
</span> But I want this one.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">arg</span>
</span> Well, you have what you wish for. And I want to have
what I wish for.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">

</span> Put up with it for this one day, since I’ve given you the
power to be with her for a year, and since I’ve given you,
the lover, the funding for it.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">

</span> Here you go! With this deed you’ve bound me to your<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">849–50</span><span class="br"></span>
service.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">

</span> Then why don’t you put on a cheerful face for me?</p></div>

</span> I beg you, are you saying that my husband’s drinking here
together with his son? And that he’s brought twenty silver
minas to a mistress? And that he, the father, is committing
such an outrage with the full knowledge of my son?</p></div>

</span> Artemona, don’t trust me ever after when I swear by the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">854</span><span class="br"></span>
gods or men if you find that I’ve lied to you about this
matter.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">

</span> But I’m such an idiot! I used to think my husband was
better than others, sober, good, moderate, full of love for
his wife.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">han</span>
</span> But from now on you should know that he’s the most
worthless of men, a drunkard, useless, immoderate, and
full of hatred for his wife.</p></div>
