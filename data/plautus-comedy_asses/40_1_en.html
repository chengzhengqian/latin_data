</span> (<span class="italic">angrily, approaching Libanus</span>) She should embrace

</span> How undeserving do I seem? So that you won’t have
made this entirely inappropriate remark against me without
any consequences, you’ll carry me on your back, at
least if you hope to get this money.</p></div>

</span> I’m done for. Well, if it is right and proper that a master
should carry his servant on his back, climb onto me.</p></div>

</span> This is how those proud ones are normally tamed. Stand
still, then, just as you used to as a boy long ago. Do you
know how I mean? (<span class="italic">Argyrippus bends over</span>) Yes, like
that. That’s it, well done, there’s no horse that’s cleverer
than you.</p></div>

</span> So I will. (<span class="italic">climbs onto Argyrippus, who begins to walk
Along</span>) Hello, what’s that supposed to be? How are you
jogging along? I’ll take you off the barley immediately if
you don’t get into a trot.</p></div>

<span class="sc">arg</span>
</span> Please, Libanus, it’s enough now.</p></div>

<span class="sc">lib</span>
</span> You’ll never soften me with your entreaties today: with
my spurs I’ll drive you uphill galloping, and then I’ll give
you to the millers so that you’re tortured there by being
forced to work at the double. Stand still so that I can<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">710</span><span class="br"></span>
climb down on the slope now, even though you’re useless.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">arg</span>
</span> What now, please? Now that you two have had your fun
with us as you liked, are you giving us the money?</p></div>

</span> If you erect a statue and an altar for me and sacrifice an ox
for me as your god here; because I am Salvation for you.</p></div>
