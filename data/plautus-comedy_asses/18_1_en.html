</span> I’ll tell you how and in what way. When an equal weight
of a hundred pounds has been tied to your feet and
when handcuffs have embraced your hands and have
been brought to the beam, then you hang neither too<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">305</span><span class="br"></span>
high nor too low . . . to stop you being bad and useless.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL060_175_17a" id="target_note_LCL060_175_17a">

</span> I want to cut short our word duel. What’s that business of
yours?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">leo</span>
</span> I’ve decided to entrust it to you.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">lib</span>
</span> You can do so with confidence.</p></div>

</span> Okay, if you want to help our young master in his love affair.
So much good is here unexpectedly, but it’s mixed<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">310</span><span class="br"></span>
with evil: all the days of the year will be celebrated as torturers’
days at our expense. Libanus, now we need to find
boldness and tricks. I’ve just hit upon so great a deed that
the two of us may be said to deserve more than anyone to
have tortures streaming together on us.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">lib</span>
</span> So that’s why I was wondering why my shoulder blades<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">315</span><span class="br"></span>
were tickling not long ago; they began to prophesy that
trouble was in store for them. Whatever it is, speak.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">leo</span>
</span> It’s a big booty with a big thrashing.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">

</span> Even if all people formed an alliance and gathered torments,
I have a comrade, I think . . . my back, no need to
look for any outside.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL060_175_18" id="target_note_LCL060_175_18">

</span> If you hold on to that firmness of mind, we’re safe.<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">320</span><span class="br"></span>

</span> Well, if I have to pay with my back, I’m keen to plunder
the treasury: then I’ll deny it and stick to it, and I’ll even
give a false oath.</p></div>
