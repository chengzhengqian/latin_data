</span> (<span class="italic">to the audience</span>) Demaenetus is dead. It’s time for me to
disappear from here. This battle is growing beautifully.
I’ll go to Diabolus and say that his orders have been executed
as he wished. I’ll advise that we should recline
to dinner in the meantime while these people here are
fighting. Then finally I’ll bring him here to the madam tomorrow<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">915</span><span class="br"></span>
so that he can give her the twenty minas in order
to get permission to get his share of the girl. I hope
Argyrippus can be persuaded to go shares and let him enjoy
her every other night: if I don’t achieve it, I’ve lost my
patron; the man is all aflame because of his love.</p></div>
