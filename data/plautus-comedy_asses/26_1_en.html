</span> (<span class="italic">to Libanus, in a soft voice</span>) I can hear it and I’m calming
down.</p></div>

<span class="sc">mer</span>
</span> (<span class="italic">aside</span>) At last he’s fallen silent, I think. It’s best to go up
to him now before he begins to rattle again. (<span class="italic">to Leonida</span>)
How soon will you give me your attention?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">leo</span>
</span> Oh, very good. How long ago did you come? I really<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">450</span><span class="br"></span>
hadn’t noticed you before—please don’t take any offense—so much did my anger block my eyesight.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">mer</span>
</span> That’s no surprise. But if he’s at home, I’d like a word with
Demaenetus.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">leo</span>
</span> He (<span class="italic">points to Libanus</span>) says he’s not in. Still, if you want to
pay down this money to me, I shall guarantee that your
debt with us will be settled.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">mer</span>
</span> No, I prefer it like this: I’ll return it to you when your<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">455</span><span class="br"></span>
master Demaenetus is present.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">lib</span>
</span> (<span class="italic">to the merchant, in a pleading voice</span>) Master knows him
and he knows master.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">mer</span>
</span> (<span class="italic">firmly</span>) I will return it to him when his master is present.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">lib</span>
</span> Just give it to him at my risk, I’ll vouch for its safety; if our
old man was to know you didn’t trust him (<span class="italic">points to
Leonida</span>), he’d be angry—he himself always trusts him in
everything.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">leo</span>
</span> (<span class="italic">to Libanus</span>) It doesn’t matter. No need to give it to me if<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">460</span><span class="br"></span>
he doesn’t want to. Let him stand there like this.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">lib</span>
</span> (<span class="italic">to the merchant</span>) Give it to him, I say. Dear me! I’m
afraid he might think I advised you not to trust him.
Please, give it to him and stop being afraid. It’ll be safe
and sound.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">mer</span>
</span> I’m sure it will be so long as I have it in my hand myself.
I’m a foreigner, I don’t know Saurea.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">lib</span>
</span> Well, then get to know him. (<span class="italic">points to Leonida</span>)</p></div>
