</span> You think he ought to be swallowed immediately if you
set eyes on him?</p></div>

</span> Precisely. But are you talking about those old, lame donkeys
whose hooves had been worn away up to the thighs?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">leo</span>
</span> Exactly, the ones which used to carry elm-rods from the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">341</span><span class="br"></span>
country here for you.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">lib</span>
</span> I get you, and the same ones carried you from here to the
country in fetters.</p></div>

</span> You remember it well. But while I was sitting at the barber’s
he began to ask me if I knew a certain Demaenetus,
the son of Strato. I said immediately that I knew him and<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">345</span><span class="br"></span>
told him that I was his slave, and I showed him our house.</p></div>

</span> What next?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">leo</span>
</span> He said he was bringing money as payment for donkeys
to the steward Saurea, twenty minas, but he didn’t know
who this chap was, but he knew the master Demaenetus
well. When he’d said this—<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">350</span><span class="br"></span>
</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">lib</span>
</span> (<span class="italic">interrupting</span>) What then?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">leo</span>
</span> Well, listen and you’ll know. Immediately I turned into a
clever and grand man and I said that I am the steward.
He answered me like this: “I don’t know Saurea or what
he looks like. It wouldn’t be fair of you to be angry. Do
bring along your master Demaenetus, whom I do know,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">355</span><span class="br"></span>
if you please. I won’t delay you getting the money.” I said
I’d bring master along and would be at home waiting.
He’s going to go to the baths, then he’ll come here afterwards.
What plan do you think we should go for now?
Tell me.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">lib</span>
</span> (<span class="italic">in deep thought</span>) Well, I’m at it, how I can swindle both
the newcomer and Saurea out of the money. This scheme<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">360</span><span class="br"></span>
