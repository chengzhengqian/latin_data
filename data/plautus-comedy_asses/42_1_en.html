</span> Well, I can’t make head or tail of your talk. I can’t understand<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">730</span><span class="br"></span>
what you’re saying or why you’re fooling me.</p></div>

</span> (<span class="italic">to Leonida</span>) I think he’s been made fun of enough. Now
let’s tell him how things stand. (<span class="italic">to Argyrippus</span>) Argyrippus,
pay attention, will you? Your father told us to bring
this money to you. (<span class="italic">hands over the wallet</span>)</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">arg</span>
</span> How you brought it just in time and just at the right moment!</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">lib</span>
</span> There will be twenty good minas in here, acquired
through a bad job; he told us to give it to you on terms<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">735</span><span class="br"></span>
agreed upon.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">arg</span>
</span> What’s that, please?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">lib</span>
</span> You are to give him a night with her (<span class="italic">points at Philaenium</span>)
and a dinner.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">arg</span>
</span> (<span class="italic">after a brief hesitation</span>) Tell him to come, please. He’s
fully deserved it and we’ll do what he wants; he pulled
our love together again, which had been pulled apart.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">leo</span>
</span> Will you bear it, Argyrippus, that your father embraces
her?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">arg</span>
</span> This here (<span class="italic">lifts up the wallet</span>) will easily make me bear it.
Leonida, run, will you, and ask my father to come here.<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">740</span><span class="br"></span>

<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">leo</span>
</span> He’s already been inside for a long time.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">arg</span>
</span> Well, he didn’t come this way.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">leo</span>
</span> He secretly went around by the alley that way (<span class="italic">points</span>)
through the garden so that no one from our household
could see him come here. He’s afraid his wife could find
out. If your mother knew about the money, how it happened—</p></div>
