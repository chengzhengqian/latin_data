</span> Previously I too always used to think that he was a good
man, but in this deed he reveals himself, drinking together
with his son and renting a mistress together with
him, that old fart!</p></div>

</span> Yes, that explains why he has to go to dinner every day.
He says he’s going to Archidemus, Chaerea, Chaerestratus,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">865</span><span class="br"></span>
Clinia, Chremes, Cratinus, Dinia, Demosthenes: in
reality he corrupts his son at a prostitute’s and frequents
the brothels.</p></div>

</span> Why don’t you order your maids to pick him up and drag
him home?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">

</span> Just be quiet. Yes, I will give him a tough time.</p></div>

</span> I know that he’ll have one so long as you’re married to<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">870</span><span class="br"></span>

</span> I should think so. The idea of this person being busy
in the senate or with his clients, and then snoring the
whole night, worn out by his work there! He comes to
me at night, worn out from doing business outside. He’s
ploughing someone else’s field and leaves his own uncultivated.
And this corrupt person then corrupts his son.<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">875</span><span class="br"></span>

</span> Just follow me this way, I’ll make sure that you’ll catch the
chap himself in flagrante in a moment.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">art</span>
</span> Yes, there’s nothing I’d prefer to do.</p></div>

</span> What’s the matter?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">han</span>
</span> If you were to see your husband lying there with a garland
embracing his mistress, could you recognize him if
you were to see him?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">art</span>
</span> I could indeed.</p></div>
