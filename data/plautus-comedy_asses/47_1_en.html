</span> Do you have any harsh feelings about this, my son, if she’s<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">830</span><span class="br"></span>
now reclining with me?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">arg</span>
</span> Father, my sense of filial duty removes the sting from the
sight. Even though I love her, I can persuade myself not
to be upset at her reclining with you.</p></div>

</span> It’s appropriate for a young man to be respectful,
Argyrippus.</p></div>

<span class="sc">arg</span>
</span> Father, I can do it because you deserve it.</p></div>

</span> Go on then, let’s hold this banquet with sweet wine as<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">835</span><span class="br"></span>
well as sweet talk. I don’t want to be feared, I prefer to be
loved by you, my son.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">arg</span>
</span> Well, I’m doing both, as befits a son.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">dem</span>
</span> I’ll believe this if I see you cheerful.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">arg</span>
</span> Do you think I’m depressed?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">dem</span>
</span> Do I think so? I can see that you’re as sad as if you were in
for trial.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">arg</span>
</span> Don’t say that. <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">839–40</span><span class="br"></span>

<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">

</span> There, look: I’m laughing.</p></div>
