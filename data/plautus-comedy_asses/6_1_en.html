because they then have a more friendly and affectionate
son. And I am eager to do so myself. I want to be loved by
my offspring. I want to be like my father, who for my sake
put on a shipmaster’s outfit himself and by a trick abducted
the woman I was in love with from a pimp. And he<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">71</span><span class="br"></span>
was not ashamed to play tricks at his age and to buy the
affection of me, his son, with these acts of kindness. I’m
resolved to follow these ways of my father. Today my son
Argyrippus has asked me to supply him with money for<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">75</span><span class="br"></span>
his affair. And I’m very keen to oblige my son in this. I
want him to love me, obliging him in his love; I want him
to love me, his father. But his mother has a firm and tight
grip on him, just as fathers usually do; I’m having none of
that. It’s only fair that I should respect his inclinations,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">80</span><span class="br"></span>
especially since he felt that I deserved his confidence.
Since he approached me the way a respectful son should
approach his father, I wish that he should have money to
give to his girlfriend.</p></div>
