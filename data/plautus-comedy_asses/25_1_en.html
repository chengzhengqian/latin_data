</span> Saurea, I ask you to let him off for my sake.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">leo</span>
</span> (<span class="italic">ignoring him</span>) Hey, did anyone pay for shipping the oil?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">lib</span>
</span> Yes.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">leo</span>
</span> Who received the money?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">lib</span>
</span> Stichus himself, your deputy.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">leo</span>
</span> (<span class="italic">in a slightly calmer voice</span>)Well, well, well, you’re trying
to appease me. I know that I have a deputy and that<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">435</span><span class="br"></span>
there’s no slave in master’s house who is worth more than
him. But the wine I sold to the wine-merchant Exaerambus
yesterday, has he settled with Stichus for it now?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">lib</span>
</span> I think he has: I saw Exaerambus bring the banker here
himself.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">leo</span>
</span> That’s how I like it. When I allowed him credit before, I
barely managed to get the money out of him a year later.
Now he’s busying himself: he even brings him here on his<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">440</span><span class="br"></span>
own account and orders payment. Has Dromo brought
home his wages?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">lib</span>
</span> Less than half I think.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">leo</span>
</span> What about the rest?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">lib</span>
</span> He said he’d return it as soon as it was returned to him;
now it’s held back so that he’d finish the job he’s been
hired for.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">leo</span>
</span> And the goblets I lent to Philodamus, has he returned
them?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">lib</span>
</span> He still hasn’t.<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">445</span><span class="br"></span>
</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">leo</span>
</span> What, he hasn’t? Give things away if you like, “lend”
them to a friend.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">mer</span>
</span> (<span class="italic">aside, but not very quietly</span>) I can’t handle it! This chap
will drive me off with his disgusting behavior in a moment.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">lib</span>
</span> (<span class="italic">to Leonida, in a soft voice</span>) Hey, enough now, you. Can’t
you hear what he’s saying?</p></div>
