<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">amph</span><p class="lineGroup">Because you used to greet me on my arrival before and
to address me the way modest wives normally greet their
husbands. On my arrival I’ve found you at home without
that habit.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">alc</span><p class="lineGroup">I certainly did greet you here on your arrival yesterday<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">714</span><span class="br"></span>
and asked you at the same time if you’d been well
throughout, my husband, and I took your hand and gave
you a kiss.</p></div>

a son. But <span class="italic">you</span> will have a big thrashing if <span class="italic">he</span> (<span class="italic">points to her
