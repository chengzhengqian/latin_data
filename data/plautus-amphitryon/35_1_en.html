<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">amph</span><p class="lineGroup">Amphitruo is happy to greet his longed-for wife, whom
her husband judges to be the absolutely best of all in
Thebes, and whom the citizens of Thebes truly celebrate
as virtuous. Have you been well throughout? Are you
happy that I’m coming?</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">sos</span><p class="lineGroup">(<span class="italic">aside</span>) I don’t think so. She’s as happy to greet him as she
would be to greet a dog.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">amph</span><p class="lineGroup">I’m pleased to see you pregnant and beautifully round.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">alc</span><p class="lineGroup">Please, why are you making fun of me by greeting and addressing
me like this, as if you hadn’t seen me for a long
time and as if you were coming home here from the enemy
just now? Why are you addressing me now as if it was<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">685</span><span class="br"></span>
ages since you saw me?</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">amph</span><p class="lineGroup">Well, I haven’t seen you at all except for now today.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">alc</span><p class="lineGroup">Why are you denying it?</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">amph</span><p class="lineGroup">Because I’ve learnt to speak the truth.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">alc</span><p class="lineGroup">Anyone who unlearns what he’s learnt isn’t doing the
right thing. Are you two testing what feelings I have? But
why are you coming back here so quickly? Did the auspices<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">690</span><span class="br"></span>
delay you or did the weather detain you since you
didn’t go away to the army as you’d said not long ago?</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">amph</span><p class="lineGroup">Not long ago? How long ago was that?</p></div>
