me?</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">sos</span><p class="lineGroup">You’d be right to abuse me if it happened like this. But
I’m not lying, and I’m telling you the matter as it really
happened.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">amph</span><p class="lineGroup">This man’s drunk, I think.</p></div>

with you. Don’t you think now that I’ve said this clearly
enough and eloquently enough, master?</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">amph</span><p class="lineGroup">Bah, go away from me.</p></div>

<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">amph</span><p class="lineGroup">But if I return home safe and sound, I’ll make sure today
that you’re unwell and wretched, as you’ve deserved.

with your crazy claims. Now that you’ve neglected to<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">586</span><span class="br"></span>
carry out what your master ordered, you’re coming of
your own accord to ridicule him. You good-for-nothing
