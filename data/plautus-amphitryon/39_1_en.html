<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">amph</span><p class="lineGroup">(<span class="italic">to Sosia</span>) Be quiet, you. (<span class="italic">to his wife</span>) You tell me: I went
away from you from here at dawn today, did I?</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">alc</span><p class="lineGroup">Well, then who told me how the battle went there, if not
you?</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">amph</span><p class="lineGroup">You know about it?<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">745</span><span class="br"></span></p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">alc</span><p class="lineGroup">Of course! I heard from you how you conquered the
great city and slew King Pterela yourself.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">amph</span><p class="lineGroup">Did I tell you about this?</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">alc</span><p class="lineGroup">Yes, you there, and Sosia here was standing right next to
you.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">amph</span><p class="lineGroup">(<span class="italic">to Sosia</span>) Did you hear me tell her about this today?</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">sos</span><p class="lineGroup">Where should I have heard it?</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">amph</span><p class="lineGroup">Ask <span class="italic">her.</span></p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">sos</span><p class="lineGroup">This never happened in my presence, as far as I know.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">alc</span><p class="lineGroup">(<span class="italic">to Amphitruo</span>) Oh yes, it’s so surprising that he doesn’t<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">750</span><span class="br"></span> speak against you.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">amph</span><p class="lineGroup">Sosia, come on, look here at me.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">sos</span><p class="lineGroup">Yes, I’m looking.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">amph</span><p class="lineGroup">I want you to tell the truth, I don’t want you simply to
agree with me. Have you heard me say to her today what
she’s telling?</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">sos</span><p class="lineGroup">Please, are you also crazy, asking me about this? I’m now
seeing her for the first time myself, together with you.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">amph</span><p class="lineGroup">What now, woman? Can you hear him?<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">755</span><span class="br"></span></p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">alc</span><p class="lineGroup">I can indeed hear him . . . tell a lie.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">amph</span><p class="lineGroup">You won’t believe him or me, your husband?</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">alc</span><p class="lineGroup">Precisely, for the simple reason that I believe myself
most and that I know that these things happened the way
I’m telling you.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">amph</span><p class="lineGroup">Are you saying that I arrived yesterday?</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">alc</span><p class="lineGroup">Are you denying that you went away from here today?</p></div><notes></notes></section>
