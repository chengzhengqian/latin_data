not long ago, just now?</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">alc</span><p class="lineGroup">What do you think then? That I am making fun of you,
because you are making fun of me and claiming that<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">695</span><span class="br"></span>
you’ve now arrived for the first time? Just now you went
