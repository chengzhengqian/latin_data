great Jupiter. And my father’s now lying with her inside
the house, and for that very reason this night’s been made
longer, while he’s enjoying himself with the one he wants.
But he’s pretending to be Amphitruo. Now don’t be surprised<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">115</span><span class="br"></span>
about this outfit of mine, since I’ve come here like
this in slave’s dress: I’ll bring to you an old and ancient
tale anew, hence I’ve come here clothed in a new way.
Well, you see, my father Jupiter is inside now, he’s turned<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">120</span><span class="br"></span>
himself into Amphitruo’s image, and all the slaves who
see him believe that he’s the real thing. He changes appearances
like that whenever he wants. I’ve taken on the
slave Sosia’s image, who went away to the army with<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">125</span><span class="br"></span>
Amphitruo, so that I can be in attendance on my father
during his love affair and so that the family servants won’t
ask who I am when they see me spend a great deal of time
here in the house. Now when they believe that I’m a
slave, their fellow slave in fact, no one will ask me who I
am or what I’ve come for. My father’s now enjoying himself<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">131</span><span class="br"></span>
inside. He’s lying there, embracing the woman he desires
most. My father’s telling Alcumena what he did during
the campaign. She believes he’s her husband, while<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">135</span><span class="br"></span>
she is with an adulterer. In there my father’s now telling
how he put the enemy’s legions to flight and how he
was presented with a great many gifts. We took away the
gifts Amphitruo was given there: my father does what he
wants with ease. Now today Amphitruo will come here<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">140</span><span class="br"></span>
from the army, and also his slave, whose likeness I bear.
Now in order that you can tell us apart more easily, I’ll
have these little wings here on my hat throughout. And<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">144</span><span class="br"></span>
