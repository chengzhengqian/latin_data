inspectors should be appointed for the actors; should
anyone have given instructions that claqueurs should applaud
him, or should anyone have caused another to be
unsuccessful, they should beat his costume and his skin
to pieces. I wouldn’t want you to be surprised that Jupiter<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">86</span><span class="br"></span>
