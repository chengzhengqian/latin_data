<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">mer</span><p class="lineGroup">This job went well and successfully for me today. I removed
a terrible nuisance from the door so that my father<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">465</span><span class="br"></span>
can embrace that woman in safety. In a moment,
when that chap gets there and meets his master Amphitruo,
he’ll say the slave Sosia drove him away from the
door. Amphitruo will believe that he’s telling lies, and
he won’t believe that he came here as he’d ordered.
I’ll fill both of them and Amphitruo’s entire household<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">470</span><span class="br"></span>
with misunderstandings and madness until my father
gets enough of the woman he’s in love with. Then, and
only then, will all know what’s happened. In the end Jupiter
will bring Alcumena back into her old harmony
with her husband. Well, Amphitruo will start a row with<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">476</span><span class="br"></span>
his wife in a moment, and he’ll accuse her of adultery.
Then my father will quell this quarrel there. Now about

give birth to two twin sons. One boy will be born in the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">481</span><span class="br"></span>
tenth month<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL060_57_27" id="target_note_LCL060_57_27"><sup>27</sup></a> after he was conceived, the other in the
seventh; one of them is Amphitruo’s, the other Jupiter’s.
But the younger boy has the greater father and vice
versa. Do you know what I mean now? But out of consideration<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">486</span><span class="br"></span>
for Alcumena here, my father’s taken care that it
would happen in one go, so that she could complete two
arduous tasks in one labor, so that she wouldn’t be suspected
of adultery, and so that the secret affair would be
concealed. Still, as I’ve said already, Amphitruo will find<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">491</span><span class="br"></span>
