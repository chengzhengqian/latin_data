arrived home at your place for the first time now.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">alc</span><p class="lineGroup">Please, will you also deny that you gave me the golden<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">760</span><span class="br"></span>
bowl as a gift today, the one you’d said you were presented
with there?</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">amph</span><p class="lineGroup">I didn’t give it and I didn’t say so; but I did have it in
mind to present you with this bowl, and I still do. But who
told you that?</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">alc</span><p class="lineGroup">I heard it from you and I received the bowl from your
own hand.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">amph</span><p class="lineGroup">Wait, wait, please. (<span class="italic">to Sosia</span>) I’m highly surprised, Sosia,
how she knows I was presented with a golden bowl there<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">766</span><span class="br"></span>
unless you met her before and told her about all this.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">sos</span><p class="lineGroup">I haven’t told her and I haven’t seen her except together

bring out the bowl my husband presented me with today.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">amph</span><p class="lineGroup">Step aside here, Sosia. (<span class="italic">they withdraw a little</span>) Honestly,
I am astonished if she has that bowl more than I am astonished
about the other astonishing things.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">sos</span><p class="lineGroup">Do you really believe that? It’s being carried in this little
chest (<span class="italic">produces it</span>), sealed with your own signet.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">amph</span><p class="lineGroup">Is this seal unbroken?</p></div>
