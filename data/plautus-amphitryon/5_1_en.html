silly, as if I didn’t know that you want it; after all, I’m a
god. I know what your feelings in this matter are: I’ll
make sure it’s a mixed play; it’ll be a tragicomedy. Well, I<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">60</span><span class="br"></span>
don’t think it would be appropriate to turn completely
into a comedy a play where kings and gods come on stage.
What then? Since a slave has a role here as well, I’ll make
it, as I said, a tragicomedy. Now Jupiter has told me to ask<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">64</span><span class="br"></span>
you for this favor:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL060_19_3" id="target_note_LCL060_19_3"><sup>3</sup></a> inspectors should go to each and every
seat, to the spectators throughout the entire theatre; if
they see any claqueurs appointed for anyone, their togas
should be taken as security<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL060_19_4" id="target_note_LCL060_19_4"><sup>4</sup></a> in the theatre; or if any people<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">69</span><span class="br"></span>
should try to canvass the palm for these actors or any
artist, through letters written, or if anyone should canvass
himself, or through an intermediary, or for that matter,
if the aediles<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL060_19_5" id="target_note_LCL060_19_5"><sup>5</sup></a> should give it to anyone unfairly, Jupiter
has decreed that the same law should apply as if he’d
canvassed for an office for himself or another party. He<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">75</span><span class="br"></span>
said that you live as winners on account of your capability,
not of canvassing or unfair behavior. Why shouldn’t the
same law apply to an actor as to a man of high rank? One
ought to canvass through one’s capability, not through
claqueurs. A man who always acts correctly has enough
supporters, if those can be trusted in whose hands this is.
Among his instructions Jupiter also gave me the following:<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">81</span><span class="br"></span>
