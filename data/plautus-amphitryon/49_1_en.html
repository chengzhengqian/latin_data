<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">jup</span><p class="lineGroup">Wait. I’ll swear an oath on your own terms that I believe
my wife to be chaste. If I deceive you in this, then I ask
you, great Jupiter, to be angry with Amphitruo for ever.</p></div>

<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">jup</span><p class="lineGroup">I trust he will be: I gave a truthful oath in your presence.
You aren’t angry any longer, are you?</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">alc</span><p class="lineGroup">No, I’m not angry.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">jup</span><p class="lineGroup">Thank you. In human life many things of this sort happen:
they reap enjoyment, and they reap misery again.
Arguments come up between them, and they’re reconciled<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">940</span><span class="br"></span>
again. But if by chance any argument of this sort
arises between them, and if they’re reconciled again,
they’re twice as fond of each other as before.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">alc</span><p class="lineGroup">You ought to have been careful not to say such a thing in<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">944</span><span class="br"></span>
the first place, but if you apologize to me for it, I’ll have to
bear it.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">jup</span><p class="lineGroup">But have clean vessels prepared for me so that I can fulfill
all the vows I made while on active service if I should
return home safe and sound.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">alc</span><p class="lineGroup">I’ll take care of that.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">jup</span><p class="lineGroup">(<span class="italic">to those inside</span>) Call Sosia out here. He is to fetch our pilot<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">950</span><span class="br"></span>
Blepharo, who was on my ship, so that he can have
lunch with us. (<span class="italic">aside</span>) He’ll be made fun of without getting
lunch when I’m holding Amphitruo by the neck and
dragging him out from here.</p></div><notes></notes></section>
