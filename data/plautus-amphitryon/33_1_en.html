only for a short time, as long as I had the opportunity
to see my husband, for a single night only. And now<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">640</span><span class="br"></span>
he left me suddenly before sunlight. I feel alone now because
the one I love more than all others is away from
here. I’ve received more grief from my husband’s going
away than I’ve received joy from his coming. But there’s
one thing at least that makes me happy: he’s won a victory
over the enemy and returned home a hero. That gives me
comfort. Let him be away, so long as he comes home in<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">644</span><span class="br"></span>
glory. I’ll bear and keep bearing his departure with a firm
and strong heart, if only my reward is that my husband is
renowned as winner in war. I’ll consider this enough for
me. Courage is the best reward. Courage does indeed
outdo everything: freedom, safety, life, possessions and<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">650</span><span class="br"></span>
parents, home and relatives are protected and preserved.
Courage has all goods within itself, all goods are with the
man who has courage.</p></div>

She loves me and I love her in return. Especially after<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">655</span><span class="br"></span>
this success, after our victory over the enemy. No one
believed they could be overcome, and yet we conquered
them in the first encounter under my auspices and leadership.
Yes, I know for sure that my wife will be waiting
eagerly for my arrival.</p></div>
