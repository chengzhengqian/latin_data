greatest enjoyment for me. He’s in love: he’s wise. He’s<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">995</span><span class="br"></span>
doing the right thing when he’s having a good time. All
humans ought to do so, as long as it’s done in moderation.
Now my father wants Amphitruo to be made fun of: I’ll
make sure that he’ll be made fun of properly this instant,
spectators, while you’re watching. I’ll put a garland<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL060_113_37" id="target_note_LCL060_113_37"><sup>37</sup></a> on
my head and pretend to be drunk. I’ll climb up there<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1000</span><span class="br"></span>
(<span class="italic">points to the roof</span>): from up there I’ll drive the chap away
gloriously when he comes here. I’ll take care that he’s
soaked even when sober. Then his slave Sosia will immediately
pay the price. Today Amphitruo will accuse him
of doing what <span class="italic">I</span> will have done here. So what? It’s appropriate
for me to be obedient to my father, it’s proper for
me to serve his desire. But look, Amphitruo’s coming.<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1005</span><span class="br"></span>
He’ll be made fun of properly this instant, if you’re willing
to make the effort to listen. I’ll go inside and pick an
outfit suitable for those who’re drunk. Then I’ll go up
onto the roof in order to keep him away from here.</p></div>
