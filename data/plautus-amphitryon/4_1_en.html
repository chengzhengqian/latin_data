mother and a human father; so it wouldn’t be fair to
be surprised if he’s afraid for himself. And I too, who am<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">30</span><span class="br"></span>
Jupiter’s son, have caught the fear of a thrashing from
my father. Therefore I’m coming in peace and bringing
peace to you. I want to ask you for a just and small favor: I
was appointed as a just pleader pleading with the just for
a just cause. For it wouldn’t be right to obtain what’s unjust<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">35</span><span class="br"></span>
from the just; but it would be stupidity to demand
what’s just from the unjust since those who are unjust

he’s doing you. Now I’ll first tell you what I’ve come here<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">50</span><span class="br"></span>
to ask you for; then I’ll tell you the plot of this tragedy.
