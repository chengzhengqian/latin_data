than after hearing that you’re angry with me. Why did
you say it, you’ll ask. I’ll explain it to you. Well, not because
I believed you’re unchaste. But I was testing your
attitude, what you’d do and how you’d take it. I said those<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">916</span><span class="br"></span>
things as a joke to you a while ago, for fun. Ask Sosia here
