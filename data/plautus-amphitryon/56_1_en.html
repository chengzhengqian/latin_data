completely. But where is he? He went inside, to my wife I<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1045</span><span class="br"></span>
believe. What other man in Thebes is more wretched
than me? What should I do now? All mortals disown and
ridicule me as they like. (<span class="italic">pauses</span>) I’m resolved to burst

Neither Jupiter nor all the gods will prevent me, if they
want to, from doing as I’m resolved to. I’ll continue on
my way into the house now.</p></div>
