the hatred of absolute power and the wretched life of those who prefer to be feared rather than loved was readily apparent to all; for Dion’s own guards,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL467_125_1" id="target_note_LCL467_125_1"><sup>1</sup></a> if they had been well disposed, might have broken open the door and saved him, since he was still alive in the hands of his assailants, who were unarmed and calling for a weapon from without But when no one came to his help, one Lyco, a Syracusan, passed a sword through the windows,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL467_125_2" id="target_note_LCL467_125_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and with it the tyrant was slain.</p>
<p><span class="bold">10.</span> After the murder had been committed and a crowd had flocked in to see the sight, several men were killed by mistake, in the belief that they had done the deed. For the rumour that violence had been offered to Dion quickly spread, and many hastened to the spot to whom such a crime was abhorrent. These it was who, misled by suspicion, slew the innocent in place of the guilty. No sooner was Dion’s death made known than the sentiment of the people changed in a remarkable manner. For those who had called him a tyrant while he was alive now insisted that he had saved his country and freed it from a tyrant. Hence, on a sudden, pity succeeded to hatred, and the people would have redeemed him from Acheron, had it been possible, at the price of their own blood. And so he was buried in the most frequented part of the city at public expense, and the place of his burial was marked, by a monument. He died at the age of about fifty-five,<span class="marginNote right">353 <span class="sc">b.c.</span></span>
