been banished by Dionysius, whose cavalry he had formerly commanded. The two exiles began to make active preparations for war, but they did not accomplish much, since the rule of the tyrants was of so many years’ standing<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL467_117_1" id="target_note_LCL467_117_1"><sup>1</sup></a> that it was regarded as very powerful, and consequently few could be induced to share in so dangerous an undertaking. Nevertheless Dion, relying less upon his own resources than on hatred of the tyrant, although he had but two transports, sallied forth with the greatest courage to attack a dynasty of fifty years’ duration, defended by five hundred war-ships, ten thousand horsemen and a hundred thousand foot. And he so easily overthrew his opponents—a success which filled all nations with amazement—that two days after landing in Sicily he entered Syracuse; which goes to show that no rule is secure which is not founded upon the devotion of its subjects.</p>
<p>At that time Dionysius was away from home, awaiting the enemy’s fleet in Italy; for he thought that no one would come against him without great forces. But he was mistaken; for Dion with those very people who had been under the heel of his opponent broke the king’s pride and gained possession of all that part of Sicily which Dionysius had ruled, as well as of the city of Syracuse, except the citadel and island<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL467_117_2" id="target_note_LCL467_117_2"><sup>2</sup></a> that formed a part of the town. So successful was he, in fact, that the tyrant consented to make peace on the following terms: Sicily was to fall to Dion, Italy<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL467_117_3" id="target_note_LCL467_117_3"><sup>3</sup></a> to Dionysius, and Syracuse to Apollocrates, who was especially trusted by Dionysius.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL467_117_4" id="target_note_LCL467_117_4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
