                divine that thou wilt pray for thy wife’s true love: by now methinks the gods have learnt this well. Thou wouldst not have rather for thine own all the fields in the whole world that stout yeomen plough with sturdy steers, nor for thine own all pearls soever that grow for India the blest by the red waters of the Eastern sea.</p>
<p><sup>17</sup>’Tis done as thou dost pray.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL006_261_1" id="target_note_LCL006_261_1"><sup>1</sup></a> See, on rustling wings Love flies to thy side with yellow bands to bind thy spouse—bands never to be loosed till dragging age bring wrinkles to her brow and bleach her hair. May the sign come true, Birth-spirit, and bring them offspring, and may a troop of younglings play before thy feet.</p>

<p><span class="sc">In</span> country and farmhouse bides my girl, Cornutus. Ah, me! he is iron who can stay in town. Venus herself has moved into the spreading fields and Love is learning the rustic speech of ploughmen. Oh, could I only look on my mistress, how stoutly there with my sturdy hoe would I turn the fertile soil and follow the curved plough as a tiller of the fields, while the barren oxen forced the clods up for the sowing! Nor would I murmur that the sun burned my slender limbs or that broken blisters hurt my delicate hands.</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>Apollo, too, the beautiful, fed the bulls of Admetus; nor did his lute and hair unshorn avail him aught, nor could he cure his trouble by healthiving herbs. Love had triumphed o’er all resources</p>
