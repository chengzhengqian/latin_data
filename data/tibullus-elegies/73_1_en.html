<h3>XVIII<span class="linebreak"></span><span class="italic">An Apology</span></h3>
<p><span class="sc">My</span> life, let me be no more to thee so hot a passion as few days ago methinks I was, if in my whole youth I have done any deed of folly of which I would own I have repented more, than leaving thee yesternight alone, through desire to hide the fire within me.</p>
<h3>XIX<span class="linebreak"></span><span class="italic">To his Mistress</span></h3>
<p>No woman shall filch thy place of love with me: such our covenant when first the love-tie joined us. Only thou dost please me; now save thee no girl in the city is beauteous to my eyes. And, oh, might I be the only one to think thee fair! Mayst thou be unpleasing to all besides. So shall I be safe. No need for envy here; far from me be the vaunts of the common herd; let the wise man keep his joy hushed up within his bosom. Thus shall I live happily in forest depths where foot of man has never worn a path. For me thou art repose from cares, light even in night’s darkness, a throng amid the solitudes. Now, though a mistress be sent to Tibullus from the skies, she will be sent in vain, and desire be extinguished. This I swear to thee by thy Juno’s holy power; for to me is she great above all gods beside. What mad thing am I doing? Alas! surrendering my hostages. That was an oath of folly. Thy fears were my gain. </p></section><notes></notes></section>
