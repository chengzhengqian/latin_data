of all my fruit that the fresh season ripens I set the first before the country’s guardian god. Ceres of the yellow hair, from my farm comes a spiky wreath to hang before thy temple doors. And to the fruit-laden gardens is given red Priapus as watch, to scare the birds with cruel billhook.</p>
<p><sup>19</sup>Ye too, my Lares, who watch over an estate, now poor though thriving once, receive your gifts. Then a slain heifer was peace-offering for uncounted beeves; a lamb is now the humble victim for my narrow plot of ground. A lamb shall fall for you, and round it the country youth shall shout: “Huzza! Send us good crops and wine!”</p>
<p><sup>33</sup>But ye, ye thieves and wolves, have mercy on my scanty flocks; from great herds must ye take your spoil. Here is all I have to make the yearly expiation for my herdsman, and to sprinkle over Pales the milk that makes her kind. Be with me, Gods: nor scorn gifts from a humble board and on clean earthenware. Earthen were the drinking-cups which the ancient yokel first made himself, modelling them from pliant clay.</p>
<p><sup>41</sup>I ask not for the riches of my sires or the gains which garnered harvests brought to my ancestors of yore. A small field’s produce is enough—enough if I may sleep upon my bed and the mattress ease my limbs as heretofore. What delight to hear the winds rage as I lie and hold my love safe in my gentle clasp; or, when the stormy South Wind sheds the chilling showers, to seek sleep in safety, aided by a fire! This be my lot; let him be rightly rich who can bear the rage of the sea and the dreary rain. Ah, sooner let all the gold and all the emeralds perish from the world than any maiden weep for my journeyings.</p>
