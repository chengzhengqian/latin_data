                to me, lest the slighted spirit send thee evil dreams and in thy slumbers thy mournful sister stand before thy bed, such as she was, when from the high casement she fell headlong down and passed blood-spattered to the lakes below. I cease, lest I stir again my lady’s bitter woe. I am not worth one cry of grief from her.</p>
<p><sup>43</sup>Nor is it well that tears should mar those speaking eyes. ’Tis the bawd that is my bane; the girl herself is good. Phryne, the bawd, keeps me out, alas, as stealthily she passes to and fro with tablets hidden in her bosom. Many times, when from the hard threshold I recognise my mistress’s sweet voice, Phryne denies she is at home. Often, when the night has been pledged to me, she brings message that the girl is sick or has been affrighted by some warning. Then I die with distress, and desperate fancy figures to itself in what and whose embraces my love is held. Then I call curses on thee, bawd. Thy life will be full enough of fears, if any part of what I pray is heard in heaven.</p>
