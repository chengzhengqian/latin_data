<p><sup>39</sup>“Aeneas never-resting, brother of Cupid ever on the wing, whose exiled barks carry the holy things of Troy, now doth Jove allot to thee the fields of Laurentum, now doth a hospitable land invite thy wandering gods. There shall divinity be thine when Numicius’ ever-worshipped waters pass thee to heaven, a god of the native-born. See, o’er the weary ships is Victory hovering. At last the haughty goddess comes to the men of Troy. Lo, I see the fire blaze from the Rutule camp.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL006_275_1" id="target_note_LCL006_275_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Now, savage Turnus, I foretell thy fall. Before my eyes is Laurentum’s fortress and Lavinium’s wall, and Long Alba, which Ascanius leads his host to found. Now thee too, Ilia, priestess whom Mars is to find fair, I see departed from the Vestal hearth. I see thy secret bridal, thy snood cast upon the ground, and, left upon the banks, the arms of the eager god. Now, while ye may, bulls, crop the grass of the Seven Hills. Ere long this will be a great city’s site. Thy nation, Rome, is fated to rule the earth wherever Ceres looks from heaven upon the fields she tends, both where the gates of dawn are opened and where in tossing waters the Ocean river bathes the Sun-god’s panting team. Then shall old Troy be a marvel to herself, and own that in this far journey ye did well for her. ’Tis truth I sing; so may I ever eat the holy bay unharmed and everlasting maidenhood be mine.”</p>
<p><sup>65</sup>So sang the seeress, and called thee to her, Phoebus, and tossed before her face her streaming hair.</p>
<p><sup>67</sup>All that Amalthea,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL006_275_2" id="target_note_LCL006_275_2"><sup>2</sup></a> all that Herophile<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL006_275_2" id="target_note_LCL006_275_2"><sup>2</sup></a> of Marpessos foretold, all the warnings of Grecian Phoeto<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL006_275_2" id="target_note_LCL006_275_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and of all the sacred lots that the Sibyl of Tibur carried through the stream of Anio and in dry bosom</p>
