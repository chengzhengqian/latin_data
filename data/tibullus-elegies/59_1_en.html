So may this humble effort prove welcome also, that thereafter the memory may give me strength to make yet other and yet other verses in thy honour.</p>

In return Dionysus presented him with a skin of wine. The shepherds whom Icarius regaled with the liquor, thinking that they were poisoned, killed him.
