                mock the reaping with defaulting blade. Let not our slow lambs fear the swifter wolves.

My prayers are heard. See in the favouring entrails how the liver-markings bear a message that the gods are gracious.</p>
<p><sup>27</sup>Now from the old bin bring me out the smoked Falernians and loose the bands of the Chian jar.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL006_255_2" id="target_note_LCL006_255_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Let drinking be the order of the day.

But let each one, as he drinks, cry, “Health to Messalla!” and in every utterance be the name of the absent heard.</p>

They taught him first to put the planks together and cover his humble dwelling with green leaves. They too, ’tis told, first trained bulls to be his slaves, and placed the wheel beneath the wain. Then savage habits passed away; then was the fruit-tree planted, and the thriving garden drank the water from the rills. Then the golden grapes gave up their juices to the trampling feet, and sober water was mixed with cheering wine.</p>
