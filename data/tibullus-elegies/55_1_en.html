<h3>V<span class="linebreak"></span><span class="italic">Lygdamus Sick to his Friends</span></h3>
<p><span class="sc">Ye</span>, my friends, stay by the stream that flows from Etruscan source, stream not to be approached in the Dog-star’s heat, but now second only to the holy waters of Baiae when the ground loosens in brighthued spring. But <span class="italic">I</span> have warning from Persephone that the black hour is nigh.</p>
<p><span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">6</span><span class="br"></span> Harm me not, goddess; I am young and have done no wrong. I have not sought in recklessness to make known the rites of the goddess whom folk call Good, which no male must profane. My hand has infused no deadly juices in men’s cups or pounded poison for the lips of any one. Nor have I sacrilegiously set fire to temples, nor is my conscious vexed by horrid crime, nor from the pent-up bitterness of a frantic soul have I let my blaspheming tongue wag against gods who show no favour.</p>
<p><span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">15</span><span class="br"></span> Neither as yet has my black hair been harmed by grey, nor bowed age come to me on halting feet. My parents first beheld my birthday when both the consuls fell by the self-same fate.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL006_301_1" id="target_note_LCL006_301_1"><sup>1</sup></a> What gain is it to rob a vine of growing grapes or to pluck the fruit just formed with brutal hand? Spare me, ye gods in whose sway are the wan waters and the stern realms, allotted to you third.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL006_301_2" id="target_note_LCL006_301_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Let the hour be far off when my eyes shall see the Elysian plains, the barque of Lethe, and the Cimmerian pools, when my cheeks are sallow with wrinkled age and the old man tells the boys of the days gone by.</p>
