<p><sup>7</sup>But if thou art merciful to soldiers, here is one will be a soldier too, and bring himself refreshing water in his helm. I am off to the camp. Farewell to Love, farewell to lasses. I too am stout of limb; for me too the trumpet was created.</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>Brave is my speech; but when I have uttered the brave bravado, the shutting of a door strikes the bold words from my lips. How often have I sworn that to its threshold I would return no more! For all my valiant swearing, my foot comes back itself.

Not forever will she bear with thee for making her votary weep. In her name I bid thee, be not cold
