<h3>IX<span class="linebreak"></span><span class="italic">To Marathus</span></h3>
<p class="noindent"><span class="sc">Why</span>, if thou wast to wrong my helpless love, didst thou pledge thy faith to me before the gods but to break it privily? Unhappily! even if at first we hide the perjury, yet in the end comes Punishment on noiseless feet. Still spare him, powers above. ‘Tis not unjust if for <span class="italic">one</span> sin against your godhead beauty should pay no forfeit.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>’Tis in quest of gain the countryman yokes his bulls to his good plough and plies his hard work on the land; it is gain that the swaying ships pursue when the sure stars guide them through seas that the winds control. And by gifts has my lad been captured. But may God turn them to ashes and running water.</p>
<p><sup>13</sup>Ere long he will make me full amends; his comeliness will be lost amid the dust and the winds that roughen his hair; his face, his curls will be burned by the sun, and long travel will disable his tender feet.</p>
<p><sup>17</sup>How many times have I warned him: “Let not gold sully beauty; under gold there often lurks a multitude of ills. Whosoever has let wealth tempt him to outrage love, with him is Venus fierce and obdurate. Rather burn my head with fire, stab my body with steel, and cut my back with the twisted scourge. And have no hope of concealment when thou art planning wrong. God knows of it, and lets no treachery stay hid. God himself has often permitted a tongue-tied servant to come out with frank talk under the influence of much drink.</p>
