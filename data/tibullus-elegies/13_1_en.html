<p><sup>73</sup>These things did the god’s voice utter for me to sing to Titius; but them doth Titius’ wife forbid him to remember. So let <span class="italic">him</span> listen to his dear; but do ye throng to my school whom some crafty lad with many wiles treats ill. Each of us has his proper glory. Let slighted lovers seek advice from me; to all my doors are open. A time shall come when round the master of the lore of Venus shall crowd the attentive young and take the old man home.</p>
<p><sup>81</sup>Alas! what lingering torture is this love for Marathus: helpless is my skill, and helpless all my cunning. Spare me, I pray thee, boy, lest I become a byword, when folk shall laugh at my useless teaching.</p>
<h3>V<span class="linebreak"></span><span class="italic">To Delia</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">I <span class="sc">was</span> angry. I vowed I could bear our severance well. But now my proud vaunting has left me far and far away. For I am driven as a top that springs before the lash over the level ground, whirled by a quick boy’s practised art.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>Bring brands and tortures for the untamed creature, that he may have no love of talking loud hereafter: quell his wild utterances.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>Yet spare me, by the bonds of our stealthy union, I entreat thee, by our love and the head that has lain by mine. It was I, they say, whose vows snatched thee from peril when thou layest exhausted in sickness’ gloomy hold. It was I that scattered all about thee the cleansing sulphur, the beldame first chaunting her magic spell. I appeased the cruel Dreams that had thrice to be propitiated with offering of holy meal, that they might work no harm.</p>
