<h3>XV<span class="linebreak"></span><span class="italic">The Journey Abandoned</span></h3>
<p><span class="sc">Dost</span> thou know that the burden of that journey is lifted from thy girl’s heart? Now I can be at Rome upon my birthday. Let us all, then, celebrate that occasion, which comes to thee this time by unexpected chance.</p>
<h3>XVI<span class="linebreak"></span><span class="italic">Cerinthus Unfaithful</span></h3>
<p>I must thank thee that now in thy unconcern thou dost allow thyself so much at my expense,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL006_335_1" id="target_note_LCL006_335_1"><sup>1</sup></a> that I may not trip in some unhappy fit of folly. For thee toga and strumpet loaded with wool-basket may be worthier of thy preference than Sulpicia, Servius’ daughter. But they are distressed in my behalf, to whom this is the greatest cause of pain, that I may yield my place to an ignoble rival.</p>
<h3>XVII<span class="linebreak"></span><span class="italic">From her Sick-bed</span></h3>
<p><span class="sc">Cerinthus</span>, has thou any tender thought for thine own girl, now that fever racks her feeble frame? Ah, I would not pray to triumph over the drear disease if I thought not that thou wouldst wish it too. How should it profit me to master sickness if thou canst bear my troubles with a heart unmoved?</p>
