Nor let it be said that her wanton sister can drain more cups or exhaust more gallants. She, folk say, often prolongs her wine-bibbing revels till the wheels of the Light-bringer rise to summon forth the day. Than she could none lay out the night hours better, or arrange the different modes of love.</p>

Dost thou think that it is for thee that she arranges her hair and through her fine tresses passes the close-toothed comb? Is it <span class="italic">thy</span> beauty prompts her to clasp gold on her arms and come forth arrayed in Tyrian drapery? Not thee, but a certain youth would she have find her charming. For him she would consign to ruin thee and all thy house. Nor does she this out of depravity; but the dainty girl shrinks from limbs that gout disfigures and an old manâ€™s arms.</p>

Didst thou dare, mad youth, to sell caresses that belonged to me and to take to others the kisses that were mine? Thou wilt weep, then, when another lad has made me his captive and shall proudly reign in thy realm.</p>
<p><sup>81</sup>In that hour of thy punishment I shall rejoice, and a golden palm-branch shall be put up to Venus for her goodness, with this record of my fortunes:</p>
<p><span class="sc">tibullus whom from treacherous love, goddess, thou didst unbind</span></p>
<p><span class="sc">offers thee this and begs thee keep for him a thankful mind</span>.</p>
