<h3>SULPICIA</h3>
<h3>XIII<span class="linebreak"></span><span class="italic">On her Love</span></h3>
<p><span class="sc">At</span> last love has come; and the rumour that I have concealed it would shame me more than disclosure. Won over by my Muse’s prayers, Cythera’s queen has brought and placed him in my arms. What Venus promised she hath fulfilled. Let my joys be told by all of whom ‘tis said that they have missed their own. Never would I choose to entrust my messages to tablets under seal, that none might read them before my lover. Nay, I love my fault, and loathe to wear a mask for rumour. Let all hear that we have met, each worthy of the other.</p>
<h3>XIV<span class="linebreak"></span><span class="italic">Before her Birthday</span></h3>
<p><span class="sc">My</span> hated birthday is at hand, to be kept all joylessly in the odious country and without Cerinthus. What is more pleasant than the town? Would a grange be fit place for a girl, or the chill river of Arretium and its fields? Rest now, Messalla, from thy excessive zeal for me. Journeys, my kinsman, are oft ill-timed. They take me away, but here I leave my soul and heart, since force forbids my living mistress of myself.</p>
