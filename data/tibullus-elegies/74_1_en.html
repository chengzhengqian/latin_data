This, alas! is the mischief brought me by my chattering tongue. Now, do what thou wilt, I will remain thine always, nor flee from bondage to a mistress that I know, but will sit in my chains at the altar of holy Venus. She brands law-breakers and befriends the suppliant.</p>
<h3>XX<span class="linebreak"></span><span class="italic">Unkind Rumour</span></h3>
<p><span class="sc">Rumour</span> says that my girl is oft unfaithful. Now could I wish my ears were deaf. These charges are not made without suffering for me. Why dost thou torture thus thy victim, bitter Rumour? Peace!</p>
<h3>DOMITIUS MARSUS<span class="linebreak"></span><span class="italic">On the Death of Tibullus</span></h3>
<p><span class="sc">Thee</span> too, Tibullus, ere thy time hath Death’s unfeeling hand</p>
<p>Despatched to fare by Vergil’s side to dim Elysium’s land,</p>

<p>Or in heroic numbers sweep with princes to the fray.</p>
