<p>III. Probus was a native of Pannonia, of the city of Sirmium,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_341_1" id="target_note_LCL263_341_1"><sup>1</sup></a> his mother was of nobler birth than his father, his private fortune was modest, and his kindred unimportant. Both as commoner and as emperor he stood forth illustrious, famed for his virtues. His father, so some have said in their writings, was a man named Maximus, who, after commanding in the ranks<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_341_2" id="target_note_LCL263_341_2"><sup>2</sup></a> with honour and winning a tribuneship, died in Egypt, leaving a wife, a son, and a daughter. Many aver that Probus was a relative of Claudius,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_341_3" id="target_note_LCL263_341_3"><sup>3</sup></a> that most excellent and venerated prince, but this, because it has been stated by only one of the Greek writers, we shall leave undiscussed. This one thing I will say, however, which I remember reading in the journal, namely, that Probus was buried by a sister named Claudia.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_341_4" id="target_note_LCL263_341_4"><sup>4</sup></a> As a youth Probus became so famed for his bodily strength that by approval of Valerian he received a tribuneship almost before his beard was grown. There is still in existence a letter written by Valerian to Gallienus, in which he praises Probus, then still a youth, and holds him up for all to imitate. From this it is clear that no man has ever in his maturity attained to the sum of the virtues except one who, trained in the nobler nursery of the virtues, had as a boy given some sign of distinction.</p>
