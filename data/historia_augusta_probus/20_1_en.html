But when he had likewise brought over many from other tribes, that is, Gepedes, Greuthungi<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_373_2" id="target_note_LCL263_373_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and Vandals, they all broke faith, and when Probus was busied with wars against the pretenders they roved over well nigh the entire world on foot or in ships and did no little damage to the glory of Rome. He crushed them, however, at divers times and by various victories, and only a few returned to their homes, enjoying glory because they had made their escape from the hands of Probus. Such were Probus’ exploits among the barbarians.</p>
<p>He also had to cope with revolts of pretenders, and they were serious indeed.
