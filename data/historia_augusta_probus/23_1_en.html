this remark? Had he not put down all barbarian nations under his feet and made the whole universe Roman? “Soon,” he said, “we shall have no need of soldiers.” What else is this than saying: “Soon there will not be a Roman soldier? Everywhere the commonwealth will reign and will rule all in safety. The entire world will forge no arms and will furnish no rations, the ox will be kept for the plough and the horse be bred for peace, there will be no wars and no captivity, in all places peace will reign, in ail places the laws of Rome, and in all places our judges.”</p>

<p>XXI. But in my love for a most excellent emperor I am proceeding further than a prosaic style requires. Wherefore, I will add only that which, most of all, hastened on for this great man his destined doom. When he had come to Sirmium, desiring to enrich and enlarge his native place, he set many thousand soldiers together to draining a certain marsh, planning a great canal with outlets flowing into the Save, and thus draining a region for the use of the people of Sirmium. At this the soldiers rebelled, and pursuing him as he fled to an iron-clad tower, which he himself had reared to a very great height to serve as a look-out, they slew him there in the fifth year of his reign.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_379_1a" id="target_note_LCL263_379_1a"><sup>1</sup></a> Afterwards, however, all the soldiers together built him a mighty tomb on a lofty mound,

Victor, <span class="italic">Caes.</span>, 37,4 and Eutropius, ix. 17, 2; on the other hand, Zosimus (i. 71, 4–5) and Zonaras (xii. 29) relate that after the departure of Probus the armies of Raetia and Noricum forced their commander, Carus, to assume the purple. The troops sent by Probus to quell the uprising joined the revolt, and when the remainder of Probus’ force learned of this they killed the Emperor.
