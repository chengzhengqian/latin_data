Bonosus, I will put them all in a special book, relating a little concerning them, as seems fitting, or rather, as need demands. One fact, indeed, must be known, namely, that all the Germans, when Proculus asked for their aid, preferred to serve Probus rather than rule with Bonosus and Proculus. Hence he granted permission to all the Gauls and the Spaniards and Britons to cultivate vineyards and make wines,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_375_1a" id="target_note_LCL263_375_1a"><sup>1</sup></a> and he himself planted chosen vines on Mount Alma<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_375_2" id="target_note_LCL263_375_2"><sup>2</sup></a> near Sirmium in Illyricum, after having had the ground dug up by the hands of the soldiers.</p>

He celebrated a triumph<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_375_3" id="target_note_LCL263_375_3"><sup>3</sup></a> over the Germans and the Blemmyae, and caused companies from all nations, each of them containing up to fifty men, to be led before his triumphal procession. He gave in the Circus a most magnificent wild-beast hunt, at which all things were to be the spoils of the people. Now the manner of this spectacle was as follows: great trees, torn up with the roots by the soldiers, were set up on a platform of beams of wide extent, on which earth was then thrown, and in this way the whole Circus, planted to look like a forest, seemed, thanks to this new verdure, to be putting forth leaves.

It does not imply that there had been a general prohibition, but meant the rescinding of an order of Domitian (Suetonius, <span class="italic">Dom.</span>, vii. 2), which attempted to provide, both for the increase in the production of grain and for the protection
of Italian vine-growers, that no new vineyards should be planted in Italy and that half of those in the provinces should be cut down. This order seems never to have been enforced in Asia Minor or southern Gaul or Spain, and even in the Danube provinces vines were planted before the time of Probus. An attempt had been made by Aurelian to promote viticulture in Italy (see <span class="italic">Aur.</span>, xlviii. 2), but apparently without much success, and the attempt was now extended to the northern provinces, with the result that the prosperity of Gaul, at least, was revived; see Rostovtzeff, <span class="italic">Soc. and Econ.
