you hope to enjoy with me the state in safety,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_357_1" id="target_note_LCL263_357_1"><sup>1</sup></a> to supply the soldiers everywhere with grain and provisions and all necessities. I assure you that in so far as it lies in me, I will have no other prefect if you administer all things well.”.</p>
<p>And so, when it was known that Probus was emperor, the soldiers killed Florian,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_357_2" id="target_note_LCL263_357_2"><sup>2</sup></a> who had seized the imperial power as though an inheritance, for they knew well that no one could rule more worthily than Probus. Accordingly, without any effort of his, the rule of the whole world was conferred upon him by the voice of both army and senate.</p>

<p>XI. Now, since we have mentioned the senate, it should be made known what he himself wrote to the senate and likewise what reply that most noble body wrote back to him:</p>
<p>The first message of Probus to the senate:</p>
<p>“Rightly and duly did you act, Conscript Fathers, in the last year that has passed, when your clemency gave to the world a prince,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_357_3" id="target_note_LCL263_357_3"><sup>3</sup></a> and one, indeed, from among yourselves, you who are the princes of the world, as you have ever been in the past and shall continue to be in the days of your descendants. And I would that Florian also had been content to wait for this and had not claimed the imperial power as though an inheritance, or even that your majesty had made him or some other man your prince. But now, since he has seized the imperial power, we have been offered the name of Augustus by the army, while he has even been punished by the wiser soldiers because he usurped it. I beg you, therefore, to judge concerning my merits, for I am ready to do whatsoever your clemency shall command.”</p>
