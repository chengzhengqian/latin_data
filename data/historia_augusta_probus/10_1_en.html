There are still to be seen in many cities in Egypt public works of his, which he caused to be built by the soldiers. On the Nile, moreover, he did so much that his sole efforts added greatly to the tithes of grain. He constructed bridges and temples, porticos and basilicas, all by the labour of the soldiers, he opened up many river-mouths, and drained many marshes,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_353_3a" id="target_note_LCL263_353_3a"><sup>3</sup></a> and put in their place grain-fields and farms.
