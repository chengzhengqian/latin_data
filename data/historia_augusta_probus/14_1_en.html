But why need I now speak of Sarmatians,

It were too long to relate how many kings of mighty nations he drove into flight, how many commanders he slew with his own hand, how many arms he captured unaided while still a commoner. What thanks former emperors gave him their letters attest, now placed in the public memorials. Ye Gods, how many times he has been presented with military gifts! What praise he has won from the soldiers I As a youth he received a tribuneship, not long after his youth the command of legions. Ο Jupiter, Best and Greatest, thou, Juno our Queen, thou, Minerva, patroness of the virtues, thou, Concord of the world and thou, Victory of Rome, do ye all grant this to the senate and the people of Rome, grant this to our soldiers, grant this to our allies and to foriegn nations: may he rule even as he has served! Therefore, Conscript Fathers, in accordance with the harmonious wish of us all I vote him the name of emperor, the name of Caesar, the name of Augustus; and I add thereto the proconsular command, the revered title of Father of his Country, the chief pontificate, the right of three proposals in the senate,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_361_1" id="target_note_LCL263_361_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and the tribunician power.” Thereupon they shouted out, “So say we all of us, all of us.”</p>
