<p>In like manner Pelopidas, the Theban, in the Thessalian war, sought to cross a certain stream. Choosing a site above the bank larger than was necessary for his camp, he constructed a rampart of <span class="italic">chevaux-de-frise</span> and other materials, and set fire to it. Then, while the enemy were kept off by the fire, he crossed the stream.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL174_37_2" id="target_note_LCL174_37_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>When Quintus Lutatius Catulus had been repulsed by the Cimbrians, and his only hope of safety lay in passing a stream the banks of which were held by the enemy, he displayed his troops on the nearest mountain, as though intending to camp there. Then he commanded his men not to loose their packs, or put down their loads, and not to quit the ranks or standards. In order the more effectively to strengthen the impression made upon the enemy, he ordered a few tents to be erected in open view, and fires to be built, while some built a rampart and others went forth in plain sight to collect wood. The Cimbrians, deeming these performances genuine, themselves also chose a place for a camp, scattering through the nearest fields to gather the supplies necessary for their stay. In this way they afforded Catulus opportunity not merely to cross the stream, but also to attack their camp.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL174_37_3" id="target_note_LCL174_37_3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>When Croesus could not ford the Halys, and had neither boats nor the means of building a bridge, he began up stream and constructed a ditch behind his camp, thus bringing the channel of the river in the rear of his army.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL174_37_4" id="target_note_LCL174_37_4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
