<p>In the Social War, Lucius Sulla, surprised in a defile near Aesernia by the army of the enemy under the command of Duillius, asked for a conference, but was unsuccessful in negotiating terms of peace. Noting, however, that the enemy were careless and off their guard as a result of the truce, he marched forth at night, leaving only a trumpeter, with instructions to create the impression of the armyâ€™s presence by sounding the watches, and to rejoin him when the fourth watch began. In this way he conducted his troops unharmed to a place of safety, with all their baggage and engines of war.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL174_47_1" id="target_note_LCL174_47_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>The same Sulla, when fighting in Cappadocia against Archelaus, general of Mithridates, embarrassed by the difficulties of the terrain and the large numbers of the enemy, proposed peace. Then, taking advantage of the opportunity afforded by the truce, which served to divert the watchfulness of his adversary, he slipped out of his hands.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL174_47_2" id="target_note_LCL174_47_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Hasdrubal, brother of Hannibal, when unable to make his way out of a defile the entrance of which was held by the enemy, entered into negotiations with Claudius Nero and promised to withdraw from Spain if allowed to depart. Then, by quibbling over the terms, he dragged out negotiations for several days, during all of which time he was busy sending out his troops in detachments by way of paths so narrow that they were overlooked by the Romans. Finally he himself easily made his escape with the remainder, who were light-armed.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL174_47_3" id="target_note_LCL174_47_3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>When Marcus Crassus had constructed a ditch around the forces of Spartacus, the latter at night filled it with the bodies of prisoners and cattle that he had slain, and thus marched across it.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL174_47_4" id="target_note_LCL174_47_4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
