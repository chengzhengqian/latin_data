<p>Titus Marcius, a Roman knight, who had charge of the remnants of the army [of the Scipios] in Spain, seeing near at hand two camps of the Carthaginians a few miles distant from each other, urged on his men and attacked the nearer camp at dead of night. Since the enemy, being flushed with victory, were without organization, Marcius by his attack did not leave even so much as a single man to report the disaster. Granting his troops merely the briefest time for rest, and outstripping the news of his exploit, he attacked the second camp the same night. Thus, by a double success, he destroyed the Carthaginians in both places and restored to the Roman people the lost provinces of Spain.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL174_189_2" id="target_note_LCL174_189_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p><span class="sc">When</span> Publius Valerius had an insufficient garrison at Epidaurus and therefore feared perfidy on the part of the townspeople, he prepared to celebrate athletic contests at some distance from the city. When nearly all the population had gone there to see the show, he closed the gates and refused to admit the Epidaurians until he had taken hostages from their chief men.</p>

Then, sending his strongest men in the guise of invalids, he seized the city and held it. </p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL174_189_1"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL174_189_1" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">1</sup>98â€“93 <span class="sc">b.c.</span></a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL174_189_1').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL174_189_2"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL174_189_2" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">2</sup>212 <span class="sc">b.c.</span> Livy xxv. 37 gives his praenomen as Lucius.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL174_189_2').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
