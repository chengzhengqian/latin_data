<h2><span class="sc">Book II</span></h2>
<p><span class="sc">Having</span> in Book I given classes of examples which, as I believe, will suffice to instruct a general in those matters which are to be attended to before beginning battle, I will next in order present examples which bear on those things that are usually done in the battle itself, and then those that come subsequent to the engagement.</p>
<p>Of those which concern the battle itself, there are the following classes:</p>
<p>I. On choosing the time for battle.</p>
<p>II. On choosing the place for battle.</p>
<p>III. On the disposition of troops for battle.</p>
<p>IV. On creating panic in the enemy’s ranks.</p>
<p>V. On ambushes.</p>
<p>VI. On letting the enemy escape, lest, brought to bay, he renew the battle in desperation.</p>
<p>VII. On concealing reverses.</p>
<p>VIII. On restoring morale by firmness.</p>
<p>Of the matters which deserve attention after battle, I consider that there are the following classes:</p>
<p>IX. On bringing the war to a close after a successful engagement.</p>
<p>X. On repairing one’s losses after a reverse.</p>
<p>XI. On ensuring the loyalty of those whom one mistrusts.</p>
<p>XII. What to do for the defence of the camp, in case a commander lacks confidence in his present forces.</p>
<p>XIII. On retreating.</p>
