<h3><span class="sc">I. On Choosing the Time for Battle</span></h3>
<p><span class="sc">When</span> Publius Scipio was in Spain and had learned that Hasdrubal, leader of the Carthaginians, had marched out and drawn up his troops in battle array early in the morning before they had had breakfast, he kept back his own men till one o’clock, having ordered them to rest and eat. When the enemy, exhausted with hunger, thirst, and waiting under arms, had begun to return to camp, Scipio suddenly led forth his troops, opened battle, and won the day.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL174_91_1" id="target_note_LCL174_91_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>When Metellus Pius was waging war against Hirtuleius in Spain, and the latter had drawn up his troops immediately after daybreak and marched them against Metellus’s entrenchments, Metellus held his own forces in camp till noon, as the weather at that time of year was extremely hot. Then, when the enemy were overcome by the heat, he easily defeated them, since his own men were fresh and their strength unimpaired.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL174_91_2" id="target_note_LCL174_91_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>When the same Metellus had joined forces with Pompey against Sertorius in Spain, and had repeatedly offered battle, the enemy declined combat, deeming himself unequal to two. Later on, however, Metellus, noticing that the soldiers of the enemy, fired with great enthusiasm, were calling for battle, baring their arms, and brandishing their spears, thought it best to retreat betimes before their ardour. Accordingly he withdrew and caused Pompey to do the same.</p>
<p>When Postumius was in Sicily in his consulate, his camp was three miles distant from the Carthaginians. Every day the Punic chieftains drew up their line of battle directly in front of the fortifications </p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL174_91_1"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL174_91_1" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">1</sup>206 <span class="sc">B.C.</span> <span class="italic">Cf.</span> Polyaen. <span class="sc">viii</span>. xvi. 1.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL174_91_1').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note inline" id="note_LCL174_91_2"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL174_91_2" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">2</sup>76 <span class="sc">B.C.</span></a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL174_91_2').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
