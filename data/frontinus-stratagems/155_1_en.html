<p>After Quintus Sertorius had learned by experience that he was by no means a match for the whole Roman army, and wished to prove this to the barbarians also, who were rashly demanding battle, he brought into their presence two horses, one very strong, the other very feeble. Then he brought up two youths of corresponding physique, one robust, the other slight. The stronger youth was commanded to pull out the entire tail of the feeble horse, while the slender youth was ordered to pull out the hairs of the strong horse, one by one. Then, when the slight youth had succeeded in his task, while the strong one was still struggling vainly with the tail of the feeble horse, Sertorius observed: “By this illustration I have exhibited to you, my men, the nature of the Roman cohorts. They are invincible to him who attacks them in a body; but he who assails them by groups, will tear and rend them.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL174_311_1" id="target_note_LCL174_311_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>The consul Valerius Laevinus, having caught a spy within his camp, and having entire confidence in his own forces, ordered the man to be led around, observing that, for the sake of terrifying the enemy, his army was open to inspection by the spies of the enemy, as often as they wished.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL174_311_2" id="target_note_LCL174_311_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Caedicius, a centurion of the first rank, who acted as leader in Germany, when, after the Varian disaster,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL174_311_3" id="target_note_LCL174_311_3"><sup>3</sup></a> our men were beleagured, was afraid that the barbarians would bring up to the fortifications the wood which they had gathered, and would set fire to his camp. He therefore pretended to be in need of fuel, and sent out men in every direction to steal it. In this way he caused the Germans to remove the whole supply of felled trees.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL174_311_4" id="target_note_LCL174_311_4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
