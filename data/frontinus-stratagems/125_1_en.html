<p>When Hannibal was besieging Casilinum, the Romans sent big jars of wheat down the current of the Volturnus, to be picked up by the besieged. After Hannibal stopped these by throwing a chain across the river, the Romans scattered nuts on the water. These floated down stream to the city and thus sustained the necessities of the allies.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL174_251_1" id="target_note_LCL174_251_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>When the inhabitants of Mutina were blockaded by Antonius, and were greatly in need of salt, Hirtius packed some in jars and sent it in to them by way of the Scultenna River.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL174_251_2" id="target_note_LCL174_251_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Hirtius also sent down the river carcasses of sheep, which were received and thus furnished the necessities of life.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">XV. How to Produce the Impression of Abundance of what is Lacking</span></h3>
<p><span class="sc">When</span> the Capitol was besieged by the Gauls, the Romans, in the extremity of famine, threw bread among the enemy. They thus produced the impression that they were well supplied with food, and so withstood the siege till Camillus came.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL174_251_3" id="target_note_LCL174_251_3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>The Athenians are said to have employed the same ruse against the Spartans.</p>
<p>The inhabitants of Casilinum, when blockaded by Hannibal, were thought to have reached the starvation point, since Hannibal had cut off from their food supply even their use of the growing herbs by ploughing the ground between his camp and the city walls. The ground being thus made ready, the beseiged flung seed into it, thus giving the impression that they had enough wherewith to sustain life even till harvest time.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL174_251_4" id="target_note_LCL174_251_4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
