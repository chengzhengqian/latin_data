Upon coming up with the deserters, he commended them for outstripping him in their eagerness, and also urged them to attack the enemy courageously. Seized with shame and penitence, the deserters changed their purpose, imagining that it had not been detected.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL174_175_1" id="target_note_LCL174_175_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>The consul Titus Quinctius Capitolinus, when the Romans yielded ground in battle, falsely claimed that the enemy had been routed on the other flank.
