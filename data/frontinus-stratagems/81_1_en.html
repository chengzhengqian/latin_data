I am alone, but you have come out with a companion against me.” When Xanthus wondered who was following him and looked behind, Melanthus dispatched him with a single stroke, as his head was turned away.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL174_163_1" id="target_note_LCL174_163_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Iphicrates, the Athenian, on one occasion in the Chersonesus, aware that Anaxibius, commander of the Spartans, was proceeding with his troops by land, disembarked a large force of men from his vessels and placed them in ambush, but directed his ships to sail in full view of the enemy, as though loaded with all his forces. When the Spartans were thus thrown off their guard and apprehended no danger, Iphicrates, attacking them by land from the rear as they marched along, crushed and routed them.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL174_163_2" id="target_note_LCL174_163_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>The Liburnians on one occasion, when they had taken a position among some shallows, by allowing only their heads to appear above the surface of the water, caused the enemy to believe that the water was deep.

<p>Alcibiades, commander of the Athenians at the Hellespont against Mindarus, leader of the Spartans, having a large army and numerous vessels, landed some of his soldiers by night, and hid part of his ships behind certain headlands. He himself, advancing with a few troops, so as to lure the enemy on in scorn of his small force, fled when pursued, until he finally drew the foe into the trap which had been laid. Then attacking the enemy in the rear, as he disembarked, he cut him to pieces with the aid of the troops which he had landed for this very purpose.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL174_163_3" id="target_note_LCL174_163_3"><sup>3</sup></a> </p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL174_163_1"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL174_163_1" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">1</sup><span class="italic">Cf.</span> Polyaen. i. 19.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL174_163_1').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL174_163_2"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL174_163_2" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">2</sup>389–388 <span class="sc">b.c.</span> <span class="italic">Cf.</span> Xen. <span class="italic">Hell.</span> <span class="sc">iv.</span> viii. 32 ff.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL174_163_2').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL174_163_3"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL174_163_3" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">3</sup>410 <span class="sc">b.c.</span> <span class="italic">Cf.</span> Xen. <span class="italic">Hell.</span> <span class="sc">i.</span> i. 11 ff.; Polyaen. <span class="sc">i.</span> xl. 9; Diodor. xiii. 50.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL174_163_3').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
