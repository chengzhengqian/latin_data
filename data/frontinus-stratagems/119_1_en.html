<p>When Hannibal was besieging the city of Himera, he purposely allowed his camp to be captured, ordering the Carthaginians to retire, on the ground that the enemy were superior. The inhabitants were so deceived by this turn of affairs that in their joy they came out of the city and advanced against the Carthaginian breast-works, whereupon Hannibal, finding the town vacant, captured it by means of the troops whom he had placed in ambush for this very contingency.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL174_239_2" id="target_note_LCL174_239_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>In order to draw out the Saguntines, Hannibal on a certain occasion advanced against their walls with a thin line of troops. Then, at the first sally of the inhabitants, feigning flight, he withdrew, and interposing troops between the pursuing foe and the city, he slaughtered the enemy thus cut off from their fellows between the two forces.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL174_239_3" id="target_note_LCL174_239_3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>Himilco, the Carthaginian, when campaigning near Agrigentum, placed part of his forces in ambush near the town, and directed them to set fire to some damp wood as soon as the soldiers from the town should come forth. Then, advancing at daybreak with the rest of his army for the purpose of luring forth the enemy, he feigned flight and drew the inhabitants after him for a considerable distance by his retirement. The men in ambush near the walls applied the torch to the wood-piles as directed. The Agrigentines, beholding the smoke ascend, thought their city on fire and ran back in alarm to protect it. </p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL174_239_1"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL174_239_1" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">1</sup>259 <span class="sc">b.c.</span> <span class="italic">Cf.</span> <span class="sc">iii</span>. ix. 4 and note.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL174_239_1').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL174_239_2"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL174_239_2" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">2</sup>409 <span class="sc">b.c.</span> The Hannibal here mentioned is the son of Gisgo.
