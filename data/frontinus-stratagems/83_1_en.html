<p>Titus Marcius, a Roman knight, on whom the army conferred the supreme command after the two Scipios were slain, succeeded in enveloping the Carthaginians. When the latter, in order not to die unavenged, fought with increased fury, Marcius opened up the maniples, afforded room for escape, and as the enemy became separated, slaughtered them without danger to his own men.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL174_167_2" id="target_note_LCL174_167_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>When certain Germans whom Gaius Caesar had penned in fought the more fiercely from desperation, he ordered them to be allowed to escape, and then attacked them as they fled.</p>
<p>At Trasimenus, when the Romans had been enveloped and were fighting with the greatest fury, Hannibal opened up his ranks and gave them an opportunity of escape, whereupon, as they fled, he overwhelmed them without loss of his own troops.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL174_167_3" id="target_note_LCL174_167_3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>When the Aetolians, blockaded by Antigonus, king of the Macedonians, were suffering from famine and had resolved to make a sally in face of certain death, Antigonus afforded them an avenue of flight. Thus having cooled their ardour, he attacked them from the rear and cut them to pieces.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL174_167_4" id="target_note_LCL174_167_4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>Agesilaus, the Spartan, when engaged in battle with the Thebans, noticed that the enemy, hemmed in by the character of the terrain, were fighting with greater fury on account of their desperation. Accordingly he opened up his ranks and afforded the Thebans a way of escape. But when they tried to retreat, he again enveloped them, and cut them down from behind without loss of his own troops.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL174_167_5" id="target_note_LCL174_167_5"><sup>5</sup></a> </p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL174_167_1"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL174_167_1" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">1</sup>349 <span class="sc">b.c.</span> L.
