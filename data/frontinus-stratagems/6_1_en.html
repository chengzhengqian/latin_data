Ventidius utilized this interval for reuniting his forces, and having assembled these, three days before the Parthians arrived, he opened battle, conquered Pacorus, and killed him.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL174_13_3" id="target_note_LCL174_13_3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>Mithridates, when he was blockaded by Pompey and planned to retreat the next day, wishing to conceal his purpose, made foraging expeditions over a wide territory, and even to the valleys adjacent to the enemy.

Then, in the second watch, he led out his forces directly past the camp of the enemy.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL174_13_4" id="target_note_LCL174_13_4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

Under cover of this he plunged into sudden warfare, crushed the ferocity of these savage tribes, and thus acted for the good of the provinces.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL174_13_5" id="target_note_LCL174_13_5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
