<h2><span class="sc">Book IV</span></h2>
<p><span class="sc">Having</span>, by extensive reading, collected examples of stratagems, and having arranged these at no small pains, in order to fulfil the promise of my three books (if only I have fulfilled it), in the present book I shall set forth those instances which seemed to fall less naturally under the former classification (which was limited to special types), and which are illustrations rather of military science in general than of stratagems. Inasmuch as these incidents, though famous, belong to a different subject,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL174_267_1" id="target_note_LCL174_267_1"><sup>1</sup></a> I have given them separate treatment, for fear that if any persons should happen in reading to run across some of them, they might be led by the resemblance to imagine that these examples had been overlooked by me. As supplementary material, of course, these topics called for treatment. In presenting them, I shall endeavour to observe the following categories:</p>
<p>I. On discipline.</p>
<p>II. On the effect of discipline.</p>
<p>III. On restraint and disinterestedness</p>
<p>IV. On justice.</p>
<p>V. On determination (“the will to victory”).</p>
<p>VI. On good will and moderation.</p>
<p>VII. On sundry maxims and devices.</p>
