He therefore posted guards at all the gates and roused the enemy, thus shut up within, to such a pitch of fury that he himself was slain in the fighting. When his lieutenants realized the situation, they withdrew the guards from one gate and afforded the Etruscans an opportunity of escape. But when the latter poured forth, the Romans pursued them and cut them to pieces, with the help of the other consul, Fabius, who happened to come up.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL174_169_1" id="target_note_LCL174_169_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>When Xerxes had been defeated and the Athenians wished to destroy his bridge,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL174_169_2" id="target_note_LCL174_169_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Themistocles prevented this, showing that it was better for them that Xerxes should be expelled from Europe rather than be forced to fight in desperation. He also sent to the king a messenger to tell him in what danger he would be, in case he failed to make a hasty retreat.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL174_169_3" id="target_note_LCL174_169_3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>When Pyrrhus, king of the Epirotes, had captured a certain city and had noticed that the inhabitants, shut up inside, had closed the gates and were fighting valiantly from dire necessity, he gave them an opportunity to escape.</p>
<p>The same Pyrrhus, among many other precepts on the art of war, recommended never to press relentlessly on the heels of an enemy in flightâ€”not merely in order to prevent the enemy from resisting too furiously in consequence of necessity, but also to make him more inclined to withdraw another time, knowing that the victor would not strive to destroy him when in flight.</p>
