<p>Sempronius Gracchus, when waging war against the Celtiberians, feigned fear and kept his army in camp.

<p>When Thamyris, queen of the Scythians, and Cyrus, king of the Persians, became engaged in an indecisive combat, the queen, feigning fear, lured Cyrus into a defile well-known to her own troops, and there, suddenly facing about, and aided by the nature of the locality, won a complete victory.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL174_135_4" id="target_note_LCL174_135_4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
