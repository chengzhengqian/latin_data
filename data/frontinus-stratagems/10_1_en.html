<p>During the war with the Cimbrians and Teutons, the consul Gaius Marius, wishing to test the loyalty of the Gauls and Ligurians, sent them a letter, commanding them in the first part of the letter not to open the inner part,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL174_21_2" id="target_note_LCL174_21_2"><sup>2</sup></a> which was specially sealed, before a certain date. Afterwards, before the appointed time had arrived, he demanded the same letter back, and finding all seals broken, he knew that acts of hostility were afoot.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL174_21_3" id="target_note_LCL174_21_3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
