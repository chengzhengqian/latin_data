<p>Viriathus, on one occasion, having placed men in ambush, sent a few others to drive off the flocks of the Segobrigenses.

<p>When Lucullus was put in charge of a garrison of two cohorts at Heraclea, the cavalry of the Scordisci, by pretending to drive off the flocks of the inhabitants, provoked a sortie.

<p>The Athenian general, Chares, when about to attack a city on the coast, hid his fleet behind certain promontories and then ordered his swiftest ship to sail past the forces of the enemy. At sight of this ship, all the forces guarding the harbour darted out in pursuit, whereat Chares sailed in with the rest of his fleet and took possession of the undefended harbour and likewise of the city itself.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL174_241_3" id="target_note_LCL174_241_3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
