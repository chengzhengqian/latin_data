<p><span class="sc">The</span> consul Titus Quinctius, having conquered the Aequians and Volscians in an engagement, decided to storm the walled town of Antium, Accordingly he called an assembly of the soldiers and explained how necessary this project was and how easy, if only it were not postponed.

Accordingly, having in two days accomplished a four days’ march through rough and barren districts, he crushed his foes, who were fearing no such event. Then, when his men asked the reason of so easy a success, he told them that they had won the victory as soon as they had accomplished the four days’ march in two.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL174_207_2" id="target_note_LCL174_207_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
