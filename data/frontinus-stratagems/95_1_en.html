In charge of those left behind he placed common and ordinary persons, thus preventing the officials from wishing to make any change, as being bound to him by favours, and the common people from even being able to do so, since they had been deprived of their leaders.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL174_191_1" id="target_note_LCL174_191_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

Scipio guarded her with the greatest pains and restored her to her betrothed, Alicius by name, presenting to him likewise, as a marriage gift, the gold which her parents had brought to Scipio as a ransom. Overcome by this manifold generosity, the whole tribe leagued itself with the government of Rome.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL174_191_4" id="target_note_LCL174_191_4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
