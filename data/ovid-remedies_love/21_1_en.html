some Pylades to care for his Orestes: this too will prove no small benefit of friendship. What, save the secret woods, were Phyllis’ bane? the cause of her death is sure: she had no companion. She was going, as the barbarian throng is wont to go, when it keeps the triennial feast of Edonian Bacchus, with hair dishevelled, and now, where she could, she gazed on the far-flung sea, now weary lay on the sandy ground. “Faithless Demophoon!” she cried to the deaf waves, and her sobbing broke the words she uttered. There was a narrow way o’er-cast
by the long shadows, by which she oft betook herself to the sea. For the ninth time she trod her hapless path: “Let him see to it!” she cries, and turning pale looks at her girdle; she looks at the branches also; she hesitates, and shrinks from what she ventures, and is afraid, and sets her fingers at her neck. Then truly, Sithonian maid, could I wish thou hadst not been alone: the wood had not shed its leaves and wept for Phyllis.
