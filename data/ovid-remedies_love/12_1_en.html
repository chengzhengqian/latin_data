truth. “How far from comely are my girl’s arms!” yet comely they were, to say the truth. “How short she is!” though she was not; “how much she asks of her lover!” that proved my chiefest cause of hate. Faults too lie near to charms; by that error virtues oft were blamed for vices. Where you can, turn to the worse your girl’s attractions, and by a narrow margin criticise amiss.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL232_201_1" id="target_note_LCL232_201_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Call her fat, if she is full-breasted, black, if dark-complexioned; in a slender woman leanness can be made a reproach. If she is not simple, she can be called pert: if she is honest, she can be called simple. Nay more, whatever gift your mistress lacks, ever with coaxing words pray her to employ it. Insist that she sing, if she be without a voice; make her dance, if she know not how to move her arms. Has her speech an accent? make her talk much with you; she has never learnt to touch the strings? call for the lyre. Her gait is awkward? take her for a walk; her bosom is all breasts? let no bands conceal the fault. If her teeth are ugly, tell her something to make her laugh; are her eyes weak? recount a tearful tale. It will profit, too, of a sudden, when she has not prepared herself for anyone, to speed of a morning to your mistress. We are won by dress; all is concealed by gems and gold; a woman is the least part of herself. Often may you ask, where is there aught to love amid so much; with this aegis wealthy Love deceives the eye. Arrive unexpectedly: safe yourself, you will catch her unarmed; she will fall, hapless woman, by her own defects. Yet ’tis not safe to trust this precept overmuch, for artless beauty deceives many a lover.
