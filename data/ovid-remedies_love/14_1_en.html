Elegy sing of quivered Loves, and lightly sport in kindly mood at her own pleasure. Achilles must not be told of in the numbers of Callimachus; Cydippe suits not thy utterance, Homer. Who could endure Thais playing Andromacheâ€™s part?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL232_205_1" id="target_note_LCL232_205_1"><sup>1</sup></a> she would err, who in Andromache played the part of Thais. Thais is the subject of my art; unfettered is my love-making: naught have I to do with fillets; Thais is the subject of my art. If my Muse meets the charge of mirthful themes, I have won, and she is accused on a false charge. Burst thyself, greedy Envy! my fame is great already; it will be greater still, so it keep its first good fortune. But you<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL232_205_2" id="target_note_LCL232_205_2"><sup>2</sup></a> haste overmuch: if I but live, you will grieve the more; many a song in store has my genius yet. For the desire of fame delights me, and has grown with my renown; my steed pants but at the beginning of the slope. Elegy admits it owes as much to me as the noble Epic owes to Virgil.</p>
<p>So far I have but made answer to reproach: pull the rein more strongly, and run, poet, in thy proper track. When therefore union is sought and the work of lusty youth, and the time of the promised night draws nigh, lest your pleasure in your mistress enthral you, if you take it with full vigour, I would have you be with someone first; find someone in whom the first bliss may spend itself: that which follows will be slow to come. Pleasure deferred is keenest: in cold we enjoy the sun, in sunshine shade, in thirst water is welcome. I am ashamed, yet I will say it: choose also a posture for your union that you think least helpful and least becoming. Nor is that hard to manage: few women admit the truth, nor is there anything they will think
