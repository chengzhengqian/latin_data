ever. Let love fail, and vanish into tenuous air, and die by slow degrees. But to hate a woman once loved is a crime: that is an end fitting to savage minds. It is enough to be indifferent: he who ends love by hating, either loves still, or will find it hard to end his misery. Shameful is it that a man and woman lately at one should be foes forthwith; the Appian<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL232_223_1" id="target_note_LCL232_223_1"><sup>1</sup></a> herself approves not such strife as that. Men often put women in the dock, and love them: where no quarrel comes love unremembered

Remember now your rival, the threshold so hard to the lover, the fruitless prayers to witnessing gods. Do not arrange your hair because you are meeting her, nor let your toga’s loose folds attract
