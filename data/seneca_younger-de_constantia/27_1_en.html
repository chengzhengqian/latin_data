On the other hand, Chaerea, a tribune of the soldiers, had a way of talking that ill-accorded with his prowess; his voice was feeble and, unless you knew his deeds, was apt to stir distrust. When he asked for the watchword, Gaius would give him sometimes “Venus,” sometimes “Priapus,” seeking to taunt the man of arms, in one way or another, with wantonness. He himself, all the while, was in gauzy apparel, shod with sandals,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL214_101_a" id="target_note_LCL214_101_a"><sup>a</sup></a> and decked with gold.
