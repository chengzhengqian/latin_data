And so the wise man not improperly considers insult from such men as a farce, and sometimes, just as if they were children, he will admonish them and inflict suffering and punishment, not because he has received an injury, but because they have committed one, and in order that they may desist from so doing. For thus also we break in animals by using the lash, and we do not get angry at them when they will not submit to a rider, but we curb them in order that by pain we may overcome their obstinacy. Now, there-fore, you will know the answer to the question with which we are confronted: “Why, if the wise man cannot receive either injury or insult, does he punish those who have offered them?” For he is not avenging himself, but correcting them.</p>
