It is not for you, therefore, to call reckless this boast of mine<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL214_65_a" id="target_note_LCL214_65_a"><sup>a</sup></a>; and if you do not give me credence, I shall adduce a voucher for it.

I crept just now from the ruins of my house, and while the conflagration blazed on every side, I fled from the flames through blood; what fate befalls my daughters, whether a worse one than their country’s own, I know not.
