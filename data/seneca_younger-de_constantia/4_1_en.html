So, for all your lofty assumption, you reach the same level as the other schools—only the names of things are changed. And so I suspect that something of this sort lurks behind this maxim also, ‘A wise man will receive neither injury nor insult’—a maxim which, at first sight, appears noble and splendid. But it makes a great difference whether you place the wise man beyond feeling injured or beyond being injured. For if you say that he will bear injury calmly, he has no peculiar advantage; he is fortunate in possessing a common quality, one which is acquired from the very repetition of injuries—namely, endurance.
