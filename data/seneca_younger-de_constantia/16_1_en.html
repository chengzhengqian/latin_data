This feeling is stirred by a sense of humiliation as the spirit shrinks before an uncomplimentary word or act. “So-and-so did not give me an audience to-day, though he gave it to others”; “he haughtily repulsed or openly laughed at my conversation”; “he did not give me the seat of honour, but placed me at the foot of the table.” These and similar reproaches—what shall I call them but the complainings of a squeamish temper? And it is generally the pampered and prosperous who indulge in them; for if a man is pressed by worse ills, he has not time to notice such things. By reason of too much leisure natures which are naturally weak and effeminate and, from the dearth of real injury, have grown spoiled, are disturbed by these slights, the greater number of which are due to some fault in the one who so interprets them. Therefore any man who is troubled by an insult shows himself lacking in both insight and belief in himself; for he decides without hesitation that he has been slighted, and the accompanying sting is the inevitable result of a certain abjectness of spirit, a spirit which depreciates itself and bows down to another. But no one can slight the wise man, for he knows his own greatness and assures him-self that no one is accorded so much power over him, and all these feelings, which I prefer to call rather annoyances than distresses of the mind, he does not have to overcome—nay, he does not even have them.</p>
