The parrot is a Indian bird, in size ever so slightly smaller than a dove, though not of a dove’s color; it is not milky white or grayish blue or both together, it is not pale yellow or mottled: no, the parrot is green from where its feathers begin to the end of its wings, with a difference only on its neck. <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span>For its neck has a scarlet ring like a golden collar, that encircles and crowns it all around with unvarying brilliance.
