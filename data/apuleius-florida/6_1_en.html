<p class="noindent"><span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span>Nor do I admire the fact that those same Indians, though situated in the same region toward sunrise, even so have bodies with the color of night, nor that they have huge snakes that struggle with monstrous elephants, with equal risk to both and for their mutual destruction; <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span>for the snakes tangle the elephants in their slimy coils, so that they cannot free their feet or in any way break the scaly fetters of those tenacious serpents, but must get their revenge by bringing their own bulk down and crushing their captors with their whole bodies.</p>
<p><span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">6</span><span class="br"></span>Among the Indians there are various classes of inhabitant (I am happier to talk about human than natural wonders). They have a class that knows only how to herd cattle, and have consequently earned the name of “herdsmen.” <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">7</span><span class="br"></span>Some are shrewd dealers in merchandise or valiant fighters of battles, where they either shoot arrows from a distance or wield swords at close quarters. They also have a preeminent class of so-called “gymnosophists.” <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">8</span><span class="br"></span>These I admire most of all, because they are men with no skill to train a vine, graft a branch or plow the earth; <span class="italic">they</span> have no idea how to till a field, sieve gold, break a horse, tame a bull, or shear or pasture a sheep or a goat. <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">9</span><span class="br"></span>What then is the reason? They know one thing worth all the rest: they study philosophy, both the old men as teachers and the young as pupils. And there is nothing about them that I praise so
