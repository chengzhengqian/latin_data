 uncouthness and at the same time to punish his stupidity. <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">8</span><span class="br"></span>But the clearest evidence of Marsyas’ folly was his failing to see that he was considered ridiculous, and before blowing on his pipes he first blurted out some inarticulate ravings about himself and Apollo. He praised himself for having spiky hair, a dirty beard, a hairy chest, with only a piper’s skill and humble status, <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">9</span><span class="br"></span>while by contrast (ridiculous as it is to say) he blamed Apollo for the opposite qualities—for having long hair, graceful cheeks, smooth body, with many skills and a glorious position. <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">10</span><span class="br"></span>“First of all,” said he, “his hair with its combed tresses and smoothed locks dangles over his brow and hangs before his face, his whole body is grace itself, his limbs are sleek, his tongue prophetic; if you want prophecies either in prose or verse, he is just as expressive in both. <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">11</span><span class="br"></span>Not to mention that his clothing too is light in texture, soft to the touch and of dazzling purple, and that his lyre too glitters with gold, glistens with ivory, and sparkles with precious stones.
