session, so I hope, <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">42</span><span class="br"></span>in order that, without detracting from their reverence or from their respect for their consular citizen, it could be seen that they had not rivaled his action but seconded it—in other words, so that this honor from the people should be reserved for a full day. <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">43</span><span class="br"></span>Moreover, the excellent magistrates and kindly dignitaries recalled that what you had ordered them to do was their very own wish. Could I know that and not proclaim it? I would be ungrateful. <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">44</span><span class="br"></span>On the contrary, I express and I feel the warmest possible thanks to your whole legislature for its enormous kindnesses to me. You have honored me by most handsome acclamations in a council house where the mere mention of one’s name is a high honor.</p>
<p><span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">45</span><span class="br"></span>And so, hard as it was to do, difficult in reality and not merely in appearance—to please the populace, satisfy the legislature, gain the approval of the magistrates and the dignitaries—in this (if I may say so without boasting) I have now in a way succeeded. <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">46</span><span class="br"></span>What therefore is left to complete the honor of my statue, other than determining the price of the bronze and the service of the sculptor? Things that have never been refused me even in lesser cities can hardly be denied me in Carthage, where even in connection with weightier issues the most distinguished senate is more used to making decisions than calculations.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL534_303_52" id="target_note_LCL534_303_52"><sup>52</sup></a> <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">47</span><span class="br"></span>But on that subject my speech will be more polished when your plan is more advanced. Yes, to you, noble senators, distinguished citizens, honorable friends, soon, when my statue is dedicated I will also sing a hymn of thanks in a written work, and I will give that work a mission: <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">48</span><span class="br"></span>to travel through every province, and thereafter through the whole world, and for all future time, to renew my praise of your kindness in every land and down all the years.</p>
