 I will make the most auspicious of beginnings with the god Asclepius, whose indisputable power makes him the benevolent guardian of our Carthage’s citadel.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL534_321_66" id="target_note_LCL534_321_66"><sup>66</sup></a> <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">38</span><span class="br"></span>See, I will now sing you a hymn to that god in Greek and Latin, dedicated to him by me. For I am not a devotee unknown to him, no recent votary or unwelcome priest, and I have worshipped him before now with eloquence in prose and verse. <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">39</span><span class="br"></span>Similarly, I will sing him a hymn in both languages on this occasion too, and I have prefaced it with a dialogue that is similarly both in Greek and in Latin. The speakers will be Sabidius Severus and Julius Perseus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL534_321_67" id="target_note_LCL534_321_67"><sup>67</sup></a> <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">40</span><span class="br"></span>men who are the closest of friends to each other and to you too, as well they should be for their public services. They are matched in learning, eloquence and benevolence, and it is an open question whether they are more unobtrusively modest, energetically zealous, or conspicuously distinguished. <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">41</span><span class="br"></span>Though on the best of terms, still they have just one source of rivalry and compete only on one point—which of them loves Carthage the more; both contend with every ounce of their strength and neither loses. <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">42</span><span class="br"></span>Thinking that a conversation between them would be most pleasing for you to hear, suitable for me to compose, and acceptable as an offering to the god, I begin the work with one of my fellow students at Athens asking Perseus in Greek what was the subject of my lecture the day before in the temple of Asclepius. <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">43</span><span class="br"></span>Gradually I bring Severus into the discussion, giving him the part of the Latin speaker for the occasion. For Perseus himself could very well speak Latin too, but for you today he will talk the purest Greek.</p>
