<p>“Let us go on then,” I replied, “to the orators who <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">158</span><span class="br"></span> remain and continue the enumeration we began. Crassus then came always prepared and ready, he was waited for eagerly and listened to with attention. From the very exordium, which with him was always carefully prepared, he rewarded expectation abundantly; no violent movements of the body, no sudden variation of voice, no walking up and down, no frequent stamping of the foot; his language vehement, sometimes angry and filled with righteous indignation; much wit but always dignified, and, what is most difficult, he was at once ornate and brief; finally, in the <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">159</span><span class="br"></span> give and take of altercation he was unequalled. He appeared in cases of almost every type; he came early to an acknowledged rank among the first orators. When still a mere lad he conducted the indictment against Gaius Carbo, one of the best speakers of his time. Through this he won not only the highest reputation for talent, but also great applause. Later <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">160</span><span class="br"></span> at the age of twenty-seven he defended the vestal virgin Licinia. In this case he was particularly eloquent, and he has left some parts of his speech in writing. While still young he chose to ingratiate himself with the popular party in the matter of the colony of Narbo, and strove to make himself the leader of that colony, as in fact he succeeded in doing. In favour of the law establishing it his speech is extant, somewhat older in tone than his youthful years would suggest. Then followed a multitude of cases. However, his tribuneship passed with so little mention, that, had he not during his term of office dined with Granius the crier, and had not Lucilius twice told the story of that dinner, we should never know that he had been tribune of the people at all.”</p>
