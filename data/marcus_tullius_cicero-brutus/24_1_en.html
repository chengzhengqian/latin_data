centuries earlier Philistus of Syracuse and even Thucydides lacked them. For just as their concise, pungent, and often obscure brevity was eclipsed by Theopompus with his high-flown, elevated style (as befell Lysias also compared with Demosthenes), so this language of succeeding writers, built up like some tall structure, has cut off the light from Cato.
