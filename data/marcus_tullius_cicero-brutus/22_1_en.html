<p>though our friend Varro, with his thoroughness of investigation into early history, thinks this date erroneous and makes the life of Naevius somewhat longer. His reason is that Plautus, his contemporary, did not die until the consulship of Publius Claudius and Lucius Porcius, twenty years after the consuls named above, when Cato was censor.</p>
<p>“But to resume, Cethegus was followed next in <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">61</span><span class="br"></span> point of time by Cato, who was consul nine years after him. Cato we look upon as very early; he died in the consulship of Lucius Marcius and Manius Manilius, exactly eighty-six years before my consulship, and yet, recent as that is, I cannot name anyone earlier whose writings can be adduced, unless perchance one find pleasure in the speech of Appius Caecus concerning Pyrrhus, to which I have just referred, or in some funeral orations. Of these some <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">62</span><span class="br"></span> are, to be sure, extant, which the families of the deceased have preserved as trophies of honour and for use on the death of a member of the same family, whether to recall the memory of past glories of their house, or to support their own claims to noble origins. Yet by these laudatory speeches our history has become quite distorted; for much is set down in them which never occurred, false triumphs, too large a number of consulships, false relationships and transitions of patricians to plebeian status,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL342_60_a" id="target_note_LCL342_60_a"><sup>a</sup></a> in that men of humbler birth professed that their blood blended with a noble family of the same name, though in fact quite alien to them; as if I, for example, should say that I was descended from Manius Tullius the patrician, who was consul with Servius Sulpicius ten years after the expulsion of the kings.</p>
