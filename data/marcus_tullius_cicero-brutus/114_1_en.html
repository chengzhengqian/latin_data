Had he chosen to entertain considerations such as these, rising through the grades of public office as his father and other distinguished men had done before him, he would have attained to the highest dignity with unanimous favour and applause. Considerations such as these I can testify that I urged also more than once upon Publius Crassus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL342_245_a" id="target_note_LCL342_245_a"><sup>a</sup></a> son of Marcus, who at an early age sought the circle of my friendship, and I exhorted him with all my power to follow that straight path to renown which his ancestors had trodden and made smooth for him.
