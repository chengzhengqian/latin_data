And yet this Livius <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">72</span><span class="br"></span> produced his first play in the consulship of Gaius Claudius, son of Caecus, and Marcus Tuditanus, as late as the very year before the birth of Ennius, five hundred and fourteen years after the founding of Rome, according to the authority whom I follow; for there is a dispute among writers about the chronology. Accius however stated that Livius was taken captive from Tarentum by Quintus Maximus in his fifth consulship, thirty years after Livius had produced his first play, according to Atticus, whose statement I find confirmed by early records.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL342_68_ba" id="target_note_LCL342_68_ba"><sup>b</sup></a> Accius goes <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">73</span><span class="br"></span> on to say that Livius produced his first play eleven years after the date (of his capture) in the consulship of Gaius Cornelius and Quintus Minucius at the Ludi Iuventatis, which Livius Salinator had vowed at the battle of Sena. In this the error of Accius is so great that in the consulship of these men Ennius was already forty years of age. But suppose that Livius was his contemporary: it will appear then that the first one to produce a play at Rome was somewhat younger than the two who had already produced many plays before this date, Plautus and Naevius.
