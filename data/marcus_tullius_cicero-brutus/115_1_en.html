<p>Here Brutus interposed: “Our good friend <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">284</span><span class="br"></span> Calvus liked to think of himself as Attic. That was the reason for that meagreness of style which he cultivated deliberately.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I know,” I replied; “so he said; but he was in error and caused others to err with him.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL342_247_b" id="target_note_LCL342_247_b"><sup>b</sup></a> If one holds that those who do not rant, nor speak pedantically nor with affectation, are Attic, he will be quite right in admiring no one who is not Attic. Tasteless bombast and preciosity he will abominate as a form of madness; sanity and wholesomeness of style he will look upon as a decent and almost religious obligation in an orator. This should be the common judgement of all orators. But if meagreness and dryness and <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">285</span><span class="br"></span> general poverty are put down as Attic, with of course the proviso that it must have finish and urbanity and precision, that is good so far as it goes.

Atticism, as the name indicates, must already have existed as a movement or tendency in Greek schools, but its precise origins are lost in the meagre record of the Hellenistic period. It was a refinement of the older doctrine of correct Greek—Ἑλληνισμός, which in this movement came to be Ἀττικισμός.
