or grandfather! In eloquence at least, he would I think have found no equal. In diction he is elevated, in ideas wise and thoughtful, in his whole style earnest and impressive; his writings have not received the last touch; much shows brilliant beginnings, but lacks final perfection. Yes, Brutus, he if anyone is an orator for our youth to read.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL342_113_a" id="target_note_LCL342_113_a"><sup>a</sup></a> He can give not only edge to their wits, but sustenance as well.</p>
<p>“Upon this period followed Gaius Galba, son of <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">127</span><span class="br"></span> the eloquent Servius, and son-in-law of Publius Crassus, who himself was eloquent and an able jurist. Galba’s oratory received the praise of our fathers; they liked him too for the memory of his father; but he fell in the race.

His colleague (in the consulship), Lucius Bestia, made a good beginning with his tribuneship—for by the measure which bears his name he recalled Publius Popilius, banished by the violence of Gaius Gracchus—a man of keen mind and not without skill as a speaker, but his consulship came to a melancholy end.
