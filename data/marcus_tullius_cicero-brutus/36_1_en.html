equal age and both of surpassing talent, Gaius Carbo and Tiberius Gracchus, of whom I shall find a place to speak presently, after I have said a little about their seniors. Of these Quintus Pompeius was for his time no mean orator, a man who gained recognition on his own merits, and with no recommendation of ancestry attained to the highest honours. Of the <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">97</span><span class="br"></span> same time was Lucius Cassius, whose words, though he was not eloquent, exercised great influence. He was a favourite of the people, not because of a free and genial disposition, but for his very harshness and severity. His ballot law was long opposed by the tribune Marcus Antius Briso with the help of Marcus Lepidus, then consul, and it became a matter of reproach to Publius Africanus that Briso was believed to have withdrawn his opposition to it through the influence of Africanus. Then also the two Caepiones served ably the needs of their clients with their advice and with their pleas in court, and still more by their influence and standing. Of Sextus Pompeius there are writings extant, not too bald, though they suggest an earlier time, and full of sound sense. Publius <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">98</span><span class="br"></span> Crassus at about the same time was, we are told, an orator highly esteemed, who to native ability added zealous study, and some disciplines he possessed too as by right of birth and family. For on the one hand he had established family ties with the famous orator Servius Galba, to whose son Gaius he had given his daughter in marriage, and on the other, as being the son of Publius Mucius and brother of Publius Scaevola, he had learned the civil law in his own home. He was clearly a man of remarkable industry and of great popularity, much in demand for his legal advice and active as a pleader.
