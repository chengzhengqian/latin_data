In fact, sometimes I could scarcely refrain from laughter, as when you compared with the Athenian Lysias our good old Cato—a great man, good heavens yes! indeed one of the greatest and unique! no one could say otherwise. But an orator? and like Lysias, with all his incomparable finish?

You express approbation of the speeches of Lepidus. To that I can give some assent if you praise them only as specimens of archaic eloquence. When in like manner you speak of Africanus and of Laelius, than whose language you say nothing
