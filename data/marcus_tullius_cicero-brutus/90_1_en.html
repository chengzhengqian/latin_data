occurred in the consulship of Lucius Paullus and Gaius Marcellus. We see thus that his career as an advocate lasted for a period of forty-four years. Of his character as an orator I shall say more presently. Here it was my purpose only to insert his name and time between the ranks of orators of different generations with whom he came in contact. It is inevitable in the case of men who live a long life of activity that they come into comparison with men much older than themselves as well as with some much younger. Thus, for example, Accius tells us that Pacuvius and himself each produced a play under direction of the same aediles when the former was eighty and he himself thirty. In like manner Hortensius was associated not only with his contemporaries, but also with my time and yours, Brutus, as <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">230</span><span class="br"></span> well as with a time somewhat earlier than his own. For he had already begun to speak during the lifetime of Crassus, and with still greater success while Antonius was yet alive.
