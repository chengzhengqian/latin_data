<p>evidence of goodwill. For certainly the man—whoever he may be, and if in fact there be such an one—who was first to reveal and demonstrate to Rome the resources of eloquence<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL342_221_aa" id="target_note_LCL342_221_aa"><sup>a</sup></a> has contributed more to the prestige of our people than those who have stormed successfully some Ligurian fortresses, which as you know have yielded many a triumph. And in truth, if you will but give it hearing, <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">256</span><span class="br"></span> apart from examples of superhuman genius, in which the intelligence of military leaders has often been the salvation of the commonwealth in the field as well as at home, the great orator is far more significant than the mediocre military leader. But the military leader is of more practical value. I do not deny it. Still—and I’m not afraid of your protests, since here we are at liberty to say what we think—I should for myself choose rather the single speech of Lucius Crassus in defence of Manius Curius than two of those petty outpost triumphs. But, you urge, the capture of a Ligurian outpost was more important for the state than a successful defence of Manius Curius. Quite true; but it was likewise more important for the <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">257</span><span class="br"></span> people of Athens to have tight roofs over their heads than to possess the famous ivory statue of Minerva; yet I should have preferred to be a Phidias than to be a master-roofer. Thus in weighing a man’s significance it is not how useful he is that should enter in, but what is his real worth. There are few competent painters or sculptors, but there is no danger of a shortage of porters and labourers. But go on, Pomponius, <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">258</span><span class="br"></span> with regard to Caesar and discharge the rest of your debt.”</p>

Thus he presents the compliment of Caesar first in the words of Caesar himself in 253, repeats it in the mouth of Brutus in 254, and takes it up again here in his own comment. Similarly in discussing the dogma of agreement between the critic and the people concerning the quality of oratory the principle is stated no less than five times (183-198). <span class="italic">Cf.</span> also <span class="italic">Suadai medulla</span> in 59.
