For of the five elements of which, as we say, it is made up, each one is in its own right a great art.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL342_36_b" id="target_note_LCL342_36_b"><sup>b</sup></a> One may guess therefore what power is inherent in an art made up of five great arts, and what difficulty it presents.</p>
