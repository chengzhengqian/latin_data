This he could never have attained through knowledge of the law alone had he not acquired in addition that art which teaches the analysis of a whole into its component parts, sets forth and defines the latent and implicit, interprets and makes clear the obscure; which first recognizes the ambiguous and then distinguishes; which applies in short a rule or measure for adjudging truth and falsehood, for determining what conclusions follow from what premises, and what do not.

<p>“The art of logic I suppose you mean,” said he.</p>
<p>“Quite right,” I replied; “but to this he joined a knowledge of letters and a finished style of speaking, as can be seen from his writings, which are quite unique.
