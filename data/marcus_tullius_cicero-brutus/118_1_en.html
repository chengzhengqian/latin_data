set themselves. They don’t even see, not only that history records it, but it must have been so, that when Demosthenes was to speak all Greece flocked to hear him. But when these Atticists of ours speak they are deserted not only by the curious crowd, which is humiliating enough, but even by the friends and supporters of their client. So then if to speak in a pinched and meagre way is Attic, why let them enjoy their title of Atticists. But let them come to the place of assembly, let them speak before a praetor standing to give his opinion without a jury.

But if they <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">291</span><span class="br"></span> prefer rather a style of speaking that is acute and judicious, while at the same time pure, sound, and matter-of-fact, which does not make use of any bolder oratorical embellishment, and if moreover they will have it that this style is peculiarly and properly Attic, they are quite right in their approbation. For in an art so comprehensive and so varied there is a
