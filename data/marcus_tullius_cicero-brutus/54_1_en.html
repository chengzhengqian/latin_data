<p>Greeks call postures or figures are the greatest ornaments of oratory.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL342_125_a" id="target_note_LCL342_125_a"><sup>a</sup></a> They are not so important in heightening the colour of words, as in throwing ideas into a stronger light. In all these respects Antonius was great, and combined with them a delivery of peculiar excellence. If we divide delivery into gesture and voice, his gesture did not seek to reflect words, but agreed with the course of his thought—hands, shoulders, chest, stamp of the foot, posture in repose and in movement, all harmonizing with his words and thoughts; voice sustained, but with a touch of huskiness.
