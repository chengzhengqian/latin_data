Publius <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">237</span><span class="br"></span> Murena had but moderate ability; he was a great student of history, devoted to letters and not unlearned in them, a man of varied and laborious activity. Gaius Censorinus had good Greek training; he was adept at lucid presentation, his delivery was not without grace, but he was lazy and hated the forum. Lucius Turius, a man of small talent, but hard working, with such skill as he could command was a frequent speaker; as the result of his efforts he all but gained the consulship, failing by only a few votes. Gaius Macer all his life was deficient in <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">238</span><span class="br"></span> character and standing, but as a pleader he lacked little of being the most active. If his life, his character, even his very face, had not robbed his talent of everything to commend it, his name as a pleader would have been far greater. His language was not copious nor yet meagre, not brilliant nor again crude; his voice, his gesture, his whole delivery were without charm; but upon invention and arrangement of matter he bestowed an extraordinary care, such as I have scarcely seen surpassed in anyone; you would call it however adroit routine rather than oratory. Though he won recognition in criminal cases, yet he held a more conspicuous place in civil suits.</p>
