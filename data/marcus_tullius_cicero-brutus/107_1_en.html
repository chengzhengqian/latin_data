reasons, but thinking of those two men, how I grieve that your persistent advocacy of peace was without avail! For had it been otherwise their great gifts and those of other leading men need not have been lost to the state.”</p>
<p>“Let us not speak of that, Brutus,” I replied. “It only adds to our sorrow; for while to recall the past is pain enough, dread of the future is a pain still sharper. So let us put aside our laments, and let me go on to set forth the capabilities of orators one by one, which is the object of our inquiry.</p>
<p>“Among those who fell in the same war was Marcus <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">267</span><span class="br"></span> Bibulus, whose activity in writing, and writing carefully, is surprising, since he was no orator; he spoke also in support of many measures with stubborn consistency.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL342_230_a" id="target_note_LCL342_230_a"><sup>a</sup></a> Another was Appius Claudius, your father-in-law, and my augural colleague and friend. Unlike Bibulus he was a student of oratory, learned in its theory and experienced in its practice. He was besides thoroughly versed in augural and public law, and well acquainted with our earlier history. Lucius Domitius on the other hand was quite without training, but his command of Latin was good and he spoke with great freedom and boldness. Then there <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">268</span><span class="br"></span> were the two Lentuli, both ex-consuls; of whom Publius, the avenger of my wrongs and author of my recall from banishment, had gained from study whatever skill he possessed; natural equipment he lacked altogether; yet his mind was so brilliant, his spirit so noble, that he aspired to all the honours which belong by right to distinction, and held them with becoming dignity. Lucius Lentulus was an orator of considerable vigour, if you could call him an orator at all; but the labour of thinking out a case bored him.
