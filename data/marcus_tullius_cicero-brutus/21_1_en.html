<p>He calls him orator<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL342_58_a" id="target_note_LCL342_58_a"><sup>a</sup></a> and adds the attribute of sweetness of speech, a thing you do not find nowadays in most of them—more barking in some than speaking; but what follows is certainly the greatest title to praise in eloquence:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">He used to be called by his fellows of that time,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">The men who then lived and passed their restless days,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">The choice flower of the people—</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">and well said indeed; for as reason is the glory of <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">59</span><span class="br"></span> man, so the lamp of reason is eloquence, for preeminence in which the men of that time did well to call such a man the flower of the people,</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">the marrow of Persuasion.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">Πειθώ the Greek term, which it is the business of the orator to effect,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL342_58_ba" id="target_note_LCL342_58_ba"><sup>b</sup></a> Ennius calls Persuasion, the very marrow of which Cethegus was, he claims; so that of that goddess, which according to Eupolis ever sat on the lips of Pericles, our orator was, he said, the very marrow.</p>
<p>“Now this Cethegus was consul with Publius Tuditanus <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">60</span><span class="br"></span> in the second Punic War, while Marcus Cato was quaestor with the same consuls, only one hundred and forty years, to be exact, before my consulship<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL342_59_c" id="target_note_LCL342_59_c"><sup>c</sup></a>; and unless the knowledge of his eloquence were known to us by the sole testimony of Ennius, time would have consigned him to oblivion as it has doubtless many others. The language of that period can be learned from the writings of Naevius, for in the consulship of those two, as early records show, Naevius died;</p>
