many on capital charges; for defendants they seldom spoke. Spurius Thorius had considerable ability as a speaker before the people, and it was he who freed the state lands from the tax burdens of the (Sempronian) law, a measure at once unconstitutional and ineffective.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL342_121_a" id="target_note_LCL342_121_a"><sup>a</sup></a> Marcus Marcellus, the father of (Marcellus) Aeserninus, was not esteemed a pleader, but was a ready and not unpractised speaker, as was also his son Publius Lentulus. Lucius Cotta too, the praetorian,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL342_121_ba" id="target_note_LCL342_121_ba"><sup>b</sup></a> <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">137</span><span class="br"></span> held a place in the ranks of orators of moderate ability. He did not advance far on the road to oratorical renown, but he is remembered because of his deliberate affectation of archaic speech in choice of words and in a rustic habit of enunciation.</p>
<p>“I am aware that in the case of this Cotta, and some others as well, I have put into the ranks of orators men who were not very good speakers, and I shall continue to do so. For it is my purpose to put together those who have made it their business in civic life to be regarded as orators. What their progress was and how difficult in every art is final attainment of the best, may be judged from what I have to say. How many orators have already <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">138</span><span class="br"></span> been named and how long I have been occupied in enumeration of them! And yet in spite of this slow and laborious progress we have only come, as before to Demosthenes and Hyperides, so now to Antonius and Crassus. I suggest the comparison because in my judgement these two men were orators of the first rank, and in them for the first time Latin eloquence attained a level comparable to the glory of Greece.</p>
