<p>no man ever pleaded his case better, when in his hearing Antiphon defended himself on a capital charge; that as to Lysias, it was only in the be <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">48</span><span class="br"></span> ginning of his career that he professed the art of rhetoric, but afterwards, seeing that Theodorus was a more skilful theorist and teacher, though dry as a speaker, he began to compose speeches for others and abandoned the profession of teacher. He tells also how Isocrates with similar alternation at first denied that there was an art of speaking, while at the same time he was writing speeches for others to use in court; but when it happened repeatedly that he was summoned as having violated a law like ours<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL342_50_a" id="target_note_LCL342_50_a"><sup>a</sup></a> ‘providing against circumvention or chicanery by judicial process,’ he ceased to write speeches for others and devoted himself wholly to the composition of theory and models of oratory.</p>
<p>“Thus, as regards Greece, you see the birth and <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">49</span><span class="br"></span> origins of oratory, early from the standpoint of our chronology, but from theirs quite recent. For long before Athens found pleasure in the art of speaking and in the glory of its exercise, it had accomplished many memorable things both in peace and in war. The pursuit of oratory however was not shared in by Greece as a whole, but was peculiar to Athens. Who <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">50</span><span class="br"></span> ever heard of an orator of Argos or Corinth or Thebes of that period, unless perhaps you entertain a suspicion in regard to Epaminondas, who was a man of some training? As for a Spartan orator, I have never down to the present day heard of one. Menelaus, even, Homer refers to as an agreeable speaker, but a man of few words, and while brevity in oratory is a thing to praise in some places, yet in eloquence as a whole it is not a merit.</p>
