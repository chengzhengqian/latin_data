the ranks of orators, however, Pomponius, Censorinus, and Murena had been taken. It was not until this time that I first began to undertake cases both civil and criminal, for it was my ambition, not (as most do) to learn my trade in the forum, but so far as possible to enter the forum already trained. At this time too <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">312</span><span class="br"></span> I devoted myself to study with Molo; for it chanced that be came to Rome in the dictatorship of Sulla as member of a commission to the senate with regard to the reimbursement of Rhodes.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL342_271_a" id="target_note_LCL342_271_a"><sup>a</sup></a> Thus my first criminal case, spoken in behalf of Sextus Roscius, won such favourable comment that I was esteemed not incompetent to handle any litigation whatsoever. There followed then in quick succession many other cases which I brought into court, carefully worked out, and, as the saying is, smelling somewhat of the midnight oil.</p>
