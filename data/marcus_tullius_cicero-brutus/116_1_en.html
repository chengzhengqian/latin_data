not all of one type. Who, for example, are more unlike than Demosthenes and Lysias? Than either of them and Hyperides, than all of these and Aeschines? Whom then are you going to imitate? If one only, do you mean that all the others did not speak pure Attic? If all, how can you imitate them when they are so unlike each other? And here I venture to put this question: did Demetrius of Phaleron speak pure Attic? To me at least his orations exhale the very fragrance of Athens. But, you say, he is more florid (if I may use the term) than Hyperides or Lysias. That was, I presume, his natural bent or perhaps his deliberate choice.</p>
