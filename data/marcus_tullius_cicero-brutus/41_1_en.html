Furius Philus of the same period was considered a speaker very choice in his Latinity and of more scholarly training than others. Publius Scaevola spoke with great legal and political wisdom and was acute in argument. More abundant in expression and not much inferior in knowledge and experience was Manius Manilius. The oratory of Appius Claudius was fluent but rather too fervid. A certain place too was granted to Marcus Fulvius Flaccus, and to Gaius Cato, son of the sister of Africanus, both orators of very moderate gifts. There are, to be sure, extant writings of Flaccus, but they show the student of letters rather than the orator. His political rival was Publius Decius, not without some gift of eloquence, but as in his life so in his language he was undisciplined and turbulent. Marcus Drusus, son of Gaius, who as tribune frustrated <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">109</span><span class="br"></span> the designs of his colleague Gaius Gracchus in his second tribuneship, was a man of weight and influence both in speech and in personality. Closely associated with him in rank was his brother Gaius Drusus. Your kinsman too, Brutus, Marcus (Junius) Pennus made a successful record in his tribuneship<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL342_98_aa" id="target_note_LCL342_98_aa"><sup>a</sup></a>; he was a little older than Gaius Gracchus, who was quaestor in the consulship of Marcus Lepidus and Lucius Orestes, when Pennus, son of the Marcus Pennus who was consul with Quintus Aelius, was tribune; but with prospect of attaining all the highest honours he died after his aedileship. As for Titus Flamininus, whom I myself have seen, I know nothing more than that he was accounted a painstaking user of the mother tongue.</p>
