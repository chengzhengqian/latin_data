scarcely less numerous than those of Lysias the Athenian, and to him far too many I am sure are assigned;—I call him Athenian since he was certainly born at Athens, died there, and performed all the offices of citizenship, though Timaeus, as if in accordance with an Athenian law like our Licinian and Mucian,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL342_63_a" id="target_note_LCL342_63_a"><sup>a</sup></a> remands him to Syracuse. Between the two men there is in some sense a likeness: both are acute, precise, clever, brief. But in respect of fame the Greek has been altogether more fortunate. He <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">64</span><span class="br"></span> has his devotees who cultivate a lean rather than a full habit of body, and within the limits of health even admire spareness. And yet, while in Lysias there is often a muscular vigour of the most effective kind, still it is quite true that in his style as a whole he belongs to the more meagre type, and, as I have said, has his admirers who have their special delight in this very slightness.
