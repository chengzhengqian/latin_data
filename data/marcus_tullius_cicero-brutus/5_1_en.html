<p>“Ah yes,” he replied, “you mean that work in <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">14</span><span class="br"></span> which he sets forth all history so briefly, and, if I may venture to judge, so faithfully.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL342_27_c" id="target_note_LCL342_27_c"><sup>c</sup></a></p>
