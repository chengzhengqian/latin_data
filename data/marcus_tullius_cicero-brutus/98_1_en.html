did not lack facility, but his diction possessed no great distinction; as pleader he showed judgement, shrewdness, and caution, diligence in mastering and arranging his case, great industry and devotion, and was engaged in many cases. The two Metelli, Celer <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">247</span><span class="br"></span> and Nepos, though not engaged in private suits, lacked neither talent nor training; they both cultivated the style of speaking which belongs to the popular assembly. Gnaeus Lentulus Marcellinus too was always thought of as a competent speaker, and in his consulship gave the impression of great eloquence; not slow in thought, nor unresourceful in language, he was possessed of a sonorous voice and considerable wit. Gaius Memmius,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL342_212_a" id="target_note_LCL342_212_a"><sup>a</sup></a> son of Lucius, highly trained in letters, but only Greek, for he scorned Latin, was an orator of the subtle ingenious type with a pleasing diction, but averse to the labour not only of speaking, but even of thinking. His skill waned in proportion to his relaxation of effort.”</p>
<p>At this point Brutus remarked: “How I wish that <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">248</span><span class="br"></span> you felt inclined to speak about the orators of to-day, and if not about others, at least about two whom I know you admire, Caesar and Marcellus. I should like to hear about them quite as much as I have enjoyed hearing about men no longer living.”</p>
<p>“But why, pray?” I replied. “Why should you expect me to pass judgement about men who are as well known to you as to me?”</p>
<p>“True enough,” he replied, “so far as Marcellus is concerned, but not so of Caesar. Marcellus I have <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">249</span><span class="br"></span> heard often; but from the time when I was old enough to form a judgement Caesar has been away from Rome.”</p>
<p>“Well, what is your opinion about the one you have heard?”</p>
