loyal men, to mourn the loss of many things; but one pang he would feel beyond the rest, or with few to share it: the spectacle of the Roman forum, the scene and stage of his talents, robbed and bereft of that finished eloquence worthy of the ears of Rome or even of Greece.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL342_23_a" id="target_note_LCL342_23_a"><sup>a</sup></a></p>
<p>For me too<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL342_23_b" id="target_note_LCL342_23_b"><sup>b</sup></a> it is a source of deep pain that the state <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">7</span><span class="br"></span> feels no need of those weapons of counsel, of insight, and of authority, which I had learned to handle and to rely upon,—weapons which are the peculiar and proper resource of a leader in the commonwealth and of a civilized and law-abiding state. Indeed if there ever was a time in the history of the state when the authority and eloquence of a good citizen might have wrested arms from the hands of angry partisans, it was exactly then when through blindness or fear the door was abruptly closed upon the cause of peace. Thus, amidst other things far more deplorable, <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">8</span><span class="br"></span> it was to me a peculiar sorrow, that after a career of conspicuous achievements, at an age when it was my right to take refuge in a harbour, not of indolence and sloth, but of honourable and well-ordered ease, when my oratory too had attained a certain ripeness and maturity of age,—it was, I say, a peculiar sorrow that at that moment resort was had to arms, which those who had learned to use them gloriously did not find a way to use them beneficently. Those men therefore appear to me to have <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">9</span><span class="br"></span> lived fortunate and happy lives, in other states and especially in our own, whom fate permitted to enjoy to the end the authority acquired by the renown of their deeds, and the esteem earned by their wisdom.</p>
