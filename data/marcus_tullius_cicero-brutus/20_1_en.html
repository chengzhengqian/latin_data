of riot and conflict of the people with the patricians; clad in his priestly robe, just as he was, he hurried to the assembly, and by the authority of his presence as well as by his words allayed the tumult. But that these men were accounted orators, or that at that time eloquence held out any prize to be coveted, I cannot recall ever having read; I am only led by conjecture to suspect it was so.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL342_56_aa" id="target_note_LCL342_56_aa"><sup>a</sup></a> It is reported too <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">57</span><span class="br"></span> that Gaius Flaminius, the tribune of the plebs who carried through the law authorizing the distribution of the land of Hither Gaul and of Picenum to individual settlers, and who as consul lost his life at Trasumenus, was a valiant speaker before the people. Also Quintus Maximus Verrucosus was by the standards of that time accounted an orator, and Quintus Metellus as well, I mean the one who was consul during the second Punic War with Lucius Veturius Philo.</p>
<p>â€œBut the first Roman concerning whom there is extant record of his eloquence, and evidence of his recognition for it, is Marcus Cornelius Cethegus. The authority for this statement, and an adequate one I fancy, is Quintus Ennius, especially since he had heard him speak and writes of him after his death, so that no suspicion of distortion because of friendship can arise. The passage of Ennius, if I recall aright, <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">58</span><span class="br"></span> is found in the ninth book of the <span class="italic">Annals</span> and runs as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">To his colleague Tuditanus was added the orator</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Marcus Cornelius Cethegus, of the sweet-speaking tongue,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Son of Marcus.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
