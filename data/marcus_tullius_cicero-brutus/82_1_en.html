from childhood, how one’s father, one’s attendant, one’s mother too speaks.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL342_180_a" id="target_note_LCL342_180_a"><sup>a</sup></a> We have read the letters of <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">211</span><span class="br"></span> Cornelia, mother of the Gracchi; they make it plain that her sons were nursed not less by their mother’s speech than at her breast. It was my good fortune more than once to hear Laelia, the daughter of Gaius, speak, and it was apparent that her careful usage was coloured by her father’s habit, and the same was true of her two daughters Muciae, with both of whom I have talked, and of her granddaughters the Liciniae, both of whom I have heard; one, the wife of Scipio, I imagine that you too, Brutus, have sometimes heard speak.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Brutus, “and with great pleasure; the more so because she was the daughter of Lucius Crassus.”</p>

<p>“He is reputed to have been a man of extraordinary ability,” he replied, “and the other son, Scipio,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL342_180_b" id="target_note_LCL342_180_b"><sup>b</sup></a> my colleague, seems to me an excellent speaker both in private conversation and in public discourse.”</p>
<p>“Your estimate is quite right Brutus,” I said, “and the reason is that his blood flows from the very fountain head of Wisdom herself—from his two grandfathers Scipio and Crassus, of whom I have already spoken, and from three great-grandfathers: Quintus Metellus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL342_181_c" id="target_note_LCL342_181_c"><sup>c</sup></a> the father of the four famous sons, Publius Scipio, who in private station freed the commonwealth from the domination of Tiberius</p>
