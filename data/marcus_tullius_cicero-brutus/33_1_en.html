<p>â€œFrom this story of Rutilius one may conclude, <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">89</span><span class="br"></span> that of the two chief qualities which the orator must possess, accurate argument looking to proof and impressive appeal to the emotions of the listener, the orator who inflames the court accomplishes far more than the one who merely instructs it; that in short Laelius possessed precision, Galba power. This same power was most strikingly recognized again when Servius Galba was accused of massacring surrendered Lusitanians in violation (as was believed) of his pledged faith. To protest against this perfidy Lucius Libo, tribune of the commons, incited the people, and introduced a measure directed in effect at Galba in person, which Marcus Cato in extreme old age (as I have said before) pressed, with vigorous attack upon Galba. (His speech, on this occasion, he incorporated into his <span class="italic">Origines</span> only a few days ormonths before his death.) Thereupon Galba, asking <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">90</span><span class="br"></span> no favour for himself, but appealing to the loyalty of the Roman people, with tears in his eyes commended to their protection his own children as well as the young son of Gaius Gallus. The presence of this orphan and his childish weeping excited great compassion because of the memory still fresh of his illustrious father. Thus Galba by stirring the pity of the populace for little children snatched himself from the flames, as Cato wrote and has left recorded.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL342_82_ba" id="target_note_LCL342_82_ba"><sup>b</sup></a>
