<p>“What else can it be,” he replied, “than that in him you are destined to see a counterpart of yourself?”</p>
<p>“In that case certainly I should wish him to please you as much as possible.”</p>
<p>“But I really mean what I say,” said Brutus, “and indeed his oratory does please me very much, and with good reason; for he has studied hard, he has devoted himself to this one goal to the exclusion of all else, and by unremitting practice he has kept himself at the top of form. The result shows in his use of <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">250</span><span class="br"></span> carefully chosen words and in wealth and variety of ideas. What he says too receives an external charm and brilliancy from a fine voice and dignified action. All this he commands so skilfully as to make me feel that he lacks no quality that an orator should have. I admire him too most of all because in this time, which has touched us all as with the hand of a malign fate, he finds such consolation as may be in the consciousness of his unswerving loyalty, and in resumption and enjoyment of scholarly pursuits.

Claudius Marcellus, consul (with Servius Sulpicius) in 51 <span class="sc">b.c.</span>, a leader of the senatorial opposition to Caesar, but distrustful of Pompey. He did not take active part in the Civil War, but withdrew to the autonomous city of Mytilene (in the province of Asia), where he was unmolested by Caesar. In spite of the urging of Cicero and other friends he was reluctant to seek pardon, but finally in May of the year 45 <span class="sc">b.c</span>. he began his return journey, but during a pause of a few days at Athens he was killed by one of his own retinue. This account of the life of Marcellus in exile and of his character is influenced by the letter of Brutus to Cicero, to which reference is made at the beginning and at the end of our treatise (11 and 330). On the identity of this letter with the treatise of Brutus <span class="italic">de Virtute</span>, see Int. pp. 6 and 7.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL342_215_aa').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
