Both were orators of the first rank, a judgement <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">104</span><span class="br"></span> which I base on the evidence of our fathers who heard them; for the orations which we possess of both Carbo and Gracchus do not yet attain to any brilliancy of language, but they are acute and thoughtful. Gracchus, thanks to the affectionate pains of his mother Cornelia, had been trained from boyhood and was thoroughly grounded in Greek letters. He had always enjoyed the instruction of Greek teachers carefully chosen, among whom from his early manhood was Diophanes of Mytilene, accounted the ablest speaker of Greece in that day.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL342_95_b" id="target_note_LCL342_95_b"><sup>b</sup></a> But his time for developing his talent and for showing it was short.</p>

In saying that Tiberius was put to death “by the state itself” Cicero, with gross partisanship, adopts the view that the violence and lawless activity of the senatorial party, led by Scipio Nasica, represented the true ultimate state (<span class="italic">ipsa republica</span>), as contrasted with the established and legal government of the moment, which had refused to take any extraordinary measures against Tiberius (Plut. <span class="italic">Tib.</span> 19).</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL342_95_a').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL342_95_b"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL342_95_b" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">b</sup>For the development of Roman oratory it is significant that the teachers of the Gracchi, Diophanes here mentioned, and the teacher of C.
