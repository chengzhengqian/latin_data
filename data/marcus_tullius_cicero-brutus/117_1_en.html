writing history, but not if you contemplate pleading cases. Thucydides was a herald of deeds, faithful and even grand, but our forensic speech with its wrangling, its atmosphere of the court-room, he never used. As for the speeches which he introduced (and they are numerous) I have always praised them; but imitate them?—I could not if I wished, nor should I wish to, I imagine, if I could. To illustrate: it is as if a man were fond of Falernian wine, but did not want it so new as last year’s, nor again so old as to search out a cask from the vintages of Opimius or Anicius.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL342_251_a" id="target_note_LCL342_251_a"><sup>a</sup></a> ‘But those brands are acknowledged to be the best!’ Yes I know, but too old a wine has not the mellowness which we want, and in fact it is scarcely longer fit to drink. If that then is one’s feeling, need he go to the <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">288</span><span class="br"></span> other extreme and hold, if he wants a potable wine, that it must be drawn from the fresh vat? Certainly not; he would look for a wine of moderate age. In like manner I hold that those friends of yours do well to shun this new oratory still in a state of ferment, like must from the basin of the wine-press, and conversely that they ought not to strive for the manner of Thucydides,—splendid doubtless, but, like the vintage of Anicius, too old. Thucydides himself if he had lived at a somewhat later time would have been mellower and less harsh.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL342_251_b" id="target_note_LCL342_251_b"><sup>b</sup></a></p>

But we do not it is true succeed in our effort; these fellows however, our self-styled Atticists, quite obviously it would seem do succeed in what they have

It is commonly called in modern criticism “the diatribe style,” but with doubtful appropriateness. The manner of anticipatory statement of an opposing argument and of quick refutation by one and the same speaker was highly developed in the oratory of the courts of law, and passed over naturally to the moral indictments of the satirist.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL342_251_b').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
