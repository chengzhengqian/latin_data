of that office. But it is the dignity of the State which confronts me, which seizes my attention, and urges me to pass over these less important matters. My client, gentlemen, was by lot the quaestor of <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">8</span><span class="br"></span> Gaius Antonius, my colleague,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL309_45_a" id="target_note_LCL309_45_a"><sup>a</sup></a> but by his participation in my counsels he was mine. A certain regard for what is due to a colleague, as I interpret the matter, makes me scruple to set out how many matters Publius Sestius discovered,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL309_45_b" id="target_note_LCL309_45_b"><sup>b</sup></a> when he was with my colleague, how much he communicated to me, and what great foresight he displayed. And of Antonius himself I will say one word only: that never, in those days of exceeding fear and public peril, did he show any desire either to remove by disavowal or to allay by pretended ignorance either the general fear of all men or the particular suspicion entertained by some about himself. And if you did often praise me, very properly, for my efforts in checking and managing my colleague and my indulgent treatment of him, together with my utmost watchfulness over the public interest, equal praise almost is due to Publius Sestius, who was so careful of his consul<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL309_45_c" id="target_note_LCL309_45_c"><sup>c</sup></a> that Antonius found in him a good quaestor, and all loyalists a most patriotic citizen.</p>
