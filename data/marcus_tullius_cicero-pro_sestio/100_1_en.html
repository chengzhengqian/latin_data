Lentulus Spinther, who was due as proconsul to govern Cilicia in 56 <span class="sc">b.c.</span>, had been commissioned by the Senate to restore Ptolemy Auletes, the exiled king of Egypt. Early in 56 <span class="sc">b.c.</span> a proposal was made by a tribune, C. Cato, that Lentulus be deprived of his <span class="italic">imperium</span>, and consequently of this commission. See Cicero, <span class="italic">Epp. ad Quintum fratrem</span>, ii. 3. 1. The charge was foiled by the consul Lentulus Marcellinus. Finally, on the plea that the Sibylline Books forbade the restoration of a king of Egypt by armed force, the Senate shelved the matter. Ptolemy was restored by A. Gabinius, governor of Syria, before April 55 <span class="sc">b.c</span>.; see Cicero, <span class="italic">Epp. ad, Att</span>. iv. 10. 1.
