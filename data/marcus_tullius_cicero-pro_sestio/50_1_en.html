<p>XXXIV. Then Lucius Cotta,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL309_135_a" id="target_note_LCL309_135_a"><sup>a</sup></a> having been asked <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">73</span><span class="br"></span> to open the debate, delivered an opinion which was most worthy of the State. He said that the measures that had been taken against me were all unconstitutional, all opposed to the custom of our ancestors, and all illegal; that no one could be deprived of his citizenship without a trial; that not only could no motion be made concerning a manâ€™s civil status, but not even could any judgment be pronounced against it, without reference to the <span class="italic">comitia centuriata</span>; that all that business was brute force, a blaze from the collapse of the State when the world was in confusion, when right and justice were overthrown; that when a great political upheaval was imminent, I had turned aside a little and, in the hope of finding calm hereafter, had avoided the stormy waves before me.
