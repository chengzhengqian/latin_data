who think they are born for their country, for their fellow-citizens, for esteem, for glory, not for sleep, for feasting, for enjoyment. For if they are led astray by pleasure, and have given themselves up to the seductions of vice and the allurements of desire, let them renounce public office, let them eschew political life, let them be content to enjoy their ease and to owe it to the labour of brave men. But those <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">139</span><span class="br"></span> who seek the reputation of loyal citizens, which alone can be called true glory, ought to seek security and pleasures for others, not for themselves. They must sweat for the common interests; they must expose themselves to enmity; they must often face storms for the sake of the State; they must be ready to fight with many audacious, wicked, and sometimes even powerful men,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL309_227_a" id="target_note_LCL309_227_a"><sup>a</sup></a> That is what we have heard, what tradition tells us, what we have read as to how our most famous men have thought and acted. Nor do we ever see as objects of praise those men who have at any time roused the temper of the commons to sedition, or who have blinded the minds of the inexperienced by bribery, or who have brought odium upon brave and illustrious men that have deserved well of the State. Our people have always considered such men to be untrustworthy, and to be reckless, wicked, and pernicious citizens. But, on the other hand, those who have checked their attacks and efforts, those who by their influence, their loyalty, their stedfastness, their greatness of soul, have resisted the schemes of adventurers, have always been regarded as men of solid worth, as chiefs and leaders, and as those to whom we owe our present eminence and sovereignty.</p>
