into one place those who had been scattered abroad, and brought them from that state of savagery to one of justice and humanity. Then things serving for common use, which we call public, associations of men, which were afterwards called states, then continuous series of dwelling-places which we call cities, they enclosed with walls, after divine and human law had been introduced. Now, between life thus <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">92</span><span class="br"></span> refined and humanized, and that life of savagery, nothing marks the difference so clearly as law and violence. Whichever of the two we are unwilling to use, we must use the other. If we would have violence abolished, law must prevail, that is the administration of justice, on which law wholly depends; if we dislike the administration of justice, or if there is none, force must rule. All are aware of this; Milo both knew it and so acted as to make trial of law, but to repel force. He was desirous to make use of the first, that virtue might overcome audacity; he was compelled to use the second, that virtue might not be overcome by audacity. And Sestius’ method was the same, if not in regard to prosecution—for it was not necessary for every one to do the same—yet certainly in regard to the necessity of defending his life and assembling a bodyguard to protect himself against force and violence.</p>
