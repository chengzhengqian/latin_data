Of late<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL309_189_a" id="target_note_LCL309_189_a"><sup>a</sup></a> there was a college of tribunes, three<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL309_189_b" id="target_note_LCL309_189_b"><sup>b</sup></a> of whom were considered by no means “Friends of the People,” two<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL309_189_c" id="target_note_LCL309_189_c"><sup>c</sup></a> extremely so.
