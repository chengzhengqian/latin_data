Milo, as a tribune of the commons, took up the <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">87</span><span class="br"></span> cause of the State. I propose to say more in his praise, not because he would himself wish my words to be spoken rather than to remain matters of opinion, nor because I would gladly address these compliments to him in person,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL309_155_a" id="target_note_LCL309_155_a"><sup>a</sup></a> especially since I cannot find words to express them; but because I think that if I have shown that Milo’s case has been commended by Sestius’ prosecutor, you will consider that Sestius has an equally good case against the charge<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL309_155_b" id="target_note_LCL309_155_b"><sup>b</sup></a> brought against him. Milo then took up the cause of the State with the desire to restore a citizen who had been violently taken from it. His purpose was simple, his method was consistent, fully supported by general agreement and complete unanimity. He had his colleagues to help him; one consul showed the greatest cordiality on his behalf, the other was almost reconciled to him<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL309_155_c" id="target_note_LCL309_155_c"><sup>c</sup></a>; of the praetors one was unfavourable to him<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL309_155_d" id="target_note_LCL309_155_d"><sup>d</sup></a>; the enthusiasm of the Senate was extraordinary, the spirit of the Roman Knights was aroused in his cause, Italy was on the tiptoe of expectation. Two men<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL309_155_e" id="target_note_LCL309_155_e"><sup>e</sup></a> only had been bought to offer obstruction; and if those despicable and contemptible men should prove unequal to so great a task, he saw that he would carry through the cause which he had undertaken without difficulty. He acted with energy, with judgment, with the sanction of that exalted Order of the Senate, with the example of loyal and brave citizens before him; he most carefully considered what was worthy of the State, what was worthy of himself, who he was, what he felt bound to hope for, what was due to the traditions of his ancestors.</p>
