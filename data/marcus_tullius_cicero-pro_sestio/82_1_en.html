judgment of the whole People, and the inmost feelings of the country. What, then, do you think of this? <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">120</span><span class="br"></span> When news had just been brought to the shows and to the stage of that decree of the Senate which was passed in the Temple of Virtue, before a vast audience a great artist who,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL309_199_a" id="target_note_LCL309_199_a"><sup>a</sup></a> upon my soul, has always played a most noble part in public life as well as on the stage, weeping with joy still fresh, with mingled grief and longing for me, pleaded my cause before the Roman People in much weightier words than I could have pleaded myself! For he expressed the genius of a great poet<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL309_199_ba" id="target_note_LCL309_199_ba"><sup>b</sup></a> not only by the exercise of his art, but also by his own grief. For while he uttered the words:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">Who with firm spirit helped the public cause,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Upheld it, ever stood with the Achivi—</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">with what force he made it clear that I had stood on your side, as he pointed to your assembled Orders! He was encored by all when he went on to say:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">In wavering affairs did never waver</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">His life to offer, nor did spare his head.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">What shouts of applause greeted his performance <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">121</span><span class="br"></span> of this passage, when they took no notice of the acting, but applauded the words of the poet, the earnestness of the actor and the hope of my recall!</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">Our greatest friend, in this our greatest war.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">The actor himself added the words</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">Endowed with greatest genius</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">out of friendship for me, and perhaps the spectators approved owing to some regret for my absence.</p>
