could wish, they certainly would not have been able, by killing their own hireling, to shift the odium upon those they thought they could, but they would have lessened the infamy of a heart-rending crime by one that would almost excite gratitude. And if, gentlemen <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">83</span><span class="br"></span>, Publius Sestius had then breathed his last in the Temple of Castor, for he was at the point of death, I have no doubt, if only there were a Senate in the State, if the majesty of the Roman People should come to life again, that a statue would one day be set up to him in the Forum as having been slain in defence of the State. And indeed, of those departed heroes whose statues you see, set up by our ancestors, in the Forum and on the Rostra, not one would be preferred to Publius Sestius, either because of the cruelty of his death<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL309_149_a" id="target_note_LCL309_149_a"><sup>a</sup></a> or of his devotion to his country: if he, having undertaken the defence of a citizen threatened with loss of civil rights,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL309_149_b" id="target_note_LCL309_149_b"><sup>b</sup></a> of a friend, of one who had deserved well of his country, the defence of the Senate, of Italy, and of the State, if he then, obedient to the auspices and religious observance, having announced an evil omen,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL309_149_c" id="target_note_LCL309_149_c"><sup>c</sup></a> had been slain openly in broad daylight, in the sight of gods and men, by those villainous pests, in a most sacred temple, in a most sacred cause, while holding a most sacred office. Will anyone, then, venture to say that in life a man ought to be robbed of his honours, whom in death you would think worthy to be honoured by an everlasting memorial?</p>
