had a son whom you see here,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL309_43_a" id="target_note_LCL309_43_a"><sup>a</sup></a> and a daughter now married. He so won the approval of these two men of most dignified and old-fashioned manners, that he was especially dear and agreeable to both. By the death of his daughter Albinus lost the name of father-in-law,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL309_43_b" id="target_note_LCL309_43_b"><sup>b</sup></a> but did not lose the affection and goodwill arising from that close connexion. Even to-day you can easily judge of his fondness for Sestius either from his constant attendance in court, or his anxiety and distress. While his father was still alive, Sestius <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">7</span><span class="br"></span> married a second wife, a daughter of Lucius Scipio,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL309_43_ca" id="target_note_LCL309_43_ca"><sup>c</sup></a> an excellent and yet most unfortunate man. Publius Sestius showed remarkable affection for him, as all willingly acknowledged, by leaving at once for Massilia, that he might be able to see and comfort his father-in-law, a man who deserved to stand where his fathers had stood, but who languished an outcast in a foreign land, a victim of the storms of trouble at home.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL309_43_d" id="target_note_LCL309_43_d"><sup>d</sup></a> And he brought his daughter to him, in the hope that her unexpected appearance and embrace might cause him to forget some portion at least, if not all of his sorrow; and by his marked and unceasing devotion he comforted him in his affliction till his death and his daughter in her bereavement. I can say much of his noble spirit, of his kindly services at home, of his military tribunate,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL309_43_e" id="target_note_LCL309_43_e"><sup>e</sup></a> of his incorruptibility in the discharge<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL309_43_f" id="target_note_LCL309_43_f"><sup>f</sup></a>
