And, while the same consuls sat there and looked on, a law was passed<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL309_79_a" id="target_note_LCL309_79_a"><sup>a</sup></a> that the auspices should have no validity, that no one should announce unfavourable omens, that no one should veto a law, that it should be permissible for laws to be passed on all <span class="italic">dies fasti,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL309_79_b" id="target_note_LCL309_79_b"><sup>b</sup></a></span> that the Aelian Law and the Fufian Law should be invalid.
