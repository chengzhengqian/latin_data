<p>LXV. And now, gentlemen, while bringing this accusation he has dared to exhort you in this case at last to show yourselves severe, and at last to administer some healing remedy to the State! It is not a remedy to apply a lancet to a sound and healthy part of the body; that is an act of butchery and cruelty.

<p>But, that my speech may have some termination, <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">136</span><span class="br"></span> and that I may cease speaking before you cease to listen to me so attentively, I will finish my remarks about the “Aristocrats” and their leaders and about the defenders of the State. You, young Romans, who are nobles by birth, I will rouse to imitate the example of your ancestors; and you who can win nobility by your talents and virtue, I will exhort to follow that career in which many “new men”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL309_223_f" id="target_note_LCL309_223_f"><sup>f</sup></a> have covered themselves with honour and glory. Believe <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">137</span><span class="br"></span> me, the only way to esteem, to distinction, and to honour, is to deserve the praise and affection of patriots who are wise and of a good natural disposition and to understand the organization of the State
