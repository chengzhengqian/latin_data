the advice of every loyal citizen, to betray the State, to degrade the name of consul? would you also be bold enough to issue an edict that the people should not lament my, their own, the public calamity, that they should not show their sorrow by their dress? Whether that change of dress was intended to show their own grief, or as a sign of entreaty, who ever was so cruel as to prevent anyone either from mourning for himself or from intercession on behalf of others? Again, are not men in the habit of changing their <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">33</span><span class="br"></span> dress by their own wish when their friends are in danger? Will no one go into mourning for you, Piso?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL309_77_a" id="target_note_LCL309_77_a"><sup>a</sup></a> not even those whom you nominated to your staff on your own authority,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL309_77_b" id="target_note_LCL309_77_b"><sup>b</sup></a> not only without a decree of the Senate, but even against its wish? The misfortune, then, of a desperate man and a traitor to the State shall perhaps be lamented by those who choose; but when a citizen fully enjoys the goodwill of loyal men and has done his utmost for the welfare of his country, shall it not be lawful for the Senate to lament his peril—a peril that involves peril to the State? And yet those very same consuls—if they are to be called consuls, whose names all think ought to be torn out not only from human memory but also from public records—after a bargain had been struck about the provinces,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL309_77_c" id="target_note_LCL309_77_c"><sup>c</sup></a> were brought before a meeting in the Circus Flaminius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL309_77_d" id="target_note_LCL309_77_d"><sup>d</sup></a> by that madman, that curse of his country, and to your profound grief gave their approval, by both word and vote, to all that was then being done against myself and the State.</p>
