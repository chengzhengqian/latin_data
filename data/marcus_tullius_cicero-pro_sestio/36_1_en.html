guardians and saviours of this city and Empire, what abominable atrocities, what crimes did ye then behold in the State! A citizen had been driven out,—a citizen who had defended the State under a resolution of the Senate and in concert with all loyal citizens, driven out on that charge alone, and on no other. He had, also, been driven out without a trial, by violence, by stones, by the sword, yes, even by inciting slaves to join the tumult. A law had been passed, after the Forum had been ravaged and abandoned, and surrendered to assassins and slaves; and to prevent that law being passed the Senate had put on mourning. While the State was in such confusion, <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">54</span><span class="br"></span> the consuls did not allow even a single night to intervene between my overthrow and the seizure of their booty. The moment I was struck down they flew to let my blood, and while the State was still breathing, to strip it of their spoil. I say nothing about the giving of thanks, the banquets, the sharing out of public money,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL309_107_a" id="target_note_LCL309_107_a"><sup>a</sup></a> favours, hopes and promises, plunder, the joy of a few amidst marks of universal sorrow. My wife was persecuted<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL309_107_b" id="target_note_LCL309_107_b"><sup>b</sup></a>; my children’s lives were threatened; my son-in-law,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL309_107_ca" id="target_note_LCL309_107_ca"><sup>c</sup></a> and that son-in-law a Piso, was driven away from the feet of Piso the consul, where he lay a suppliant; my property was seized, and that also was carried off to the consuls; my house on the Palatine was in flames—and the consuls were feasting. Yet even if they rejoiced at my disasters, they ought to have been affected by the peril of the State.</p>
