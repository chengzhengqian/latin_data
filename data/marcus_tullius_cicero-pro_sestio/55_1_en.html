The tribune is unarmed and off his guard; some assail him with swords, some with pieces of railing,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL309_145_b" id="target_note_LCL309_145_b"><sup>b</sup></a> others with clubs. Covered with wounds from these, wearied out and mangled, he threw himself down exhausted, and escaped with his life only because he was thought to have lost it. When they saw him lying on the ground, hacked with many wounds, collapsed from exhaustion and almost at his last gasp, they at last ceased to strike, more from fatigue and the mistake of thinking him dead than from any feeling of pity or restraint.

Or is it violence, simply to be unable to die? or that he, a tribune of the commons, stained a temple with his blood? or that, after he had been carried off and had just recovered his senses, he did not order that he should be carried back? Where is <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">81</span><span class="br"></span> the ground for accusation? What fault do you find with him? I now put this question, gentlemen.
