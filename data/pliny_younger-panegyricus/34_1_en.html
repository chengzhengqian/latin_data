                    not only did the Nile (which normally spreads far afield) stop short of and fall
                    below the level it usually occupied in the hills, but even on level ground which
                    should have retained them, its waters rapidly retreated instead of maintaining
                    their usual even, gentle flow; and the soil was left insufficiently soaked, to
                    be added to the parched areas. Therefore the country, denied the flood which is
                    its fertility, looked to Caesar for aid instead of to their river; and no sooner
                    had he heard their appeal than their troubles were at an end. So prompt is your
                    power, Caesar, so prepared and ready for all alike your goodness of heart, that
                    if any of your subjects suffers misfortune he has only to tell you to find help
                    and security in you.</p>

                    plight to test your resources and witness your vigilance. Though you deserve
                    prosperity everywhere, in everything, chance adversity clearly provides a field
                    of opportunity for your gifts and talents; for prosperity proves men to be
                    fortunate, while it is adversity which makes them great. For long it was
                    generally believed that Rome could only be fed and maintained with Egyptian aid,
                    so that this vain and presumptuous nation used to boast that they must still
                    feed their conquerors, that their river and their ships ensured our plenty or
                    our want. Now we have returned the Nile its riches, sent back the corn we
                    received; it has had to take home the harvests it used to dispatch across the
                    sea. Let this be a lesson to Egypt; let her learn by experience that her </p></section><notes></notes></section>
