                    as a wholly different category from those with whom they had the closest ties.
                    As a result, what should have been a considerable benefit turned into a grave
                    injustice, and Roman citizenship came to stand for hatred, dissension, and
                    deprivation, since it parted relatives who were dear to each other, regardless
                    of their ties of affection. Even so, people were found for whom the name of
                    Roman meant so much that it seemed adequate compensation not only for a five per
                    cent tax but even for the wrong done their kindred; though the value they put on
                    citizenship gave them the best claim to enjoy it tax-free.</p>
<p>Consequently, your father<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_405_2" id="target_note_LCL059_405_2"><sup>2</sup></a> decreed that any property passing from a
                    mother to her children, or from children to their mother, even in the absence of
                    kindred rights, provided that they were citizens, should be exempt from the five
                    per cent tax. He extended the same exemption to a son in respect of his
                    father’s property, provided that he was still under his father’s
                    authority, thinking that it was excessive, unprecedented, and might even be
                    called impious for a tax-collector’s name to be associated with theirs;
                    and that it was positively sacrilegious for a relationship so sacred to be
                    severed by the intervention of an inheritance tax. Indeed, he thought that no
                    tax was worth the cost of estranging parents and children.</p>
