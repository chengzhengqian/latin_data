                    diametrically opposed; knowing this, you realize how a true prince is most
                    welcome to those who can least endure a tyrant. These then are the men you
                    promote and show as a typical example of the way of life and kind of man you
                    prefer; and if you have not yet assumed the censorship and superintendence of
                    our morals, it is because you would rather test our character by benefits than
                    correctives. Besides, I fancy that a ruler may do more for the morals of his
                    country by permitting good conduct than by compelling it. We are easily led
                    wherever he takes us, following (as it were) in his steps; now we see before us
                    one whose affection and approval we all seek to win, in a way those unlike him
                    can never hope to do; so that by the firmness of our allegiance we are reaching
                    the point when we shall all conform with the ways of a single man. (We are
                    surely not so wrong-headed that we can only copy a bad ruler and not a good
                    one.) You need only continue as you are, Caesar, and the principles of your
                    conduct will have the same effective power as a censorship. Indeed, an
                    emperorâ€™s life <span class="italic">is</span> a censorship, and a true
                    perpetual one;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_423_1" id="target_note_LCL059_423_1"><sup>1</sup></a> this is what guides and directs us, for
                    example is what we need more than command. Fear is unreliable as a teacher of
                    morals. Men learn better from examples, which have the great merit of proving
                    that their advice is practicable.</p>
