                    persuading the Roman people to put up with this, though he did not succeed in
                    making them willing to do so. But in your case, the people asked you to take the
                    measures which the other had imposed, seeing them now as a public benefit and
                    not an enforced necessity, as unanimous in their demand for you to do away with
                    the mimes as they had been for your father to restore them. They were right in
                    both casesâ€”it was necessary to restore what a bad emperor had suppressed,
                    and once restored, equally necessary to suppress it, for the rule to follow when
                    good deeds are done by bad men is to make it clear that the agent deserves
                    censure, not the act. And so the same populace which once watched and applauded
                    the performances of an actor-emperor<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_425_2" id="target_note_LCL059_425_2"><sup>2</sup></a> has now even
                    turned against the professional mimes, and damns their perverted art as a taste
                    unworthy of our age. This shows that even the vulgar crowd can take a lesson
                    from its rulers, since a reform so sweeping, if once started by an individual,
                    can spread to all. All honour to your noble wisdom, Caesar, for this has enabled
                    you to see an accepted custom take the place of what used to be an arbitrary
                    decree! Of their own accord men who deserved correction have corrected their own
                    faults and proved themselves reformers though previously needing reform.
                    Consequently no one complains of your severity though complaint is open to all.
                    It is always the way that fewest complaints are made about a ruler who allows
                    most freedom to make them, and under your regime there is nothing which can fail
                    to give joy and happiness
