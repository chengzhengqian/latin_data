                    as the nature of the man adopted, sure indication that Nerva would have been
                    foolish had he chosen otherwise. It is not so long since there was an adoption
                    which failed to check an outbreak of rebellion,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_343_1" id="target_note_LCL059_343_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and indeed

                    Can it be doubted that if an emperor who had forfeited men’s regard was

                    emperor with a share in the tribune’s powers, to hold immediately and
                    simultaneously all the titles which in recent times were conferred by an emperor
                    on one only of the sons he had fathered.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_343_2" id="target_note_LCL059_343_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
