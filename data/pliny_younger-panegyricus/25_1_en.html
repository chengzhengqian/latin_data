<p>22. Now first of all, think of the day when you entered your city,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_371_1" id="target_note_LCL059_371_1"><sup>1</sup></a> so long awaited and so much desired! The very method of your
                    entry won delight and surprise, for your predecessors chose to be borne, or
                    carried in, not satisfied even to be drawn by four white horses in a triumphal
                    carriage, but lifted up on human shoulders in their overbearing pride. You
                    towered above us only because of your own splendid physique; your triumph did
                    not rest on our humiliation, won as it was over imperial arrogance. Thus neither
                    age, health nor sex held your subjects back from feasting their eyes on this
                    unexpected sight: small children learned who you were, young people pointed you
                    out, old men admired: even the sick disregarded their doctorsâ€™ orders and
                    dragged themselves out for a glimpse of you as if this could restore their
                    health. There were some who cried that they had lived long enough now they had
                    seen and welcomed you, others that this was a reason for longer life. Women
                    rejoiced as never before to bear children now that they knew they had brought
                    forth citizens and soldiers to live and serve under your rule and command. Roofs
                    could be seen sagging under the crowds they bore, not a vacant inch of ground
                    was visible except under a foot poised to step, streets were packed on both
                    sides leaving only a narrow passage for you, on every side the excited populace,
                    cheers and rejoicing everywhere. All felt the same joy at your coming, when you
                    were coming to be the same for all, joy which could still grow as you moved
                    forward, and (one might say) swell with every step.</p>
