                    for its beauty, and still more for the way in which prince and people alike are
                    seated on the same level. From one end to the other is a uniform plan, a
                    continuous line, and Caesar as spectator shares the public seats as he does the
                    spectacle. Thus your subjects will be able to look on you in their turn; they
                    will be permitted to see not just the Emperor’s box, but their emperor
                    himself, seated among his people—the people to whom you have given an
                    additional five thousand seats.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_439_1" id="target_note_LCL059_439_1"><sup>1</sup></a> For you had already increased their

                    would have been placed for him among the gods, and prayers offered in his name
                    with major victims on the holiest of altars. But you enter the sanctuaries only
                    to offer your own prayers—for you the highest honour is to have your
                    statues placed outside the temples, on guard before the doors. This is why the
                    gods have set you on the pinnacle of human power: they know that you do not
                    covet their own. Of your statues, only one or two are to be seen in the
                    vestibule of the temple of Jupiter Best and Highest, and these are made of
                    bronze; whereas only recently every approach and step, every inch of the
