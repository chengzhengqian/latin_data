<p>57. So much for the fame of the consulship you held. Now for the one you
                    postponed, when your principate had only just begun and (as if sated and
                    surfeited with honours) you refused the office of consul which newly-elected
                    emperors had previously claimed even when it was assigned to others. One of them
                    at the end of his reign had even snatched away a consulship he had bestowed
                    himself and which had nearly run its course.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_455_1" id="target_note_LCL059_455_1"><sup>1</sup></a> This then was
                    a distinction so coveted by emperors whether beginning or ending their reigns
                    that they could seize it from its bearers; yet you left it for your subjects,
                    even when it was vacant and unoccupied. Should we have begrudged you a third
                    consulship? Or a first one in your new capacity as our prince? You were in fact
                    emperor when you entered your second one, but were still serving under another
                        emperor,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_455_2" id="target_note_LCL059_455_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and could only claim credit by setting
                    an example of obedience. Why, the country has seen men five or six times
