                    care you took to include everyone in your bounty! It was bestowed even on those
                    whose names were listed after your edict, in place of some crossed off, while
                    others ranked equal with the rest though not eligible at first. One man might be
                    delayed by illness or his personal affairs, another held up by rivers or sea,

                    children, the populace of the future, to watch for the emperor’s public
                    appearance and line his path. Every parent’s concern was to show his
                    little ones mounted on his shoulders, to teach them flattering words and fawning
                    phrases, while they repeated their lessons, their vain pleas mostly falling on
                    the emperor’s deaf ears, to be brushed aside in their ignorance of what
                    they asked and what was refused, until the day would come when they would
                    understand all too well. You, however, would permit no requests. Though your
                    eyes might be gladdened by the sight of the rising generation of Rome, you gave
                    orders that every child must be admitted and enrolled before seeing or
