                    neglect or revile; in contrast, a spirit which is above ambition, which can hold
                    in check the temptations of power unbounded, blossoms as the years go by and
                    hears its praise most often on the lips of those who are least forced to sing
                    it. Moreover, an emperor is no sooner elected than his fame is assured for all
                    time, for better or worse; he need not seek a lasting reputation (it will last
                    in spite of him) but a good one: and this is preserved not in portraits and
                    statues but in virtue and good deeds. His form and features too, so short-lived
                    as they are, are not so well expressed and retained in silver and gold as by his
                    peopleâ€™s love. That happy fortune is yours to enjoy, in every way you
                    could desire, for your radiant face and beloved countenance dwell in the words,
                    the looks, the thoughts of all your subjects.</p>

<p>56. I dare say you have noticed, Conscript Fathers, that I have long since
                    stopped selecting what I shall say; for I set out to praise my prince in person,
                    and not his actions. Many deeds may be admirable though bad men do them, but a
                    man can only win praise for himself if he possesses true virtue. Wherefore,
                    august Emperor, nothing can bring you greater glory than the fact that in
                    expressing our thanks we have nothing to omit or conceal. Is there anything in
                    your principate which a panegyrist must hurry over with a passing word? Any
                    moment or instant of time which has yielded no benefit and commands no
                    approbation? Does not everything combine to make the highest praise of you no
                    more than a faithful record of the truth? And so my speech could be infinitely
