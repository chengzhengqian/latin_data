                    necessity require, bringing aid and nourishment to a nation cut off by the sea
                    as if its people were numbered among the humbler citizens of Rome! Even the
                    heavens can never prove so kind as to enrich and favour every land alike; but he
                    can banish everywhere the hardships if not the condition of sterility, and
                    introduce the benefits of fertility, if not fertility itself. He can so join
                    East and West by convoys that those peoples who offer and those who need
                    supplies can learn and appreciate in their turn, after experiencing licence and
                    discord, how much they gain from having one master to serve. Divide a common
                    property, and each individual must bear his own losses; but where everything is
                    jointly held, no one suffers personal loss and all share in the common wealth.

                    plea to the soil and river of Egypt: ask no more of our prince’s
                    generosity, take the seed sowed in your soft embrace and return it multiplied.
                    We ask no interest, but remember that you have a debt to repay; redeem the
                    broken promise of a single year in all the years and all the centuries to come,
                    the more so as we are making no demands.</p>

<p>33. Citizens and allies alike had had their needs supplied. Next came a public
                    entertainment— nothing lax or dissolute to weaken and destroy the manly
                    spirit of his subjects, but one to inspire them to face honourable wounds and
                    look scorn on death, by exhibiting love of glory and desire for victory even in
                    the persons of criminals and slaves. What generosity went to provide this
