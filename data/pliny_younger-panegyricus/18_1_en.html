                    of horse or carriage. Your charger followed, unmounted, more for
                    propriety’s sake than to help you on your way: you made use of it only at
                    the rest camps, raising the dust as you worked off your energy galloping over

                    doubts that you could do so. This much is certain of the man who had called you
                    from Spain to be his surest support during those very German wars, unwilling as
