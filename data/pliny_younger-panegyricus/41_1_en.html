<p>37. The burdens of empire have necessitated the introduction of several taxes, at
                    the expense of the individual in order to benefit the country as a whole. Among
                    these is the five per cent inheritance tax,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_403_1a" id="target_note_LCL059_403_1a"><sup>1</sup></a> one which is
                    more readily acceptable when it is confined to distant heirs, but which weighs
                    heavily on direct heirs within the family. And so hitherto it was applied to the
                    former cases and remitted in the latter, doubtless because it was obvious how
                    hardly men would accept—or rather, not accept—any reduction and
                    diminution of the property assured them through ties of blood and kinship and
                    the bond of family rites, something which they had never considered as an
                    expectation from another’s hands but as their own permanent possession,
                    to be passed on one day to their nearest relative in their turn. This legal
                    concession was reserved for citizens of long standing; recent ones, whether they
