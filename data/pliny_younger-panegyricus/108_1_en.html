                    of princes and most valorous of emperors in the field, so that to its supreme
                    honour might be added the further distinction of rapid promotion. This marks the
                    gulf between you and those among your predecessors who sought to recommend their
                    benefits by hedging them with difficulties, and believed that honours would be
                    more acceptable to their recipients if hope long deferred, exasperation and
                    endless delays tantamount to a rebuff, had first turned them into a mark of
                    ignominy. Modesty prevents us from quoting in detail your recommendation whereby
                    you did honour to our love of virtue and the State by comparing us with the
                    great consuls of the past—whether justly or not we cannot venture to
                    decide, for it would be improper for us to disparage your expressed opinion, and
                    an embarrassment to admit to any truth in such a splendid tribute to ourselves.
                    You, on the other hand, are fully worthy to bestow the consulate on such men as
                    you can extol in terms like these. Forgive me for saying that the most welcome
                    feature to us of the favours you bestow is your intention that we should be
                    colleagues once again. That was demanded by our mutual affection, the harmony of
                    our way of life, and the uniformity of our principles, which is so marked that
                    the similarity of our habits detracts from the merit of our close agreement; for
                    either of us to disagree with his colleague would be as surprising as if he were
                    at odds with himself. Thus there is nothing incidental or transitory in the
                    pleasure which each of us feels in the consulship of his colleague; it might be
                    a second one of his own, </p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL059_537_1"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL059_537_1" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">1</sup>The <span class="italic">praefectura aerarii Saturni</span> (<span class="italic">Ep.</span> V. 14, X.
