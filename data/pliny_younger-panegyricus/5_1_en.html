                    solemn duty today because our Father has banned and forbidden private
                    expressions of thanks and would intervene against public speeches also if he
                    allowed himself to oppose the Senate’s will. Both these actions, Caesar
                    Augustus—your refusal of thanks elsewhere and your acceptance
                    here—are proof of your moderation, for you do honour thereby not to
                    yourself but to those who would thank you. You yield to our feelings of
                    affection; and no necessity constrains us to proclaim your good deeds, whereas
                    you have bound yourself to listen to them.</p>
<p>I often used to wonder, Conscript Fathers, what great gifts should be proper to
                    the man whose word or gesture of command could rule land and sea and determine
                    peace or war; but when I tried to picture to myself a ruler worthy of power
                    equalling that of the immortal gods, even in my fondest hopes I never conceived
                    the like of him whom we see before us today. One man may have shone in war, but
                    his glory has grown dim in time of peace, while another has distinguished
                    himself in civil life but not in arms. Some have won respect through
                    men’s fear, while others in courting popularity have sunk low. Sometimes
                    the honour gained at home has been thrown away outside it, while at others a
                    public reputation has been lost in private life. In fact there has been no one
                    up till now whose virtues have remained unsullied by the close proximity of his
                    faults. Contrast our prince, in whose person all the merits which win our
                    admiration are found in complete and happy harmony! His essential seriousness
                    and authority lose nothing through his candour and good humour; </p></section><notes></notes></section>
