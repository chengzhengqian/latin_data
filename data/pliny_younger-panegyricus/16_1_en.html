<p>13. Thus your enemies bowed before your reputation. What shall I say now of the
                    admiration which you won from your own men? They saw how you shared their hunger
                    and thirst on field manoeuvres and how their commander’s sweat and dust
                    was mingled with their own; with nothing to mark you out save your height and
                    physique, in open battle you launched your spears at close quarters or received
                    those aimed at you; you delighted in the courage of your soldiers and rejoiced
                    whenever a heavier blow struck you on shield or helmet, praising your assailants
                    and urging them on to greater deeds of daring—which they at once
                    performed. Nothing escaped your direction or your observant eye; it was you who
                    assigned the men their arms before the start of operations, and tested the
                    spears so that when one seemed too heavy for a man you could wield it yourself.
                    Again, it was you who comforted the weary and attended to the sick, for it was
                    your habit to inspect your comrades’ tents before you retired to your
                    own; the last man must go off duty before you would take a rest yourself. Such
                    were the great generals of the past, bred in the homes of Fabricius, Scipio, and
                        Camillus;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_353_1" id="target_note_LCL059_353_1"><sup>1</sup></a> if they have a lesser claim upon my
