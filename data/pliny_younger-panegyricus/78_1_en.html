                    prince”; Caesar bows to the same restrictions as any other consul. He
                    takes the oath of obedience to the law with the gods as witness (for who if not
                    Caesar can command their attention?)— he takes it under the watchful eye
                    of those who must take it too, well aware that no one must be more scrupulous
                    about keeping to his oath than the man most concerned that there should be no
                    perjury.</p>
<p>Then, at the moment of laying down your consulship, you swore a similar oath that
                    you had done nothing contrary to the law; and this, as a statement of
                    achievement, was even finer than your earlier promise. To appear on the platform
                    so often, to frequent a place shunned by the pride of princes, there to assume
                    and there to lay down your offices: how this conduct becomes you, and how it
                    contrasts with the conduct of those who took up a consulship for a day or
                    two—or, rather, failed to take it up— only to issue a proclamation
                    that they had flung it aside! That was what took the place of the assembly, the
                    platform and their oath, doubtless to make their consulship end as it had begun,
                    and to provide the only indication that they had been elected at all: namely,
                    the absence of any other consul.</p>

<p>66. I have not left out our prince’s consulship, Conscript Fathers, but I
                    wanted all I had to say about oaths to be dealt with at once, for this is no
                    barren, empty subject in which a single facet of his glory must be broken up
                    into fragments and handled several times. The first day of your consulship had
                    hardly dawned before you entered the Senate-house and exhorted us, individually
                    and collectively, to resume our freedom, to take up the responsibilities </p></section><notes></notes></section>
