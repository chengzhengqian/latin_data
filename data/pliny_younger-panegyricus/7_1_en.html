                    assume imperial power, a sure sign that you would use it well. So then you had
                    to be pressed. Even then you could only be persuaded because you saw your

                    in the army; it was to provide the widespread violence and terror which were
                    needed to overcome your diffidence. Just as a period of calm in sky and sea is
                    welcomed by contrast with storm and tempest, similarly, I think, that earlier
                    season of unrest was designed to increase our appreciation of the peace we owe
                    to you. Such are the vicissitudes of our mortal lot: misfortune is born of
                    prosperity, and good fortune of ill-luck. God conceals their origins in both
                    cases, and the causes of good and evil are hidden for the most part, each behind
                    the otherâ€™s mask.</p>

                    time when an emperor and Father of the human race was besieged in his palace,
                    arrested and confined; from the kindest of elderly men was snatched his
                    authority to preserve mankind, from a prince was removed the greatest blessing
                    of princely power, the knowledge that he cannot be forced against his will. Yet
                    if this were the only means whereby you were to be brought to steer the ship of
                    state, I am still ready to declare that the price was not too high. Army
