                    gave no surer proof of his humiliation and defeat than at the very moment of his

                    they fought against us, not for their liberty but to enslave us all, accepting

                    permission to obey commands. They see that Rome has a leader who ranks with her

                    stained with the bloodshed of victory and on battlefields piled high with the
                    bodies of the dead. Today, therefore, we are receiving hostages, not paying for
                    them; huge losses and vast sums of money are no longer needed to buy terms of

                    complain—how could they, when they know how you encamped confronting a
                    dangerous enemy at the very time which was best for them and least favourable to
                    us: when the Danube is bridged by ice from bank to bank and can carry vast
                    preparations for war across its frozen surface, so that its savage peoples can
                    enjoy the double protection of their own arms and the winter weather of their
