                    between! Would you scorn the votes you hoped would confirm your election, and
                    think it sufficient to be proclaimed consul by your own order, without
                    preserving any semblance of a free state? Would you stand aloof from the
                    elections, cowering in some hiding-place, as if they were not there to confer a
                    consulship on you but to abrogate your supreme power? Earlier despots, in their
                    overweening pride, held to their conviction that if ever they acted as senators,
                    they would cease to be emperors in their own eyes. Most, however, were
                    influenced not so much by pride as by a kind of fear; conscious of their vices

                    and pollute the sacred field with their guilty tread? Their contempt for
                    everything human and divine had not reached the point of steeling them to stand
                    up in that great open space and face the eyes of gods and men directed on them.
                    In striking contrast, it was your moderation and your purity of heart which
                    persuaded you to offer yourself to men’s judgement and the divine
                    presence of the gods.</p>
