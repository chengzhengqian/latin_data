                    to own whatever he sees, and at long last the land subject to his sovereign
                    rights extends farther than his personal property;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_435_1" id="target_note_LCL059_435_1"><sup>1</sup></a> many of his
                    inherited estates (which his predecessors held not for their own pleasure so
                    much as to deny them to anyone else) are being restored to the State. Thus into
                    the seats and homes of the nobility step new masters equal to the old, and the
                    houses of the great no longer fall to pieces in the hands of a slave for
                    occupant, collapsing in hideous decay. Instead, we may see splendid mansions,
                    extended and flourishing, the dust all swept away: a noble service you render,
                    Caesar, not only to man but to the very buildings, for in checking ruin,
                    banishing neglect, and saving great edifices from destruction, you show the same
                    imaginative spirit as those who built them. And indeed, those dumb inanimate
                    stones seem to sense the happiness of being restored to splendour and frequented
                    once again, now that at last they have a master who appreciates their worth.
                    Under the name of Caesar is published a long list of possessions for sale,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_435_2a" id="target_note_LCL059_435_2a"><sup>2</sup></a> which shows up as the more abominable the cupidity of that
                    emperor who possessed far more than he needed, but always wanted more.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_435_3" id="target_note_LCL059_435_3"><sup>3</sup></a> In those days it was fatal for anyone about him to own a
                    spacious house or attractive property; today our prince looks for owners for
                    those very places, and introduces them
