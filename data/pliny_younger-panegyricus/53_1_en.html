<p>47. As for the lives and characters of the young— how you are forming them
                    in true princely fashion! And the teachers of rhetoric and professors of
                    philosophy—how you hold them in honour! Under you the liberal arts are
                    restored, to breathe and live in their own country—the learning which the
                    barbarity of the past punished with exile, when an emperor acquainted with all
                    the vices sought to banish everything hostile to vice, motivated less by hatred
                    for learning as by fear for its authority.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_427_1" id="target_note_LCL059_427_1"><sup>1</sup></a> But you

                    praise for your readiness to give audiences. Your father had shown his
                    magnanimity by giving the title of “open house” to what (before

                    accord; every action of yours suggests you might have set it there yourself. No
