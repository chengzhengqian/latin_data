                    husbands denied them complete success as citizens. But your own wife<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_519_1" id="target_note_LCL059_519_1"><sup>1</sup></a> contributes to your honour and glory, as a supreme model of
                    the ancient virtues; the Chief Pontiff himself,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_519_2" id="target_note_LCL059_519_2"><sup>2</sup></a> had he to
                    take a wife, would choose her, or one like herâ€”if one exists. From your
                    position she claims nothing for herself but the pleasure it gives her,
                    unswerving in her devotion not to your power but to yourself. You are just the
                    same to each other as you have always been, and your mutual appreciation is
                    unchanged; success has brought you nothing but a new understanding of your joint
                    ability to live in its shadow. How modest she is in her attire, how moderate the
                    number of her attendants, how unassuming when she walks abroad! This is the work
                    of her husband who has fashioned and formed her habits; there is glory enough
                    for a wife in obedience. When she sees her husband unaccompanied by pomp and
                    intimidation, she also goes about in silence, and as far as her sex permits, she
                    follows his example of walking on foot. This would win her praise even if you
                    did the opposite, but with a husband so moderate in his habits, how much respect
                    she owes him as his wife, and herself as a woman!</p>

<p>84. Your sister,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_519_3" id="target_note_LCL059_519_3"><sup>3</sup></a> too, never forgets that she is your
                    sister, and your own frank sincerity and candour can be clearly recognized in
                    her, so that if comparison were drawn between her and your wife, one could only
                    wonder which is the more conducive to an upright life, good training or
                    fortunate birth. Nothing leads to dissension so readily, especially between
                    women, as the rivalry which is most likely to arise </p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL059_519_1"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL059_519_1" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">1</sup>The
