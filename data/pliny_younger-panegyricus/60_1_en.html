                    by having statues of an incestuous emperor in their midst.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_441_1a" id="target_note_LCL059_441_1a"><sup>1</sup></a> And so your
                    few statues of bronze stand and will stand as long as the temple itself, whereas
                    those innumerable golden images, as a sacrifice to public rejoicing, lie broken
                    and destroyed. It was our delight to dash those proud faces to the ground, to
                    smite them with the sword and savage them with the if blood and agony could
                    follow from every blow. Our transports of joy—so long
                    deferred—were unrestrained; all sought a form of vengeance in beholding
                    those bodies mutilated, limbs hacked in pieces, and finally that baleful,
                    fearsome visage cast into fire, to be melted down, so that from such menacing
                    terror something for man’s use and enjoyment should rise out of the
                    flames.</p>
<p>With the same reverence for the gods, Caesar, you will not allow public thanks
                    for your benevolence to be addressed to your genius, but direct them to the
                    godhead of Jupiter Best and Highest; to him, you say, we owe whatever we owe
                    you, and your benefactions are the gift of him who gave you to us. Yet
                    previously the vast herds of victims were often stopped on the Capitoline Way
                    and large numbers forced to turn aside, for in honour of that grim statue of a
                    brutal tyrant<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_441_2" id="target_note_LCL059_441_2"><sup>2</sup></a> the blood of victims had to flow as
                    freely as the human blood he shed.</p>
