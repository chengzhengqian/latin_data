                    took as much pleasure in hearing the consuls proclaimed as he did in their
                    designation. The candidates stood before the prince’s chair, as he had
                    previously stood himself before the consul’s, and were directed to take
                    the oath in the same words as their prince had recently used—for he
                    believes the act of swearing so important that he expects everyone to do as he
                    did. The rest of the day was devoted to the administration of justice, and there
                    he gave proof of his scrupulous attitude towards equity and his deep reverence
                    for the letter of the law. If approached as emperor, he simply replied that he
                    was consul. No magistrate had his rights or authority diminished; indeed, he
                    took pains to increase these, by delegating the majority of the cases to the
                    praetors and addressing them as his colleagues, not with any idea of courting
                    popularity among his audience, but because these were his genuine
                    sentiments—for such was the value he put upon the praetor’s office
                    that in his estimation to be called the Emperor’s colleague added nothing
                    to its status. In addition, his application to the task of administering justice
                    made it appear that he was refreshed and restored by hard work. Which of us
                    takes the same trouble or makes so much effort? Who devotes himself to the
