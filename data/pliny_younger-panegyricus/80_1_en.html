                    has said. Only consider the seriousness of his sentiments, the unaffected
                    candour of his words, the assurance in his voice and decision in his
                    countenance, and the complete sincerity of his gaze, his pose and gestures, in
                    fact of his entire person! So, we may be sure, he will always remember the
                    advice he gave us, and will always understand that in making use of the freedom
                    he granted we are acting only in obedience to him. We need have no fears that he
                    will think us improvident if we show no hesitation in profiting by the security
                    of the times, since he remembers how differently we lived under a wicked
                    emperor. We were accustomed to offering vows<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_481_1" id="target_note_LCL059_481_1"><sup>1</sup></a> to ensure the
                    eternity of the empire and the safety of the emperors, or, rather, the safety of
                    the emperors and thereby the eternity of the empire. But in the case of our
                    present emperor, it is worth noting the wording of these vows, and the clause
                    “if he has ruled the State well and in the interests of all.” Such
                    vows are indeed worthy of being always renewed and always discharged. At your
                    instigation, Caesar, the State has struck a bargain with the gods that they
                    shall preserve your health and safety as long as you do the same for everyone
                    else; otherwise they are to turn their attention from protecting your life, and
                    to abandon you to such vows as are taken in secret. Others used to wish to
                    outlive the State, and took steps to do so; but for you, the thought of personal
                    safety is hateful unless it be bound up with the safety of us all. You permit no
                    prayers on your behalf unless they benefit their authors, and every year you set
                    the gods to reconsider you, insisting that </p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL059_481_1"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL059_481_1" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">1</sup>For the annual renewal of
