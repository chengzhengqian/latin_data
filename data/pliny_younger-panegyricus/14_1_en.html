                    should shed, then the temples<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_349_2" id="target_note_LCL059_349_2"><sup>2</sup></a> you raised to him. Others have done
                    the same, but with different intent; Tiberius deified Augustus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_349_3" id="target_note_LCL059_349_3"><sup>3</sup></a> but his
                    purpose was to introduce the charge of high treason; Nero had done the same for

                    similarly honoured Vespasian and Domitian Titus, but only for one to be thought
                    the son and the other the brother of a god.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_349_5" id="target_note_LCL059_349_5"><sup>5</sup></a> You gave your
                    father his place among the stars with no thought of terrorizing your subjects,
                    of bringing the gods into disrepute, or of gaining reflected glory, but simply
                    because you thought he <span class="italic">was</span> a god. This is an honour which
                    means less when it is paid by men who believe themselves to be equally divine;
                    unlike you, who set up his cult with altars, couches and a priest, yet created
                    and proved his godhead still more by being the man you are. For there is no more
                    certain proof of divinity in a ruler who has chosen his successor before he met
                    his end than the worthiness of his choice. Consequently, it is inconceivable
                    that knowledge of your fatherâ€™s immortality would ever make you proud;
                    you would not take your example from recent times, when sovereigns have grown
                    insolent and idle just because their parents are divine, instead of from the
                    rulers of the past who . . . their empire
