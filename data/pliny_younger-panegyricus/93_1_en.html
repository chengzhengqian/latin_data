                    above the other consuls, when it was he who made them, for it would be an insult
                    to his position if office could be bestowed by one incapable of filling it. The
                    creator of consuls must also instruct them, and show those who are going to
                    receive the highest office from him that he knows the value of his gifts; in
                    this way they will also come to know the value of what they have been given.</p>

<p>78. With all the more justice then, did the Senate ask you to bow to its wishes
                    and accept the consulate for a fourth time.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_507_1" id="target_note_LCL059_507_1"><sup>1</sup></a> That it
                    speaks with the voice of authority and not of flattery is proved by your own
                    attitude of deference; there is no demand which the Senate has a better claim to
                    make of you or you to grant. For the prince no less than for the common man the
                    thread of life is short and easily snapped, even when he deems himself the equal
                    of the gods;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_507_2" id="target_note_LCL059_507_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and thus it is only proper that the best
                    among us should apply his efforts to leaving records of his justice and
                    moderation which will be of service to his country even after death. None can
                    achieve this better than the consul. We know that your intention is to set up
                    liberty in our midst again. What distinction should find more favour with you,
                    what title should you bear more often than that which was the first creation of
                    liberty restored? It is just as democratic to be prince as well as consul as to
                    be consul alone. Take thought too for the feelings of propriety of your
                    colleagues (yes, colleagues; for that is how you refer to them and wish us to do
                    the same); it will be painful for modest men to recall their own </p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL059_507_1"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL059_507_1" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">1</sup>Trajan held the consulate a fourth time
