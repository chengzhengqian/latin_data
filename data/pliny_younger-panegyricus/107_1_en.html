                    and honourable if prompted by general rather than personal injustices, so it is
                    nobler to love the good ones for their services to the human race and not to any
                    particular men. But it has become customary for the consuls, once their official
                    speech of thanks is finished, to go on to express their personal debt to their
                    prince. Allow me then to perform this duty, as much on behalf of my
                    distinguished colleague, Cornutus Tertullus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_535_1" id="target_note_LCL059_535_1"><sup>1</sup></a> as for
                    myself. I should surely speak for us both when my debt of thanks is due as much
                    on his account as on my own, especially when the supreme generosity of the
                    Emperor took note of our intimacy and conferred on us jointly what would have
                    won the gratitude of us both had it been assigned only to one. Both of us had
                    suffered from that robber and assassin of every honest man through the massacre
                    of our friends, as the hot breath of his falling thunderbolt passed close by our
                        heads;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_535_2" id="target_note_LCL059_535_2"><sup>2</sup></a> for we took pride in having the same
                    friends and mourned their loss together, and just as today we share the same
                    hopes and joys, at that time we were one in grief and terror. The divine Nerva
                    had recompensed us for our times of peril in expressing his wish to promote us
                    as being honest citizens, though as yet unknown; for the advancement of those
                    whose only prayer hitherto had been to remain forgotten by the Emperor was a
                    further indication that times had changed.</p>
