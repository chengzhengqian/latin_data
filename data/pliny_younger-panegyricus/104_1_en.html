                    seek Caesar’s affection in person, another when he is away; let both

                    you hold your freedmen in high honour, but as freedmen only, and believe that a

                    know that the chief indication of weakness in a ruler is the power of his
                    freedmen. In the first place, you employ no one unless he was considered and
                    chosen for you or your father or for one of the better emperors; then you train
                    these men daily in such a way that they measure themselves against their own
                    position, not yours: with the result that they prove all the more worthy of our
                    high regard because it is not forced on us.</p>
