                    distinction of your origin—why should the status of those who deserve to
                    have descendants among the nobility be inferior to that of those whose parents
                    were already ennobled? You are indeed well fitted to report on our magistrates
                    in this way on all occasions, and by rewarding the good instead of punishing the
                    bad so make them better men. The country’s youth was fired with
                    inspiration to imitate what it saw winning recognition; none could fail to share
                    this thought, knowing that anything done well by anyone in the provinces was
                    fully known to you. There is profit now and advantage for those with responsible
                    positions in the provinces; they can rest assured that incorruptibility and
                    application on their part can expect the highest reward in the Emperor’s
                    judgement and support. Hitherto, however honest and upright his nature, a
                    man’s views were distorted, or at any rate weakened, by the
                    reflection—lamentable but true—that even if he did well, would
                    Caesar know? And if he knew, would he show it? And so the emperors in their
                    malice or their indifference allowed evil counsels to go unpunished, while
                    promising no rewards to deeds well done; thus they deterred some from seeking
                    distinction but no one from crime. Things are different today. Anyone who has
                    governed a province well is offered the position his merits demand; the field of
                    promotion and fame lies open to all; everyone can set out to achieve his
                    aspirations, and owes his success to his own efforts. The provinces too have
                    been relieved by you of their fears for the future, the danger of malpractices
                    and the need to bring prosecutions; for if they can ad­vance </p></section><notes></notes></section>
