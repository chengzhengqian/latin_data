                    for the third time seated by your side, and a consul-elect, again for the third
                    time, called upon to speak. This was their finest hour, as it was also yours!
                    Tall men, however erect, normally look smaller by the side of those who are
                    taller still; in the same way, your subjects’ highest honours are
                    diminished by comparison with your own exalted state, and the nearer they
                    approach to your eminence, the more they seem to lose of their own. Such men
                    could never be made your equal, however much you wished, but you raised them
                    sufficiently high for them to stand out above the rest as you did above them. If
                    you had singled out one person only for a third consulship during the year you
                    held your own it would have been clear proof of your magnanimity—for if
                    success means the power to do all one wishes, magnanimity is the will to do all
                    one can. In that case there would have been praise for the man who earned his
                    third consulship, but more for the prince under whom he earned it; the winner of
                    such a prize might be great and memorable, but how much greater the one who
                    awarded it! Well: did you not choose two for the honour of a third consulship,
                    two for the sacred privilege of being your colleague? (No one then can doubt
                    that your chief reason for extending your own consulship was to cover not one
                    but both of theirs.) Both had recently held a second consulship, received from

                    having it granted by you; for both, the rods of office so lately laid aside were
                    still before their eyes, and the traditional cries of the lictors heralding
                    their approach still ringing in </p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL059_465_1"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL059_465_1" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">1</sup>Frontinus was consul
