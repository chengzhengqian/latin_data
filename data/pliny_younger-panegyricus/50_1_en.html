                    encourage signs of character and spirit, instead of forcing them into subjection
                    as your predecessors did. People find that honesty pays, now that they are
                    convinced that it does them no harmâ€” indeed, it brings them honours,
                    priesthoods, provinces from your hands, and they flourish in your friendship and
                    favour. This payment for application and integrity spurs on others like them,
                    while encouraging men of different character to mend their ways; for it is the
                    rewards for vice and virtue which make men bad or good. Not many people have a
                    strong enough character to pursue or shun good or evil with no thought of
                    advantage; for the rest, when they see the reward for effort, activity and
                    thrift going to idleness, torpor and extravagance, set about gaining similar
                    advantages by the same devices as they see others use. Their one wish is to
                    resemble such men, be one of them, until their wishing makes them so.</p>

<p>45. Previous emperors, with the exception of your father and one or two more (and
                    that is saying too much), did in fact take more pleasure in the vices of their
                    subjects than in their virtues, first because everyone likes a man after his own
                    heart, then because they supposed that slavery would be more acceptable to
                    people unfitted to be anything but slaves. Such men gathered up all the favours,
                    open-armed; while honest citizens who were forced to bury themselves in
                    retirement were neglected and only saw the light of day at their trials for
                    treason. By contrast, you choose your friends from the best of your subjects,
                    and quite rightly, the affection of a good prince lit on the very men most hated
