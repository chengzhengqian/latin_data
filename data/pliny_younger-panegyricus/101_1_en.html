                    sprung up flattery and adulation, and worse even than hatred, the false
                    semblance of love; while in the Emperors’ palace nothing remained of
                    friendship but the name, now empty and derided.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_523_1" id="target_note_LCL059_523_1"><sup>1</sup></a> For how could
                    friendship survive between men thus divided, the one half feeling themselves the
                    masters, the other half their slaves? It was you, Caesar, who brought her back
                    from exile, to find a home again; you have friends because you know how to be
                    one. Love cannot be demanded of subjects, as other things can; there is no
                    sentiment so lofty and independent, so impatient of tyranny, so uncompromising
                    in its expectations of a return. It is possible for a prince to incur hatred
                    (though perhaps unjustly) from many of his subjects, though he feels none
                    himself; it is not possible for him to win affection unless he shows it too. And
                    so you love as you are loved; all honour to both sides, though the glory is all
                    yours, since it is you who step down from your superior status to carry out all
                    the duties of friendship, descend from being emperor to be a
                    friend—though in fact you are never more emperor than when you fill the
                    role of friend, for a prince needs every kind of friendship to maintain his
                        position,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_523_2" id="target_note_LCL059_523_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and so his first care is to provide
                    himself with friends. May you ever follow this line of conduct, never fail to
                    practise this among your other virtues: and never let yourself be persuaded that
                    a prince demeans himself unless he hates. There is nothing more delightful in
                    human affairs than to inspire love, unless it is to feel it, and you can enjoy
                    both, seeing that the warmth of your own affection kindles even more in your
                    friends.
