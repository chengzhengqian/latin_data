<p>43. In the same category must be placed the new security for wills. No longer can
                    a single heir inherit all, sometimes under the pretext that his name is there in
                    writing, sometimes that it is not.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_417_1" id="target_note_LCL059_417_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Your own name
                    is not invoked to support forged and unjust documents, nor can anyone make you
                    the excuse for his anger, folly, or neglect of duty. You are not named as heir
                    because someone else has given offence, but on your own merits, set down by your
                    personal friends and passed over by strangers. The only difference in fact
                    between your former private life and your present supreme position lies in the
                    greater number of those who love you, as your own affections are more widely
                    spread. Only continue on this course, Caesar, and experience will show whether
                    the reputation and the purse alike of a prince are not better enriched when his
                    subjects make him their heir at their death from choice rather than from
                    compulsion. Your father was generous with his gifts, and you have been equally
                    generous. If someone dies now without showing gratitude, still he leaves heirs
                    to his property, and nothing comes to you but an increase in reputation: for
                    generosity may be more fortunate when it receives recognition, but is more
                    glorious when it does not. Yet who before you chose this distinction in
                    preference to additional wealth? How many emperors refused (like you) to
                    consider as theirs even that portion of our patrimony which originally came from
                    them? Is it not true to say that the gifts of emperors like those of kings used
                    to resemble baited hooks or hidden snares, so that </p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL059_417_1"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL059_417_1" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">1</sup>Cf.
