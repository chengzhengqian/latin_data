                    posterity both in the general interest and to do honour to us all; firstly, so
                    that the world could be summoned as an active witness to our loyalty, secondly
                    to demonstrate that we were not afraid to pass judgement on good and bad rulers
                    even in their lifetime, finally to give proof that though previously we were not
                    ungrateful, we were unhappy so long as we were denied the opportunity of making
                    our gratitude known. Now we are all eagerness and determination, clamouring for
                    you not to set limits to our feelings or your own merits, in a word, to remember
                    the example you owe to posterity! Let future princes too learn to distinguish
                    between true acclamation and false, and owe it to you that they can no longer be
                    deceived. The road to good repute need not be made for them, they have only to
                    follow it; they have not to clear their path of adulation, only to guard against
                    its return. There is no uncertainty about how they must act nor how their
                    actions will be received. What then can I add, in the name of the Senate, to the
                    prayers I shared with the whole Senate, except this? May your heart never lose
                    the joy which showed in your eyes on that occasion, may you always think of that
                    day with affection, and yet go on to greater things, to win fresh rewards and
                    hear new acclamation; for the same words can only be repeated about the same
                    deeds.</p>
