<p>89. What happiness you must feel today, divine Nerva, on beholding him whom you
                    judged the best candidate for your choice proving that he is best, and being
                    addressed as such! What joy for you to stand second in comparison with your son!
                    There can be no better indication of your greatness of soul than the fact that
                    though so good yourself you did not hesitate to choose a better man. You also,
                    father Trajan (for you too, though not raised to the stars, must surely occupy

                    determine where the greater glory must be assigned—to his begetter or to
                    the one who made him his choice. All honour to you both for the immense service
                    you have done your country and the great benefit you have conferred on it.
                    Though it was your son’s merits which brought one of you triumphal

<p>90. I am well aware, Conscript Fathers, that the consuls should feel a sense of
                    obligation (in their public rather than their private capacity) which goes
