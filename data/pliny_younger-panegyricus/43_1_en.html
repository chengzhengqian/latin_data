                    needed while leaving to his son free and ample opportunity for doing good.
                    Accordingly, without delay, your generosity built on his foundations by
                    extending the immunity enjoyed by a son in regard to his father’s
                    property to a father on inheriting his son’s, so that the loss of his
                    status of fatherhood should not end its privileges. It was nobly done, Caesar,
                    to refuse to tax a father’s tears—a father should take possession
                    of his son’s property without forfeiture, and not have to share his
                    inheritance with those who cannot share his grief. No one should demand accounts
                    from one suffering from the recent shock of bereavement, nor compel a father to
                    estimate what he has been left by his own son. And I can emphasize the
                    generosity of our prince’s gift, Conscript Fathers, by pointing out that
                    it was thoughtfully planned; for without thought there is no true generosity,
                    only extravagance, ostentation, and the desire to please. It was, then, an act
                    worthy of your clemency to soften the pangs of bereavement and not to permit
                    further sorrows to add to the grief of losing a son. It is grief enough already
                    for a father to outlive his son as his sole heir; what if he has to share the
                    inheritance with another not of his son’s choosing? Besides, when the
                    divine Nerva decreed that children should be exempt from the five per cent tax
                    on their father’s property it was only logical that the immunity should
                    be extended to fathers with regard to the property of their children. Why should
                    the younger generation be held in higher honour than the older one? And why
                    should justice not equally apply to old and young </p></section><notes></notes></section>
