                    hand, if he gives and then takes away, supports and then destroys, all too soon
                    he will make men regret they had children, regret even that they had parents and
                    are alive themselves. And so nothing in your generosity commands my admiration
                    so much as the fact that these donations and allowances are paid from your own
                    purse, so that the nation’s children are not fed like wild beasts’
                    cubs on blood and slaughter; and what is most welcome to the recipient is his
                    knowledge that no one has been robbed to provide for him, that there is one
                    alone who is the poorer for so many thus enriched—his prince. And perhaps
                    not even he—for anyone with a share in a common wealth is as rich or as
                    poor as the whole.</p>

<p>28. Your many claims for recognition beckon me elsewhere—but no; I have
                    not paid admiring homage to the fact that you poured out these generous sums in
                    no consciousness of crime committed, no desire to avert notoriety’s
                    pursuit, nor to provide more cheerful topics to divert grim suspicions from
                    men’s tongues. No fault in you had to be redeemed by your donation, no
                    act of cruelty bought off by allowances; your benefactions were not inspired by
                    hope of impunity for your misdeeds. By this expenditure you sought the
                    affection, not the forgiveness of your subjects; the people of Rome heard no
                    entreaties at the tribunal, but stepped down conscious only of their debt to
                    you. For your donation was gladly offered and as gladly received, without
                    apprehension on either side; what your predecessors had thrown as a sop to the
                    surging anger of the populace, to appease the general hatred of
                    them­selves, </p></section><notes></notes></section>
