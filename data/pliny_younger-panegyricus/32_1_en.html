                    people, as innocent in your giving as they were in receiving. Nearly five
                    thousand free-born children, Conscript Fathers, were sought out and found, to be
                    entered on the lists through the generosity of their prince, to safeguard the
                    state in war and adorn it in peace, supported by their country while they learn
                    to love her not only as their homeland but as a nurse. The army and citizen body
                    will be completed by their numbers, and they will have children one day whom
                    they will support themselves without any need of allowances. Let the gods only
                    grant you, Caesar, the long life which you deserve and preserve the spirit you
                    owe to them, and the lists of children entered at your bidding will ever
                    multiply! These grow increasingly day by day, not so much because parents care
                    more for children, as because every citizen is cared for by his prince. Go on
                    with subsidies and allowances if it is your wish; but the true reason for these
                    births lies in yourself.</p>

                    Pompey such great honour, though he swept bribery from elections, rid the high

                    himself no finer citizen than our Father, who in his wisdom and authority and
                    devotion to his people has opened roads, built harbours, created routes
                    overland, let the sea into the shore and moved the shore out to sea,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_385_2a" id="target_note_LCL059_385_2a"><sup>2</sup></a>
