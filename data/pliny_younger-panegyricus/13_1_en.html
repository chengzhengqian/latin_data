                    decision were not Nerva’s alone, but the heart-felt prayer of the whole
                    country. He did no more than exercise his prerogative as Leader of the State,
                    and anticipate what everyone would have liked to do, nor would his action have
                    been so universally popular if it had not been previously approved. Power and
                    advancement were yours, but heaven may bear witness to the moderate use you made
                    of them. Inscriptions, portraits<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_347_1" id="target_note_LCL059_347_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and the

                    your self-effacement, activity and vigilance you were soldier, officer and
                    commander in the field; striding ahead of the standards and eagles which were
                    now your own you claimed no benefit from your adoption but the right to show the
                    obedience and devotion of a son, and sought long life and lasting glory only for
                    the name you now bore. The gods in their wisdom had already raised you to the
                    supreme position, but your desire was still to take the second place and grow
                    old there; you felt yourself to be no more than a simple citizen as long as
                    another emperor reigned with you. Your prayers were heard, but only so long as
                    this served the interests of that august and venerable ruler; for the gods
                    claimed him to take his place in the heavens, thinking that nothing merely
                    mortal should follow his godlike and immortal act and that the honour proper to
                    a noble deed was for this deed to be the last of its author, who should then be
                    deified at once so that one day posterity might wonder whether he was already
                    god when his last deed was done. Thus his highest claim to be the Father of his
                    country was his being father to you; and this was his greatest </p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL059_347_1"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL059_347_1" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">1</sup>The medallions showing the
