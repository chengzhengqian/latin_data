<p>2. It is my view that not only the consul but every citizen alike should
                    endeavour to say nothing about our ruler which could have been said of any of
                    his predecessors. Away, then, with expressions formerly prompted by fear: I will
                    have none of them. The sufferings of the past are over: let us then have done
                    with the words which belong to them. An open tribute to our Emperor demands a
                    new form, now that the wording of our private talk has changed. Times are
                    different, and our speeches must show this; from the very nature of our thanks
                    both the recipient and the occasion must be made clear to all. Nowhere should we
                    flatter him as a divinity and a god;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_325_1a" id="target_note_LCL059_325_1a"><sup>1</sup></a> we are
                    talking of a fellow-citizen, not a tyrant, one who is our father not our
                    over-lord. He is one of usâ€”and his special virtue lies in his thinking
                    so, as also in his never forgetting that he is a man himself while a ruler of
                    men. Let us then appreciate our good fortune and prove our worth by our use of
                    it, -and at the same time remember that there can be no merit if greater
                    deference is paid to rulers who delight in the servitude of their subjects than
                    to those who value their liberty. The
