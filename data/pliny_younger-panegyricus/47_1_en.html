                    insinuating counsel of every kind, and especially that of avarice. It dries up
                    and falls silent, for where there is no one to hear advice, soon there is none
                    to proffer it. Consequently we are deeply in your debt, and doubly so—for
                    your own character, and even more for the improvement it has made in our
                    own.</p>

                    high treason, the unique and only way of incriminating men who had committed no
                    crime. You completely removed our dread of this, content to show the nobility
                    which none had lacked so much as those who used to pretend to majesty. Loyalty
                    is restored among friends, a sense of duty to freedmen and obedience to
                    slaves— who can now respect and obey and keep their masters. Henceforth
                    it is we who are the Emperor’s friends, not our slaves, and the Father of
                    our country puts his own subjects’ affection above that of persons held
                    in bondage to other men. You have freed us all from the accuser in our homes,
                    and by raising the standard of public safety have effectively suppressed what
                    might be called a servile war—thereby doing a service to slaves by making
                    them better men as well as to their masters in ridding us of our fears. You seek
                    no praise for this, and perhaps it should not be offered, but how welcome it is
                    for those of us who remember that emperor who suborned slaves against the very
                    lives of their masters<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_415_2" id="target_note_LCL059_415_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and told them the charges he proposed to
                    punish before their information was laid—an evil as fearful as it was
                    unavoidable,
