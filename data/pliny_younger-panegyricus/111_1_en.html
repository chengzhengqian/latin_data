<p>94. To end my speech, I call on the gods, the guardians and defenders of our
                    empire, speaking as consul on behalf of all humanity: and to you in particular,
                    Capitoline Jupiter, I address my prayer that you shall continue your benefits,
                    and augment the great gifts you have bestowed by making them perpetual. You
                    heard our prayers under a bad prince; now give ear to our wishes on behalf of
                    his opposite. We are not burdening you with vows—we do not pray for
                    peace, concord, and serenity, nor for wealth and honours: our desire is simple,
                    all-embracing, and unanimous: the safety of our prince.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_543_1" id="target_note_LCL059_543_1"><sup>1</sup></a> This is no
                    new concern we ask of you, for it was you who took him under your protection
                    when you snatched him from the jaws of that monster of rapacity; for at the time
                    when all the peaks were tottering to their fall, no one could have stood high
                    above them all and remained untouched except by your intervention. So he escaped
                    the notice of the worst of emperors, though he could not remain unnoticed by the
                    best. It was you too who gave him clear signs of your interest as he set out to
                    join his army,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_543_2" id="target_note_LCL059_543_2"><sup>2</sup></a> when you yielded to him your own name
                    and glory; and you who spoke your opinion through the voice of the Emperor, when
                    you chose a son for him, a father for us, a Chief Pontiff for yourself. It is
                    therefore with increased confidence, using the same form of vow that he asked to
                    be made on his behalf, that I make
