                    occupy them. Such is our prince’s goodness of heart, such the security of
                    our times, that he believes us worthy of princely possessions and we have no
                    fears about seeming so. Nor do you give your subjects the opportunity only to
                    purchase—you have bestowed on us as a gift some of the loveliest
                    properties, making over to us the very inheritance for which you were chosen and
                    adopted, which was made yours by a reasoned decision; for you hold that
                    ownership is best enjoyed through the persons of your friends.</p>

                    they did at the passage of huge blocks of stone; our houses stand safe and
                    secure, and the temples are no longer threatened with collapse. There is enough,
                    and more, for you, although your predecessor was so careful in his expenditure,
                    and it is splendid too to have cut down and retrenched even on what he thought
                    was necessary; especially as in his case he was denying himself personal
                    enjoyment of what the hazards of empire had brought him, whereas your
                    self-denial is applied to what came from him. But when it comes to public
                    building, you do it on the grand scale. Here stands a colonnade, there a shrine,
                    rising as if by magic, so rapidly as to seem remodelled rather than fresh-built.
