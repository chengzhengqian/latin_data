<p>21. Although your many outstanding merits surely called for you to assume some
                    new title and honour, you refused the title of Father of your country,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_369_2" id="target_note_LCL059_369_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and it was only after a prolonged struggle between us and your
                    modesty that in the end you were persuaded. Others<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_369_3" id="target_note_LCL059_369_3"><sup>3</sup></a> accepted that
                    title from the start along with that of Emperor and Caesar, on the first day of
                    their principate, but you waved it away until even in your own grudging estimate
                    of your services, you had to admit it was your due. Thus you alone have been
                    Father of the country in fact before you were in name. In our hearts, in our
                    minds we knew you as this; the title made no difference to the devotion of your
                    people, except for our feeling of ingratitude if we addressed you only as
                    Emperor and Caesar when we felt we had a Father in you. And now that you bear
                    the name, how kind and considerate you show yourself, living with your subjects
                    as a father with his children! You left us as an ordinary citizen, you return as
                    emperor, knowing your subjects as you are known to them; in your thoughts we
                    have not changed, nor in ours have you; you are one among us all, the greatest
                    of us simply because you are the best.</p>
