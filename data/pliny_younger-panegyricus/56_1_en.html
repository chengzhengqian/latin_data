                    table open to all, the repast and its pleasures are there for us to share, while
                    you encourage our conversation and join in it. As for the length of your
                    banquets, polite manners prolong what frugality<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_433_1" id="target_note_LCL059_433_1"><sup>1</sup></a> might cut
                    short. You do not arrive already gorged with a solitary feast before midday, to
                    sit menacingly over your guests, watching and marking all they do, nor when they
                    are fasting and hungry do you belch from a full stomach and present or rather
                    throw at them the food you disdain to touch, and after a pretence at enduring
                    this insulting mockery of a banquet take yourself back to secret gluttony and
                    private excesses. And so it is not the plate of gold and silver, nor the
                    ingenuity of the dishes served which command our admiration so much as your own
                    courtesy and charm, of which we can never have too much, for all is genuine and
                    sincere and conducted with true dignity. The Emperor has rid his tables of the
                    ministrants of an oriental superstition<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_433_2a" id="target_note_LCL059_433_2a"><sup>2</sup></a> and the
                    indecent antics of impudent buffoons; in their place is warm hospitality, love
                    of culture and civilized wit. Then afterwards your sleep is short and sparing,
                    for in your love of us there is no period of your time so short as that you
                    spend alone.</p>
