                    people, and to take action. All your predecessors had said the same, but none
                    had been believed. In our mind’s eye were the shipwrecks of the many who
                    had advanced in a hazardous period of calm, only to be sunk by an unforeseen
                    storm; for no sea could be more treacherous than the flattery of those emperors
                    whose instability and guile made it more difficult to be on guard against their
                    favour than their wrath. But in your case, we have no fears, and are all
                    eagerness to follow your lead. You bid us be free, and we shall be free; you
                    tell us to express ourselves openly, and we shall do so, for our previous
                    hesitation was due to no cowardice or natural inertia, but to fear and
                    apprehension, and the lamentable caution born of our perils which bade us turn
                    eyes and ears and minds from our country, from that republic which was utterly
                    destroyed. Today we can place our trust and reliance on your promises and sworn
                    oath, and open our lips long sealed by servitude, loosen our tongues which were
                    bound to silence by so many evils; for you truly wish us to be what you bid us,
                    and your exhortations are free from all overtones of deception. In short, no
                    traps are laid today for the trustful, bringing their own dangers for those who
                    set them—for no prince has ever been deceived unless he led the way in
                    deception.</p>
