<p>79. Perhaps in your own eyes a third consulship is enough, but this is all the
                    more reason for its not sufficing our demands. It only formed the habit in us of
                    wanting to see you consul again and again. We might be less pressing if we had
                    yet to learn what sort of consul you would be; refusal of a chance to test you
                    would be more easily accepted than the denial of continuing with you whom we
                    know. Shall we be permitted to see him as consul once again? Will he hear and
                    repeat the formula of yesterday, and give us pleasure equal to his own? Will he
                    preside over our public rejoicing, as its author and its object, attempt (as is
                    his wont) to check our outbursts of enthusiasm—and fail to do so? The
                    Senate’s loyal devotion will match itself against the prince’s
                    moderation in a splendid struggle, happy in its outcome whether it triumphs or
                    not. For my part, I anticipate some form of happiness as yet unknown and even
                    greater than before, for no one is so unimaginative as not to hope for a consul
                    to prove all the better for repeated experience. Another man, though he did not
                    abandon himself to the delights of idleness, would at least have sought relief
                    from continuous service by an interval of peaceful retirement; but he rid
                    himself of a consul’s cares only to resume those of empire, so balancing
                    his responsibilities that as prince he never sought to be consul, nor as consul
