<p>20. But now your people’s prayers were calling you home; affection for
                    your country heard them, and love of army life had to stand aside. Your journey
                    was quiet and undemanding, truly that of one returning from a settled peace. It
                    is not for me to call it a virtue in you if neither father nor husband dreaded
                    your approach; others have made a point of cultivating moral purity, but in you
                    it is natural and inborn, and not something to be counted to your credit.
                    Carriages were requisitioned without fuss, no difficulties were raised over
                    lodgings, rations were the same for all, and your staff was alert and
                    disciplined. It might have been some great general, most likely yourself,
                    travelling to join his army,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_367_1" id="target_note_LCL059_367_1"><sup>1</sup></a> for there was no difference, or
                    practically none, between the high authority you held then and what it was to
                    be. It was not long since another Emperor had passed that way<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_367_2" id="target_note_LCL059_367_2"><sup>2</sup></a> in very
                    different fashion, and his progress was better called a plundering foray, when
                    houses were forcibly emptied to provide lodgings, and right and left the land
                    was burnt and trampled as if struck by some disaster or the very barbarian
                    hordes from whom he fled. The provinces had to be convinced it was only
                    Domitian, and not every emperor who travelled in this fashion, and so you
                    published a statement contrasting his expenditure with your own. Here your chief
                    concern was the public interest and not your reputation, for an emperor must
