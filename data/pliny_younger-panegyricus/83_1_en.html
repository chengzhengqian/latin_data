                    follow, no easier for a candidate than for a prince! Where is the candidate who
                    can show greater respect for the Senate for a single day than you have done
                    throughout your life, and particularly on the day when the candidates were
                    subject to your decision? What else was it but respect for the Senate which made
                    you offer young men of noble birth the position which was their family right,
                    but earlier than it was due? So at long last the light of the nobility<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_487_1" id="target_note_LCL059_487_1"><sup>1</sup></a> is not dimmed by Caesar but made to shine more brightly; at
                    last the grandsons of great men, the descendants of liberty, need not tremble in
                    fear before the Emperor; instead, he exalts and honours them by early
                    distinctions, and restores them to their ancestral glory. Any remnant of an
                    ancient house, any lingering spark of former splendour he revives and cherishes
                    and promotes to the service of the State. The great names are held in honour
                    among men; they are on the lips of fame, brought back from the shades of
                    oblivion by the graciousness of Caesar, whose intention is not only to preserve
                    our noble families but to create them.</p>
