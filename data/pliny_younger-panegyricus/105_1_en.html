                    Would it have been better to call him “Fortunate”? This is a
                    tribute to his luck, not his character. What about “the
                        Great”?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_531_1" id="target_note_LCL059_531_1"><sup>1</sup></a> This has a ring of envy rather than
                    renown. In adopting you, the best of emperors gave you his own name, to which
                    the Senate added that of <span class="italic">Optimus,</span> to be as much your
                    personal name as the one your father gave. Thus you are as clearly designated
                    and defined by the name of <span class="italic">Optimus</span> as by that of Trajan;
                    just as formerly the house of Piso was known for frugality,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_531_2" id="target_note_LCL059_531_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and
                    those of Laelius and Metellus for wisdom and filial piety.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_531_3" id="target_note_LCL059_531_3"><sup>3</sup></a> All these
                    virtues are contained in the single name which is yours, for “the
                    Best” can only refer to the man who outstrips all others who are best in
                    their own distinctive ways. And so it was only proper to place this at the end
                    of your other titles,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_531_4" id="target_note_LCL059_531_4"><sup>4</sup></a> as being the greater one, for it means
                    less to be Emperor and Caesar and Augustus than to be better than all those who
                    have borne those titles before you. For the same reason, the Father of gods and
                    men is worshipped under the title <span class="italic">Optimus</span> followed by <span class="italic">Maximus,</span> Best and Highest, and the more honour is due to
                    you, who in the eyes of all are equally Highest and Best. You have won a title
                    which cannot pass to another without seeming borrowed, in the case of a good
                    prince, and false, in the case of a bad one; and though all in future may claim
                    it, it will always be recognized as yours. Just as the
