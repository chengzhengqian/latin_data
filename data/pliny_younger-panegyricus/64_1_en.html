                    silence and overcomes your hesitation, what honours shall we decree and you be
                    glad to accept! Then it will be made plain that it was not pride and contempt
                    which made you refuse the highest honours while accepting lesser ones, for this,
                    Caesar, was nobler on your part than to refuse all: to refuse all would be
                    merely courting favour, while it is true modesty to choose the lowest. The same
                    spirit of moderation marks your relations with us, and with the treasury; we
                    need not feel that our motives are suspect, and the treasury has a limit set to
                    its expenditure, since you are not minded to replenish it (if emptied) from the
                    wealth of innocent men. And so statues are put up for you as they were for
                    individuals in times past for their outstanding services to the State;
                    Caesar’s portrait is there for all to see, fashioned from the same bronze
                    as that of a Brutus or a Camillus, and for the same reason<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_449_1a" id="target_note_LCL059_449_1a"><sup>1</sup></a>—for
                    they expelled the tyrant kings and conquering foe from the walls of Rome, while
                    Caesar sweeps tyranny away, banishes all that captivity has bred, and makes sure
                    that the imperial seat he holds shall never be a tyrant’s throne. And
                    knowing your wisdom as I do, I find it less remarkable that you set aside or
                    limit those titles which are mortal and must perish; for you know where lies the
                    true, eternal glory of a prince. Therein are the honours over which devouring
                    flames, passage of time, the hands of a successor have no power. Arches and
                    statues, even altars and temples must all decay, to
