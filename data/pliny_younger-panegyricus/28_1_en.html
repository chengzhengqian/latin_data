<p>25. I am not afraid of seeming long-winded, Conscript Fathers, since nothing is
                    more desirable than that we should have much to offer thanks for to our prince.
                    And rather than run quickly through a selection of his merits, we should show
                    more respect if we left everything unspoken and implicit in our hearts: for what
                    is left untouched is more likely to be judged at its true worth. Nevertheless, I
                    should like to say a word about his gifts to enrich the urban population,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_377_1a" id="target_note_LCL059_377_1a"><sup>1</sup></a> the largess distributed to civilians in its entirety, whereas
                    the military received only half of their bonus.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_377_2" id="target_note_LCL059_377_2"><sup>2</sup></a> This is sure
                    indication of no ordinary spirit—to make a donation to those who could
                    more easily have been refused— though in spite of this distinction, the
                    rule of parity was not neglected, and the army was put on the same footing as
                    the civilians in that it received its half-donation first, while the people who
                    had the whole at once took second place. How generous

                        number of 200,000 recipients; names could be added only when there were
                        vacancies (cf. 25. 3). Trajan added 5,000 children to the list (28. 4). (2)

                        years gave 3 <span class="italic">congiaria</span> of 225 denarii a head.
                        Nerva’s lavish donations look like bribery, and Trajan paid out 650
                        denarii a head, a vast sum. See Syme, <span class="italic">JRS</span> XX. Note
                        that Pliny says nothing about the alimentary system instituted by Nerva and
                        revised by Trajan in 101 (S. 435-6, the “Veleian Table”);
                        perhaps this was still being reorganized when the speech was
                        delivered.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL059_377_1a').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL059_377_2"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL059_377_2" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">2</sup>The <span class="italic">donativum</span> to each soldier, paid in cash.
