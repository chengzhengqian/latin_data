                    is only right that we should be able one day to trust the evidence of our own
                    eyes and our own judgement, and not always have to rely on your reputation and
                    reports. How long are we to rejoice in your existence without ever having you in
                    our midst? Let us see whether that second consulship of yours has not really
                    made you give yourself airs! A year’s interval can make a big difference
                    in a man’s character, and even more in a prince’s. We are told
                    that possession of one virtue means possession of all,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_461_1" id="target_note_LCL059_461_1"><sup>1</sup></a> but all the
                    same we want to know whether a good consul and a good prince are still one and
                    the same today. For apart from the general difficulty of exercising two kinds of
                    supreme power at the same time, there is a certain contradiction between them:
                    for a prince should resemble as much and a consul as little as possible an
                    ordinary citizen.</p>

<p>60. I do of course realize that your chief reason last year for refusing the
                    consulship was the impossibility of holding it in absence.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_461_2" id="target_note_LCL059_461_2"><sup>2</sup></a> But now that
                    you are restored to Rome in answer to our prayers, how else can you give better
                    proof to us of those great qualities in you which we missed when you were away?
                    It is not enough for you to enter the House if you do not bid us assemble; you
                    should not be present at our meetings without presiding, nor listen to speeches
                    unless you call on the speakers. Would you restore its former majesty to the
                    consuls’ tribunal, once so much revered? Then mount it. Do you want to
                    strengthen respect for the magistrates, spread restraint among litigants, and
                    confirm the authority of the law? Then let men come before you. Rest assured
