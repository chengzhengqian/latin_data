<p>17. Already I seem to see before me a triumph<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_363_1" id="target_note_LCL059_363_1"><sup>1</sup></a> piled high
                    not with the spoils of plundered provinces and gold wrung from our allies, but
                    with our enemies’ arms and the chains of captured kings. I can recognise
                    the high-sounding titles of chieftains whose persons are not unworthy of such
                    names, and watch the wagons pass with their loads to show the fearful ventures
                    of the savage foe, each prisoner following, hands bound, the scene of his own
                        deeds;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_363_2" id="target_note_LCL059_363_2"><sup>2</sup></a> then, close behind the conquered nations
                    your own self standing high in your chariot, before which are the shields
                    pierced by your own hand. The spoils of supreme honour would be yours if any
                    king would dare to match himself against you, shuddering with terror though the
                    whole field of battle and army might lie between, when confronted not only by
                    your weapons but by a glance from your threatening eye. And your recent
                    moderation has ensured that whenever you are compelled to war, offensive or
                    defensive, for the honour of your realm, you will be known to win triumph
                    through victory, not to seek victory in order to triumph.</p>

<p>18. How wonderful it was of you (for one idea suggests another) to rekindle the
                    dying flame of military discipline by destroying the indifference, insolence and
                    contempt for obedience, those evils of the preceding regime!<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_363_3" id="target_note_LCL059_363_3"><sup>3</sup></a> Today
                    it is safe to earn respect and affection, and no one in command need fear to be
                    unpopular—or popular—with his men. Thus freed from the anxiety
                    alike of incurring favour or giving offence, he can press on with constructive
