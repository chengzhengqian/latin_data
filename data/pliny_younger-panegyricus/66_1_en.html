                    moderation, but how much more is still unsaid! For example: you accepted a
                    second consulship because an emperor, your father, bestowed it; but later on,
                    when the gods placed supreme authority in your hands, that power to direct your
                    own future as well as everything else, you refused the consulate a third time,
                    although you could have assumed its duties so well.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_453_2" id="target_note_LCL059_453_2"><sup>2</sup></a> It is noble
                    to postpone a distinction, nobler still to put aside the glory it would bring
                    you. Which commands my admiration more—the consulship you refused or the
                    one you held? and held not in the tranquil atmosphere of the city deep in the
                    embrace of peace, but in the face of savage tribes, like those heroes of old who
                    changed the toga of office for a soldier’s cloak and carried victory to
                    lands unknown. It brought honour for the empire and distinction to you, when
                    friends and allies sought audience in their own countries, their native lands;
                    it was a splendid sight after so many years to see green turf piled high for a
                    consul’s tribunal, with the soldiers’ javelins and standards for a
                    guard of honour alongside the rods of office, and you presiding in person, your
                    majesty enhanced by contrast with the varied garb of your petitioners and their
                    discordant voices, their speeches seldom dispensing with an interpreter. If it
                    is noble to administer justice to fellow-citizens, what is it to enemies! The
                    splendour of occupying a curule chair in the assured peace of the forum pales
                    beside the glory of setting it up in vast open spaces in the conqueror’s
                    wake, with calm and security acting as a threat to hostile river-banks; the
                    glory too of scorn­ing </p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL059_453_1"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL059_453_1" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">1</sup>Probably Pliny means the period from 28 January 98 when Trajan
