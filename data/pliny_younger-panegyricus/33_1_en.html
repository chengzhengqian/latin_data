                    that natural products in any place now seem to belong to all. It is plain to see
                    that every year can abundantly supply our needs—and without harm to
                    anyone. Harvests are not snatched as if from enemy soil to perish in our
                    granaries, carried off from allies who lament in vain; instead, these bring of
                    their own accord the produce of their soil, the year’s harvest nurtured
                    by their climate; unburdened by fresh impositions<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_387_1" id="target_note_LCL059_387_1"><sup>1</sup></a> they can meet
                    long-standing obligations, and the imperial exchequer pays openly for its
                    purchases. Hence these provisions and the corn-supply, with prices agreed
                    between buyer and seller; hence, without causing starvation elsewhere, we have
                    plenty here in Rome.</p>

                    rain and weather to nurture and mature the seeds in her soil; watered as she
                    always was by her own river and accustomed to a fertility dependent only on the
                    water flowing through her, she was clad in crops so rich that she could rival
                    the most fertile lands with never a thought that this could cease. Then she was
                    struck by sudden disaster, dried and burnt up, left well-nigh barren, when the
                    Nile turned lazy, sluggish and reluctant to stir out of its bed, so that though
                    still one of the world’s great rivers it could not now be thought
                    incomparable. Thus a great area of land which used to be flooded and refreshed
                    by the river became a scorching furnace of thick dust. All in vain the native
                    Egyptian prayed for rain-clouds and watched the heavens, now that the author of
