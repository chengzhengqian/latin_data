                    thanks, they will not be compelled to lodge complaints against anyone, and
                    besides, they know now that nothing helps a candidate for future honours better
                    than the ones he has already held. It is an excellent thing for office to be
                    sought through office, and honour as a result of honour already bestowed. For my
                    part, I should like to see a provincial governor citing not only the
                    recommendations of his friends and the support on his behalf he has coaxed out
                    of city factions, but also the civic resolutions of the Roman townships and
                    cities where he has served.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_491_1" id="target_note_LCL059_491_1"><sup>1</sup></a> It is good that cities, peoples and
                    nations play their part in casting votes for the men they knew as governors, and
                    the most effective way of petitioning on behalf of a candidate is to express
                    your gratitude to him in thanks.</p>

<p>71. Again, with what applause and delight the Senate acclaimed you, when you
                    embraced each candidate as you named him,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_491_2" id="target_note_LCL059_491_2"><sup>2</sup></a> stepping down
                    to our level as if your intention was to join in our congratulations! Which am I
                    to do—admire you, or blame those who made your behaviour exceptional by
                    contrast with their own: when they sat as if rooted to their chairs of office,
                    offering only a hand so slowly and reluctantly, and apparently seeing merit in
                    doing no more than that? Our eyes have been fortunate to behold the old-style
                    form of ceremony, the prince as equal with the candidates, to see him standing
                    with them, conferring honour and yet standing no higher than those who received
                    it from him; so that with sincere admiration the entire Senate acclaimed you as
                    the more noble and revered. </p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL059_491_1"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL059_491_1" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">1</sup>Contrast the views of
