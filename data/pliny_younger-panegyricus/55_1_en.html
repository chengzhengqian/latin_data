                    Vengeance pushed aside his guards, broke through and burst in by the narrow
                    passages and their barriers, as if the doors stood open and thresholds called

                    those secret chambers, those cruel haunts whither he was driven by his fear and
                    pride and hatred of mankind. How much safer is that same dwelling today, and how
                    much happier, now that its master finds protection in popularity instead of
                    cruelty, and seeks the thronging crowds of his subjects instead of solitude
                    behind locked doors! What is the lesson for us? Experience shows that the one
                    guard which a prince can wholly trust is his own innocence. The sole citadel
