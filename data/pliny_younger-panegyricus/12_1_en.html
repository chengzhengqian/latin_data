                    as a soldier and obey. Yes, Caesar, you obeyed, and it was your obedience which
                    raised you to the principate; nothing is better proof of your sense of
                    discipline than the fact that you started your reign with these splendid titles
                    of <span class="italic">Caesar, Imperator,</span> and <span class="italic">Germanicus</span> granted you when you were far from Rome and unaware of your
                    future, yet still in your own heart remained a loyal subject. I should be
                    thought to exaggerate if I said that you did not know you would be emperor; in
                    fact, you <span class="italic">were</span> emperor, but did not know it. And when the
                    news came of your good fortune, you would have preferred, I think, to remain as
                    you had been; but you were not free to decide. You were subject, legate and son:
                    your duty lay in obedience to your ruler, your general and your father; else
                    where would military discipline be, and the tradition of centuries of accepting
                    readily, without question, whatever charges your general imposed? He could have
                    assigned you province after province, sent you on campaign after campaign, for
                    clearly he was exercising the same authority in recalling you to assume the
                    imperial power as he did when he sent you out to command your army. An order is
                    an order, whether it means a departure as legate or a return as prince, though
                    there may be greater glory in obedience where the desire to obey is less.</p>

<p>10. This order was the more authoritative for you simply because authority was in
                    grave peril; you thought that obedience was all the more necessary from you
                    since it was lacking in others. Furthermore, you were told that the Senate and
