                    can improve no more on his supreme position, the only way he can rise still
                    higher is by stepping down, confident in his greatness. (There is nothing the
                    fortune of princes has less to fear than the risk of being brought too low.) For
                    me, even your courtesy seemed less remarkable than your anxiety to make it felt.
                    In adapting your expression, your voice and gestures to your words, as if this
                    was some commission you had to entrust to another, you ran through the whole
                    gamut of politeness. Similarly, when the names of the sponsors were received
                    with the usual cries of acclamation, your voice could be heard among them; from
                    Caesar’s lips was heard the Senate’s assent, and the tribute we
                    were happy to pay to merit in the Emperor’s presence was voiced by him
                    with us. Thus by hailing these men as the best choice, you made them so; nor was
                    it only their life which won your approval, but also the judgement of the
                    Senate: which rejoiced to find itself honoured no less than those who received
                    your praise.</p>

<p>72. Next, you offered prayers to the gods, that the elections, thus duly
                    performed, should bring success and happiness to us, to the State, and to
                    yourself. Should we not rather reverse this order, and beg the gods to grant
                    that all your actions, present and future, prove successful for yourself, for
                    the State, and for us, or, to shorten our prayers, for yourself alone, on whom
                    the State and ourselves alike depend? There was a time (which lasted all too
                    long) when the Emperor’s successes and misfortunes did not coincide with
                    ours; but now we share with you both joys and sorrows, and we cannot be happy
                    without you </p></section><notes></notes></section>
