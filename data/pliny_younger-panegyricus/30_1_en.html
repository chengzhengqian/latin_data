                    right, Caesar, to cherish at your expense the future of the name of Rome. No
                    expenditure is so worthy of a great prince destined for immortality as what is

                    cherishes them with loving care, he hastens the downfall of empire and realm; if

                    rang in your ears—the first you heard of your youngest subjects, on whom

<p>27. Above all, you are a prince whose reign makes it both pleasure and profit to
                    rear children. No father now need fear more for his son than the hazards of
                    human frailty—among fatal illnesses he need not count his
                    emperor’s wrath. There is indeed great encouragement to have children in
                    the promise of allowances and donations, but greater still when there is hope of
                    security and freedom from fear. It may be that a ruler gives nothing, supports
                    no one, but so long as he neither takes nor destroys he will </p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL059_381_1"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL059_381_1" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">1</sup>By the <span class="italic">Lex
