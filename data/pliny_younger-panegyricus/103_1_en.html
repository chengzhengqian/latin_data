                    Of your generosity I say nothing. No services could approach princely solicitude
                    and endurance like yours, which merited some recognition on his side that his
                    determination came too near obstinacy. No doubt he debated in his heart whether
                    to swing round his helm, and would have done so, if there were not more joy and
                    happiness than even what a prince’s intimacy can bring, in missing him in
                    absence with the knowledge that he feels the same. And so he enjoys both the
                    high reward of having accepted office and the greater honour which came to him
                    from laying it down; while your readiness to fall in with his wishes has at

                    indeed democratic and proper for one who is father to us all. It is your
                    prerogative, Caesar, to confer office on those who may desire to relinquish it,
                    to grant exemption to any who seek it, though it may be against your own wishes,
                    to understand that your friends are not deserting you if they want to retire, to
                    be always finding people whom you recall from private life or send back to it.
                    And to those of you in the Senate whom our Father deems worthy of his friendship
                    and regard, I say: cherish the high opinion he has of you; this is your concern
                    not his, for a prince may show that he can feel affection in one case without
