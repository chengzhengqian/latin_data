                    accordingly seek office and welcome citizenship without misgivings, confident
                    that these new obligations will leave no one broken and desolate, like a tree

<p>Moreover, even in cases of remoter degrees of kinship, where ties are
                    correspondingly weaker, there will no longer be the same liability as before to
                    the inheritance tax on any and every sum.</p>

<p>40. The amount which shall be subject to taxation has been fixed by the common
                    Father of us all. Small estates,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_411_1" id="target_note_LCL059_411_1"><sup>1</sup></a> with no large
                    sums involved, will be exempt from the tax; if the grateful heir so wishes, he
                    can devote everything to the costs of funeral rites and a tombâ€”no one
                    will stand over him to witness and censure what he does. Anyone then who
                    inherits a modest sum will be able to enjoy it without care or anxiety. Since
                    wealth alone is affected under the express terms of the inheritance law, the
                    unequal burden of taxation has become a source of congratulations and its
                    hardships to be desired: every heir positively hopes to be liable to tax. A
                    further clause allows exemption to all who were liable under the old law but
                    only up to the day of the new act, and have not yet paid.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_411_2" id="target_note_LCL059_411_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Even the gods
