                    fulfil the desires of the provinces, the prayers too of every city, with no
                    difficulties over giving audience nor delays in making reply. Admission is
                    immediate, dismissal prompt; at last there is an end of closed doors and crowds
                    of delegates waiting on the palace steps.</p>

<p>80. Now let me turn to judicial matters,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_511_1" id="target_note_LCL059_511_1"><sup>1</sup></a> where you
                    showed how strictness need not be cruel nor mercy weak. You did not mount the
                    tribunal for the purpose of enriching your private exchequer, and the only
                    reward you sought in passing sentence was the knowledge that justice had been
                    done. Before you stood the litigants, concerned more for your opinion of them
                    than for their fortunes, fearful of your judgement on their character rather
                    than on their case. This is indeed the true care of a prince, or even that of a
                    god, to settle rivalry between cities, to soothe the passions of angry peoples
                    less by exercise of power than by reason: to intervene where there has been
                    official injustice, to undo what should never have been done: finally, like a
                    swift-moving star, to see all, hear all, and be present at once with aid
                    wherever your help is sought. It is thus, I fancy, that the great Father of the
                    universe rules all with a nod of the head, if he ever looks down on earth and
                    deigns to consider mortal destinies among his divine affairs. Now he is rid of
                    this part of his duties, free to devote himself to heavenâ€™s concerns,
                    since he has given you to us to fill his role with regard to the entire human
                    race. And you are filling it, worthy of his trust in you: since every passing
                    day brings every advantage for us and the greatest glory for you.</p>
