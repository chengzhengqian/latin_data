                    showed, unmoved as he was by personal feelings or else superior to them.
                    Requests were granted, unspoken wishes were anticipated, and he did not hesitate
                    to press us urgently to make fresh demands; yet still there was something new to
                    surpass our dreams. How freely too the spectators could express their enthusiasm

                    and divinity; who deemed himself the equal of the gods yet raised his gladiators
                    to be his equal.</p>

                    by contrast with that hateful scene! There we saw the informers marched in, like
                    a band of robbers or brigands—only their haunts had not been at the

                    will was safe from them, no position secure; to be childless or a parent was
