                    preserve you if you deserve it; you are well aware that no one can judge this
                    better than the gods themselves. Can you not imagine, Conscript Fathers, how his
                    thoughts run, night and day: “I have put arms to be used against me, if
                    public interest demands, in the hands of my own prefect;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_483_1" id="target_note_LCL059_483_1"><sup>1</sup></a> but when it
                    comes to the gods, I will never seek to avert either their wrath or their
                    indifference, rather will I beg and pray that my country shall never have to
                    offer vows on my behalf against its will, or if it has already done so, that

<p>68. Thus, Caesar, from your agreement with the gods you have a glorious reward in
                    your continued safety. For by stipulating that the gods shall preserve you only
                    “if you have ruled the State well and in the interests of all” you
                    can be confident that you are ruling well, as long as they are preserving you.
                    And so you can be carefree and happy all through that day which was fraught with
                    fear and anxiety for the other emperors, who spent it racked by suspense,
                    uncertain how far to try our patience, awaiting from all quarters the messages
                    of our common servitude. And if perchance some of these were delayed by rivers,
                    snow, or adverse winds, they jumped to the conclusion that they would get their
                    just deserts. Their apprehensions were always the same; for a bad ruler fears
                    anyone worthier than himself as a likely successor, so when all are worthier,
                    all are feared. Your own tranquillity is not interrupted either by belated
                    messages or slow delivery of letters; </p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL059_483_1"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL059_483_1" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">1</sup>Sex.
