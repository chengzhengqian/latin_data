                    recreation and amusements, must be the extent of his serious interests and
                    preoccupations, from which he turns to relaxation like this. For it is a
                    man’s pleasures (yes, his pleasures) which tell us most about his true
                    worth, his moral excellence, and his self-control. No one is so dissolute that
                    his occupations lack all semblance of seriousness; it is our leisure moments
                    which betray us. This is the very time which the majority of his predecessors
                    used to spend on gambling, debauchery and extravagance, thus replacing what
                    should have been the relaxation of their serious concerns by a different form of
                    tension—their pursuit of vice.</p>

                    concealment, and in the case of princes, it flings open the door not only to
                    their homes but to their private apartments and deepest retreats; every secret
                    is exposed and revealed to rumour’s listening ear. But in your case,
                    Caesar, nothing could better redound to your credit than a searching inspection
                    of this kind. Your public conduct is indeed remarkable, but no less so your
                    private life. Splendid though it is to keep yourself thus unspotted by any form
                    of vice, it is even more so to do the same for the members of your family, for
                    the more difficult it is to vouch for others rather than one-self, the more
                    honour is due to you for combining your own excellence with making all those
                    around you reach the same high standard. Many distinguished men have been
                    dishonoured by an ill-considered choice of a wife or weakness in not getting rid
