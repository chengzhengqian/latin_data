                    forgetting that an emperor is best praised in his lifetime through criticism of
                    his predecessors according to their deserts. For when an evil ruler’s
                    survivors hold their peace, it is clear that his successor is no better.</p>

<p>54. Could any spot remain ignorant of the lamentable spirit of adulation in the
                    country, when tribute to the emperors was paid in the form of shows and riotous
                        entertainment,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_445_1" id="target_note_LCL059_445_1"><sup>1</sup></a> where dancing and wailing ran through
                    every kind of buffoonery and effeminacy, expressed in rhythmic antics and
                    shrieks? But the scandal was that everything was approved in the Senate as well
                    as on the stage, through consul and actor alike. You cut out all these stage
                    performances from honours paid to you. Thus serious poetry and the everlasting
                    glory of our historic past pay you tribute in place of a moment’s
                    disgraceful publicity; furthermore, the whole theatre-audience will rise to show
                    its respect with all the more unanimity now that the stage is to say less of
                    you. But why confine my admiration to this, when the other honours we offer you
                    are always so sparingly accepted or else refused?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_445_2" id="target_note_LCL059_445_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Hitherto,
                    anyone called on to speak in the Senate, on any subject however slight and
                    trivial, had to prolong his speech with adulation of the emperor. We debated the
                    increase in number of gladiators or the founding of a workers’ union; the
                    boundaries of empire might have been extended as we discussed colossal arches
                    and inscriptions too long for temple architraves, or else the months, when more
                    than one were to take the
