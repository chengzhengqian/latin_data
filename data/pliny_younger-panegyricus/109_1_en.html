                    difference: those who hold office twice are indeed honoured twice, but on
                    different occasions, whereas we have received our two consulships together and
                    hold them together, and through the person of the other each feels that we are

<p>92. It is no less remarkable that you bestowed the consulate on us while we were
                    prefects of the treasury before you appointed a successor there. Honour has been
                    heaped on honour, and our responsibilities not only prolonged without a break
                    but doubled, now that a second office has anticipated the end of the first as if
                    it were not enough for it to follow in succession. Such was your faith in our
                    integrity that you were confident that it would do no damage to your principles
                    of close surveillance if you did not permit us to retire into private life when
                    we laid down an office of such importance.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_539_1" id="target_note_LCL059_539_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Nor must I
                    neglect to mention that you conferred a consulship on us in the same year as you
                    held your own,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_539_2" id="target_note_LCL059_539_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and so our consulship will be recorded
                    on the same page as yours, and our names will appear on the calendar headed by
                    your own. It was not beneath your dignity to preside in person at our election
                    and to pronounce the sacred formula of the oath; it was your decision to make us
                    consuls, and your voice which proclaimed us; you sponsored our candidature in
                    the senate-house and announced its success on the election-field. Moreover, what
                    an honour it is for us of all men to be assigned to the month which is
                    distinguished by your birthday! It will be our good fortune to celebrate by
                    public games and official
