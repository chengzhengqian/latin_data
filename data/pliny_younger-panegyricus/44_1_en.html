                    that he was still under his father’s authority”, in the belief, I
                    imagine, that there is a natural law compelling children always to be obedient
                    to their fathers, one which does not reduce the human race to the level of the

                    he also exempted the second degree, and granted immunity to brothers and sisters
                    in respect of each others’ property, and to grandparents and
                    grandchildren in the same way. Furthermore, he granted the same concession to
                    those who had gained Roman citizenship through their Latin rights, while at a
                    single stroke to all alike were granted according to Nature’s law the
                    rights of kinship which his predecessors had preferred to leave for individual
                    petitions, though not so much with the intention of granting these as of
                    dismissing them with a refusal. Here is clear proof of his imagination and his
                    benevolence—to gather up and reunite the torn and scattered members of a
                    family, to breathe into it new life, to concede what was hitherto refused, and
                    grant to all what individuals had often failed to obtain: in short, to deny
                    himself so many chances of showing himself a benefactor, so many opportunities
                    for gaining credit and putting his subjects in his debt. No doubt he thought it
                    unsuitable that a man should have to ask for what the gods had bestowed. You are
                    brother and sister, grandparent and grandchild; what need is there to ask
                    permission to be what you are? You are blessed with a ruler who with his usual
