                    part, the emperors suffered this and even enjoyed it, believing it their due.
                    But which of us today spends the proper time for his speech on praising the
                    emperor as if forgetful of the subject of debate? The credit here is due to
                    moderation on your part, not self-restraint on ours; it is in obedience to your
                    wishes that we assemble in the House not to compete in flattery but to practise
                    and render justice, and to pay tribute to your open-hearted sincerity through
                    our confidence that your likes and dislikes are genuinely what you say they are.
                    We start and finish at a point where neither was possible when another was in
                    power; for though there have been others who refused most of the honours offered
                    them, no one was great enough before for us to believe that he did not want them
                    offered. This, I think, is more splendid than any inscription, since your name
                    is engraved not on beams of wood or blocks of stone but in the records of
                    imperishable glory.</p>

<p>55. It will go down through the ages that there has been a prince to whom, in the
                    full vigour of his lifetime, only modest honours were decreed, and, more often,
                    none at all. Of course we cannot hope to compete with the compulsion of former
                    times, for novelty is more readily devised by simulated than by genuine feeling,
                    less successfully by freedom and affection than by servitude and fear. Since,
                    therefore, adulation has exhausted any possibility of innovation, the only new
                    way left for us to do you honour is to venture sometimes to say nothing. Ah,
