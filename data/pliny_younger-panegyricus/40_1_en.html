<p>36. It is a pleasure to see peace and quiet restored to the treasury, to see it
                    as it was before the days of informers. Now it is a real temple and sanctuary of
                    a god, not a mortuary of citizens and a grim depository for blood-soaked spoils,
                    no longer the one place left in the world where even under an excellent ruler
                    the good were still at the mercy of the wicked. The laws still command respect,
                    and public utility is in no way diminished; but a new vengeance is added to
                    existing penalties, and the sole innovation lies in the fact that men no longer
                    go in fear of informers: instead, they fear the law. It may be thought that you
                    are less strict in your control of the imperial exchequer than of the treasury,
                    but in fact you are all the stricter through believing that you have a freer
                    hand to deal with your own money than with the public’s. Anyone may call
                    your procurator or his agent to justice, to appear in court—for an
                    emperor’s court<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_401_1" id="target_note_LCL059_401_1"><sup>1</sup></a> is set up which differs from the rest
                    only in the eminence of the person concerned in its workings. Lots drawn from
                    the urn assign the exchequer its magistrate, who can be rejected at any
                    one’s protest: “Not him, he’s weak and out of touch with
                    the spirit of the age—that’s the man, independent and loyal
                    subject of Caesar!” The same court serves the principate and the cause of
                    liberty; and nothing brings you greater honour than the fact that it is the
                    exchequer which often loses its case— for only under an honest ruler is
                    defeat possible. </p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL059_401_1"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL059_401_1" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">1</sup>The <span class="italic">Digest</span> (I. 2. 2. 32) says that Nerva set up a special
