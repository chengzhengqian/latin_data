                    his toils and troubles, nor was it the pleasures and successes of his position
                    which compelled you, but its difficulties and pains. You assumed authority only
                    after he wished to be rid of it. No tie of kinship or relationship bound adopted
                    and adopter; your only bond was that of mutual excellence, rendering you worthy
                    either to choose or to be chosen. Thus you were adopted not as others have been
                    hitherto, in order to gratify a wife;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_339_1" id="target_note_LCL059_339_1"><sup>1</sup></a> no stepfather
                    made you his son, but one who was your prince, and the divine Nerva became your
                    father in the same sense that he was father of us all. This is the only fitting
                    way to adopt a son if the adopter is an emperor; for when it is a case of
                    transferring the Senate and people of Rome, armies, provinces, and allies to a
                    single successor, would you look to a wife to provide him, or seek no further
                    than the four walls of your home? No indeed, you would search through all your
                    subjects, and judge him the closest and dearest to you whom you find to be the
                    noblest and dearest to the gods. If he is destined to rule the people, one and
                    all, he must be chosen from among them all, for no natural law can satisfy you
                    when you are not appointing an overlord for your household of cheap slaves, but
                    a prince and emperor for the citizens of Rome. Not to adopt the one man who in
                    the eyes of all could have proved himself a ruler even without adoption would
                    indicate the wanton tyranny of power. Thus Nerva made his choice, realizing that
                    unless sons are adopted with more judgement than they are begotten there is
                    little difference between a son born and a son chosenâ€”but for the fact
