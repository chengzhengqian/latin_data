                    army-camps. You cut out the canker in our midst; your stern providence ensured
                    that a state founded on laws should not appear to perish through the
                    laws’ abuse. So although your high estate and generosity enabled you to
                    present the spectacle we saw, first men whose spirit matched their mighty
                    physique, then animals in their natural state of savagery and also tamed in
                    unexpected degree, then the riches hitherto kept hidden in secret and now, in
                    your reign, to be shared by all; yet nothing was so popular, nothing so fitting
                    for our times as the opportunity we enjoyed of looking down at the informers at
                    our feet, their heads forced back and faces upturned to meet our gaze. We knew
                    them and rejoiced; like victims chosen to atone for the sufferings of their
                    country, treading in the blood of the criminals before them, they were led to
                    long-lasting punishment and more fearful retribution. Ships were hastily
                    produced, and they were crowded on board and abandoned to the hazard of wind and
                    weather. Well, let them go, and flee from the lands their informing had left
                    desolate; and if the stormy sea casts anyone alive on the rocks, let him eke out
                    a wretched existence on the bare crags of a hostile shore, and suffer in the
                    knowledge that by his departure the entire human race is relieved of its
                    cares.</p>

<p>35. The sight was unforgettable: a whole fleet of informers thrown on the mercy
                    of every wind, forced to spread sail before the tempests, driven by the fury of
                    the waves on to the rocks in their course. What joy for us to watch the ships
                    scattered as soon as they left harbour, and on the very water’s edge to
                    render </p></section><notes></notes></section>
