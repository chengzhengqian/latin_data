<p>14. Now, Caesar, let us turn to the very cradle and starting point of your
                    career. You were scarcely more than a boy when your successes in Parthia helped
                    to win fame for your father,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_355_2a" id="target_note_LCL059_355_2a"><sup>2</sup></a> when you already deserved the name

                    sound of your approach struck terror into the proud hearts of savage Parthians,
                    when Rhine and Euphrates were united in their admiration for you. Your fame
                    travelled the world ahead of your person, yet always proved less than reality
                    among those who knew you later. And still you were not yet Emperor, not yet the
                    son of a god. Spain and Germany were still divided by the barrier of countless
                    peoples and an almost endless waste of intervening country, to say nothing of
                    the Pyrenees and Alps, and other mountains which seem enormous, though not
                    comparable with these. Throughout the entire journey,
