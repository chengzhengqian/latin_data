<p>44. What an advantage it is to have attained success through adversity! You
                    shared our lives, our dangers, our fears, the common lot at that time of all
                    innocent men. You know from experience how bad rulers come to be hated even by
                    those who have corrupted them. You can remember how you joined in our prayers
                    and protests—witness the fact that your sentiments have remained those of
                    a citizen since you become prince, while your merits have proved greater than
                    anything you could have hoped for in another. You have inspired us not to be
                    satisfied with less than perfection in our ruler, whereas hitherto we prayed
                    only for someone who would prove better than the worst. Consequently everyone
                    knows you—and himself—too well to covet your position after you; a
                    willing successor might even be harder to find than a capable one, for who would
                    voluntarily shoulder your burden of responsibility or readily stand comparison
                    with you? Experience has taught you how difficult it is to succeed a good
                    emperor—and you could plead the fact of your adoption. No one could
                    imagine it easy for any comer to repeat a situation where no one need purchase
                    security by disgrace, where everyone’s life is safe and safe with honour,
                    where foresight and prudence no longer prompt men to spend a lifetime keeping
                    out of sight. The rewards of virtue are now the same under an emperor as they
                    were in times of liberty, and good deeds win more solid recognition than the
                    mere consciousness of having performed them.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_419_1" id="target_note_LCL059_419_1"><sup>1</sup></a> You value
