                    disagree, to vote in opposition, and to give the State the benefit of his views.
                    We were all consulted and even reckoned with, and the sentence which carried the
                    day was the better one, and not merely the first proposed.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_503_1" id="target_note_LCL059_503_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Contrast the
                    previous reign: who dared then to open his mouth or say a word except the poor
                    wretches called on for the first speech? The rest, too terrified to move,
                    endured the forced necessity of giving assent in silence, without rising from
                    their seats, their mental anguish as painful as their physical fears.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_503_2a" id="target_note_LCL059_503_2a"><sup>2</sup></a> A solitary senator expressed a single view for all to follow,

                    an attitude of respect for the Senate in its presence, but once out of the House
                    he was emperor again, throwing off all his consular obligations with careless
                    contempt. But Caesar has conducted himself as if he were <span class="italic">only</span> consul, thinking nothing beneath him unless it were beneath a
                    consul too. In the first place, he would leave his home without the delays
                    caused by the pomp which accompanies imperial pride, or by the commotion of
                    attendants who must clear his path; he paused only once on his threshold to take
                    the auspices and receive with proper reverence the directions of the gods. No
                    one was jostled or pushed aside, and his official escort was so unobtrusive and
