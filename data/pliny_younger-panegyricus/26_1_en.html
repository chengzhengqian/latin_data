                    when you went away, when you singled out the leading knights for the honour of
                    being greeted by name without an official intermediary, when you not only took
                    the first step in greeting your clients but added some touches of friendliness,
                    and still greater delight when you moved slowly and quietly forward where the
                    crowds of spectators fell back, letting yourself be jostled as one of the
                    people, though in fact the crowds pressed thickest where you were. On that very
                    first day you made yourself accessible to all, for no party of satellites
                    attended you; you moved in the midst of the élite of the senators or
                    knights, as the numbers of either party prevailed as they gathered round you,
                    and your lictors quietly and courteously cleared your path. As for the soldiers
                    present, they differed from the civilians in neither dress, propriety, nor
                    discipline. But when you proceeded to mount the Capitol, how gladly everyone
                    remembered your adoption,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_373_1" id="target_note_LCL059_373_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and what special joy it was for those
                    who had first hailed you as <span class="italic">Imperator</span> in that very place!
                    But the greatest pleasure of all, I fancy, was that of the god who was your
                    father in his own creation. Above all, as you trod in the same steps as your
                    father when he prepared to reveal the mighty secret of the gods, how the crowd
                    rejoiced with fresh outbursts of cheering, as this day recalled that other which
                    had brought it into being! Everywhere there were altars, but still not enough
                    for their victims; everyone’s prayers were for your safety alone, since
                    each man knew they would be answered for himself and his children if they were
                    granted for you.
