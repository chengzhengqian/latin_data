                    spirit, had it been possible, how gladly would you have restored their
                    life-blood and their fortunes to so many victims of butchery and spoilation! You
                    forbade the collection of debts contracted before your reign; but another would
                    have suspected a refusal to submit, vented his anger accordingly, and punished
                    delay in payment by exacting twice or four times the amount. You find nothing to
                    choose between the unfair exaction of debts which should never have been
                    contracted and their unjust imposition.</p>

<p>41. You will bear with my anxieties, Caesar, my concern as consul. Your refusal
                    to accept gifts of money, your distribution of the military bonus and civilian
                    largess, dismissal of informers and reduction of taxes—the thought of all
                    this makes me feel I should ask you whether you have given due thought to the
                    Empire’s revenues. Are there sufficient resources to support the
                    Emperor’s economy and enable it to bear unaided the cost of paying out
                    such sums? Others were robbers on a large scale and kept their ill-gotten gains,
                    yet they might have taken and kept nothing, for they were always penniless;
                    whereas you have given so much and taken nothing; but always have enough and to
                    spare as if you had given nothing and taken all. What is the explanation? Our
                    rulers have always had people at their side who were all too ready to keep a
                    stern and unremitting eye on the needs of the exchequer. There were even
                    emperors whose personal cupidity and greed for gain needed no teaching, though
                    in most cases instruction—to our own detriment—has come from us.
