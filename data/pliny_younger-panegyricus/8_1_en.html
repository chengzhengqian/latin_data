                    should never prevail. Your merits did indeed call for your adoption as successor
                    long ago; but had you been adopted then, we should never have known the
                    empire’s debt to you. We had to wait for the moment which would show you
                    not so much the beneficiary as the benefactor. The country reeled under its
                    blows to take refuge in your embrace; the empire which was falling with its
                    emperor was put into your hands at the emperor’s word; for it was through
                    your adoption that you yielded to entreaties and allowed yourself to be
                    recalled, like the great generals of the past who were summoned from distant

                    other the greatest of all gifts: he gave you supreme power and you returned it
                    to him. You alone in our time have made proper return for such a gift, simply by
                    your acceptance of it; nay, rather, you put the giver in your debt, for the
                    sharing of authority increased your responsibilities while lessening his
                    cares.</p>
