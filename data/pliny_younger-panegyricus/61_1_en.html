                    character of the principate which had become debased by a long period of
                    corruption. Indeed, eulogy is best expressed through comparison, and, moreover,
                    the first duty of grateful subjects towards a perfect emperor is to attack those
                    who are least like him: for no one can properly appreciate a good prince who
                    does not sufficiently hate a bad one. Furthermore, no service of our
                    emperor’s has spread so far in its effects as the freedom he allows us to
                    criticize bad rulers with impunity. Have we already forgotten in our troubles
                    how Nero was but lately avenged?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_443_1" id="target_note_LCL059_443_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Can you
                    imagine that <span class="italic">he</span> would have allowed the breath of
                    criticism to fall on Nero’s life and reputation, when he avenged his
                    death? Would he not guess that anything said against one so like himself could
                    be applied to him? And so in your case, Caesar, alongside all your other
                    benefits and above many of them, I set our freedom to avenge ourselves daily on
                    the evil emperors of the past, and to warn by example all future ones that there
                    will be neither time nor place for the shades of disastrous rulers to rest in
                    peace from the execrations of posterity. With all the more assurance, Conscript
                    Fathers, can we therefore reveal our griefs and joys, happy in our present good
                    fortune and sighing over our sufferings of the past, for both are equally our
                    duty under the rule of a good prince. This then must we make the subject of our
                    private talk, our public conversation
