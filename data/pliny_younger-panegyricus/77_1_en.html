                    you would act as you did had you not accepted it. I am still astonished,
                    Conscript Fathers, still unable to believe the evidence of my years and eyes; I
                    keep on asking myself whether I really heard and saw this thing. The Emperor,
                    Caesar, Augustus, the Chief Pontiff stood before the seated consul—yes,
                    the consul sat while his prince stood before him, and remained seated,
                    undisturbed and unafraid, as if it were normal practice. Moreover, while he sat
                    he repeated the words of the oath to his prince who remained standing: and the
                    latter swore. Clearly and explicitly he pronounced the words whereby he
                    consigned his life and household to the wrath of heaven if knowingly he swore
                    false. Great is your glory here, Caesar, and so it will remain, whether your
                    successors follow your example or not. A man three times consul acted as he did
                    at his first election: a prince showed himself no different from a commoner, an
                    emperor no different from one of his subjects: this surely is beyond all praise.
                    For my part, I cannot judge which is the more splendid: the fact that you took
                    the oath with no precedent before you, or that you took the words from
                    another’s lips.</p>

                    intended these laws to apply to the Emperor, Caesar, but you were unwilling for

                    willing for them to do so. There is a new turn of phrase which I hear and
                    understand for the first time—not “the prince is above the
