                    you prefer is simply this—a change of work. Your only relaxation is to
                    range the forests, drive wild beasts from their lairs, scale vast mountain
                    heights, and set foot on rocky crags, with none to give a helping hand or show
                    the way; and amidst all this to visit the sacred groves in a spirit of devotion,
                    and present yourself to the deities there. In the days of old this was the
                    training and the delight of youth, these were the skills which formed the
                    leaders of the future—to pit speed against an animal’s
                    swift-footedness, and strength and dexterity against its courage and cunning;
                    while in times of peace it brought no small honour to sweep marauding wild
                    beasts from the plains and raise the siege they laid to the farmers and their
                    work. Then this distinction was also claimed by those emperors who lacked the
                    ability to win it, claimed by a mere pretence of skill, as they rounded up
                    animals who had been tamed and weakened by captivity and then let loose to
                    provide them (of course!) with amusement. But Caesar puts just as much effort
                    into the chase as he does into making a capture, while the hardest task of
                    hunting out a quarry is what delights him most. And, indeed, does he ever decide
                    to display the same physical energy on sea, he is not one to follow the sails
                    afloat only by eye or pointing finger; one moment he sits at the helm, at
                    another he matches the sturdiest of his comrades in mastering the waves, taming
                    the opposition of the winds, and forcing a passage by oar against a racing
                    current.</p>
