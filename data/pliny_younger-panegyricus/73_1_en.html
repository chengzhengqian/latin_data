                    when once again they donned the purple and seated themselves in the curule
                    chair; just as in times past, when the enemy at the gates and the
                    republic’s gravest hour of peril demanded men tried and tested in office,
                    it was a case of returning the same men to the consulate rather than the
                    consulate to them. Such is your power to do good that your gracious favour has
                    the same effect as stern necessity. These men had just taken off their robes of
                    office when they must put them on again, dismissed their lictors only to call
                    them back; their friends had offered congratulations and taken their leave, and
                    now they must return. Surely some superhuman stroke of genius, some more than
                    mortal power enables you to renew men’s times of rejoicing and revive
                    their happiness, to deny all respite to congratulations, and refuse to allow a
                    break before the next consulship beyond the time spent on winding up the one
                    before! May your work continue, and may your spirit and guiding fortune never
                    tire; bestow third consulships on as many of us as possible, and when you have
                    given all you can, may there ever be more of us to whom they should be
                    given!</p>

<p>62. All benefits which are awarded to deserving mei 1 give as much pleasure to
                    others like them as to the recipients ; yet in particular, the consulship
                    conferred on these two senators delighted the entire Senate (not just one
                    section of it) so much that everyone felt he shared both in the giving of the
                    honour and in receiving it. For these are the men who were the Senate’s
                    choice, and indeed its first choice, when it was selecting the best men for the
