<p>86. At this point I must recall the personal distress you chose to undergo rather
                    than refuse anything to a friend. You released from office a man of the highest
                        merit,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_525_1" id="target_note_LCL059_525_1"><sup>1</sup></a> one of your dearest friends, in spite of
                    your grief and reluctance, as if there was no possibility of your retaining him.
                    How much you felt for him was shown by the extent of your regret; your heart was
                    torn and broken as you yielded to his pressure. The situation was unheard-of:
                    for an emperor and his friend to have conflicting desires, and the
                    friend’s wishes to take precedence. Here then is something to go down on

                    chosen was allowed to return to the retirement he so obstinately preferred:
                    occupied as you were by the cares of empire, you begrudged no one an honourable
                    release. We can appreciate the extent of our debt to you, Caesar, for all the
                    hardships and vexations of the responsibilities you bear, when retirement is
                    sought and granted by you as the greatest of blessings. Your distress, I am
                    told, was undisguised, as you saw him on to the boat; yes, you saw him off, and
                    there on the shore you were not ashamed to give him your embrace and kiss of
                    farewell. There on a watchtower, the witness of his friendship, stood Caesar,
                    and prayed for a calm sea for his departing friend, prayed too for a speedy
