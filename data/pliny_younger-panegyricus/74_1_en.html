                    Caesar. Has not past experience shown us all too often a situation where the
                    Senate’s approval can make or mar a man in the Emperor’s eyes? It
                    is only a short time since nothing was so fatal as for him to think that this
                    one or another had the Senate’s affection and support. He hated everyone
                    we loved—but we felt the same about his favourites. Today, prince and
                    Senate are rivals in their affection for all who most deserve it; by turns we
                    prove this or accept the proofs he gives us, and—chief indication of our
                    mutual sentiments— we love the same men. Henceforth, Conscript Fathers,
                    you may be open in your favours and stead-fast in your affections; there is no
                    need now to conceal your love and hatred for fear the one may bring harm, the
                    other profit, when Caesar’s approval and disapproval rests on the same
                    objects as the Senate’s. Present or absent, you share his counsels. He
                    granted a third consulship to men of your choosing, and in the same order in
                    which you had chosen them. Whether he has special affection for those who he
                    knows are dearest to your hearts, or whether he will not give precedence to
                    anyone he personally prefers to them, the honour he does you is equally great.
                    Older men can look to rewards, young ones to examples; they can gather on the
                    doorsteps of houses which at last feel free to open wide their doors. Anyone who
                    looks up to the men the Senate admires can be sure of finding favour with a
                    prince who believes that his own status is increased as others advance, and who
                    feels no distinction in standing supreme unless those beneath him stand as high
                    as possible. Continue, Caesar, in the course you have </p></section><notes></notes></section>
