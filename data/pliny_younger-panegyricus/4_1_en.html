                    moderation of my prince, and while paying due tribute to his merits shall remind
                    myself of what his ears can endure to hear. And indeed it does him honour of no
                    ordinaiy kind if in thanking him my fears are not that he will think I say too
                    little in his praise but that I say too much. This is my sole anxiety, the only
                    difficulty in my path; for it is easy, Conscript Fathers, to render thanks where
                    they are due. There is no danger that in my references to his humanity he will
                    see a reproach for arrogance; that he will suppose I mean extravagance by modest
                    expenditure, and cruelty by forbearance; that I think him covetous and
                    capricious when I call him generous and kind, profligate and idle instead of
                    self-controlled and active, or that I judge him a coward when I speak of him as
                    a brave man. I do not even fear that my gratitude or lack of it will be judged
                    in accordance with the adequacy of my words, for I have noted that the gods
                    themselves delight in the innocence and purity of their worshippers rather than
                    in the elaborate preparation of the prayers they offer, and prefer the man who
                    brings a chaste and sinless heart to their shrines to one who comes with a
                    studied invocation.</p>
