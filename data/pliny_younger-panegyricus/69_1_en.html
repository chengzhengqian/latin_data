                    in you which led you to deny an honour always sought after, to the moderation
                    which made you yield it to others, or to the benevolence which enabled you to

<p>59. Even so, the time has come for you to offer yourself for the consulate, and
                    increase its status by taking and holding it in person. To refuse it too often
                    can be misinterpreted, or give the impression that you value it too little. In
                    fact, of course, you refused because you value it so highly, but you will
                    convince no one of this unless one day you accept. You may beg to be spared
                    trophies and statues and arches of triumph and must be forgiven for your
                    modesty, for these are clearly offered to you personally. But what we are asking
                    now is that you teach future emperors to break away from their inertia and
                    suspend their pleasures for a while, to rouse themselves for a moment at least,
                    and not sleep away their good fortune: to put on the toga of office which is
                    already in their possession as it is in their power to give, to mount the curule
                    chair which they are keeping empty: in short, to be what they have really wished
                    to be, and not to agree to become consul only to say they have been one. You
                    have held a second consulship, I know, but the armies, the provinces, even
                    foreigners can be said to have benefited from it, not any of us. Certainly we
                    have heard it said that you fulfilled every duty as a consul, but what is
                    hearsay? And the rumour goes that you were the very soul of justice, kindness,
                    and consideration, but it is only </p></section><notes></notes></section>
