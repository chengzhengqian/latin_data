                    modest than a Papirius or a Quinctiusâ€”you who are Augustus and Caesar and
                    the Father of your country? There was a republic then, you say, to summon them;
                    but surely there is still a republic to call on you, as well as a Senate, and
                    the consulate itself, which must be honoured and ennobled if you will shoulder
                    its responsibilities.</p>

                    successive consulships dragged the long year out without a break, only drawing a
                    comparison with those who have thought little of their several consulships. A
                    member of the Senate had been consul three times at the moment when you refused
                    to hold office a third time.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_457_2" id="target_note_LCL059_457_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Evidently we asked too much of your
                    modesty by our unanimous request that our prince should be consul as often as
                    one of his own senators, but your diffidence about accepting would have been
                    excessive even in an ordinary citizen. Can a third consulship really be
                    promotion for the son of a consular father granted a triumph? Is it not rather
                    his due, his proper reward, if only as a member of a distinguished family? And
                    so ordinary people enjoyed the honour of opening the year and heading the
                    official calendar, and this too was proof of liberty restored: the consul now
                    need not be Caesar. (The year began in freedom in the same way after the kings
                    were expelled, long ago when the appearance of individual names in the calendar
                    marked the end of servitude.) O wretched ambition in those who sought to match
                    their lifelong power with a perpetual consulship! Or perhaps not ambition so
