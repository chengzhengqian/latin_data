                    an oar without shivering in disgraceful terror at each stroke! So it was that,
                    far removed from the slightest sound, sheltered from every shock and movement,
                    his vessel firmly held in tow, he was brought like a victim to the sacrifice.
                    Disgraceful scene, for the emperor of the Roman people to follow behind with
                    another to steer his course and direct his helm, as if held prisoner in his own
                    ship! Rivers also witnessed this shameful travesty; the Danube and Rhine<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_515_2" id="target_note_LCL059_515_2"><sup>2</sup></a> were delighted for their waters to play their part in our
                    disgrace, and it was no less a blot on the empire for this to be seen by Roman
                    eagles, Roman standards, and the Roman river-bank, than by the other side, the
                    bank of the enemy—the enemy whose habit it was to navigate or swim across
                    these same rivers, whether blocked with ice-floes or flooding the plains when
                    ice is melted and passage is free. Not that I think so highly of hardness of
                    physique and muscle as such, unless the body is ruled by a mind more powerful
                    than itself, one which is neither softened by fortune’s favour nor led
                    astray by imperial riches into idleness and excess; in this case a body which
                    thrives on work and sinews developed by service, whether trained on mountain or
                    at sea, will win my admiration. I have observed that since ancient times, the
                    husbands of goddesses and the sons of gods have won fame less through the glory
                    of their marriages or the divinity of their fathers than by skills such as
                    these; at the same time I ask
