                    through a short term of service was not enough for you; your time as tribune
                    must qualify you for immediate command, with nothing left to learn when the
                    moment came for passing on your knowledge. Ten years of service<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_359_1a" id="target_note_LCL059_359_1a"><sup>1</sup></a> taught
                    you customs of peoples, locality of countries, lie of the land, and accustomed
                    you to enduring every kind of river and weather as if these were the springs and
                    climate of your native land. Many were the times when you changed your mount and
                    the arms worn out with service! The day will come when posterity will clamour to
                    see and show their youngers the earth which was soaked in your sweat, the trees
                    and rocks which sheltered your moments of sleep and repose, the roof which gave
                    hospitality to your noble person, as in your time you were shown the cherished
                    traces left by the great generals of the past. But this is for the future;
                    meanwhile, any soldier who is not too young can gain glory from having served
                    with you. How many do you suppose there are who did not know you as comrade in
                    arms before you were their emperor? Thus you can call nearly all your soldiers
                    by name, and know the deeds of bravery of each one, while they need not recount
                    the wounds they received in their country’s service, since you were there
                    to witness and applaud.</p>
