                    much self-prompted, and still more by some instinct or authority—even
                    behind rejoicing there is a driving force. No thought for your modesty could
                    restrain us—our fervour leapt into flames the more you would have damped
                    it down. This was no wilful disobedience, Caesar; yours is the power to release
                    our joy, but its extent is beyond our control. On your part, too, you confirmed
                    the sincerity of our acclamation by the unfeigned shedding of your tears. We saw
                    your eyes wet, your face overcome by joy; we saw your blushes give outward
                    expression to the sense of unworthiness in your heart. This fired us the more to
                    pray that you would never have a different cause for tears or anything to cloud
                    your face. And to these seats of ours we must put a question, as if they could
                    make reply: have they ever seen an emperor’s tears? (The Senate’s
                    they have witnessed often enough.) You have laid a heavy burden on emperors to
                    come, and no less on our successors, who will expect their princes to be worthy
                    to receive a similar acclamation; while these princes will feel slighted because
                    they do not.</p>

<p>74. I can find no more appropriate word than the one voiced by the entire Senate
                    in hailing you as “fortunate.” Here we were referring not to your
                    material wealth but to your inner self, for genuine good fortune lies in being
                    judged worthy of enjoying it. But among the many words of weight and wisdom
