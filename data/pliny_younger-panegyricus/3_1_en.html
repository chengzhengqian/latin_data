                    distinguishing between their rulers. They all give the same acclamation now to
                    one for his valour as another had a short time ago for his good looks,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_327_1" id="target_note_LCL059_327_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and the cries which greeted the voice and attitudes of one of

                    emperor’s devotion to duty, his clemency and restraint. What about us? Is
                    it the divine nature of our prince or his humanity, his moderation and his
                    courtesy which joy and affection prompt us to celebrate in a single voice?
                    Surely nothing could reveal him as citizen and senator more appropriately than
                    the title bestowed on him of <span class="italic">Optimus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_327_3a" id="target_note_LCL059_327_3a"><sup>3</sup></a></span>
                    Best, one which by contrast with the insolence of some of his predecessors he
                    can claim as his individual right. One and all and all alike we acclaim his good
                    fortune, and with it our own, and beg him to “continue thus” or
                    again, “to hear our prayers,” as if forming our requests in the
                    sure knowledge that he will grant these. For his part, he listens with tears in
                    his eyes, and his blushes show his awareness that he is addressed not as the
                    holder of his title of prince but as himself.</p>

<p>3. This moderation, then, which we have all maintained in the sudden surge of our
                    affection, we must individually try to keep in our more studied tributes,
                    remembering that there is no more sincere nor welcome kind of thanks than that
                    which most resembles the spontaneous acclamation which has no time for artifice.
