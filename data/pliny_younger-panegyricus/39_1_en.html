                    unfailing mercy had preferred to entrust vengeance over men on earth to the gods
                    of the sea! Then indeed we knew how times had changed; the real criminals were
                    nailed to the very rocks which had been the cross of many an innocent man; the
                    islands where senators were exiled were crowded with the informers<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_399_1" id="target_note_LCL059_399_1"><sup>1</sup></a> whose power you had broken for all time, not merely for a day,
                    held fast as they were in the meshes of punishments untold. They set out to rob
                    other men of money: now let them lose their own. They sought to evict men from
                    their homes: let them be homeless too. Let them stop presenting a brazen and
                    unblushing front, unmarked by any disgrace, stop laughing off all reproaches.
                    Now they can expect losses in proportion to their rewards, and know apprehension
                    to match their former hopes; now they can feel the fear they once inspired.</p>
<p>It is true that the divine Titus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_399_2" id="target_note_LCL059_399_2"><sup>2</sup></a> in the nobility of his spirit had
                    taken measures for our security and need for vengeance, and because of this was
                    placed among the gods; but how much more will you one day deserve your seat in
                    heaven, for all your additions to those measures for which we recognized his
                    godhead! And your achievement was the more difficult because the Emperor
                        Nerva,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_399_3" id="target_note_LCL059_399_3"><sup>3</sup></a> worthy as he was of you as his son and
                    successor, had himself made notable additions to Titus’s edict, so that
                    it seemed that nothing was left—except for you, whose ideas were so many
                    that nothing might have been thought of before. Had you dispensed these favours
                    singly
