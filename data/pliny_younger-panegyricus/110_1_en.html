<p>93. There is still something which demands praise beyond all else: the fact that
                    when you have made consuls you allow them to act without interference, by which
                    I mean that there are no fears nor perils as regards the Emperor to weaken and
                    destroy their spirit; the consuls will not have to listen to anything against
                    their will nor have decisions forced on them. Our office retains and will retain
                    the respect due to it, and in exercising our authority we need lose none of our
                    peace of mind. Moreover, if the high dignity of the consulate should chance to
                    be diminished, the fault will not be found in the times we live in but in
                    ourselves. So far as rests with our prince, the consuls are free to fill their

                    we can make you, to match all you have done for us? Only perhaps by remembering
                    all our lives that we have been consuls, your consuls: by ensuring that our
                    opinions and pronouncements are worthy of the office we once held: by playing an
                    active part in public affairs to show we believe that the republic still exists:
                    by not withholding our aid and counsel, and by not imagining ourselves rid of
                    the consulate and dismissed from office, but believing ourselves </p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL059_541_1"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL059_541_1" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">1</sup>Trajan was born on 18
