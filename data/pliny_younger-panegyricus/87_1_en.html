                    the gods to grant your prayers only so long as you continued to merit our
                    esteem? Nothing stands higher with you than your subjects’ affection: so
                    much so, that you would put our love before that of the gods, and desire theirs
                    only if you have ours. Certainly the fate of your predecessors has taught you
                    that no one can expect the gods to love him when men do not. It was difficult
                    for us to match these prayers of yours with appropriate acknowledgement, but we
                    managed to do so; such was the warmth of our feeling and our enthusiasm, which
                    set a torch to our cries of acclamation! No mental power on our side prompted
                    these words, Caesar, but your own virtue, your own merits—words such as
                    no adulation has ever devised nor terror wrung out. Whom have we feared so as to
                    conjure up these expressions, or loved so as to produce an avowal like this? You
                    know the exigencies of servitude; have you ever heard or said the like? Fear may
                    indeed be inventive, but the result is far-fetched and constrained. The very
                    nature of anxiety is not that of security, and misery has quite different
                    resources at its command from joy: neither can be prompted by pretended emotion.
                    Unhappiness has its own language, and so has good fortune, and even if what they
                    say is identical, it is differently worded.</p>
