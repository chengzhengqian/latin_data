                    in wanting to see you consul as well as emperor is simply what it would be if
                    you were an ordinary citizen and could be senator and consul as well.</p>
<p>Thus these repeated, cogent arguments have broken down the long resistance of our
                    prince’s modesty, and at last he has yielded.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_463_1" id="target_note_LCL059_463_1"><sup>1</sup></a> In what way?
                    Not by descending to his subjects’ level, but by raising them to his; for
                    he accepted a third consulship only to be able to bestow one. He knew the
                    moderation and reluctance of those who would accept a third consulship only as
                    colleagues of another who was three times consul. This honour used to be granted
                    in the past to allies in war and companions in danger, and only in rare cases;
                    yet you bestowed it on two outstanding individuals who had served you well and
                    bravely but as civilians. In both cases, the watchful care of your colleague set
                    a restriction on you, Caesar; but it is rare and almost unknown in a prince to
                    think himself under any restraint, or to welcome it if he does. This then is a
                    debt which you wish to repay, and in doing so by granting a third consulship you
                    see yourself not as a great emperor so much as a not ungrateful friend.
                    Moreover, however modest the services of your subjects, you ennoble them by
                    virtue of your rank, for everyone is made to feel that he has given as much as
                    he has received from you. Your generosity leaves me with nothing to ask, save
                    that you will always create these mutual obligations, and so leave your subjects
                    in doubt whether they do better as your debtors or your creditors.</p>
