<p>63. I pass now to your consulship, though there are certain events relating to it
                    which did in fact precede it: first of all, you were present in person at your
                    election, as a candidate not only for the consulate but for immortality and the
                    fame of setting an example for good rulers to follow and bad ones to look on
                    with surprise. The people of Rome saw you in the ancient seat of their former
                    power, while you bore patiently with the long ceremonial of the electoral
                        assembly,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_471_1" id="target_note_LCL059_471_1"><sup>1</sup></a> the slow ritual which this time was not
                    a farce; and so you were made consul as if one of us, us who are made consuls by
                    your word. How many of your predecessors did honour in this way either to the
                    consulate or to the people? Some of them, we know, awaited the news of their
                    election heavy-eyed with sleep, gorged with the banquet of the day before;
                    others who were certainly alert and awake in their own rooms were plotting exile
                    and death for the very consuls who proclaimed their electtion. Vile ambition,
                    blind to the meaning of true majesty, for a man to covet honours which at heart
                    he despised, to despise what he coveted, and although his gardens overlooked the
                        election-field,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_471_2" id="target_note_LCL059_471_2"><sup>2</sup></a> to keep away
