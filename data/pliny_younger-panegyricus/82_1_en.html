                    can be sure that everywhere the oath is being taken for you, as you have taken
                    it for us all, for no one would deny himself this pleasure. The fact is, we love
                    you as you deserve—but in our own self-interest rather than in yours. The
                    day will never dawn when we offer vows on your behalf only from a sense of duty,
                    with no benefit to ourselves. (There is no virtue in supporting a prince who can
                    claim the credit for our support.) We may well complain that it is only the
                    rulers we hate who violate our privacy, for if good and bad were equally
                    inquisitive, what universal admiration for yourself you would find, what delight
                    and rejoicing, what conversations you would hear everywhere between us and our
                    wives and children, and even before the hearths and altars of our homes! You
                    would then understand how we are sparing those sensitive ears of yours. But
                    however different love and hatred may be, they have one close resemblance: we
                    give our love more unrestrainedly to good princes in this very place where we
                    have freely hated bad ones.</p>
