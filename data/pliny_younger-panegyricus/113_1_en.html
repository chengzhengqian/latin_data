                    grief and fear, and can be counted among the serene and happy now that better
                    days have come; that, finally, I love the best of princes as much as I was hated
                    by the worst: then I shall act not as if I consider myself consul to day and
                    ex-consul tomorrow, but as if I were still a candidate for the consulate, and in
                    this way shall minister at all times to the reverence which is due to you
                    all.</p>
<p><span class="italic">Translator’s note.</span> Where <span class="italic">‘princeps</span> is translated as‘ prince ’ it is because no
                    other English word seems to combine the emphasis of a monosyllable with the
                    patriotic feeling which inspires the speech.</p>
