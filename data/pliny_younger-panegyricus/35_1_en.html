                    a proper tribute; let her realize that she is not indispensable to the people of
                    Rome although she is their servant. Henceforth, if it wishes, the Nile can stick
                    to its bed and content itself with a river’s proper form—it will
                    make no difference to Rome, nor to Egypt either, except that ships will leave
                    her country cargoless and empty, as once they used to return, while from Rome
                    they will sail filled with the cargo they once brought to us. The sea’s
                    function thus reversed, it will be from here that a following wind and a
                    shortened voyage are the object of the sailors’ prayer. It might seem a
                    miracle, Caesar, that the city’s corn-supply had been unaffected by
                    Egypt’s shortcomings and the defection of the Nile, but thanks to your
                    vigilance and bounty it has been dispensed so freely that two points are proved:
                    we have no need of Egypt, but Egypt must always need us. She is
                    finished—that country which might have been so productive had she been
                    free. Humiliated by her strange sterility she blushed for her famine as much as
                    she suffered thereby, when your intervention not only answered her needs but
                    also pricked her self-esteem. Her farmers stared in amazement at granaries
                    filled by other hands than theirs: what fields had produced such a harvest?
                    Where in Egypt was there another river? Thus by your gracious aid the earth has
                    not begrudged her fruits, and if the Nile has often shown itself more propitious
                    to Egypt, it has never flowed more generously for our glory.</p>
