                    who sees in preparations against his enemies a threat directed at himself, after
                    the fashion of his predecessors, who feared to fall victim to their own harsh
                    practices and so were glad to see a falling off of interest in the
                    soldier’s life, slack training and lowered morale, while swords grew dull
                    and blunted through disuse. Thus our generals had less to fear from foreign foes
                    than from their masters’ treachery, and more from the swords their own
                    men held than from their enemies’.</p>

                    enjoyed before you came, and many found men’s regard for them the greater
                    because you shared it too. So you were beloved by all, the highest and the
                    lowest; the emperor and the comrade-in-arms so combined in your person that you
                    could fire men’s ardour and endurance by your supervision, while
                    relieving their hardships by sharing the common lot, Happy those whose seal and
                    loyalty were known to you not at second-hand, by word of mouth, but through the
                    first-hand evidence of your own eyes!
