<p>48. And you yourself—awaiting and receiving everyone in
                    person—devote a large part of every day to so many cares of State, while
                    preserving the unhurried atmosphere of a life of leisure. So we gather round
                    you, no longer pale and terrified, slow of step as if in peril of our lives, but
                    carefree and happy, coming when it suits us. And having gained audience, we may
                    at times have something which seems urgent to keep us at home; we are always
                    excused by you, without having to find excuses. Knowing as you do how eager we
                    all are to see and frequent you, you are all the readier to make easy
                    opportunities in advance for this pleasure. Moreover, when our respects are
                    paid, there is no immediate flight to leave the hall empty—we stay behind
                    to linger on as if in a home we share, though this is the place where recently
                    that fearful monster built his defences with untold terrors, where lurking in
                    his den he licked up the blood of his murdered relatives<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_429_2" id="target_note_LCL059_429_2"><sup>2</sup></a> or emerged to
                    plot the massacre and destruction of his most distinguished subjects.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_429_3" id="target_note_LCL059_429_3"><sup>3</sup></a> Menaces and horror were the sentinels at his doors, and the
                    fears alike
