                    same modest demeanour as if it had been a private house, and everyone returned
                    home to repeat the sincere expression of a happiness which was wholly
                    spontaneous.</p>

<p>24. Such an entry would have overwhelmed another; but you became daily more
                    admirable, more perfect, such a prince in fact as others can only promise to be.
                    You alone have gained and grown in reputation through passage of time, for you
                    have two extremes combined and blended in your person, a beginnerâ€™s
                    modesty and the assurance of one long accustomed to command. You do not direct
                    your subjects to grovel at your feet, returning a kiss with no more than a
                    proffered hand; your lips keep their old courtesy now you are emperor, your hand
                    respects its proper use. You used to go on foot before, you still do now; you
                    delighted in hard work, and still delight; though fortune has changed all around
                    you, she changed nothing in yourself. When the prince moves among his subjects
                    they are free to stand still or approach him, to accompany him or pass ahead,
                    for you do not walk in our midst to confer a benefit by your presence, nor put
                    us in your debt if we enjoy your company. Anyone who approaches you can stay at
                    your side, and conversation lasts till it is ended by his discretion, not by any
                    loftiness of yours. We are ruled by you and subject to you, but no more than we
                    are to the laws, for these too must regulate our desires and passions, always
                    with us and among us. You shine out in splendour like Honour, like Sovereignty,
                    for these are always above mortal men and yet inseparable from them. Previous
