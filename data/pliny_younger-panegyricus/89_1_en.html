                    in you; for a man may deceive another, but no one can deceive himself, so long
                    as he looks closely at his life and asks himself what are his true deserts.
                    Moreover, our words carried conviction in the ears of the best of princes
                    through the very factor which made them unconvincing to his evil predecessors;
                    for though we went through the motions of affection before them, they could
                    never believe that they were genuinely liked. Furthermore, we prayed that the
                    gods should love you as you do ourselves, and who would say this of himself or
                    to his prince if either were only moderately loved? On our own account, the sum
                    of our prayers was simply that the gods should love us as you do. Amidst our
                    acclamation of yourself we declared ourselves happy too: has this not the ring
                    of truth? How could we be happier? Secure in our princeâ€™s love, we have
                    only to hope that the gods will love us in the same way. And so this city which
                    has always shown its devotion to religion and earned through piety the gracious
                    favour of the gods has only one thought for the completion of its happiness: the
                    gods must follow where Caesar shows the way.</p>
