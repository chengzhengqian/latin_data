                    status and inflamed by jealousy until it ends in open hatred; all the more
                    remarkable then must it appear when two women in the same position can share a
                    home without a sign of envy or rivalry. Their respect and consideration for each
                    other is mutual, and as each loves you with all her heart, they think it makes
                    no difference which of them stands first in your affection. United as they are
                    in the purpose of their daily life, nothing can be shown to divide them; their
                    one aim is to model themselves on your example, and consequently their habits
                    are the same, being formed after yours. Hence their quiet contentment and
                    untroubled serenity—they run no risk of being no more than your subjects,
                    for that is what they have always been. The Senate had offered them the title of
                        <span class="italic">Augusta?</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_521_1a" id="target_note_LCL059_521_1a"><sup>1</sup></a> which both
                    made haste to refuse, unwilling to bear it so long as <span class="italic">you</span>
                    refused to be known as the Father of your country, or else believing it a
                    greater honour to be spoken of simply as your wife and sister. But whatever the
                    reason for such modesty on their part, this is the title they deserve; this is
                    how we think of them in our hearts, the more because it is left unspoken.
                    Nothing can be more glorious for women than to value true distinction through
                    the opinion of the world instead of by the magnificence of titles, and to make
                    sure they are worthy of a great name though they may not wish to bear it.</p>
