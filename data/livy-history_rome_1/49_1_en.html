horseman galloped up to the king, and told him that <span class="marginNote right"><span class="sc">b.c.</span> 672–640</span>
the Albans were marching off. In this crisis Tullus vowed to establish twelve Salian priests,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL114_99_1" id="target_note_LCL114_99_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and to build shrines to Pallor and Panic. The horseman he reprimanded
in a loud voice, that the enemy might overhear
him, and ordered him to go back and fight; there was no occasion for alarm; it was by his own command that the Alban army was marching round, that they might attack the unprotected rear of the Fidenates. He also ordered the cavalry to raise their spears. This manœuvre hid the retreat of the Alban army from a large part of the Roman foot-soldiers; those who had seen it, believing what the king had been heard to say, fought all the more impetuously. The enemy in their turn now became alarmed; they had heard Tullus’s loud assertion, and many of the Fidenates,
having had Romans among them as colonists, knew Latin. And so, lest the Albans should suddenly charge down from the hills and cut them off from their town, they beat a retreat. Tullus pressed them hard, and having routed the wing composed of the Fidenates, returned, bolder than ever, to the Veientes, who were demoralized by the panic of their neighbours.
They, too, failed to withstand his attack, but their rout was stopped by the river in their rear. When they had fled thus far, some basely threw away their arms and rushed blindly into the water, others hesitated on the bank and were overtaken before they had made up their minds whether to flee or resist. Never before had the Romans fought a bloodier battle.</p>
