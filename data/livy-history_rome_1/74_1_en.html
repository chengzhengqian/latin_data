In this war the bravery and good fortune of Tullius were conspicuous; and when he had utterly defeated
the vast army of his enemies, he found on returning to Rome that his title to the kingship was no longer questioned, whether he tested the feeling of the Fathers or that of the commons. He then addressed himself to what is by far the most important
work of peace: as Numa had established religious law, so Servius intended that posterity should celebrate himself as the originator of all distinctions among the citizens, and of the orders which clearly differentiate the various grades of rank and fortune. For he instituted the census,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL114_149_2" id="target_note_LCL114_149_2"><sup>2</sup></a> a most useful thing for a government destined to such wide dominion, since it would enable the burdens of war and peace to be borne not indiscriminately, as heretofore,
but in proportion to men’s wealth. He then distributed the people into classes and centuries according to the following scale, which was based upon the census and was suitable either for peace or war:</p>
