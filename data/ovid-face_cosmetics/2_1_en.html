these times of ours. In feminine wise are your husbands made trim, and the bride has scarce aught to add to her smartness. They all dress up to please themselves, no matter what lover may be the quarry; but by being spruce they will never be wrong. They bury themselves in the country, and yet are trimming their locks; though lofty Athos hid them, lofty Athos would find them smart. There is pleasure, too, in self-satisfaction, whoeâ€™er one may be; dear to the heart of girls is their own beauty. The bird of Juno spreads out the feathers praised by man, and in its own beauty many a bird exults. Thus is love to be united rather than by strong herbs, which the hand of the sorceress gathers as she plies her terrible craft. Trust not to grasses nor to mixture of juices, nor attempt the noxious venom of an infatuated mare; snakes are not split in twain by Marsian spells,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL232_5_1" id="target_note_LCL232_5_1"><sup>1</sup></a> nor does the wave stream backward to its fount; and though one has clashed the bronze of Temese,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL232_5_2" id="target_note_LCL232_5_2"><sup>2</sup></a> the Moon will never be shaken from out her car.</p>
<p>Think first, ye women, to look to your behaviour. The face pleases when character commends. Love of character is lasting: beauty will be ravaged by age, and the face that charmed will be ploughed by wrinkles. The time will come, when it will vex you to look at a mirror, and grief will prove a second cause of wrinkles. Goodness endures and lasts for many a day, and throughout its years love securely rests thereon.</p>
