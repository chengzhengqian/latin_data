<p><span class="bold">1.</span> Conon the Athenian began his public career at
the time of the Peloponnesian war, and in that war<span class="marginNote right">413 <span class="sc">b.c.</span></span> he rendered important service; for he commanded the land forces with the rank of general, and as admiral of the fleet he did great deeds on the sea. In recognition of this an unusual honour was conferred upon him; he was given sole charge of all the islands, and while holding that commission<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL467_101_2" id="target_note_LCL467_101_2"><sup>2</sup></a> he took Pherae, a colony<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL467_101_3" id="target_note_LCL467_101_3"><sup>3</sup></a> of the Lacedaemonians.
