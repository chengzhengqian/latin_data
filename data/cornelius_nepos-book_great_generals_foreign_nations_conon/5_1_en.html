the expense of that of the great king.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL467_109_1" id="target_note_LCL467_109_1"><sup>1</sup></a> For since the famous naval battle that he had fought off Cnidos had given him high standing, not only with the barbarians, but with all the Greek states as well, he began to plot the restoration of Ionia and Aeolia to the Athenians.</p>
<p>Since his design was not concealed with sufficient care, Tiribazus, governor of Sardis, summoned Conon, pretending that he wished to send him to the king on a mission of importance. Conon obeyed the summons, but on his arrival he was thrown into prison and remained in confinement for some time. Then, as some writers say, he was taken to the king and there met his end; Dinon, on the contrary, an historian in whose account of Persian affairs we have the most confidence, has written that he made his escape; but he is in doubt whether it was with or without the connivance of Tiribazus.</p>
