Though Caesar himself suffered much because of the unnatural malice of Consul Antony, he showed a gallant steadfastness in withstanding him. Earthquakes were frequent. The shipsheds and many other things were struck by lightning. By the violence of a tornado a statue, which Marcus Cicero had placed before the temple-chamber of Minerva on the day before he was exiled by decree of the commons, fell on its face with its limbs detached and its shoulders arms, and head broken; this foretold disaster to Cicero himself. Bronze tablets were torn by the tornado from the temple of Loyalty. The doors of the temple of Wealth were broken. Trees were torn up by the roots, and many roofs were overturned. A meteor in the sky was seen to travel towards the west. A conspicuous star blazed up for seven days. Three suns shone, and around the lowest sun a wreath like the wreath of heads of grain flashed into view surrounding it, and afterward when the sun had been reduced to a single orb, its light was sickly for many months. In the temple of Castor some letters were struck from the names of the consuls Antony and Dolabella, which meant that both would be estranged from the fatherland. The howling of dogs was heard by night before the residence of the Chief Pontiff, and the fact that the largest dog was torn by the others foretold unseemly disgrace to Lepidus. At Ostia a school of fish was stranded on dry land when a flooding sea in turn receded. The Po overflowed, and when it returned within its banks, left a great abundance of vipers.
