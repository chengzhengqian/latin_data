<p>21. At Amiternum a boy was born with three feet. At Caura streams of blood flowed from the ground. When the Salassi inflicted a disaster on the Romans, the Board of Ten announced that they had found a provision in the Sibylline Books that, whenever the Romans were about to launch a campaign against Gauls, they were required to offer sacrifice in enemy territory. (<span class="italic">Summary</span> LIII; Dio XXII. fr. 74.; Orosius V. iv. 7 [293].)</p>

<p>22. Since there was famine and an epidemic, an observance of prayer was offered by the Board of Ten. At Luna a hermaphrodite was born, and on the instructions of the soothsayers was cast into the sea. There was such a plague among the people of Luna that though the corpses were lying about everywhere in civic areas, men to perform burial were lacking. In Macedonia a Roman army suffered losses in battle; against Viriathus another fought without success. (<span class="italic">Summaries</span> LIII and <span class="italic">Ox</span>. LIII; Orosius V. iv. 8â€“14 [293], but Orosius places the epidemic at Rome.)</p>

<p>23. At Praeneste and in Cephallenia it seemed that images had fallen from the sky. Mount Aetna showed much fire. This portent was expiated with forty full-grown victims. The year was peaceful after the defeat of Viriathus. (<span class="italic">Summary</span> LIV.)</p>
