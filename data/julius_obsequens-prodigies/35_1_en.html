<p>65a. When Pompey was marshalling his line of battle against Caesar in Macedonia and had summoned some peoples friendly to himself, lightning flashes gave them an unfavourable omen as they were advancing from Dyrrhacium. A swarm of bees on the standards foretold ruin. There were panics at night in the army. Pompey himself on the day before the battle dreamed that he was being received in his own theatre with great applause. Immediately afterward he was defeated in battle, and was put to death in Egypt. On that very day, it is well known that in many places statues turned about of their own accord, battle-cries and the clash of arms were heard at Antioch, so that twice the walls were manned; the same sounds were heard at Ptolema√Øs, and the noise of timbrels at Pergamum. A growing palm sprang up to full-grown size in Tralles in the temple of Victory, between the joints of the stones below the statue of Caesar. Gaius Cornelius, an augur, announced at Padua on that very day, since it was indicated by the birds, that the action was taking place, and that Caesar was conquering.
