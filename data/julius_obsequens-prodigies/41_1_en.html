A meteor reaching from south to north made night as <span class="marginNote right"><span class="sc">b.c.</span> 17</span>bright as the light of day. A tower in the gardens of Caesar by the Colline Gate was struck by lightning. The Romans under the deputy Marcus Lollius were trapped into ambushes by the Germans and suffered severely. (Disaster to Lollius, 16 <span class="sc">b.c.</span> , Dio LIV. xx. 4–6; Velleius II. 97; Suetonius, <span class="italic">Augustus</span> 23, cf. Tacitus, <span class="italic">Annals</span> I. 10.

<p>72. In Germany in the camp of Drusus, a swarm of bees settled on the tent of Hostilius Rufus, the prefect of the camp, in such a way that it enveloped the forward guy rope and the spear planted before the tent. The whole force of Romans was crushed in an ambush. (<span class="italic">Summary</span> CXLII, end; Pliny, <span class="italic">Natural History</span> XI. 18 (55). Since Pliny points out that the immediate sequel to the bees was success by Drusus, either Obsequens has picked on some details of Drusus’ campaign in order to support the conventional view that a swarm of bees is a bad omen, or else, as Rossbach suggests, the disaster was that of Varus, the lapse of time being disregarded.)</p>
