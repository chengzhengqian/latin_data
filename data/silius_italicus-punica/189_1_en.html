the conquest of Africa and the fall of Carthage—could confer on Fabius such glory as he reaped from the wrong done him by envy; for he conquered at the same time every obstacle—danger and Hannibal, resentment and jealousy—and he trod underfoot calumny and Fortune together.</p>
<p>When Hannibal saw the Romans rushing down from their high rampart, his ardour was shaken: he groaned, and his sanguine hopes of a crushing victory sank in a moment. For he had surrounded the army of Minucius with a serried ring of soldiers and hoped to destroy them by a shower of missiles from every side. And now the Roman general in that ill-judged battle had already in thought crossed the Styx to the place of eternal darkness<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL277_379_a" id="target_note_LCL277_379_a"><sup>a</sup></a>—for he was ashamed to look to Fabius for help—when the Dictator, surrounding the battle-field with his two flanks, hemmed in the Carthaginian rear with an outer circle, and now, from his outside position, blockaded those who had lately been blockaders. By grace of Hercules he seemed to rise higher as he fought and to grow in stature. The plume of his helmet flashed on high; and his frame was suddenly endued with marvellous strength and activity; he hurled spear after spear and assailed the enemy in their rear with clouds of darts. Thus the King of Pylus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL277_379_b" id="target_note_LCL277_379_b"><sup>b</sup></a> fought in his second stage of life, when youth was gone and old age not yet come.</p>
<p>On he rushed and slew Thuris and Butes, Naris and Arses, and Mahalces who had dared to face him, a famous warrior who had gained glory by his spear, Then he laid low Garadus and Adherbes of the long hair, and Thulis who towered above both armies and could grasp the topmost battlements on a lofty wall.
