strange pallor disfigured his youthful beauty; his shield fell from his loosened grasp, and the sleep of darkness stole over his eyes.</p>
<p>Cleadas, a descendant of Cadmus, had come to the wars from Tyrian Sidon, summoned by the entreaty of the daughter-city, and fought side by side with the Carthaginians, proud of his troop of archers from the East; jewels sparkled all over his golden helmet and golden collar. So sparkles Lucifer,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL277_383_a" id="target_note_LCL277_383_a"><sup>a</sup></a> when, refreshed by the waters of Ocean, he is approved by Venus and outshines the greater stars. Purple was his dress, and purple the housings of his steed; and on all his company glittered the precious dye that is steeped in the vats of Sidon.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL277_383_b" id="target_note_LCL277_383_b"><sup>b</sup></a> Brutus, eager for the fray, was burning to blot out such a famous name; but Cleadas mocked him, wheeling his horse lightly round in mazy circles, now to the right and now to the left; and then he shot a winged arrow over his shoulder, refusing in Persian<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL277_383_c" id="target_note_LCL277_383_c"><sup>c</sup></a> fashion to face his foe. Nor did he fail to hit: the keen arrow lodged, alas, right in the chin of Casca, the squire of Brutus; warmed with blood the point passed upwards, leaving a jagged wound, and forced the steel into the moist palate. But Brutus, troubled by the grievous plight of his friend, no longer tried to ride down Cleadas, as he ranged at large and sent out a shower of deadly arrows while pretending flight: he entrusted to his spear all the fierce anger of his heart, and launched the flying weapon with a thong<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL277_383_d" id="target_note_LCL277_383_d"><sup>d</sup></a>; and the point pierced his breast, where the collar with its row of pendants hung loose and left the neck exposed.
