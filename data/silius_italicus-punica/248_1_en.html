fighting Hannibal hand to hand? Did we not promise Rome that he should stand with fetters round his neck before your triumphal car? Alas for our country! Alas for our people who in their wickedness bestow their favour amiss!<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL278_49_a" id="target_note_LCL278_49_a"><sup>a</sup></a> Now that they are suffering such calamities, they will find no answer to this question: was Varro’s birth or Hannibal’s the worse calamity? and which should they have prayed Heaven to avert?” While Paulus spoke thus, Hannibal pressed hard on the flying Romans, and discharged all the spears of Carthage against their backs, in full view of Paulus. The consul’s helmet was struck and his shield battered; but on he rushed, none the less fiercely, into the centre of the foe.</p>
<p>But now, when Paulus had parted from him and gone to fight far away, Varro’s reason tottered. He pulled at the bridle and turned his horse round and said: “Rome, thou art punished now for having put Varro in command while Fabius still lived. But what means this divided mind, this change of fortune? Is it a trap laid for me by the Fates? I long to make an instant end of all things by taking my own life. But some god arrests my sword and keeps me alive that I may suffer even worse. Can I live and carry back to Rome these rods, broken and spattered with the blood of citizens? How shall I show my hated face through the towns of Italy?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL278_49_b" id="target_note_LCL278_49_b"><sup>b</sup></a> How shall I, a fugitive from battle, see Rome again? Hannibal himself could desire for me no more cruel punishment.”</p>
<p>Further protest was cut short by the approach of the enemy: their attack drove him back, and his war-horse with loosened rein carried him swiftly away.</p>
