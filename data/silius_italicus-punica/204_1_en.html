to battle! The consuls are changed. By the unwisdom of the Senate the heroic scion of Hercules<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL277_409_a" id="target_note_LCL277_409_a"><sup>a</sup></a> has laid down his arms, and you have to fight against a second Flaminius.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL277_409_b" id="target_note_LCL277_409_b"><sup>b</sup></a> I was sent to you—doubt it not—by the consort of the almighty Thunderer. Though I am honoured in the land of Italy as an immortal goddess, I was born of the seed of Belus, your ancestor. Make no delay; launch the thunderbolts of war with utmost speed, where Mount Garganus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL277_409_c" id="target_note_LCL277_409_c"><sup>c</sup></a> sinks down to the fields of Iapygia; the land is not far distant; straight to that point send your standards.” She ended, and her watery<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL277_409_d" id="target_note_LCL277_409_d"><sup>d</sup></a> image rose up to the clouds.</p>
<p>The general, revived by this pledge of glory to come, addressed her thus: “Nymph, glory of our nation, as sacred to me as any deity, be propitious and give a favourable issue to your promises. If I may fight a battle, I will set your image in a marble shrine on the citadel of Carthage, and dedicate beside it an image of Dido, and both shall be honoured alike.” Thus he spoke, and then swollen with pride encouraged his triumphant comrades. “Soldiers! messengers of death to Italy! Here is an end to heavy hearts and the lingering torture of inaction. We have appeased the anger of the gods, and they turn again to us. I announce to you that the command of Fabius, that pettifogger, is now at an end, and that the rods are borne before a new consul. Now let each of you renew his pledges to me, and make good the deeds of valour which you used to promise when debarred from fighting. See! a goddess of our country promises a future greater than our past. Pull up the standards, and let us follow the goddess to the field where the name of Diomede is of ill omen to Trojans.”</p>
