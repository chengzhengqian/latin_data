Do you, a consul, intend to leave behind a victorious foe and by this device, forsooth! to tear the Carthaginian from our throats? If he remains coolly where he is, refusing to follow you and your army to Africa, you will curse your short-sighted strategy when Rome is taken. But suppose that he does take fright and march his army away, and is willing to follow the sails of your fleet; even then he will surely be the same Hannibal, whose camp you saw from the walls of Rome.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL278_433_a" id="target_note_LCL278_433_a"><sup>a</sup></a>” Thus Fabius spoke, and the older senators expressed loud approval of his speech.</p>
<p>Then Scipio answered him: “In the hour when two noble generals fell together and the whole of Spain was occupied by Carthage and had come under her yoke, neither Fabius nor any one of those who share his opinions came to the rescue then. I faced that war-cloud, young as I was—I admit it—and I alone exposed my life when heaven was falling, and drew all the danger upon myself. Then the old men declared that it was a mistake to trust a mere boy as general; and the same prophet of evil who warns you to-day spoke then of foolhardiness. I praise and thank the gods whose power protects the race of Troy.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL278_433_b" id="target_note_LCL278_433_b"><sup>b</sup></a> That ‘boy,’ too young for service in the field and unripe for arms, that Scipio, recovered Spain for Rome and never suffered defeat; he routed the Carthaginians and followed the sun’s course to its setting beside Atlas, and expelled the name of Libya from the western world; nor did he withdraw his army from the land, until he saw the Sun-god unharnessing his reeking coursers by the Ocean upon Roman territory.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL278_433_c" id="target_note_LCL278_433_c"><sup>c</sup></a> Kings also he gained over as allies. Now Carthage alone remains, and the conquest of Carthage will crown my career; I know this
