the twofold tie between us: suffer the noble leader to pass safe through danger, and spare his life; let him not be taken captive, to carry Roman fetters. Also, let the walls of my city, though sorely battered, remain standing when the Carthaginian name has perished, and be preserved to honour me.”</p>
<p>Thus Juno spoke, and Jupiter answered her briefly thus: “I grant to the walls of lofty Carthage the reprieve you seek. Let them stand, in answer to your tears and entreaties. But hear how far your husband is able to grant your requests. The days of Carthage are numbered, and another Scipio<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL278_467_a" id="target_note_LCL278_467_a"><sup>a</sup></a> shall come, to raze to the ground the towers which for the present are safe. Further, let your prayer for Hannibal be granted: let him be rescued from the fray and continue to breathe the air of heaven. He will seek to throw the world into confusion and to fill the earth with renewed warfare. I know his heart, which can bring forth nothing but war. But I grant him life on one condition: he must never hereafter see the land of Saturn<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL278_467_b" id="target_note_LCL278_467_b"><sup>b</sup></a> and never again return to Italy. Snatch him away at once from imminent death; or else, if he joins in fierce battle on the broad plains, you may be unable to rescue him from the right hand of the young Roman general.”</p>
<p>While the Almighty Father thus fixed the doom of Carthage and of Hannibal, the armies began the battle, and their shouting challenged the stars. Never did the earth behold mightier nations in conflict or greater generals in command of their country’s armies. High was the prize of victory set before them—even all that the wide canopy of heaven covers. The Punic leader came forth, glittering in purple; and the head he bore so high was made higher
