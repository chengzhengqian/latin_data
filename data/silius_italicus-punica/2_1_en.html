second war<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL277_5_a" id="target_note_LCL277_5_a"><sup>a</sup></a> each nation strove to destroy and exterminate her rival, and those to whom victory was granted came nearer to destruction: in it a Roman general<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL277_5_b" id="target_note_LCL277_5_b"><sup>b</sup></a> stormed the citadel of Carthage, the Palatine was surrounded and besieged by Hannibal, and Rome made good her safety by her walls alone.</p>
