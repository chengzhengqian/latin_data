“in vain you seek to rouse my wrath and to escape captivity by death. You must go on living. Let him be guarded in close fetters.” Thus he spoke, proud of victory and the favour of Heaven.</p>
<p>But the senators and matrons of Rome repaired in haste to the temples, to worship the gods. With sad looks and streaming eyes, the band of women marched in long procession, and offered a robe to Juno and solemn vows. “Be present, O Queen of Heaven, we, thy chaste people, pray; and we, all the Roman women of noble name, bring thee a gift wondrous fair, which our own hands have woven and embroidered with threads of gold. This robe thou shalt wear for the present, O goddess, until mothers grow less fearful for their sons. But if thou dost grant us to drive the African storm-cloud away from our land, divers jewels, set in gold, shall adorn thy glittering crown.” They made special offerings also to Pallas and Phoebus, to the War-god, and to Dione<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL277_343_a" id="target_note_LCL277_343_a"><sup>a</sup></a> above all.

Intoxicated by success, he made sure of victory as soon as the armies met: “On! on!”
