with fury the mettled steed, another the charioteer. Some are zealous for horses of their own country, others for the fame of some ancient stud. One man is filled with joyful hope for an animal that is racing for the first time, while another prefers the green old age of a well-tried veteran. At the start, <span class="italic">Lampon</span>,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL278_411_a" id="target_note_LCL278_411_a"><sup>a</sup></a> bred in Gallicia, left the rest behind; he rushed through the air with the flying car, galloping over the course with huge strides and leaving the winds behind him. The crowd roared with applause, thinking that with such a start their favourite had as good as won. But those who looked deeper and had more experience of the race-course, blamed the driver for putting forth all his strength at the beginning: from a distance they uttered vain protests, that he was tiring out his team with his efforts and keeping no reserve of power. “Whither are you careering too eagerly, Cyrnus?”—Cyrnus was the charioteer—“Be prudent! Put down your whip and tighten your reins!” But alas, his ears were deaf: on he sped, unsparing of his horses, and forgetting how much ground had still to be covered.</p>
<p>Next came <span class="italic">Panchates</span>, a chariot-length and no more behind the leader. Bred in Asturia,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL278_411_b" id="target_note_LCL278_411_b"><sup>b</sup></a> he was conspicuous for the white forehead and four white feet of his sires. Though high-mettled, he was low of stature and lacked comeliness; but now his fiery spirit lent him wings, and he sped over the plain, impatient of the reins; he seemed to grow in stature and size as he ran. His driver, Hiberus, was gay with scarlet of Cinyphian<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL278_411_c" id="target_note_LCL278_411_c"><sup>c</sup></a> dye.</p>
<p>Third in order, neck and neck with <span class="italic">Pelorus</span>, ran</p>

The four drivers were: (1) Cyrnus; (2) Hiberus; (3) Durius; (4) Atlas. By an odd convention only one horse in each team is named: these are: (1) Lampon; (2) Panchates; (3) Pelorus; (4) Caucasus.
