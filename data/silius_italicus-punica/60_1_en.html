barred by snow, and crags that reach the sky; we must face the labour that brought the sweat to the brow of Alcides and made his stepmother<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL277_121_a" id="target_note_LCL277_121_a"><sup>a</sup></a> marvel; we must face the Alps, a sharper ordeal than war. But, if Fortune withhold her promised favour and frown on my enterprise, I should wish you long life and peaceful old age; your youth deserves that the unhasting Fates should prolong your threads beyond my span.”</p>
<p>Thus he spoke, and Imilce answered him. She was descended from Castalius,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL277_121_b" id="target_note_LCL277_121_b"><sup>b</sup></a> a man of Cirrha, who named his city, Castulo, after his mother, and it still keeps the name of Apollo’s priest. Thus Imilce traced her pedigree to a sacred stock. When Bacchus was conquering the Spanish peoples and attacking Calpe with the staves and spears of his Maenads, Milichus was born of a lustful Satyr and the nymph Myrice, and had held wide dominion in his native land; and horns, like those of his father, grew upon his forehead.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL277_121_c" id="target_note_LCL277_121_c"><sup>c</sup></a> From him Imilce drew her nationality and noble blood; but the name of Milichus had suffered a slight corruption in the native speech. Thus she then began with slowly dropping tears: “Do you forget that my life depends on yours? Do you reject me as a partner of your enterprise? Does our union, do our first nuptial joys, make you believe that I, your wife, would fall back when climbing with you the frozen mountains? Doubt not a woman’s hardihood; no danger is too great for wedded love to face. But if you judge me by sex alone, and are determined to leave me, I yield indeed and will not stay the course of destiny. I pray God to bless you.
