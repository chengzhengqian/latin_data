the battle. Make haste, I implore you, to prepare a scene fit for him to behold, by covering the field with corpses. All the Roman generals who could inspire fear<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL278_373_a" id="target_note_LCL278_373_a"><sup>a</sup></a> have been overthrown by my brother; their only hope now is Livius, and he, aged by his condemnation and seclusion,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL278_373_b" id="target_note_LCL278_373_b"><sup>b</sup></a> is now at your mercy, a doomed victim. Go forward manfully, I entreat you! Lay low the general against whom Hannibal would be ashamed to fight, and put a merciful end to his dishonoured old age.”</p>
<p>Nero on his side spoke thus: “Soldiers, why hesitate to end the struggle of this tremendous war? You have gained great glory by your march; now complete your enterprise by valour in the field. You left your camp and robbed it of its strength for no sufficient reason, unless victory justifies the deed. Be first to reap the glory; men will always tell how the enemy was defeated by your arrival.”</p>

Fill with your bodies the passage opened up by my sword, and close once for all with the steel the Alps that offer too easy a passage to Punic invaders. If we fail to overthrow their ranks with a speedy victory, and if Hannibal, the thunderbolt of Carthage, comes up suddenly, what god can save a single one of us from the shades below?” Then he put his helmet on, and made good his threats with his sword, and fought amain with his grey head covered. Where the ranks of the foe stood thickest on the field, he slew a man for every javelin he cast;</p>
