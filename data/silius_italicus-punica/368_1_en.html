<p>—Entella, a name dear to Trojan Acestes.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL278_289_a" id="target_note_LCL278_289_a"><sup>a</sup></a> Nor was Thapsus backward, nor the men of Acrae, descending from their icy heights. From Agyrium men came flocking, and from Tyndaris that boasts of the Spartan Twins.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL278_289_b" id="target_note_LCL278_289_b"><sup>b</sup></a> Hilly Acragas sent a troop of a thousand horse, whose neighings made the air hot and rolled a cloud of dust to the sky. Their leader was Grosphus, upon whose shield a fierce bull was engraved, in memory of an ancient punishment.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL278_289_c" id="target_note_LCL278_289_c"><sup>c</sup></a> When men’s bodies were roasted over a fire in the bull, their cries took the sound of a bull bellowing; and one might believe that the sounds were produced by real cattle driven from their stalls. But punishment followed; for the inventor of this inhuman contrivance died in the bull he had made, lowing pitifully. Gela, named after a river, came; Halaesa came, and Palaeca that punishes perjured men with sudden death<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL278_289_d" id="target_note_LCL278_289_d"><sup>d</sup></a>; and Trojan Acesta; and the Acis which flows to the sea through the territory of Etna and bathes the grateful seanymph<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL278_289_e" id="target_note_LCL278_289_e"><sup>e</sup></a> with its sweet waters. (Acis was once a lover and a rival of Polyphemus; and, while fleeing from the clownish rage of the furious giant, was turned into a stream of water; thus he escaped his enemy, and mixed his stream in triumph with Galatea’s flood.) There came too those who drink of Hypsa and Alabis, loud-sounding rivers, and the transparent waters of shining Achates; men came from winding Chrysa and scanty Hipparis and the Pantagias whose slender stream is easily crossed, and from the yellow waters of fast-flowing Symaethus.</p>
