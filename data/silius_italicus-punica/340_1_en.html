<p>But here Taurea,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL278_233_a" id="target_note_LCL278_233_a"><sup>a</sup></a> brave in defiance—I cannot think it right to conceal a noble deed, even if done by an enemy—shouted out in anger: “Will you take with the steel the life of one greater than yourself, and take it with impunity? Shall the lictor do your bidding and lay the severed head of a hero before the feet of cowards?
