Go and prosper! Go with favouring gods and prayers! And amid the battles and the blaze of arms, remember to keep in mind the wife and child whom you leave behind. For I fear the Romans, with their weapons and their firebrands, less than I fear you: you rush fiercely right upon the swords, and expose your life to the missiles, nor does any successful feat of arms content you; your ambition, unlike that of other men, knows no bounds; and you think a peaceful death an inglorious end for a soldier. Trembling takes hold of my limbs; and yet I dread no man who shall meet you in single combat. But thou, O Father of battles,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL277_123_a" id="target_note_LCL277_123_a"><sup>a</sup></a> have pity, and turn away evil from us, and preserve that life from all assaults of the Trojans<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL277_123_b" id="target_note_LCL277_123_b"><sup>b</sup></a>!”</p>

I am driven on by the spirit of my father that rebukes me in the darkness of night; that altar and that dreadful sacrifice<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL277_123_c" id="target_note_LCL277_123_c"><sup>c</sup></a> stand clear before my sight; and my brief and changeful span forbids me to defer the date.
