and Phalantus were hardy veterans both; but Hannibal slew the first in close combat and Gracchus the second, each general fighting in full view of his rival.

Boiling with rage, Gracchus cried to him: “Rash man, leave here the sight that still remains in that fierce face and gleams from that mutilated brow.” With these words he threw his spear with a strong straight cast, and the whole point passed through the threatening eye.

The Spaniards were nimble in attack, and the Moors yet more nimble in their movements. Roman javelins and African spears vied in covering the sky with a thick cloud, and all the level ground, as far as the river-banks, was hidden by the hurtling missiles; and in that closepacked
