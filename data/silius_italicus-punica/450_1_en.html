permitted to die, but kept alive to grace the triumphal procession to Jupiter’s temple; how Carthage was dismayed and shattered by the repeated retreats of the cowardly Hasdrubal, who was now master of the state. With sorrow they told how they had seen two camps burning in the silence of night, and all Africa lit up with evil flames. Scipio (they said) moved with lightning speed, and threatened that, while Hannibal lingered on the Bruttian coast, he would destroy Carthage with fatal fires, and Hannibal would have no country to return to, bringing his mighty deeds with him. When they had spoken thus and revealed their disasters and fears, they wept and kissed his hand as if it were a god’s.</p>
<p>The general listened with a fixed and stern countenance. He kept silence and pondered anxiously in his heart, considering whether Carthage was worth so great a sacrifice. And then he spoke thus: “How dreadful the doom that waits on mortal men! how envy ever stunts the growth of great deeds and nips them in the bud! Long ago I might have overthrown Rome and sacked the city and levelled her with the ground; I might have carried her people away into slavery and dictated conditions of peace. But I was refused money and weapons and fresh recruits for my army which victories had worn out<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL278_453_a" id="target_note_LCL278_453_a"><sup>a</sup></a>; and Hanno thought fit to cheat my soldiers even of bread to eat; and now all Africa is wreathed with fire, and the Roman lance beats on the gates of Carthage. Hannibal is now the glory of his country and her only rock of refuge; their one remaining hope is in my right arm. I shall march away, as the senate has decreed; I shall save the walls of Carthage and at the same time save Hanno.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL278_453_b" id="target_note_LCL278_453_b"><sup>b</sup></a></p>
