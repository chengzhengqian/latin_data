<p>abundance—so favoured were they then by Fortune; their garments, even those worn by men, were dyed with Assyrian<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL278_105_a" id="target_note_LCL278_105_a"><sup>a</sup></a> purple; their princely banquets began at noon, and the rising sun found them at their revels; and their way of life was defiled by every stain. Moreover, the senators oppressed the people, the masses welcomed the unpopularity of the senate, and civil discord made the parties clash. Meanwhile the old men, more corrupt themselves, outdid the headstrong follies of the young. Men notorious for humble birth and obscure origin asserted their claims, expecting and demanding to hold office before others, and to rule the sinking state. Then too, it was their ancient custom to enliven their banquets with bloodshed, and to combine with their feasting the horrid sight of armed men fighting; often the combatants fell dead above the very cups of the revellers, and the tables were stained with streams of blood.</p>
<p>Thus demoralized was Capua, when Pacuvius, a man whose name is known only because of his misdeeds, worked cunningly upon the minds of the citizens, in order to make them more eager to join the Carthaginians. He urged them to demand of Rome what he knew that Rome would never grant—indeed he did not wish it to be granted—that Capua should claim an equal share in the highest office<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL278_105_b" id="target_note_LCL278_105_b"><sup>b</sup></a> and that the rods should pass in turn from one consul to the other.

Their chief was Virrius, an eloquent speaker but a man of low origin and second to none in violence.
