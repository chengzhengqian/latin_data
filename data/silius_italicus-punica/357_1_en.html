come to an end of her suffering: the water rushes madly forth from dark furnaces, bringing up calcined rocks to the surface and lashing her face with burning stones. That other, whose heart-strings are gnawed by an eagle’s beak,—hark to the sound of flapping wings with which the armour-bearer of Jove returns to its meal,—is Tarpeia, a maiden guilty of a monstrous crime. She loved gold, and for its sake betrayed the citadel<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL278_267_a" id="target_note_LCL278_267_a"><sup>a</sup></a> to the enemy, and opened the gates to the Sabines who had promised to reward her.
