Laelius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL278_359_a" id="target_note_LCL278_359_a"><sup>a</sup></a> was the pride and glory of Rome, a man to whom bountiful Nature gave every gift and on whom every god smiled. When he spoke in the market-place and opened his eloquent lips, his words were as sweet as the honey that fell from the mouth of Nestor,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL278_359_b" id="target_note_LCL278_359_b"><sup>b</sup></a> the ancient king of Pylos.
