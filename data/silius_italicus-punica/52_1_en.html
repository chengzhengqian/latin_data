ancient city of the Rutulians.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL277_105_a" id="target_note_LCL277_105_a"><sup>a</sup></a> They throw on the pile all that the conquered still possess, and their shields too and swords that could not save; and they dig up from the bowels of the earth hoards buried in time of war, and with joy and pride consign the conqueror’s booty to the all-devouring flames.</p>
<p>When the fatal Fury saw this pile, she brandished the torch that was dipped in the fiery waves of Phlegethon<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL277_105_b" id="target_note_LCL277_105_b"><sup>b</sup></a>;
and she hid the gods above with the darkness of Hell. Then the people, ever unconquered, began a work, which glory in defeat keeps famous for ever throughout the world. First Tisiphone, resenting a father’s<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL277_105_c" id="target_note_LCL277_105_c"><sup>c</sup></a> half-hearted stroke, pushed the hilt forward in triumph and drove in the reluctant sword, and cracked her hellish scourge again and again with hideous noise. Against their will men stain their hands with kindred blood; they marvel at the crime they have committed with loathing, and weep over the wickedness they have wrought. One man, distraught with rage and the madness of disaster and extreme suffering, turns a sidelong glanced at the breast of his mother. Another, snatching an axe and aiming it at the neck of his loved wife, reproaches himself and curses his unfinished crime, and, as if paralysed, throws his weapon down. Yet he is not suffered to escape; for the Fury repeats her blows, and breathes black passion into him with her hissing mouth. Thus there is an end of all wedded love: the husband has forgotten the joys of his marriage-bed,
and remembers his bride no more. Another, exerting all his strength, throws a suffering body into the flames where the crest of the dark-rolling
fire sends up thick smoke and pitchy blackness.</p>
