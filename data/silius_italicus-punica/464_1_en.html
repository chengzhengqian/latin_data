not with them; I hear their groans and their cries to Hannibal to help them. What river of Tartarus will ever purge away my guilt?” Even as he poured forth this complaint, he looked to the sword in his right hand<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL278_481_a" id="target_note_LCL278_481_a"><sup>a</sup></a> in his passionate desire for death.</p>
<p>Then Juno took pity upon him. Putting on the likeness of a shepherd, she suddenly emerged from a shady grove, and addressed him thus while he had in mind a dishonourable death: “For what purpose came you here, a man in arms, to our peaceful woodlands? Seek you the stern battle, in which great Hannibal is defeating the remnant of the Romans? If speed is your desire and you seek to get there quickly, I will guide you by a neighbouring path to the midst of the combat.” He assented, and loaded the shepherd with promises of rich reward, saying that the rulers of mighty Carthage would give a great recompense and that he himself would be no less generous. Starting forward, he moved with great bounds over the surrounding plain; but Juno in disguise led him by a circuitous way, and, misdirecting him, earned no gratitude by saving his life against his will.</p>

Some thought he had been slain by the sword; others, that he had abandoned the battle in despair, unable to cope with the ill-will of the gods. On came Scipio and drove them in flight all over the plain; and now even the towers of Carthage trembled. When her armies were routed, all Africa was filled with terror and confusion: flying, not fighting, panic-stricken men rushed with utmost speed to the most distant shores.
