Therefore he was in eager haste to further the designs of Carthage; nor did he postpone his crime but made a new treaty at once, stipulating that Hannibal, having conquered Rome, should withdraw from Sicily.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL278_281_b" id="target_note_LCL278_281_b"><sup>b</sup></a> But retribution was at hand, and the Fury denied him a grave<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL278_281_c" id="target_note_LCL278_281_c"><sup>c</sup></a> in that very soil from which he had just bargained that his ally should be excluded.
