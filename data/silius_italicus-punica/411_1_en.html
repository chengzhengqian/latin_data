<p>and before him fled in disorder Macae and warlike Autololes and the long-haired warriors from the Rhone.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL278_375_a" id="target_note_LCL278_375_a"><sup>a</sup></a></p>
<p>Nabis who came from the prophetic sands of Ammon<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL278_375_b" id="target_note_LCL278_375_b"><sup>b</sup></a> fought there with foul weapons.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL278_375_c" id="target_note_LCL278_375_c"><sup>c</sup></a> He had no fear of death, thinking that his god protected him; and he had vowed, in his pride and folly, to fasten upon the temple of his nation trophies taken from Italy. His blue mantle was bright with Garamantian gems which twinkled like the stars scattered through the sky; his helmet blazed with jewels and his shield with gold.

Now too he had driven his weapon with a great shout through the shield and body of Sabellus, and was carrying off his victim in triumph and calling in triumph on the name of Ammon. But the aged consul saw it and resented such fierceness and such arrogance in the heart of the barbarian: hurling his javelin, he robbed Nabis of his victim and his life at one blow, and proved victorious over the victor.</p>
<p>Hasdrubal heard with grief the cry with which Nabis fell, and hastened up.
