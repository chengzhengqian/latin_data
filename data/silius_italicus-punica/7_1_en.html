Thunder-god. Ah! what wild storm is this that rages with sudden downpour, while the sky is rent asunder and the fiery ether flashes! The gods are preparing mighty things, the throne of high heaven thunders, and I see Jupiter in arms.” Then Juno forbade her to learn more of coming events, and the victims suddenly became dumb. The dangers and the endless hardships were concealed.</p>
<p>So Hamilcar left his design of war concealed in his secret heart, and made for Calpe and Gades,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL277_15_a" id="target_note_LCL277_15_a"><sup>a</sup></a> the limit of the world; but, while carrying the standards of Africa to the Pillars of Hercules, he fell in a hard-fought battle.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the direction of affairs was handed over to Hasdrubal<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL277_15_b" id="target_note_LCL277_15_b"><sup>b</sup></a>; and he harried with savage cruelty the wealth of the western world, the people of Spain, and the dwellers beside the Baetis.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL277_15_c" id="target_note_LCL277_15_c"><sup>c</sup></a> Hard was the general’s heart, and nothing could mitigate his ferocious temper; power he valued because it gave him the opportunity to be cruel. Thirst for blood hardened his heart; and he had the folly to believe that to be feared is glory. Nor was he willing to sate his rage with ordinary punishments. Tagus, a man of ancient race, remarkable for beauty and of proved valour, Hasdrubal, defying gods and men, fastened high on a wooden cross, and displayed in triumph to the sorrowing natives the unburied body of their king. Tagus, who had taken his name from the gold-bearing river, was mourned by the Nymphs of Spain through all their caves and banks; nor would he have preferred the river of Maeonia<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL277_15_d" id="target_note_LCL277_15_d"><sup>d</sup></a> and the pools of Lydia, nor the plain watered by flowing gold and turned yellow by the sands of Hermus pouring over it.
