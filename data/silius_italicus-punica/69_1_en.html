refuse life except in arms. For war is their only reason for living, and they scorn a peaceful existence.</p>
<p>Then Astyr,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL277_139_a" id="target_note_LCL277_139_a"><sup>a</sup></a> the ill-starred squire of Eastern Memnon, came; wetted by Aurora’s tears, he had fled far from his native land to the opposite quarter of the world. The horses of the Astyrians are small and not notable in battle; yet they amble without shaking their rider, or with docile neck can draw a carriage with speed in time of peace. They were led by Cydnus, eager to scour the heights of the Pyrenees in the chase, or to fight from a distance with Moorish javelin.</p>
<p>The Celts who have added to their name that of the Hiberi<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL277_139_b" id="target_note_LCL277_139_b"><sup>b</sup></a> came also. To these men death in battle is glorious; and they consider it a crime to burn the body of such a warrior; for they believe that the soul goes up to the gods in heaven, if the body is devoured on the field by the hungry vulture.</p>
<p>Rich Gallicia sent her people, men who have knowledge concerning the entrails of beasts, the flight of birds, and the lightnings of heaven; they delight, at one time, to chant the rude songs of their native tongue, at another to stamp the ground in the dance and clash their noisy shields in time to the music. Such is the relaxation and sport of the men, and such their solemn rejoicings. All other labour is done by the women: the men think it unmanly to throw seed into the furrow and turn the soil by pressure of the plough; but the wife of the Gallician is never still and performs every task but that of stern war. These men, and the Lusitanians<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL277_139_c" id="target_note_LCL277_139_c"><sup>c</sup></a> drawn forth from their distant forests, were led by the young Viriathus—Viriathus, whose name was to win fame from Roman disasters at a later day.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL277_139_d" id="target_note_LCL277_139_d"><sup>d</sup></a></p>
