<p>Then, when the Roman general ordered that the gates should not be fired and the walls should be left standing—such moderation did him honour—the soldiers put away swords and fire-brands. From the temples of the gods and from houses glittering with gold, booty was brought forth in abundance, and all the appliances of luxurious living, and the delights that had brought ruin to their possessors—womanish garments stripped from the backs of men,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL278_231_b" id="target_note_LCL278_231_b"><sup>b</sup></a> tables imported from foreign lands,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL278_231_c" id="target_note_LCL278_231_c"><sup>c</sup></a> and cups whose orient pearls whetted the taste for extravagance.

There were long processions of slaves everywhere; and money enough to carry on a protracted war was taken from private houses; and the hordes of menials who had waited at the banquets of the rich were past counting.</p>
