<p>Far back in history, and hidden in deep darkness by the uncertain report of antiquity, lies the answer to this question: why should the Italians consecrate a temple to a Phoenician deity, and why should Dido’s sister be worshipped in the country of the Aeneadae? But I shall repeat the legend from the beginning, keeping my tale within strict limits, and briefly recalling the past.</p>
<p>When Dido was deserted by her Trojan guest<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL277_397_b" id="target_note_LCL277_397_b"><sup>b</sup></a> and hope was utterly dead, she hastened in frenzy to the fatal pyre within the palace.

Who would help her in her need, when that king of the Numidians spread terror far and wide? It chanced that Battus then ruled Cyrene with gentle sway—Battus, a kindly man and ready to give a tear to human suffering.
