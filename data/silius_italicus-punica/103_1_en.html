assembled. Now let the Roman leaders make a treaty with me; now let them insist upon their contracts and covenants! And you,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL277_207_a" id="target_note_LCL277_207_a"><sup>a</sup></a> whose life was spared in the battle, life that was no boon, so, so may you live on and again confer this glory on your son! When life ends and Fate summons you, may death in battle be denied you! To fall fighting belongs to Hannibal.” Thus he cried in his fury. Then, impatient of delay, he sent light-armed Massylian squadrons to the verge of the Roman camp, to provoke the foe and draw him forth.</p>
<p>The Roman soldiers too were ashamed to owe their safety to their stockade, or to let the spears strike against the closed gates of the camp. They sallied forth; and, when the rampart was levelled, the consul, worthy descendant of the Gracchi, rushed out before them all. The wind blew out the horse-hair plume of his Auruncan<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL277_207_b" id="target_note_LCL277_207_b"><sup>b</sup></a> helmet, and the scarlet cloak that had graced his ancestors was conspicuous on his shoulder. Looking back on the ranks, he summoned them with a loud voice; and wherever a mass of foemen
in close formation met him, he burst his way through and sped along the plain. Even so a roaring torrent falls headlong from the summit of Pindus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL277_207_c" id="target_note_LCL277_207_c"><sup>c</sup></a> to the plain; with a mighty noise it tears away a side of the mountain and rolls it down; all the cattle in its path, the wild beasts, and the forests, are swept along; and the foaming waters are loud in the rocky valleys.</p>
<p>Even if I could reproduce the glorious voice of Homer,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL277_207_d" id="target_note_LCL277_207_d"><sup>d</sup></a> and if Father Phoebus granted me to speak with a hundred tongues, I could not set forth all the victims slain by the arm of the great consul or by the furious rage of his Carthaginian opponent. Murranus
