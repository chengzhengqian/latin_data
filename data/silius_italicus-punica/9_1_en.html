that well became him; his heart equipped with guile, and his native eloquence.</p>
<p>The Libyans<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL277_19_a" id="target_note_LCL277_19_a"><sup>a</sup></a> were first to hail him with applause as their leader, and the Pyrenean tribes and warlike Spaniards followed them. At once his heart swelled with pride and satisfaction that so much of land and sea had come under his sway. Libya lies under the burning sign of Cancer, and is parched by the south winds of Aeolus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL277_19_b" id="target_note_LCL277_19_b"><sup>b</sup></a> and the sun’s disk. It is either a huge offshoot of Asia, or a third continent of the world. It is bounded on the rosy east by the river of Lagus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL277_19_c" id="target_note_LCL277_19_c"><sup>c</sup></a> which strikes the swollen sea with seven streams. But, where the land in milder mood faces the opposing Bears,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL277_19_d" id="target_note_LCL277_19_d"><sup>d</sup></a> it is cut off by the straits of Hercules, and, though parted from them, looks on the lands of Europe from its adjacent heights; the ocean blocks its further extension, and Atlas<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL277_19_ea" id="target_note_LCL277_19_ea"><sup>e</sup></a> forbids its name to be carried further—Atlas, who would bring down the sky, if he withdrew his shoulders. His cloud-capt head supports the stars, and his soaring neck for ever holds aloft the firmament of heaven. His beard is white with frost, and pine-forests crown his brow with their vast shade; winds ravage his hollow temples, and foaming rivers rush down from his streaming open jaws. Moreover, the deep seas assail the cliffs on both his flanks, and, when the weary Titan<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL277_19_f" id="target_note_LCL277_19_f"><sup>f</sup></a> has bathed his panting steeds, hide his flaming car in the steaming ocean. But, where Africa spreads her untilled
plains, the burnt-up land bears nothing but the poison of snakes in plenty; though, where a temperate strip blesses the fields, her fertility is not surpassed by the crops of Henna<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL277_19_g" id="target_note_LCL277_19_g"><sup>g</sup></a> nor by the Egyptian
