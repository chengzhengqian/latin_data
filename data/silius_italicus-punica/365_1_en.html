He flew all over the field—it seemed like a contest of men against women—and enriched with blood the fields that Ceres loves. The enemy fell in heaps, and the speed of battle made it impossible for any to escape death by flight. For whenever a fugitive hoped to save his life, Marcellus was before him and barred the way with his sword. “On, on!” he cried; “mow down this feeble folk and lay them low with the steel”; and he pushed the laggards on with the boss of his shield. “Cowards stand before you, men who have learnt to endure easy bouts of wrestling in the shade, and who delight to oil their limbs till they glisten; and those who conquer them in battle get little glory.
