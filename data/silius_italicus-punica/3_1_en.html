for a fresh conflict. When she upset all things on earth and was preparing to stir up the sea, she found a sufficient instrument in a single leader.</p>
<p>Now warlike Hannibal clothed himself with all the wrath of the goddess; his single arm she dared to match against destiny. Then, rejoicing in that man of blood, and aware of the fierce storm of disasters in store for the realm of Latinus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL277_7_a" id="target_note_LCL277_7_a"><sup>a</sup></a> she spoke thus: “In defiance of me, the exile from Troy<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL277_7_b" id="target_note_LCL277_7_b"><sup>b</sup></a> brought Dardania<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL277_7_c" id="target_note_LCL277_7_c"><sup>c</sup></a> to Latium, together with his household gods—deities that were twice taken prisoners<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL277_7_d" id="target_note_LCL277_7_d"><sup>d</sup></a>; and he gained a victory and founded a kingdom for the Teucrians at Lavinium. That may pass—provided that the banks of the Ticinus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL277_7_ea" id="target_note_LCL277_7_ea"><sup>e</sup></a> cannot contain the Roman dead, and that the Trebia, obedient to me, shall flow backwards through the fields of Gaul, blocked by the blood of Romans and their weapons and the corpses of men; provided that Lake Trasimene
shall be terrified by its own pools darkened with streams of gore, and that I shall see from heaven Cannae, the grave of Italy, and the Iapygian plain inundated with Roman blood, while the Aufidus, doubtful of its course as its banks close in, can hardly force a passage to the Adriatic shore through shields and helmets and severed limbs of men.” With these words she fired the youthful warrior for deeds of battle.</p>
<p>By nature he was eager for action and faithless to his plighted word, a past master in cunning but a strayer from justice. Once armed, he had no respect for Heaven; he was brave for evil and despised the glory of peace; and a thirst for human blood burned
Hannibal over the Romans in Italy: (1) on the Ticinus; (2) on the Trebia; (3) at Lake Trasimene; (4) at Cannae, by the river Aufidus.
