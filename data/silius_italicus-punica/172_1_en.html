They summon to arms the old and feeble, unworthy antagonists for us. All whom you see now are the refuse—men discarded as useless when the war began. Where are now the Gracchi, and where are the two Scipios,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL277_345_a" id="target_note_LCL277_345_a"><sup>a</sup></a> the thunderbolts of their nation? Behold! Hunted out of Italy, they never paused in their cowardly flight until terror drove them to the Ocean and the World’s End<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL277_345_b" id="target_note_LCL277_345_b"><sup>b</sup></a>; each is now a wandering exile, and keeps to the banks of the Iberus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL277_345_c" id="target_note_LCL277_345_c"><sup>c</sup></a> in dread of my name.
