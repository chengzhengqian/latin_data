Neither Herbesos nor Naulocha sat idle, indifferent to the crisis; nor did Morgentia of the leafy plains abstain from traitorous war; Amastra came forward, together with Menae and Tisse unknown to fame; Netum and Mutyce and the soldiers of the river Achaetus. Aid came to the Carthaginians from Drepane, from the Helorus whose stream is heard afar, and from Triocala, laid waste later in the Servile War.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL278_293_b" id="target_note_LCL278_293_b"><sup>b</sup></a> On the same side was bold Arbela, and hilly Ietas; Tabas skilled in arms, and little Cossyra, no larger than Megara, fought side by side; also the island of Gaulum, a fair sight when it resounds with the halcyon’s song and her floating nest rides on the smooth surface of the unruffled sea.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL278_293_c" id="target_note_LCL278_293_c"><sup>c</sup></a> Syracuse herself, that famous city, had filled her spacious walls with mustered troops and arms of every kind.
