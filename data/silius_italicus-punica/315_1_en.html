<p>Hannibal pause: seeking a reputation for humanity, he gave burial to Gracchus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL278_183_a" id="target_note_LCL278_183_a"><sup>a</sup></a> though rejoicing at his death. For Gracchus, while seeking by means of a conference to gain the adherence of the false Lucanians, had been treacherously and foully slain by his host; encompassed by hidden guile he had been murdered, and Hannibal snatched at the credit of giving him burial.</p>
<p>But when it was known that Hannibal was hastening to Capua, no stone was left unturned. Both consuls<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL278_183_b" id="target_note_LCL278_183_b"><sup>b</sup></a> flew to the spot, and all the forces from Nola; the younger Fabius brought his men with speed from Arpi; Nero from one quarter and swift Silanus from another urged their armies on night and day for instant battle. From all sides they assembled; and Rome was resolved to pit all her generals against that one young commander. He himself encamped aloft on Mount Tifata, the height that rises close by the walls of Capua, and looked down thence upon the city below. But now, when he saw himself surrounded by so many armies, and the city of his allies<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL278_183_c" id="target_note_LCL278_183_c"><sup>c</sup></a> blockaded, so that it was impossible either for him to enter or for the Capuans to sally forth, he was troubled for the issue. At one time he thought of shattering every obstacle with the sword; or again he might swerve from his present purpose, and devise some stratagem to draw that great host away from the closed gates and set free the beleaguered city. Thus then he spoke to himself, and thus he turned over his anxious thoughts: â€œWhither does my wavering purpose summon me? Shall I face the risk again, though the lie of the land is against me? Shall I turn my back, with Capua looking on? Or shall I sit here close by on the mountain and suffer the city
