with blackened breast and Grief and Pain; and all the Avengers<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL277_101_a" id="target_note_LCL277_101_a"><sup>a</sup></a> were there; and the sleepless guardian<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL277_101_b" id="target_note_LCL277_101_b"><sup>b</sup></a> of the dismal dwelling bayed from his triple throat. At once the Fiend changed her shape and took the likeness of Tiburna and her gait withal and the sound of her voice. Tiburna, robbed of her husband, Murrus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL277_101_c" id="target_note_LCL277_101_c"><sup>c</sup></a> was mourning for her marriage-bed made empty by war and the fierce blast of battle; she was of noble birth and derived her name from the blood of Daunus.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL277_101_d" id="target_note_LCL277_101_d"><sup>d</sup></a> The Fury assumed her likeness and then, with hair dishevelled and cheeks torn in sign of mourning, rushed wildly into the midst of the crowd. “How long?” she cried. “We have done enough for the sake of Loyalty and our forefathers; my own eyes have seen the bleeding form of my loved Murrus, have seen him startling my nights with his mangled body, and speaking fearful words: ‘Save yourself, dear wife, from the calamities of this hapless city; and, if the victory of the Carthaginian leaves no land for refuge, seek safety, Tiburna, with my ghost. Our gods are overthrown, we Rutulians are undone, the Punic sword is master of all.’ My heart quakes with fear, and his ghost is still before my eyes. Shall I then see the dwellings of Saguntum vanish utterly? Fortunate Murrus, to die and leave his country still alive! But as for us—we shall be carried off to wait on the women of Carthage; and, after the calamities of war and the dangers of the great deep, victorious Carthage will behold us; and at last, when the final darkness of death comes, I shall be laid a captive in the lap of Libya. But you, young men, whose conscious valour has denied that you can ever be taken captive, you who have in death a mighty weapon against misfortune, rescue your mothers from slavery
