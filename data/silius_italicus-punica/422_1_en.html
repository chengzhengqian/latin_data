When he had passed the rampart and was received by the Roman general with friendly looks, the king thus began: “The warning of the gods and the prophecy of my revered mother, together with your great deeds so blest of Heaven, have torn me away from the Carthaginians and brought me hither unreluctant to you, the leader of the Roman army.

With fire and sword you must force back to Libya the man who for twice five years has been the master of Italy and is now planting his ladders against the walls of Rome.”</p>

We offer you splendid rewards, Masinissa, for noble service; and Scipio will sooner be overcome
