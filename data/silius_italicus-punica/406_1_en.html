Must I endure Hasdrubal too who has invaded my devastated land and seeks to consume with fire the little that war has left? Then the African nomad will plough my fields, and the Libyan will commit seed to the furrows of Italy, unless I bury in one grave all those armies that tread so proudly on my wide plains.” Thus she reflected; and while black Night shut in the slumbers of gods and men, she hastened to the camp where the scion of Sparta<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL278_365_a" id="target_note_LCL278_365_a"><sup>a</sup></a> lay. Behind his rampart of turf he was watching Hannibal, who was close at hand and kept his army within the limits of the Lucanian country.

I have condemned the open fields by the Metaurus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL278_365_c" id="target_note_LCL278_365_c"><sup>c</sup></a> to be the grave where the bones of the Carthaginians shall lie.” Thus she spoke and departed; and, even as she went, she seemed to draw after her the hesitating general, and to break down the gates of the camp for the horsemen to rush out.</p>
