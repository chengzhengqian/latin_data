in a fierce struggle with Philip<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL278_347_a" id="target_note_LCL278_347_a"><sup>a</sup></a>; and the Acarnanians, their next neighbours, made common cause with the foe. This new disturbance was due to an alliance formed between the Carthaginians and King Philip against the Romans. Philip had a splendid pedigree<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL278_347_b" id="target_note_LCL278_347_b"><sup>b</sup></a> and an ancient monarchy; he was proud to wield the sceptre of the Aeacids and proud of his descent from Achilles. He terrified Oricon<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL278_347_c" id="target_note_LCL278_347_c"><sup>c</sup></a> by a night-attack; and where the people of Taulas dwell in small and nameless villages along the Illyrian coast, he made a fierce assault in arms. He put to sea and fell upon the lands of the Phaeacians and Thesprotians, and rushed through Epirus with a campaign that led to nothing. At another time he displayed his standards on the coast of Anactorium, and overran with his arms the bays of Ambracia and the shore of Olpae. His oars stirred to fury the waters of Leucate, and he saw, as he rushed along, the temple of Apollo at Actium. Nor did he leave unvisited the harbours of Ithaca where Laërtes once reigned, or remote Same, or the rocks of Cephallenia against which the hoary waves bellow, or the stony fields of Neritus. He went further: he visited with special joy the land of Pelops<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL278_347_d" id="target_note_LCL278_347_d"><sup>d</sup></a> and the cities of Achaia, and approached the city of Oeneus that suffered from Diana’s vengeance<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL278_347_e" id="target_note_LCL278_347_e"><sup>e</sup></a> and was once inhabited by the Curetes; he promised the Greeks that he would fight for them against Rome. Next he swept through Ephyre<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL278_347_f" id="target_note_LCL278_347_f"><sup>f</sup></a> and Patrae and the royal city of Pleuron, and Parnassus with its two peaks, and the cliffs that have a voice for Apollo.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL278_347_g" id="target_note_LCL278_347_g"><sup>g</sup></a>. Often too he was recalled to his own country by war,</p>
