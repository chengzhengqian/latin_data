bird, for twice eight years<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL277_179_a" id="target_note_LCL277_179_a"><sup>a</sup></a> shall pursue the men of Rome in the land of Italy, and shall carry off much booty and shed much blood. But restrain your threats; for, lo! the armour-bearer of Jupiter<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL277_179_b" id="target_note_LCL277_179_b"><sup>b</sup></a> withholds from you the realm of Daunus. I recognize thy hand, O mightiest of the gods. Be present, O Father, and confirm the omen of thy bird! For, unless the eagle is false to the gods and his flight means nothing, it is reserved for this boy to seal the fate of conquered Libya, and to gain a name c greater than that of Carthage.”</p>
<p>Bogus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL277_179_d" id="target_note_LCL277_179_d"><sup>d</sup></a> on the other hand, prophesied good fortune to Hannibal: the hawk was a favourable sign, and the slaughter of birds in the sky foretold disaster to the Aeneadae, the descendants of Venus. Then, to suit his words, he hurled the first spear against the foe, as if prompted by heaven and aware of coming events. The weapon flew far over the empty space of the spreading plain, and distance would have robbed it of its effect, but for the desire of Catus to reap glory in the first battle. He galloped forward with loosened rein and drove his horse’s head to meet it; and so the spear, when flagging in its course and ready to fall, found the mark it sought and received from the enemy power to kill; it lodged between the temples of the brow that courted death.</p>
<p>The armies advance at speed, and a mighty noise spreads over the field when all the riders raise their horses’ heads high with the bridle and then urge them forward; rearing aloft, the chargers then rush on and in their stormy flight over the plain leave hardly a trace of their hoof-prints on the dusty surface. A swift squadron of Boii,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL277_179_e" id="target_note_LCL277_179_e"><sup>e</sup></a> commanded by Crixus, takes the lead, dashing against the front rank
