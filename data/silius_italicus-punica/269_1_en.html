Hannibal with his own hand held up a tall pine-torch with fire for foliage and called on the god to hear his prayer: “Hannibal, victorious over the Italian nation, burns these first-fruits of battle and offerings of conquest; and to thee, Father Mars, whose ears were open to my prayers, this host of surviving men dedicates the choicest armour.” Then he threw the torch upon the pyre, and blazing fire made havoc of the burning mass, till the crest of flame burst through the smoke and rose to the sky, flooding the fields with bright light. From here Hannibal went quickly to witness the funeral rites granted to Paulus, proud of showing honour to a dead enemy. A tall pyre was reared, and a soft bier was made of green turf, and offerings were laid upon it, to honour the dead—the shield, the sword dreaded by those who had felt it, the rods and axes taken in the battle, broken now but once a badge of power that all men feared. No wife was there, no sons, no gathering of near kinsmen; no customary masks of ancestors were borne on high litters before the corpse to grace the funeral procession.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL278_91_a" id="target_note_LCL278_91_a"><sup>a</sup></a> Bare was it of all trappings; but the praise of Hannibal was glory enough in itself: sighing he threw on the body a covering bright with rich purple dye and a mantle embroidered with gold, and uttered this last tribute to the dead: “Go, pride of Italy! Go whither spirits may go that exult in brave deeds! To you fame is secured already by a glorious death, but I must struggle on as Fate drives me, and she hides future events from my knowledge.”</p>
