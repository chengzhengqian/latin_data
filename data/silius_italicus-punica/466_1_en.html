<p>Thus the war ended. At once and willingly the citizens opened their gates to Scipio. He took from them their excessive power and their weapons, and engraved conditions of peace upon tablets; he broke down the power of their overweening wealth, and the huge beasts<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL278_485_a" id="target_note_LCL278_485_a"><sup>a</sup></a> laid down the towers they carried.
