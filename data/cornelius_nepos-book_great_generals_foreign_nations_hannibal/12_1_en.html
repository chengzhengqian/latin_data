The slave having quickly reported the facts and told him that all the exits were guarded, Hannibal knew that it was no accident; that it was he whom they were after and he must no longer think of preserving his life. But not wishing to lose it at another’s will, and remembering his past deeds of valour, he took the poison which he always carried about his person.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL467_281_1" id="target_note_LCL467_281_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p><span class="bold">13.</span> Thus that bravest of men, after having performed many and varied labours, entered into rest in his seventieth<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL467_281_2" id="target_note_LCL467_281_2"><sup>2</sup></a> year. Under what consuls he died is disputed. For Atticus has recorded in his <span class="italic">Annals</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL467_281_3" id="target_note_LCL467_281_3"><sup>3</sup></a> that he died in the consulate of Marcus Claudius<span class="marginNote right">183 <span class="sc">b.c.</span></span>
Marcellus and Quintus Fabius Labeo; Polybius,<span class="marginNote right">182 <span class="sc">b.c.</span></span>
under Lucius Aemilius Paulus and Gnaeus Baebius<span class="marginNote right">181 <span class="sc">b.c.</span></span>
Tamphilus; and Sulpicius Blitho, in the time of Publius Cornelius Cethegus and Marcus Baebius Tamphilus. And that great man, although busied with such great wars, devoted some time to letters; for there are several books of his, written in Greek, among them one, addressed to the Rhodians, on the deeds of Gnaeus Manlius Volso in Asia.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL467_281_4a" id="target_note_LCL467_281_4a"><sup>4</sup></a> Hannibal’s deeds of arms have been recorded by many writers, among them two men who were with him in camp and lived with him so long as fortune allowed, Silenus and Sosylus of Lacedaemon. And it was this Sosylus whom Hannibal employed as his teacher of Greek.</p>
<p>But it is time for us to put an end to this book and give an account of the Roman generals, to make it possible by comparing their deeds with those of the foreigners to judge which heroes ought to be given the higher rank.</p>
