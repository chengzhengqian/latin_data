to the gods and the stars, and his brother Quintillus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_177_1" id="target_note_LCL263_177_1"><sup>1</sup></a> a righteous man and the brother indeed, as I might truly say, of his brother, assumed the imperial power, which was offered him by the judgement of all, not as an inherited possession, but because his virtues deserved it; for all would have made him emperor, even if he had not been the brother of the Claudius their prince. In his time those barbarians who still survived endeavoured to lay waste Anchialus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_177_2" id="target_note_LCL263_177_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and even to seize Nicopolis,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_177_3" id="target_note_LCL263_177_3"><sup>3</sup></a> but they were crushed by the valour of the provincials. Quintillus, however, could do naught that was worthy of the imperial power because his rule was so short, for on the seventeenth day of his reign<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_177_4a" id="target_note_LCL263_177_4a"><sup>4</sup></a> he was killed, as Galba<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_177_5" id="target_note_LCL263_177_5"><sup>5</sup></a> had been and Pertinax<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_177_6" id="target_note_LCL263_177_6"><sup>6</sup></a> also, because he had shown himself stern and unbending toward the soldiers and promised to be a prince in very truth. Dexippus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_177_7" id="target_note_LCL263_177_7"><sup>7</sup></a> to be sure, does not say that Quintillus was killed, but merely that he died. He does not, however, relate that he died of an illness, and so he seems to feel doubt.</p>

<p>XIII. Since we have now described his achievements in war, we must tell a few things, at least, concerning the kindred and the family of Claudius, lest we seem to omit what all should know: now Claudius, Quintillus, and Crispus were brothers, and Crispus had a daughter Claudia; of her and Eutropius, the noblest man of the Dardanian folk, was born Constantius

As the coins bearing his name are very numerous, we must suppose a longer reign than 17 days; on the other hand, as, according to a papyrus dated 25 May, 270, Aurelian was then known in Egypt to be emperor, the period of 77 days is too long.
