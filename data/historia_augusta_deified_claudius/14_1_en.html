Concerning his grandparents we know all too little, for varying statements have been handed down by most of the writers.</p>
<p>Now Claudius himself was noted for the gravity of his character, and noted, too, for his matchless life and a singular purity; he was sparing in his use of wine, but was not averse to food; he was tall of stature, with flashing eyes and a broad, full face, and so strong were his fingers that often by a blow of his fist he would dash out the teeth of a horse or a mule. He even performed a feat of this kind as a youth in military service, while taking part in a wrestling-match between some of the strongest champions at a spectacle in the Campus Martius held in honour of Mars. For, becoming angry at one fellow who grasped at his private parts instead of his belt, he dashed out all the man’s teeth with one blow of his fist. This action won him favour for thus protecting decency; for the Emperor Decius, who was present when this was done, publicly praised his courage and modesty and presented him with arm-rings and collars,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_179_2" id="target_note_LCL263_179_2"><sup>2</sup></a> but bade him withdraw from the soldiers’ contests for fear he might do some more violent deed than the wrestling required.</p>

(xii. 26 end), both of whom represent Constantius as the son of Claudius’ daughter, while the <span class="italic">nepos</span> of c. ix. 9 is ambiguous.
On the other hand, the accepted official version, found in the Panegyrics addressed to Constantine and in the inscriptions of both the emperor himself and his sons, in which Constantine appears as Claudius grandson, presupposes the theory that Constantius was Claudius’ son. This divergence leads inevitably to the suspicion that the relationship was wholly a fabrication, designed, in the interests of the dynasty, to provide the parvenu Constantius with ancestors. This is strengthened by the fact that, with the exception of Quintillus, none of the members of Claudius’ family named in this chapter is known to us, and by the wholly incorrect attribution to Claudius of the names Flavius and Valerius which were those of Constantius; see note to c. i. 1.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL263_179_1a').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL263_179_2"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL263_179_2" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">2</sup><span class="italic">i.e.</span>, the usual rewards given to soldiers; see <span class="italic">Maxim.</span>, ii. 4; <span class="italic">Aur.</span>, vii. 7; <span class="italic">Prob.</span>, v. i.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL263_179_2').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
