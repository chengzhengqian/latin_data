<p>VI. But let us return to Claudius. For, as we have said before, those Goths who had escaped when Marcianus chastised them<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_163_1" id="target_note_LCL263_163_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and those whom Claudius, hoping to prevent what actually came to pass, had not allowed to break forth,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_163_2" id="target_note_LCL263_163_2"><sup>2</sup></a> fired all the tribes of their fellow-countrymen with the hope of Roman booty.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_163_3a" id="target_note_LCL263_163_3a"><sup>3</sup></a> Finally, the various tribes of the Scythians, the Peucini, Greuthungi, Austrogothi, Tervingi, Visi, and Gepedes, and also the Celts and the Eruli, in their desire for plunder burst into Roman territory and there proceeded to ravage many districts; for meanwhile Claudius was busied with other things and was making preparation, like a true commander, for that war which he finally brought to an end; and so it may seem that the destiny of Rome was retarded by the diligence of an excellent prince, but I, for my part, believe that it so came to pass in order that the glory of Claudius might be enhanced and his victory have a greater renown throughout the whole world. There were then, in fact, three hundred and twenty thousand men of these tribes under arms. Now let him who accuses us of flattery<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_163_4" id="target_note_LCL263_163_4"><sup>4</sup></a> say that Claudius was not worthy of being beloved!

The account, padded with fabricated letters and rhetorical questions, is hopelessly inadequate. A fuller description is given by Zosimus, i. 42–43; 45. The East and West Gothic tribes, Greuthungi-Austrogothi and Tervingi-Visi (the author has made four out of two), and the Gepidae, led, apparently, by the Eruli (see <span class="italic">Gall</span>. xiii. 6–10) and accompanied by some of the Peucini from the mouth of the Danube invaded Thrace and Macedonia and the Propontis by land and sea. After a vain attempt to take Byzantium and Cyzicus they laid siege to Thessalonica and Cassandrea but were called away by the arrival of Claudius, who completely defeated and scattered their forces at Naissus (modern Nish in Jugoslavia). The figures of 320,000 men (§ 4) and 2000 ships (c. viii. 1) are, of course, gross exaggerations, like the number of Germans in <span class="italic">Prob.</span>, xiii. 7.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL263_163_3a').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL263_163_4"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL263_163_4" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">4</sup>See c. iii. 1 and note.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL263_163_4').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
