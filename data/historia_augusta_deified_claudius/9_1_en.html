There was fighting at Thessalonica, to which the barbarians had laid siege while Claudius was far away. There was fighting in divers places, and in all of them, under the auspices of Claudius, the Goths were defeated, so that even then he seemed to be making the commonwealth safe in days to come for his nephew Constantius Caesar.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_169_5" id="target_note_LCL263_169_5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
