<p>XI. While these things were being done by the Deified Claudius, the Palmyrenes, under the generals Saba and Timagenes, made war against the Egyptians,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_173_1" id="target_note_LCL263_173_1"><sup>1</sup></a> who defeated them with true Egyptian pertinacity and unwearied continuance in fighting. Probatus, nevertheless, the leader of the Egyptians, was killed by a trick of Timagenes’. All the Egyptians, however, submitted to the Roman emperor, swearing allegiance to Claudius although he was absent.</p>
<p>In the consulship of Antiochianus and Orfitus the<span class="marginNote right">270</span> favour of heaven furthered Claudius’ success.
