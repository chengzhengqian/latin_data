the setting of the scene in <span class="italic">De Oratore</span> 2.12). With these details goes the style. The disputants of the dialogue converse in these measured tones because those were the tones of the speakers taking part in the dialogues of Cicero.</p>
<p>This means, further, that we cannot use the style to date the <span class="italic">Dialogus</span> early in the career of Tacitus, thus providing a specious progress from youthful Ciceronianism to a late personal style. In any case, youthful Ciceronianism is not in itself particularly likely in view of the century that separates the death of Cicero from the birth of Tacitus, a century that had seen Seneca and all the influences working to change style that are analysed in the <span class="italic">Dialogus</span>. There is no reason to suppose that Ciceronianism would have come naturally to a young man of the mid first century; Quintilian had upheld Ciceronian values, but even he had not preached or practised a return to Cicero’s style. Pliny could not be mistaken for Cicero; and if Tacitus puts on Ciceronian airs, he may do it at any period of his life.</p>
<p>Views on the dating of the <span class="italic">Dialogus</span>, thus untrammelled by stylistic considerations, have moved towards a certain unanimity. Tacitus fixes the dramatic date of the conversation he purports to describe by a phrase in 17.3, “sextam iam felicis huius principatus stationem quo Vespasianus rem publicam fovet.” This sixth year would be 74.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL035_220_1" id="target_note_LCL035_220_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Now at 1.2 Tacitus calls himself “iuvenis admodum” at the time of the discussion—the phrase of an appreciably older man; and the general inclination now is to set the date of composition at least twenty years
