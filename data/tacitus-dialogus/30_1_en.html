Count the fifty-six years in which the sainted Augustus thereafter held the helm of state; to these add twenty-three years for Tiberius, nearly four for Caligula, fourteen each for Claudius and Nero, that one long year for Galba, Otho, and Vitellius, and now the sixth stage of this auspicious reign in which Vespasian is making the country happy:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL035_275_2" id="target_note_LCL035_275_2"><sup>2</sup></a> the addition gives us only a hundred and twenty years<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL035_275_3" id="target_note_LCL035_275_3"><sup>3</sup></a> from the death of Cicero to the present day, no more than the life of an individual. Why, I saw with my own eyes an old man in Britain who could make the statement that he had taken a hand in the fight in which, when Caesar was attempting the invasion of that island, his compatriots tried to head him off and repel him from their shores.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL035_275_4" id="target_note_LCL035_275_4"><sup>4</sup></a> Now if the person who thus offered armed resistance to Caesar had come all the way to Rome as a slave, or on a visit, or by some other chance, it is quite possible that he might have listened to Caesar himself on the one hand, and to Cicero, and on the other have been present at our own judicial pleadings. You yourselves anyhow at the last public distribution of largess saw quite a number of old men who told us that they had more than once received a gratuity from the sainted Augustus himself. The obvious inference from this is that they might have listened to Corvinus as well as to Asinius, for Corvinus lived to the middle of the reign of Augustus, Asinius almost to the end of it;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL035_275_5" id="target_note_LCL035_275_5"><sup>5</sup></a> so
