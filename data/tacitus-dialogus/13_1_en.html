more honour and renown here in Rome, or that secures a more brilliant reputation throughout the Empire and in the world at large.</p>
<p>“If practical advantage is to be the rule of all we think and all we do, can there be any safer line to take than the practice of an art which gives you an ever ready weapon with which to protect your friends, to succour those to whom you are a stranger, to bring deliverance to persons in jeopardy, and even to strike fear and terror into the hearts of malignant foes—while you yourself have no anxiety, entrenched as you are behind a rampart of inalienable authority and power? While things are going well with you, it is in the refuge it affords to others, and in the protection it gives them, that its efficacy and usefulness are most in evidence; but when danger hurtles round your own head, then surely no sword or buckler in the press of arms gives stouter support than does eloquence to him who is imperilled by a prosecution; for it is a sure defence and a weapon of attack withal, that enables you with equal ease to act on the defensive or to advance to the assault, whether in the law courts, or in the senate house, or in the Emperor’s cabinet council. What was it save his eloquence that enabled Eprius Marcellus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL035_241_1" id="target_note_LCL035_241_1"><sup>1</sup></a> a short while ago to confront the senate, with everyone against him?

I need say no more under the head of practical advantage, for here my friend Maternus is not at all likely, I take it, to join issue with me.</p>
