to the orator. Here lies a consolation for the decay of speaking: peace recompenses for the loss.</p>
<p>In these last sections it is as though Maternus has passed from the Flavian age to the Trajanic calm. We hear no more of the violent oratory that led him to take up poetry. Earlier he had decried, where Aper had lauded, the modern eloquence that brought profit at the price of blood; in that world eloquence after a fashion had thrived. In the new world it thrives not at all.</p>
<p>But something yet remained. For Maternus it was poetry; for Tacitus it was history. And both genres could perhaps accomplish what the orator could no longer dare—criticism, open or covert, of the hypnotic imperial peace. To the blandness of the <span class="italic">Dialogus</span> was to succeed the savagery of the <span class="italic">Annals.</span></p>
<span class="label">B<span class="sc">ibliography</span></span>
<p>No one has more brilliantly illuminated the <span class="italic">Dialogus</span> than Sir Ronald Syme in his <span class="italic">Tacitus</span> (Oxford, 1958), esp. <span class="italic">cc</span>. 9–10 in Vol. I, with Appendix 28 in Vol. II and lavish bibliography. It may be supplemented on the literary side by A. Michel, <span class="italic">Le Dialogue des Orateurs de Tacite et la philosophie de Cicéron</span> (Paris, 1962).</p>
<p>Among editions, A. Gudeman’s (edn. 2, 1914. Reprinted by Hakkert of Amsterdam in 1967) is standard. Less overpowering is that of A. Michel (Paris, 1962). The edition of Lenchantin de Gubernatis (Turin, 1949) does not include a commentary. There has been nothing in English since W. Peterson’s (Oxford, 1893), now out of print.</p>
