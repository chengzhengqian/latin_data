It has gone against the grain to say what I have said, and there is more that I have left out: though it is precisely these blemishes, and these alone, that are admired and imitated by those who call themselves orators of the good old school. I mention no names, as it is enough for me to indicate a type; but you of course will have in your mind’s eye the archaists who prefer Lucilius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL035_293_2" id="target_note_LCL035_293_2"><sup>2</sup></a> to Horace, and Lucretius to Virgil, who consider the style of Aufidius Bassus and Servilius Nonianus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL035_293_3" id="target_note_LCL035_293_3"><sup>3</sup></a> very inferior as compared with that of Sisenna<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL035_293_4" id="target_note_LCL035_293_4"><sup>4</sup></a> or Varro,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL035_293_5" id="target_note_LCL035_293_5"><sup>5</sup></a> who, while they admire the draft speeches which Calvus left behind him, have nothing but feelings of disdain and repugnance for those of our own contemporaries. Such persons as these, when they prose along before a judge in the antique style, cannot hold the attention of their audience; the crowd refuses to listen, and even their clients can scarcely put up with them. So dreary are they and so uncouth: and even the sound condition which they make their boast they owe not to any sturdiness, but to banting. Why, in dealing with the human body, doctors have not much to say in praise of the patient who only keeps well by worrying about his health. It is not enough not to be ill; I like a man to be strong and hearty and vigorous. If soundness is all you can commend in him, he is really next door to an invalid.</p>
