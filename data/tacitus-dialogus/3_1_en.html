after 74. Syme argues for 101–2, to coincide with the consulship of the dedicatee, Fabius Justus; others have gone still later (one might think of 103–4, the sixth year of another <span class="italic">felix principatus</span>—that of Trajan). The advantages of late dating are manifest. The critical remarks on Vibius Crispus and Eprius Marcellus come better under an emperor who had banished <span class="italic">delatores</span> than under a dynasty, the Flavian, that had relied on their support.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL035_221_1" id="target_note_LCL035_221_1"><sup>1</sup></a> And the parallel of the <span class="italic">De Oratore</span>, where Cicero, writing in 55 <span class="sc">b.c</span>., describes a discussion set in 91 <span class="sc">b.c</span>., hints that Tacitus should be talking of the far past and employing interlocutors now dead.</p>
<p>The introductory paragraph raises at once the main topic of the dialogue: why has oratory so decayed? The question was no new one.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL035_221_2" id="target_note_LCL035_221_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Cicero had, on <span class="italic">a priori</span> grounds, forecast that the decay would take place <span class="italic">(Tusc</span>. 2.5). And complaints are raised as early as the reign of Tiberius, when the elder Seneca speculated whether the decadence was due to luxury (a common scapegoat), materialism, or merely the grudging fate that dictates the fall of what has gone high (<span class="italic">Contr</span>. 1, <span class="italic">praef</span>. 7). Quintilian took the matter seriously enough to devote a treatise to it; his <span class="italic">On the Causes of the Corruption of Oratory</span> is now lost, but it is probable from allusions to it in the slightly later <span class="italic">Institutio</span> (about 95) that it compared the downward path of Roman oratory with the decadence
