exponents of oratory were the <span class="italic">delatores</span>, professional accusers whose victims enriched them and were sometimes driven to suicide. Such methods could lead to fame. Domitius Afer, for Quintilian the finest orator he had seen, began his career thus; so did Eprius Marcellus and Vibius Crispus, singled out in the <span class="italic">Dialogus</span> as orators who had reached political power.</p>
<p>It has been argued<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL035_223_1" id="target_note_LCL035_223_1"><sup>1</sup></a> that Maternus’ renunciation of oratory stands for Tacitus’ similar renunciation—the break that made the consul under Nerva the author of the <span class="italic">Histories</span> and the <span class="italic">Annals</span> under Trajan and Hadrian. This may be so. Yet the objections<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL035_223_2" id="target_note_LCL035_223_2"><sup>2</sup></a> of Maternus apply rather to the <span class="italic">delator</span>-centred oratory of the Neronian and Flavian periods, and need not have weighed once “nunc demum redit animus” <span class="italic">(Agr</span>. 3) under the new dispensation. We may take these introductory sections more straightforwardly; they sketch in a general view of oratory (just as Crassus praises eloquence early in the <span class="italic">De Oratore</span> [1.30 <span class="italic">seq.</span>]), with a counter-view of its dangers that might serve to reconcile to its decay. Just as later Maternus refutes Aper’s view that all is well with oratory, so here he reminds us that there are better things. Oratory thrives in a troubled state, he tells us later; but, equally, it causes some of those troubles itself.</p>
<p>The section is marked off, and the tension lowered, by the arrival of Messalla; and it is his known views
