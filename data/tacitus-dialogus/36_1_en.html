very few there are who read his impeachment of Asitius or Drusus! On the other hand, the orations entitled ‘Against Vatinius ’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL035_287_1" id="target_note_LCL035_287_1"><sup>1</sup></a> are a common textbook with students, especially the second: for it is rich in style as well as in ideas, and well suited to the taste of a law court, so that one may readily see that Calvus himself knew the better part, and that his comparative lack of elevation and elegance was due not so much to want of taste as to want of intellectual force.

For the rest, his commonplace phraseology, his slipshod arrangement, and his ill-constructed periods savour of old-fashionedness, and I do not believe that there is anyone so devoted to antiquity as to praise Caelius just because he is old-fashioned. As to Julius Caesar we must no doubt make allowance. It was owing to his vast designs and all-absorbing activities that he accomplished less as an orator than his superhuman genius called for; just as in the case of Brutus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL035_287_3a" id="target_note_LCL035_287_3a"><sup>3</sup></a> we must leave him to his well-loved philosophy, for even his admirers admit that as an orator he did not rise to his reputation. You won’t tell me that anybody reads Caesar’s oration in defence of Decius the Samnite, or Brutus’s in defence of King Deiotarus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL035_287_4" id="target_note_LCL035_287_4"><sup>4</sup></a> or any of the other speeches, all equally slow and equally flat—unless, indeed, it be someone who is an
