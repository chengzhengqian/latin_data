that you must not make two epochs out of one, and keep on speaking of’ remote antiquity’ in reference to orators whom the same persons could have heard with their own ears and so have connected closely with ourselves.</p>

<p>18. “The reason why I have said all this by way of introduction is that I wanted to show that we have a common property in any lustre the name and fame of these orators may shed upon the times, and that it is nearer to us than to Servius Galba,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL035_277_1" id="target_note_LCL035_277_1"><sup>1</sup></a> or Gaius Carbo,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL035_277_2" id="target_note_LCL035_277_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and all the rest who may properly be called ‘ancients’; for they are really rough and unfinished, crude and inartistic, and generally with such qualities that one could wish that neither your admired Calvus, nor Caelius, nor Cicero himself had made them his model in anything. I want to take a bolder line now, and to speak more resolutely, first premising however that the forms and types of oratory change with the times.

Corvinus again is mellower than Cicero, more engaging, and more careful in his choice of words. I am not asking which is the greatest orator: for my present purpose it is enough for me to have made the point that eloquence has more than one fashion of countenance, and that even in those whom you speak of as ‘ancients’ a variety of types can be discovered. Where change occurs, we
