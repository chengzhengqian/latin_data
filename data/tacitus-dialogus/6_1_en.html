<p>The standard plain text is the Teubner of E. Koestermann (1964), with bibliography. H. Furneaux’s Oxford Classical Text <span class="italic">(Cornelii Taciti, Opera Minora</span>, 1900) is now out of date. In the Budé series we have the text edited by H. Goelzer with translation by H. Bornecque, edn. 3, Paris, 1947.</p>

<p>We owe the preservation of the <span class="italic">Dialogus</span>, as of the other minor works of Tacitus, to the lost<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL035_227_1" id="target_note_LCL035_227_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Codex Hersfeldensis; nothing is known of what happened to the part of the codex that contained the <span class="italic">Dialogus</span>, but as in the <span class="italic">Germania</span> we can reconstruct two lost copies of the codex from fifteenth-century manuscripts:</p>
<p class="lineGroup verse">
<span class="line indent2">X = the consensus of Vaticanus lat. 1862,<span class="linebreak"></span>and<span class="linebreak"></span>Leidensis Periz.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">Y = the consensus of Vaticanus lat. 1518,<span class="linebreak"></span>and<span class="linebreak"></span>Neapolitanus IV C21.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p>
<p>X and Y are both indispensable to the editor, but the only direct evidence we have of the readings of the Hersfeld MS. (Decembrio’s at 36) suggests that Y is superior.</p>
<p>In the notes to this text, readings not assigned to any scholar are given by a consensus of X and Y (minor variations being ignored). Other manuscripts do exist, and some of them have at times
