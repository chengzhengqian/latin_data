But he quite cleverly disarmed me by yielding the point that verse composition may be indulged in by anyone who would not make a good lawyer. Now while I might possibly accomplish something, though not without effort, as a barrister, yet on the other hand it was by dramatic readings that I took the first step on the path of fame, when in Nero’s reign I broke the power of Vatinius,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL035_259_1" id="target_note_LCL035_259_1"><sup>1</sup></a> that unconscionable usurper who was desecrating even the sanctity of letters; and any reputation or renown I may possess today is due, I fancy, to the fame of my poetry rather than to my speeches.
