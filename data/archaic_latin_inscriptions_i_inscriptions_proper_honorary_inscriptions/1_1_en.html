And in the same command he as consul performed an exploit in ships at sea, the first Roman to do so; the first he was to equip and train crews and fleets of fighting ships; and with these ships he defeated in battle on the high seas the Punic fleets and likewise all the most mighty troops of the Carthaginians in the presence of Hannibal their commander-in-chief. And by main force he captured ships with their crews, to wit: one septireme, 30 quinqueremes and triremes: 13 he sank. Gold taken: 3,600 (<span class="italic">and more</span>) pieces.</p>

But some scholars, such as Ritschl and Mommsen, believe that the inscription was actually first composed in the imperial period and that it is therefore not archaic at all. Cf.
