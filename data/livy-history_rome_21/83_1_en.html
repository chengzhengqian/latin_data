arrived, having taken an enormous risk in passing through the enemy cavalry roaming far and wide on marauding expeditions (which was recklessness rather than a calculated risk or one taken with any hope of eluding the enemy or resisting if he did not elude him). He held the consular elections, the one pressing need at the moment, and returned to his winter quarters. The consuls elected were Gnaeus Servilius and Gaius Flaminius.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL233_167_216" id="target_note_LCL233_167_216"><sup>216</sup></a></p>
<p>In fact, there was no peace for the Romans even in their winter quarters: Numidian cavalry ranged far and wide, and Celtiberians and Lusitanians were doing so wherever the ground was too difficult for the Numidians.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL233_167_217" id="target_note_LCL233_167_217"><sup>217</sup></a> Thus all Roman supplies were cut off from every quarter, apart from those shipped up the Po.</p>
<p>There was a storage depot near Placentia, well defended both by stout fortifications and a powerful garrison. Hannibal set out with his cavalry and light-armed infantry hoping to storm this stockade and, placing his greatest hope of success in keeping the operation secret, he attacked at night but failed to elude the sentinels. A cry suddenly went up, so loud that it was heard even in Placentia. The result was that the consul appeared on the scene with his cavalry just before dawn, having given instructions for the legions to follow in square formation.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL233_167_218" id="target_note_LCL233_167_218"><sup>218</sup></a> In the meantime there was a cavalry engagement, and since Hannibal left the fight after receiving a wound the enemy were filled with alarm and the post was very successfully defended.</p>
