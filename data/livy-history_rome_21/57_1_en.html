Gnaeus Scipio, under my auspices<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL233_115_164" id="target_note_LCL233_115_164"><sup>164</sup></a> in accordance with the wishes of the Roman Senate and People, and I have freely volunteered my services for this battle so that you would have a consul leading you against Hannibal and the Carthaginians. So now, as your new commander, I must say a few words to my new soldiers.</p>
<p>“So you not be unaware of the war’s nature or your enemy, soldiers, those that you must fight are men you defeated on land and sea in the last war, men from whom you wrung tribute over a twenty-year period and from whom you took Sicily and Sardinia, which you now possess as prizes of war.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL233_115_165" id="target_note_LCL233_115_165"><sup>165</sup></a> Accordingly, in this conflict, you and they will both have the level of morale usually found respectively in victors and vanquished. And they are now going to fight not because they are confident but because they have to—unless you believe that men who refused combat when their army was intact have gained more hope after losing almost two thirds of their infantry and cavalry in crossing the Alps.</p>
<p>“Ah, you may say, few they may be, but they are strong in morale and energy—men whose toughness and stamina hardly any force could withstand. Not so! They are mere specters, just shadows of men, lifeless from hunger and cold, dirt and filth, who were battered and disabled amid rocks and cliffs. Further, their limbs are frostbitten, their muscles stiffened by snow, their bodies paralyzed with cold; and their weapons are shivered and broken, their horses lame and spent. This is the cavalry, this is the infantry that you are going to fight; you have not an enemy
