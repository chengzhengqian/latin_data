Hasdrubal was also assigned a fleet to protect the coastline because it could be supposed that the Romans would then, too, operate with that mode of warfare in which they had earlier been victors.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL233_63_87" id="target_note_LCL233_63_87"><sup>87</sup></a> There were fifty quinqueremes, two quadriremes, and five triremes; but of these only thirty-two quinqueremes and the five triremes were fitted out and furnished with crews.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL233_63_88" id="target_note_LCL233_63_88"><sup>88</sup></a></p>
<p>From Gades Hannibal returned to the army’s winter quarters in New Carthage; and on leaving there he marched along the coast, past the city of Onussa,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL233_63_89" id="target_note_LCL233_63_89"><sup>89</sup></a> to the Ebro.
