<p>After the consul felt that Sicily was well enough protected in that quarter, he crossed to the islands of Vulcan<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL233_149_199" id="target_note_LCL233_149_199"><sup>199</sup></a> because there had been a report that a Carthaginian fleet was at anchor there, but no enemy was found in the vicinity of the islands. It so happened that the Carthaginians had already crossed to conduct raids on the coastline of Italy, and after laying waste the agricultural land of Vibo<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL233_149_200" id="target_note_LCL233_149_200"><sup>200</sup></a> they were even threatening the town itself. News of the enemy raid on the farmland of Vibo reached the consul as he was heading back to Sicily, and he was also brought a dispatch from the senate informing him of Hannibal’s crossing to Italy and ordering him to bring his colleague help at the earliest opportunity.</p>
<p>With many simultaneous concerns on his mind, Sempronius immediately boarded his army on some ships and sent it up the Adriatic to Ariminum.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL233_149_201" id="target_note_LCL233_149_201"><sup>201</sup></a> He assigned to his legate Sextus Pomponius the task of patrolling the territory of Vibo and the coastal areas of Italy with twenty-five warships, and he brought the fleet of the praetor Marcus Aemilius up to a full complement of fifty ships. After settling affairs in Sicily, Sempronius himself then came to Ariminum with ten ships, skirting the Italian coast. Setting off from there with his army, he joined his colleague at the River Trebia.</p>
<p>52. That the two consuls and all available Roman forces were now facing Hannibal made it quite clear that either the empire of Rome could be defended by those troops or there was simply no hope. However, one of the consuls, crushed by the single cavalry engagement and the wound he had received, preferred to see things deferred; the other, his drive still fresh and being thus all the more audacious, would brook no delay.</p>
