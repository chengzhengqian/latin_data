 it is unlikely that those routes to Gaul would have been open at that time; and in any case those leading to the Poenine Alps<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL233_111_155" id="target_note_LCL233_111_155"><sup>155</sup></a> would have been blocked by the Half-German tribes.

That was why the consul Publius Scipio hastened toward the Po after reaching Pisa<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL233_111_159" id="target_note_LCL233_111_159"><sup>159</sup></a> by sea with his ships, even though the army he had taken over from Manlius and Atilius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL233_111_160" id="target_note_LCL233_111_160"><sup>160</sup></a> was one of raw recruits demoralized by their recent shameful performance—his aim was to engage an enemy whose strength was not yet restored. When the consul reached Placentia, however, Hannibal had already moved from his camp and had taken by storm a single city of the Taurini—in fact, the tribal capital—because its people would not readily enter into an alliance with him.
