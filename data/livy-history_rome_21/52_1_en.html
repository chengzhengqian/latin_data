Over an old, untouched layer of snow was a fresh one of some slight depth, and on this layer, since it was soft and not too deep, the soldiers’ feet could easily get a foothold as they advanced; but as it melted with so many men and pack animals walking over it, they began to find themselves stepping on the glare ice that lay beneath and on the slush of thawing snow.

If they used hands or a knee to help themselves up, these supports themselves would slither away from under them and they would fall again. Nor were there were stumps or roots around to provide leverage for either foot or hand—so they would simply slither about on glare ice and slushy snow. The pack animals treading the snow would occasionally cut even into the bottom layer and then, slipping forward and their hooves flailing more wildly in their efforts to get up, would break right through, so that a number became wedged in the ice (which was hardened and frozen to a great depth) as though caught in a trap.</p>
