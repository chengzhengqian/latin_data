nobility toward Flaminius, who had spoken for the bill, though it had also won him support among the common people and thus a second consulship.</p>
<p>For these reasons Flaminius felt the senators would keep him in the city by a phony interpretation of the auspices, using the delay imposed by the Latin Festival<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL233_187_256" id="target_note_LCL233_187_256"><sup>256</sup></a> and anything else that could detain a consul; and so, pretending he had a journey to make, he slipped away furtively to his province as a private citizen. When this became public knowledge, it generated fresh anger in the already hostile senators: Gaius Flaminius was now at war not merely with the senate but with the immortal gods, they said. When he was earlier elected consul without the sanction of the auspices, and the gods and men tried to call him back from the actual battlefield, he had not listened, they said. Now, guiltily aware of the disrespect he had shown them, he had avoided the Capitol and the formal pronouncement of his vows in order not to come to the temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus on the day of his entry into office and in order not to see and deliberate with the senate, by which he was detested and which he and he alone detested. He wished to avoid giving notice of the Latin Festival, offering the customary sacrifice to Jupiter Latiaris on the Alban Mount, proceeding to the Capitol to make his vows after taking the auspices, and then setting off for his province dressed in his military cloak and accompanied by his lictors. Like a camp follower, he had set off without his decorations of office and without lictors, secretly, furtively, and no differently than if he had emigrated to become an exile. Of course, it better suited the majesty of his command to enter office at Ariminum rather than Rome, and to put on the <span class="italic">praetexta</span> in an inn rather than before his household gods!</p>
