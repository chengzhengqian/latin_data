Hannibal, riding ahead of the troops, ordered the men to halt on a spur that afforded a deep and broad panorama and pointed out to them Italy and the plains that surrounded the Po at the foot of the Alps.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL233_103_142" id="target_note_LCL233_103_142"><sup>142</sup></a> At that moment, he told them, they were crossing the defenses not merely of Italy but of the city of Rome; the rest of the way would be flat or downhill—one or at most two battles and they would have that chief bastion of Italy in their hands and under their sway.</p>

But the journey proved much harder than during the ascent, the Alpine slopes on the Italian side being mostly shorter but also steeper. Almost every step of the way was precipitous, narrow and slippery, so the men could not keep from falling; and even those only slightly losing their balance could not keep their footing and would fall over each other, and the pack animals would fall on the men.</p>

They next came to a much narrower passageway on the rock face, where the cliff descended so steeply that a soldier free of baggage could barely make it down by feeling his way and clinging with his hands to shrubs and roots projecting round about him. The spot, naturally steep before, had now also been sheered off by a recent landslide, which had created a drop of fully one thousand feet.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL233_103_144" id="target_note_LCL233_103_144"><sup>144</sup></a> The cavalry halted there, assuming they had reached the
