<p class="noindent">This book describes the beginning of the Second Punic War, and how Hannibal, the general of the Phoenicians, crossed the river Ebro in violation of the treaty. Besieging Saguntum, a city belonging to allies of the Roman People, he captured it in the eighth month. These violations led to the dispatch of ambassadors to the Carthaginians to complain. On their refusing satisfaction, war was declared against Carthage. Hannibal, after surmounting the passes of the Pyrenees, traversed Gaul—having routed the Volcae, who had attempted to stop him—and arrived at the Alps. After a troublesome passage of these mountains, in the course of which he also defeated in several battles the Gallic mountain people when they blocked his way, he descended into Italy and routed the Romans in a cavalry battle near the river Ticinus. In this battle Publius Cornelius Scipio was wounded and was saved by his son, who later received the name of Africanus. Near the river Trebia a Roman army was again routed. After this Hannibal crossed the Apennines, with great suffering for his soldiers because of violent storms. In Spain Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio fought successfully against the Phoenicians, capturing the enemy’s general, Mago.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL233_191_259" id="target_note_LCL233_191_259"><sup>259</sup></a></p>
