<p>Such were Sempronius’ comments at his sick colleague’s bedside and also in staff meetings,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL233_155_205" id="target_note_LCL233_155_205"><sup>205</sup></a> almost as if delivering a harangue. He was urged on, too, by the approaching election date: the war might drag on into the term of the new consuls, and there was also the possibility of diverting all the glory to himself while his colleague lay ill. And so, while Cornelius remonstrated in vain, he ordered his men to prepare themselves for an imminent engagement.</p>
<p>Hannibal, seeing what his enemy’s best strategy would be, had scarcely any hope for an impulsive or foolish move by the consuls. But after learning from experience what he had heard rumored earlier, namely that one was hotheaded and impetuous, he also believed that the man would have been made even more impetuous by his successful skirmish with his raiding party. He was therefore not without hope of soon having an opportunity for action. He was anxiously focused on not missing his moment while his enemy’s soldiers still lacked experience, while the better of the two generals was out of action with his wound, and while the Gauls were in good spirits (he knew that the further their vast horde was drawn from home, the less eager they would be to follow him). For these and other such reasons he was hoping for an imminent engagement and wanted to initiate one in case the enemy hesitated; and when his Gallic spies—safer for gathering the intelligence he required since Gauls were serving in both camps—reported that the Romans were ready for battle, he proceeded to look around for a spot for an ambush.</p>
