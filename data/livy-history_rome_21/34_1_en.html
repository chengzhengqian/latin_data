 of the colonies of Placentia and Cremona<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL233_69_99" id="target_note_LCL233_69_99"><sup>99</sup></a> on the banks of the Po on Gallic soil. And so they quickly took up arms, attacked that very region, and caused such panic and chaos that not only crowds of peasants but the very triumvirs who had come to apportion the land—Gaius Lutatius, Gaius Servilius and Marcus Annius—lost confidence in Placentia’s defenses and fled to Mutina.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL233_69_100" id="target_note_LCL233_69_100"><sup>100</sup></a></p>
<p>The identification of Lutatius here is not in doubt; in place of Annius and Servilius some annalistic accounts<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL233_69_101" id="target_note_LCL233_69_101"><sup>101</sup></a> have Manius Acilius and Gaius Herennius, and others have Publius Cornelius Asina and Gaius Papirius Maso. In question, too, is whether the envoys sent to protest to the Boii<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL233_69_102" id="target_note_LCL233_69_102"><sup>102</sup></a> were manhandled or whether it was the triumvirs who were attacked as they surveyed the land.</p>
<p>When the Romans were blockaded at Mutina, the Gauls, a people unskilled in the art of besieging cities and also very lazy with regard to military operations, sat idly before the walls, which they left intact, and then started feigning interest in peace negotiations. Roman spokesmen, invited to parley by the Gallic chieftains, were then apprehended by them, not only against international convention but also in violation of sworn guarantees given for that occasion, the Gauls saying they would release them only if their hostages were returned.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL233_69_103" id="target_note_LCL233_69_103"><sup>103</sup></a> When he was given the news about the spokesmen, and since Mutina and its garrison were in danger, the praetor Lucius Manlius flew into a rage and led a disorganized column of troops toward Mutina.</p>
