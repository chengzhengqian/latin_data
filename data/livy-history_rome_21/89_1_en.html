Not far from Tarraco he encountered their marines and crews wandering aimlessly through the countryside (because success almost inevitably leads to carelessness) and sending out his cavalry in every direction against them he drove them back to their ships, producing great carnage and greater flight. Not daring to linger in the area any longer for fear of being overtaken by Scipio, he then fell back across the Ebro. At the news of his new enemy, Scipio lost no time in bringing his column there, but then, after punishing a few of the ships’ officers and leaving a small garrison at Tarraco, he returned to Emporiae with his fleet.</p>
