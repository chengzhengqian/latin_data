<p>23. Pleased with this vision, Hannibal took his forces across the Ebro in three sections, having sent men ahead to soften up the Gauls with gifts in the areas through which the army had to be led, and also to reconnoiter the Alpine passes. He led over the Ebro 90,000 infantry and 12,000 cavalry. He then brought under his control the Ilergetes, the Bargusii, and the Ausetani, and the region of Lacetania,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL233_65_91" id="target_note_LCL233_65_91"><sup>91</sup></a> which lies at the foot of the Pyrenees, and he put Hanno<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL233_65_92" id="target_note_LCL233_65_92"><sup>92</sup></a> in charge of this entire area so as to have in his power the defiles connecting the Spanish and Gallic regions. Hanno was given 10,000 infantry and 1,000 cavalry to secure the area.</p>
<p>After the army’s march through the pass over the Pyrenees had already begun and the rumor spreading among the barbarians that the war was to be with Rome became more persistent, 3,000 of the Carpetani<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL233_65_93" id="target_note_LCL233_65_93"><sup>93</sup></a> abandoned the march. It was clear that they were motivated less by the war than the length of the journey and the impossibility of crossing the Alps. Because calling them back or keeping them in service under duress was risky, as it might also provoke the fiery tempers of the others, Hannibal sent home more than 7,000 men whom he too had felt to be discontented with the campaign, pretending that the Carpetani had also been discharged by him.</p>
<p>24. For delay and inactivity not to sap his men’s morale, he then crossed the Pyrenees with the rest of his forces<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL233_65_94" id="target_note_LCL233_65_94"><sup>94</sup></a> and encamped at the town of Iliberri.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL233_65_95" id="target_note_LCL233_65_95"><sup>95</sup></a></p>
