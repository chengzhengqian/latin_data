<p>The consul Tiberius Sempronius came to Messana after this battle but before those in town knew of it. As he entered the strait, King Hiero came to meet him at the head of a fully equipped fleet. Hiero crossed from the royal barge to the Roman flagship, congratulated the consul on having arrived safely with his army and ships, and prayed that his crossing to Sicily would prove profitable and successful. He then explained the situation on the island and the designs of the Carthaginians, and promised to be as committed a helper of the Roman people in his old age as he had been as a young man in the earlier war. He would supply the consulâ€™s legions and crews with grain and clothing, and at no cost, he said, adding that Lilybaeum and the coastal city-states were facing great danger and some were wanting a regime change.</p>
<p>The consul therefore felt he should lose no time in heading for Lilybaeum with his fleet; and the king and the royal fleet set off with him. During the voyage from there they received the news of the battle fought off Lilybaeum and the defeat and capture of the enemy ships.</p>
<p>51. Sending back Hiero and the royal fleet and leaving the praetor to protect the Sicilian coastline, the consul himself crossed from Lilybaeum to the island of Melita,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL233_147_197" id="target_note_LCL233_147_197"><sup>197</sup></a> which was occupied by the Carthaginians. On his arrival there, Hamilcar son of Gisgo,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL233_147_198" id="target_note_LCL233_147_198"><sup>198</sup></a> the garrison commander, surrendered to him along with slightly fewer than two thousand men, and the town and the island were turned over to him. A few days later Sempronius returned from there to Lilybaeum, and the prisoners, apart from men of noble birth, were auctioned off both by the consul and the praetor.</p>
