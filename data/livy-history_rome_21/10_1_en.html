<p>Hannibal entered their territory with an invading force, laid waste their agricultural lands and made a three-pronged attack on the city.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL233_21_35" id="target_note_LCL233_21_35"><sup>35</sup></a> There was a corner of the city wall overlooking a valley, where the ground became more level and open than the other land surrounding the town.
