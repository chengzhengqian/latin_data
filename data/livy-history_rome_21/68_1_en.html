definite word of their leaving the Ticinus, but the Carthaginian still captured some six hundred of the stragglers, who were slow in unmooring the pontoon on his side of the river. He could not himself cross by the pontoon bridge since the end sections had been loosened and the whole structure was floating downstream.</p>

For those familiar with the river this would be scarcely credible. It is not likely that cavalry could have mastered such a strong river current while still retaining their arms and horses, even if one accepts that all the Spaniards were floated over on inflated skins; and to seek out fords over the Po by which an army weighed down with baggage could cross would have meant a detour lasting several days. More credible in my view are the authors recording that it took a good two days to find a spot for spanning the river with a pontoon bridge; the cavalry and light-armed Spanish troops were sent over it first with Mago.</p>
<p>Hannibal remained at the river for a time granting audiences to Gallic embassies and then took his column of heavy-armed infantry across; and meanwhile Mago and the cavalry, after their crossing, made a one day’s march toward their enemy at Placentia.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL233_137_185" id="target_note_LCL233_137_185"><sup>185</sup></a> Some days later Hannibal established a fortified camp six miles from Placentia, and the following day he deployed his line of battle in full view of his enemy and gave them the opportunity to engage.</p>
