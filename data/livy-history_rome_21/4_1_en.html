—and the endorsement of the common people followed.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL233_9_12" id="target_note_LCL233_9_12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>When Hannibal was barely an adolescent Hasdrubal had summoned him by letter,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL233_9_13" id="target_note_LCL233_9_13"><sup>13</sup></a> and the matter had even been discussed in the Carthaginian senate. The Barca faction insisted that he be familiarized with military life and that he succeed to his father’s authority, but Hanno,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL233_9_14" id="target_note_LCL233_9_14"><sup>14</sup></a> leader of the opposing faction, demurred. “What Hasdrubal asks for seems reasonable,” he said, “and I am nevertheless opposed to granting his request.”</p>
<p>Having caught everyone’s attention with such a surprisingly equivocal comment, Hanno continued: “Hasdrubal thinks that he offered up the good looks of his youth for the gratification of Hannibal’s father and that it is only fair for him to take the son’s in return. However, it is most inappropriate for us to subject our young soldiers to the sexual appetite of their officers as though that were military training. Or is this our fear, that Hamilcar’s son must wait too long to look upon the father’s unlimited authority and apparently regal power, and that we too late become the slaves to the son of that <span class="italic">king</span>, whose son-in-law was left our armies as a bequest? No, in <span class="italic">my</span> opinion, that young man should be kept at home and taught to live in obedience to the laws and magistrates on an equal footing with everyone else. Otherwise, this small flame may one day start a huge conflagration.”</p>
<p>A few, including almost all the most right-thinking men, agreed with Hanno, but, as usual, the larger party triumphed over the better.</p>
