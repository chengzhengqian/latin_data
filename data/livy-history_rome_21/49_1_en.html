When they reached a narrowing of the road, overlooked on one side by a mountain ridge, the barbarians rose up from their hiding places everywhere. They attacked the Carthaginians front and rear, engaged them hand to hand and from a distance, and rolled huge rocks down on the column. An enormous body of men proceeded to bear down on the rear. The infantry wheeled round to face them, leaving no doubt that but for the reinforcement provided to the end of the column there would have been a calamitous defeat in that defile. Even as it was they faced extreme peril and were almost destroyed.
