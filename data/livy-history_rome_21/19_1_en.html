truth. In my case, I have come to you in consideration of my long-established guest-friendship with you, and do so in order for you not to be unaware that there are terms that can bring you salvation and peace. And your assurance that what I say I say for your own sake and no one else’s is that I never made any mention of peace to you while you had the strength to resist or were still expecting assistance from Rome. It is only now—when you can expect nothing from the Romans and have insufficient protection from your own arms and defenses—that I bring you peace terms that are necessary rather than fair. You have some hope of concluding this peace if, as the defeated party, you accept the terms that Hannibal dictates </p>
<p class="noindent">to you as victor and if, when everything rests in that victor’s hands, you do not regard what is removed from you as a loss but rather consider as a gift whatever is left. Your city—which he has mostly destroyed, anyway, and nearly all of it he has captured—he takes from you; but your lands he leaves you, and he will assign to you a site on them for building a new town. All gold and silver—state- or privately-owned—he orders to be brought to him. You yourselves, your wives and your children he spares if you are prepared to leave Saguntum unarmed and with two articles of clothing<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL233_39_52" id="target_note_LCL233_39_52"><sup>52</sup></a> each. Such are the terms a victorious enemy dictates to you; harsh and grievous though they are, your circumstances suggest you should accept them. In fact, I am not without hope that Hannibal will ease the conditions somewhat once he is in full control. But I believe you should tolerate them even as they are rather than allow yourselves to be butchered and your wives and children to be seized and dragged away before your eyes, in accordance with the rules of war.”</p>
