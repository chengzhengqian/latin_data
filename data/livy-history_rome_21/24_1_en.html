<p>18. These preparations thus completed, the senators, in order to have all protocols observed before the war, sent an embassy of older men to Africa: Quintus Fabius, Marcus Livius, Lucius Aemilius, Gaius Licinius, and Quintus Baebius.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL233_49_66" id="target_note_LCL233_49_66"><sup>66</sup></a> They were to inquire of the Carthaginians whether Hannibal’s assault on Saguntum had been officially authorized and to declare war on the Carthaginian people if, as seemed likely, they acknowledged the fact and defended Hannibal’s action as being state policy. On their arrival in Carthage, the Romans were granted an audience with the senate, and Quintus Fabius did nothing more than put forward the single question the deputation had been instructed to ask. One of the Carthaginians then replied:</p>
<p>“Romans, even your earlier delegation, when you were demanding that Hannibal be surrendered to you for blockading Saguntum on his own initiative, was presumptuous enough. But this delegation, while its language is to this point more restrained, is actually more unreasonable. <span class="italic">Then</span> Hannibal was being accused and his surrender demanded at the same time; <span class="italic">now</span> a confession of wrongdoing is being wrung from <span class="italic">us</span> and immediate satisfaction also demanded—as though we had already confessed. To my mind, the pertinent question is not whether the assault on Saguntum came from individual initiative or state policy but whether the attack was or was not justified. For the investigation and punishment of a citizen for what he has done with our blessing or on his own is our prerogative and ours alone. With <span class="italic">you</span> the only matter for discussion is whether the action was permissible under the treaty.</p>
