<p>The land that lies between the Trebia and the Po was then inhabited by Gauls who, as the two superpowers came into conflict, vacillated in their support, quite clearly with an eye to gaining the victor’s favor. The Romans were happy enough with this, provided they took no action, but the Carthaginian leader was very unhappy—he had come to liberate the Gauls, he kept saying, and at their request. In his anger over this, and at the same time to provide his men with spoils, he commanded two thousand infantry and a thousand cavalry (Numidians mostly, but with some Gauls also among them) to systematically pillage Gallic farmlands right up to the banks of the Po.

They sent a deputation to the consuls and begged for Roman aid for a land suffering damage through its inhabitants being all too loyal to the Romans.</p>

They took the Carthaginians by surprise as they were roving around out of formation, most of them also burdened with loot, and they created sheer panic and great carnage, chasing them right to the outposts
