After riding around the area, and from careful inspection seeing for himself that it provided sufficient cover for concealing even cavalry, Hannibal said to his brother Mago: “This will be the spot for you to occupy. Choose a hundred men from all your infantry and a hundred from your cavalry, and come to me with them at first watch.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL233_157_206" id="target_note_LCL233_157_206"><sup>206</sup></a> Now it is time for food and rest.”</p>
<p>With that the meeting was adjourned. A little later Mago appeared with the men he had selected. “I see here the toughest of my men,” said Hannibal. “But to have the strength of numbers to match your courage, you must each chose nine like yourselves from your respective troops and maniples. Mago will show you the spot for your ambush—you face an enemy blind to such arts of war.”</p>

Then, after provoking a confrontation, they were to draw him over the river by gradually ceding ground.</p>
<p>Such were the orders for the Numidians. The other infantry and cavalry officers were to tell all their men to take their meal and then await the signal, armed and with horses saddled.</p>
