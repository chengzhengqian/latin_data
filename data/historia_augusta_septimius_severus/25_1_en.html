<p>His clothing was of the plainest; indeed, even his tunic had scarcely any purple on it, while he covered his shoulders with a shaggy cloak. He was very sparing in his diet,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_419_1" id="target_note_LCL139_419_1"><sup>1</sup></a> was fond of his native beans, liked wine at times, and often went without meat. In person he was large and handsome. His beard was long; his hair was gray and curly, his face was such as to inspire respect. His voice was clear, but retained an African accent even to his old age. After his death he was much beloved, for then all envy of his power or fear of his cruelty had vanished.</p>

<p>XX. I can remember reading in Aelius Maurus, the freedman of that Phlegon<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_419_2" id="target_note_LCL139_419_2"><sup>2</sup></a> who was Hadrian’s freedman, that Septimius Severus rejoiced exceedingly at the time of his death, because he was leaving two Antonini to rule the state with equal powers,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_419_3" id="target_note_LCL139_419_3"><sup>3</sup></a> herein following the example of Pius, who left to the state Verus and Marcus Antoninus, his two sons by adoption; and that he rejoiced all the more, because, while Pius had left only adopted sons, he was leaving sons of his own blood to rule the Roman state, namely Antoninus Bassianus, whom he had begotten from his first marriage,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_419_4a" id="target_note_LCL139_419_4a"><sup>4</sup></a> and Geta, whom Julia had borne him. In these high hopes, however, he was grievously deceived; for the state was denied the one by murder,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_419_5" id="target_note_LCL139_419_5"><sup>5</sup></a> the other<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_419_6" id="target_note_LCL139_419_6"><sup>6</sup></a> by his own character. And in scarcely any case did that revered name<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_419_7" id="target_note_LCL139_419_7"><sup>7</sup></a> long or creditably survive. Indeed, when I reflect on the matter, Diocletian Augustus, it is quite clear to me
