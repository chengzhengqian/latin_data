<p>Next he ruled the Pannonias<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_379_1" id="target_note_LCL139_379_1"><sup>1</sup></a> with proconsular powers, and after this he drew in the allotment the proconsular province of Sicily. At Rome, meanwhile, he was presented with a second son.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_379_2" id="target_note_LCL139_379_2"><sup>2</sup></a> While he was in Sicily he was indicted for consulting about the imperial dignity with seers and astrologers, but, because Commodus was now beginning to be detested,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_379_3" id="target_note_LCL139_379_3"><sup>3</sup></a> he was acquitted by the prefects of the guard to whom he had been handed over for trial, while his accuser was crucified. He now served his first consulship, having Apuleius Rufinus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_379_4" id="target_note_LCL139_379_4"><sup>4</sup></a> for his? <span class="marginNote right">189</span>colleague—an office to which Commodus appointed him from among a large number of aspirants. After the consulship he spent about a year free from public duties; then, on the recommendation of Laetus, he was put in charge of the army in Germany.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_379_5" id="target_note_LCL139_379_5"><sup>5</sup></a> Just as he was setting out for Germany, he acquired elaborate gardens, although he had previously kept only an unpretentious dwelling in the city and a single farm in Venetia. And now, when he was reclining on the ground in these gardens, partaking of a frugal supper with his children, his elder son, who was then five years old, divided the fruit, when it was served, with rather a bounteous hand among his young playmates. And when his father reproved him, saying: “Be more sparing; for you have not the riches of a king,” the five-year-old child replied: “No, but I shall have”. On coming to Germany, Severus conducted himself in this office in such a manner as to increase a reputation which was already illustrious.</p>
