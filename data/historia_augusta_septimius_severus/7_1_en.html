<p>VI. After the murder of Julianus Severus still remained encamped and in his tents as though he were advancing through a hostile territory; the senate, therefore, sent a delegation of a hundred senators to bear him congratulations and sue for pardon. And when these met him at Interamna, they were searched for concealed weapons and only then suffered to greet him as he stood armed and in the midst of armed men. But on the following day, after all the palace attendants had arrived, he presented each member of the delegation with seven hundred and twenty pieces of gold,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_383_4a" id="target_note_LCL139_383_4a"><sup>4</sup></a> and sent them on ahead, granting to such as desired, however, the privilege of remaining and returning to Rome with himself. Without further delay, he appointed as prefect of the guard that Flavius Juvenalis whom Julianus had chosen for his third prefect.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_383_5" id="target_note_LCL139_383_5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

(100,000 sesterces) was now equal to only 720 aurei instead of 1000. Accordingly, the sum that was presented to each of the legates was the equivalent of 100,000 sesterces reckoned according to the later standard. See von Domaszewski in <span class="italic">Rhein.
