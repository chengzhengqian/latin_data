<p>XXIII. In many communities there are public buildings erected by him which are famous, but particularly noteworthy among the achievements of his life was the restoration of all the public sanctuaries in Rome, which were then falling to ruin through the passage of time. And seldom did he inscribe his own name on these restorations or fail to preserve the names of those who built them. At his death he left a surplus of grain to the amount of seven years’ tribute,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_427_2" id="target_note_LCL139_427_2"><sup>2</sup></a> or enough to distribute seventy-five thousand pecks a day, and so much oil,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_427_3" id="target_note_LCL139_427_3"><sup>3</sup></a> indeed, that for five years there was plenty for the uses, not only of the city, but also for as much of Italy as was in need of it.</p>
<p>His last words, it is said, were these: “The state, when I received it, was harassed on every side; I leave it at peace, even in Britain; old now and with crippled feet, I bequeath to my two Antonini an empire which is strong, if they prove good, feeble, if they prove bad”. After this, he issued orders to give the tribune the watchword “Let us toil,” because Pertinax, when he assumed the imperial power, had given the word “Let us be soldiers”.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_427_4" id="target_note_LCL139_427_4"><sup>4</sup></a> He then ordered a duplicate made of the royal statue of Fortune which was customarily carried about with the emperors and placed in their bedrooms,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_427_5" id="target_note_LCL139_427_5"><sup>5</sup></a> in order that he might leave this most holy statue to each of his sons; but later, when he realized that the hour of death was upon him, he gave instructions, they say, that the original should be placed in the bed-chambers
