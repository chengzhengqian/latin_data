<p>There was at that time in the same monastery a certain little boy that was lately called to the faith, a Saxon born, which was taken with the same sickness and kept his bed upon his back no small time. When, therefore, the second day of the said fasting and praying was being observed, it happened that about the second hour<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL248_81_1" id="target_note_LCL248_81_1"><sup>1</sup></a> of the day this boy was found by himself alone in the place where he lay sick: and suddenly by the appointment of God there vouchsafed to appear unto him the most blessed chiefs of the apostles. For the boy was of very innocent and meek nature, and with sincere devotion kept the sacraments of faith which he had received. The apostles then saluted him with most gentle words, saying: â€œFear not, son, the death for which thou art so pensive: for we are to bring thee this day to the heavenly realms. But first thou hast to tarry till the masses be said, and after thou hast received thy voyage-provision of the body and blood of the Lord, till (being so released of sickness as well as death) thou be lifted up to everlasting joys in heaven. Do thou therefore call for the priest Eappa unto thee, and tell him that the Lord hath heard your prayers and hath looked with favour upon your devotion and fastings: neither is anyone more to die of this plague from this monastery
