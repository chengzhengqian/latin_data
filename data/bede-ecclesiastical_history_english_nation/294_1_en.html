In the time of whose bishopric Cadwalla did overcome and put out the aldermen and took the government to himself: and when he had kept the same by the space of two years, at length, being pricked with the love of the kingdom on high, he left it, while the same prelate did yet govern the church; and going into Rome there ended his life, as must be told more at large hereafter.</p>
