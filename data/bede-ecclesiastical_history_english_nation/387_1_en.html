<h4><span class="italic">How a certain man in the province of Northumberland rising from the dead told many things both terrible and worthy to be desired that he had seen.</span></h4>

There was then in the coast of Northumberland, called Incuneningum,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL248_253_3" id="target_note_LCL248_253_3"><sup>3</sup></a> a householder living a godly life with his family; and he fell sick and (the disease growing daily more and more upon him) was brought to extremity, and in the beginning of the night died; but in the dawning of the day reviving again and sitting up suddenly he caused all that had remained weeping about the corse to run away, as men wonderfully amazed with fear: only his wife which loved him more (although she trembled and quaked) tarried behind; and he comforting her, said: “Be not afraid, for I am now risen in very deed from the death that had dominion over me, and am permitted to live among men again; yet not after the manner I was wont before, but henceforth my conversation must be far unlike that other.”
