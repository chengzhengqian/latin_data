also at his baptism named Peter, that by communion of name he might be united to the most blessed chief of the apostles, to whose most holy body his godly love had brought him to come from the ends of the earth; and in his church too he was buried: and at the pope’s commandment an epitaph was written upon his tomb, that the memory of his devoutness thereupon engraved might continue throughout all ages, and the readers and hearers also might be stirred to religious zeal by the example of that he had done. The epitaph was written after this sort:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">“All high estate and wealth and rule, all hope of race to come,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">All triumphs, spoil and captive chiefs, walled cities, camp</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">and home;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">All that his fathers’ might or he had hoarded for their pride,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">The warrior prince Cadwalla set for love of God aside,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">That Peter he a pilgrim king might see and Peter’s place,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">And in his font the waters pure might take of saving grace;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">And drink the dazzling radiance of that bright shining beam</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Which spreadeth through the world its light in one life-giving</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">stream.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">And in his eagerness of heart a life renewed to claim,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">His former barbarous rage he changed, he changed his former</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">name,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">And triumph in the change he gat: pope Sergius gave</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">command</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">That Peter he be called, and took as godfather his hand,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">When from the font new-born he rose, and straight in robes</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">of white</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">He whom Christ’s grace had cleansed, above was borne to</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">heavenly height.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">O wondrous was that princely faith! and yet more wondrous</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">far</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Christ’s mercy, unapproachable to all Whose judgments are.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">From Britain’s furthest clime to Rome he was in safety</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">brought</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Through divera nations, over seas, by roads with peril</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
