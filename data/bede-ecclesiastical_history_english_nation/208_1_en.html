Who coming to the country of the East English was honourably received of the said king, and pursuing his accustomed work of preaching the Gospel he wrought with many, both by the example of his goodness and the urgency of his preaching, either converting unbelievers to Christ or strengthening further in the faith and love of Christ them that already believed.</p>
<p>And being seized there with a certain sickness of body he was counted worthy to have the joy of an angelic vision wherein he was warned to press on earnestly in the ministry of the word, which he had begun, and persevere unweariedly in his accustomed watching and praying; for that his end was certain, but the coming hour of the same end was uncertain, according to the saying of the Lord:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL246_417_1" id="target_note_LCL246_417_1"><sup>1</sup></a> “Watch therefore, for ye know not the day nor the hour.” Being strengthened with which vision he hastened with all speed to build up a monastery in the place king Sigbert had given him and to give instruction therein to regular discipline. Now the monastery was pleasantly situated for the woods and sea adjoining, being erected in a castle which in the tongue of the English is called Cnobheresburg, that is the city of Cnobhere;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL246_417_2" id="target_note_LCL246_417_2"><sup>2</sup></a> which afterwards Anna the king of that country and all the noble men enriched with buildings of more majesty and with offerings. Moreover, this Fursa came of the noblest race of the Scots, but he was far nobler of mind than of birth of the flesh. From the very time of his childhood he gave no small pains to the reading of the Scriptures and monastical discipline, and as especially becometh holy men, all things that he had learned ought to be done, he was diligent in endeavouring to execute.</p>
