son, as it is meet for a loving father to do, that ye hasten all manner of ways ye can with earnest will and constant supplications to keep this that the mercy of God hath vouchsafed to grant in calling you to His grace; that so He which hath vouchsafed to bring you in this present world, freed from all error, to the acknowledgment of His name, may also prepare a mansion place for you in the heavenly country. Be ye therefore often busied in the reading of Gregory your preacher and my lord of apostolic memory, having before your eyes the goodwill of the teaching of the selfsame, which he gladly practised for the sake of your souls: that so his prayer may both increase your kingdom and your people, and make you to appear in the end without fault before Almighty God. Now as concerning those things which you hoped should be ordained by us for your bishops, we do without any delay and with readiness of mind make it our care to grant them, for the sake of the unfeignedness of your faith, of which we have been commendably informed in divers reports by the bearers of these our presents; and we have sent two palls belonging to the two metropolitans, that is, for Honorius and Paulinus, in order that when one of them is called out of this world to the Author of his being, the other should appoint a bishop in his place by this our authority. And this thing truly we are moved to grant, as well for the good will of your love, as for the situation of such great provinces at the distance which is known to separate us from you, to the intent we might in all points shew our readiness to meet your devotion and act according to your wishes.</p>
<p>“May the grace from above have your excellency in safe keeping!”</p>
