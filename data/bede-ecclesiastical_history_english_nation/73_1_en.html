fear. For when Paul the Apostle said: ‘He that cannot contain, let him have his wife;’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL246_147_1" id="target_note_LCL246_147_1"><sup>1</sup></a> he was careful straight to say farther: ‘Now this I say by permission, not of commandment.’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL246_147_2" id="target_note_LCL246_147_2"><sup>2</sup></a> For there is no permission of that which is lawful, seeing it is right. Wherefore in that he used this word <span class="italic">permission</span> he shewed it to be faulty.</p>
<p>“Moreover, it is to be pondered with good heed that the Lord intending to speak to the people in the mount of Sinai, first gave commandment that the same people should abstain from women. And if the purity of the body was there so earnestly required, where the Lord by means of a creature made subject to Him did speak unto men, that they which should hear the words of God should be free from women; how much more the women which receive the body of the Almighty Lord shall seek to preserve in themselves the cleanness of the flesh, lest they may take hurt by the very greatness of that inestimable mystery. Hereof also it is said by the priest<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL246_147_3" id="target_note_LCL246_147_3"><sup>3</sup></a> unto David as touching his servants, that, if they were clean from women, they should eat of the Shew Bread, which otherwise they should no way be suffered to take, except David would first say that they were clean from women. Then, moreover, the man who hath been washed with water after the carnal knowledge of his wife may also receive the mystery of the holy Communion, when according to the judgment before laid down he may come also to the church.”</p>
<p>IX. <span class="italic">Question of Augustine</span>. “Whether after the illusion which is wont to befall unto a man in his dream, either anyone may receive the body of the Lord or, if he be priest, celebrate the holy mysteries?”</p>
