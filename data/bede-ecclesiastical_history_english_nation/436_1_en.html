Church doth receive as agreeable to the Christian faith, whereof you likewise desired me to write to you. It is true we know that neither were the apostles shaven all after one and the same sort, nor now doth the catholic Church, though it agreeth in one faith, hope and charity towards God, likewise use one and the selfsame fashion of tonsure throughout the world. In short, that we may look back to the times before us, to wit the times of the patriarchs, Job a pattern of patience, by shaving his head<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL248_351_1" id="target_note_LCL248_351_1"><sup>1</sup></a> at the time his afflictions fell upon him, shewed at any rate that in time of prosperity he was accustomed to let his hair grow. But Joseph, himself too the truly excellent practiser and teacher of chastity, lowliness, godliness and all other virtues, is said to have been shorn when he was to be taken out of bondage<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL248_351_2" id="target_note_LCL248_351_2"><sup>2</sup></a>: whereby it is well manifest that in the time of his bondage he was wont to remain in prison with his hair unshorn. Lo, here two men of God, though their inward conscience did agree together in like grace of virtuous actions, yet shewed abroad a different fashion of countenance the one from the other.</p>
<p>â€œBut though I may boldly say that the diversity of tonsure hurteth nothing them that have a pure faith in God and unfeigned charity toward their neighbour; especially seeing we do not read there hath been ever any controversy between the catholic fathers touching difference of tonsure, as there hath been strife touching the diversity of Easter, or in matters of faith; yet notwithstanding, amongst all kinds of tonsure which we find either in the Church or among mankind at large, I may rightly say that none is rather to be followed and embraced of us
