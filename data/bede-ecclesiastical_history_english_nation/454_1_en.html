<p>Likewise a book of Epistles to divers persons: whereof one is of the six ages of the world: one of the halting-places of the children of Israel, one of the words of Isaiah: “And they shall be shut up in the prison, and after many days they shall be visited”; one of the reason of Leap Year; one of the Equinox, after Anatolius.</p>
<p>Likewise of the histories of the Saints; a book of the life and passion of St. Felix, confessor, hath been by me translated into prose after the work in metre of Paulinus.</p>
<p>The Book of the life and passion of saint Anastasius, which was ill translated from the Greek, and worse amended by some unskilful person, I have corrected to the sense as well as I was able.</p>
