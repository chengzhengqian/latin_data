For in that place there lay a stone close to the ground, covered with a little green turf, and not one other could be found in all that level ground; and it fortuned by chance, or rather by the providence of God to punish my fault of disobedience, that I pitched upon this stone with my head and hand, which in the fall I had put under my head, and so broke my thumb and also cracked my skull; and, as I said, was most like one that was dead. And because I could not be moved, they stretched forth a tent for me to lie in upon the place.

And coming in to me early in the morning, he said a prayer over me and called me by my name, and when I waked as it were out of a great slumber, he asked me, if I knew who it was that spoke to me.
