flesh of the same woman could not be putrefied, doth well shew that she continued uncorrupted and untouched by any man.</p>
<p>And she long and earnestly besought the king that she might have leave to forsake the cares of the world, and in a monastery serve only Christ the true king; and when hardly did she sometime obtain leave, she entered into the monastery of abbess Ebba who was aunt to king Egfrid, and it standeth in the place they name the town of Coludi,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL248_105_1" id="target_note_LCL248_105_1"><sup>1</sup></a> where she received the veil of a nun’s habit from the aforesaid bishop Wilfrid.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL248_105_2" id="target_note_LCL248_105_2"><sup>2</sup></a> But after a year she was herself made abbess in the country which is called Elge<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL248_105_3" id="target_note_LCL248_105_3"><sup>3</sup></a>; where having built a monastery she began to be a virgin mother of very many virgins dedicated to God, both in examples and lessons of heavenly life. And of her it is said, that from the time that she went to the monastery she would never wear linen but only woollen clothes<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL248_105_4" id="target_note_LCL248_105_4"><sup>4</sup></a>: and seldom wash herself in warm baths, save against solemn high feasts, namely Easter, Whitsuntide and Twelfthtide; and then would she be last of all, and with her own hands and the hands of her servants first washed<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL248_105_5" id="target_note_LCL248_105_5"><sup>5</sup></a> the rest of Christ’s handmaids that were there. Seldom except on high feasts or closer need did she eat more than once a day: always, unless a sorer sickness had let her, from the time of the morning assembling<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL248_105_6" id="target_note_LCL248_105_6"><sup>6</sup></a> until the rising of the day she would abide in the church, still continuing at her prayers. There are too that say that by the spirit of prophecy she did foretell both the pestilence whereof she should die herself, and also did openly in all their presence let them know the number of those that should be taken thereby from this world out of her monastery.
