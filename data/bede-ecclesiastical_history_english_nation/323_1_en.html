holden in no bonds, he gave him his leave to ransom himself, if he were able. Now after the third hour when masses were wont to be said, his fetters were most often loosed. Whereupon he upon his oath to come again or send his ransom to the Frisian, came to Kent to king Lothere (who was son to the sister<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL248_125_1" id="target_note_LCL248_125_1"><sup>1</sup></a> of queen Ethelthryth of whom we have spoken before), for that he had himself too been sometime thane to the same queen: and sued to the king and obtained the price of his ransom, and sent it in place of himself to his owner, as he had promised.</p>
<p>And after this he returned to his own country, and coming to his brother unfolded in order all the adversities that had befallen him, and what comforts he had had in his adversities: and by what his brother told him he knew that his fetters had been loosed at those times specially at which the solemnities of the masses had been celebrated for him. Moreover, he understood that the other helps and succours that had happened to him in his danger had been given of the heavenly grace through his brotherâ€™s intercession and offering of the wholesome host. And many on hearing these things from the foresaid man were kindled in faith and godly devoutness unto prayer, or to giving of alms, or to offering to the Lord hosts of the holy oblation, for the delivery of their friends that were departed this world: for they understood that the wholesome sacrifice was effectual to the everlasting ransoming both of soul and body.</p>
<p>This history was told me also of certain of them that heard it of the very man in whom it was done: and therefore having ascertained it clearly, I doubted no whit to put it into our Ecclesiastical History.</p>
