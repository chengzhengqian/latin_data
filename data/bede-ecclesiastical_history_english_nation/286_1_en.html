taken with the foresaid plague, when he came to his last moment, cried out three times upon one of the virgins consecrated to Christ, speaking to her, as if she were present, by her own name, “Eadgyth, Eadgyth, Eadgyth”; and therewithal ending the temporal life entered into life eternal. But that virgin which he called at his death, straightway in the place where she was, being taken with the same sickness, the very same day that she was so called was taken out of this life, and followed him that called her to the kingdom of heaven.</p>
<p>Also a certain one of the same handmaids of God, being taken with the said disease and now brought to her last point, began suddenly about midnight to cry out to them that attended her, desiring them to put out the candle that was there burning: and when she ofttimes called and so desired them, and yet none of them would do as she bade them: “I know,” put she in at the last, “that ye think me thus to speak as if I were not in my right mind; but now at this time know ye that it is not so: for I tell you truly that I see this house filled with so great a light that that candle of yours seemeth to me altogether dim.” And when none of them did even yet answer unto these sayings of hers nor follow her bidding: “Well,” quoth she again, “let that candle burn as long as ye list; but yet know ye well that the same is not my light: for my light is to come to me when the morning beginneth.” And she began to tell that a certain man of God appeared unto her, which had died the same year, and said to her, that when the morning light drew near, she should depart hence to the everlasting light. The truth of which vision was proved by the speedy death of the maiden about the break of day.</p>
