<p>Amongst his other doings the blessed pope Gregory caused that in the churches of the holy apostles Peter and Paul masses should be said over their bodies. Moreover too in the very celebration of these masses he added three petitions full of the highest perfection: “And dispose our days in thy peace, and command us to be taken from eternal damnation, and to be numbered in the flock of thine elect.”</p>
<p>Now he governed the Church in the days of the emperors Maurice and Focas. But in the second year of the said Focas’ empire, departing out of this life he passed to the true life which is in heaven. His body was buried in deed in the church of the blessed apostle Peter before the vestry, the 12th day of March, with the which same body he shall rise again hereafter in glory with the other pastors of the holy Church: and on the tomb which he had for himself was written such an epitaph as followeth:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">“Receive, O earth, this body formed of dust of thine, to keep</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Until the same the Lord shall wake to life again from sleep.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">His spirit to the stars is gone, no right hath Death to maim,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Which rather is the way for him that other life to claim.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Pontiff supreme, within the tomb his bones are buried here,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Which ever and in every place made his good deeds appear.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">The hungry he with food sustained, the naked he arrayed,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">With sacred warnings human souls from Satan’s power he stayed</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">He did in deed what things in word soever he did teach,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">To be ensample unto them which heard his holy speech.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">The English to Christ’s faith he turned, his goodness being guide,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">And with a new race made the ranks of Christian men more wide.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">This was thy toil, thy zealous care, good shepherd, only fain</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Unto thy Lord for offering a larger flock to gain.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">With these thy triumphs then rejoice, God’s consul captain made,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">For of thy deeds a sure reward thou hast, which cannot fade.”</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
