with the knowledge of Holy Scripture, and endued by the grace of God with good works, whatsoever he adviseth you to do, gladly hear it, devoutly do it, diligently remember it: for if you hear him in that he speaketh unto you in the Almighty Lord’s behalf, the same Almighty God the sooner heareth him entreating for you. For if (as God forbid) you forbear to give heed to his words, when can Almighty God hear him in your behalf, whom you despise to hear in God’s behalf? Wherefore with all your heart join yourself closely with him in zealousness of faith, and assist his endeavour with the excellency that God hath given you, that He may Himself make you partaker of His kingdom Whose faith you in your kingdom cause to be received and observed.</p>
<p>“Furthermore, we will your highness to know that (according as we are taught in the Holy Scriptures by the words of the Almighty Lord) the end of the present world now draweth onward, and the kingdom of the saints shall follow, which can never have an end. And the same end of the world approaching, many things are at hand which have not been heard of before: that is, to wit, changes of the air, terrible sights from the heaven, tempests contrary to the ordering of seasons, wars, famines, pestilences, earthquakes in divers places; all which yet shall not fall in our days, but all shall follow close after our days. Wherefore if you know any of these to be in your land, let not your mind in any way be dismayed therewith; for therefore are these signs of the end of the world sent before the time, to the intent we should the more diligently tender the health of our souls, live in expectation
