reverend bishop Wilfrid,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL248_71_1" id="target_note_LCL248_71_1"><sup>1</sup></a> the said bishop was put out of the see of his bishopric and two bishops appointed in his place to be over the people of the Northumbrians: Bosa, namely, to govern the province of the Derans, and Eata the province of the Bernicians: which Bosa had his episcopal see in the city of York, and Eata in Hexham or else in the church of Lindisfarne, both men being taken from out of the cloister of monks and called to the degree of bishop. And with them also was Eadhed made bishop in the province of Lindsey which king Egfrid had very lately conquered of Wulfhere, whom he overcame in battle and put to flight. And the same province received this man as the first prelate they had of their own; the next was Ethelwin, the third Edgar, the fourth Cynibert, who is there at this present. For before Eadhed the province had Sexwulf for bishop, who was bishop also of the Marchmen and Middle English as well: whereby too being put out of Lindsey he remained in control of those other provinces. Now Eadhed, Bosa and Eata were ordained at York by Archbishop Theodore: who also three years after Wilfrid’s departing thence, added two more to the number of these, namely, Tunbert at the church of Hexham, Eata remaining at Lindisfarne, and Trumwine for the province of the Redshanks,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL248_71_2" id="target_note_LCL248_71_2"><sup>2</sup></a> which at that time was subject to the dominion of the English. Because that Ethelred had recovered the province of Lindsey, Eadhed came back from thence and was by Theodore set over the church of Ripon.</p>

Bright, p. 282. Egfrid was irritated because Wilfrid encouraged his first wife to become a nun, and his second wife was Wilfrid’s enemy because of his wealth and power.
