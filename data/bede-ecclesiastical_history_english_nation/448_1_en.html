<h4><span class="italic">Chronological recapitulation of the whole work; and concerning the Author himself.</span></h4>
<p><span class="sc">But</span> those things which have been related more at large according to the division of the times, I have thought fit to sum up shortly to the intent they may be better had in memory.</p>
<p>In the sixtieth year then before the incarnation of the Lord, Gaius Julius Caesar, first of the Romans, assailed Britain with war and won the victory, and yet could he not for all that gain the kingdom there.</p>
<p>In the year of the Lord’s incarnation 46, Claudius coming the second of the Romans into Britain, brought the greater part of the island into subjection; and also added the Orkney Islands to the Roman empire.</p>
<p>In the year of the Lord’s incarnation 167 Eleuther, being made prelate of Rome, ruled the Church fifteen years with great glory. To whom Lucius, king of Britain, sent a letter, asking that he might be made a Christian, and was granted his request.</p>
<p>In the year of the Lord’s incarnation 189, Severus, being made emperor, ruled seventeen years, and he compassed Britain with a rampart from sea to sea.</p>
<p>In the year 381, Maximus, being made emperor in Britain, crossed the sea into Gaul and slew Gratian.</p>
<p>In the year 409 Rome was brought down of the Goths; from which time the Romans ceased to rule in Britain.</p>
