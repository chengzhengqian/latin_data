called Deirans,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL246_203_1" id="target_note_LCL246_203_1"><sup>1</sup></a> being plucked from the ire of God and called to the mercy of Christ. How is the king of that province called?” It was answered that his name was Aella,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL246_203_2" id="target_note_LCL246_203_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Whereupon Gregory playing upon the name saith: “Alleluia! the praise of God the Creator must be sounded in those parts.” And coming to the bishop of the Roman and apostolic see (for himself was not yet chosen bishop thereof), he besought him that he would send to the English people in Britain some ministers of the word, by whom they might be converted unto Christ; saying that he himself was ready to carry out this work with the help of the Lord, yet only if it should please the pope apostolic to permit of the same. And while he was not able to accomplish this (for though the bishop would have granted him that he had asked, yet the burghers of Rome could not have suffered him to depart so far from the city), afterward, as soon as himself entered upon the office of bishop, he brought to pass the work he had before so long desired: sending indeed other preachers, but himself helping to make their preaching fruitful by his exhortations and prayers. This much according to the report which we have heard from days of old we have thought fitting to put in the History of our Church.</p>
