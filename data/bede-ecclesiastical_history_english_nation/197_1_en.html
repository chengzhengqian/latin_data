marvellous devout and godly man: who by the space of seven years ruled the province of the Deirans in most plenty of all things and with the love of all his subjects. But Oswy who governed the other part of the Northumbrian nation on the north, to wit the province of the Bernicians, could not live peaceably with him; nay, rather forging and increasing causes of debate he murdered him most cruelly. For, an army being on both parts assembled opposite, Oswin, seeing that he was not able to join battle with him that had a greater host of men, thought it more expedient to give over his purpose of fighting at that time and keep himself until better occasion served. Therefore he discharged his army which he had gathered together, and commanded them severally to return home again from the place which is called Wilfaraesdun,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL246_395_1" id="target_note_LCL246_395_1"><sup>1</sup></a> that is Wilfar’s Hill, and standeth almost ten mile from the village of Cataract, being withdrawn over against the setting of the sun in summer: and Oswin conveyed himself out of the way with one only that was his most faithful thane, named Tondher, to hide himself in the house of Hunwald, a retainer<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL246_395_2" id="target_note_LCL246_395_2"><sup>2</sup></a> whom also he took to be of himself a very friend to him. But alas, sad to say! he was far otherwise: for, being by the same retainer betrayed, Oswin, along with his aforesaid thane, was slain of Oswy through the means of his reeve<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL246_395_3" id="target_note_LCL246_395_3"><sup>3</sup></a> Ethelwin, by a death that was abominable in the eyes of all. And this was done the 20th day of August in the ninth year of his reign in the place which is called Ingetlingum:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL246_395_4" id="target_note_LCL246_395_4"><sup>4</sup></a> where afterward for the satisfaction of this heinous act there was a monastery builded:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL246_395_5" id="target_note_LCL246_395_5"><sup>5</sup></a> in the which daily prayers should be offered to the Lord for the redemption of both the kings’ souls, to wit.
