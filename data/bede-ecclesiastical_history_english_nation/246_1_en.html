And the king sent with him his priest, Eadhed by name, who after in the reign of king Egfrid was made prelate of the church of Ripon. But they at their arrival in Kent found that the archbishop Deusdedit had now passed from the world and no other was yet appointed bishop in his room. Whereby they stroke over to the province of the West Saxons where Wini was bishop; and of him the foresaid Chad was consecrated bishop, having with him to assist and accompany him at the ordination two bishops of the British race, who celebrate the Lord’s Easter day, as hath often been said before, contrary to<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL246_493_1" id="target_note_LCL246_493_1"><sup>1</sup></a> the canonical order from the 14th to the 20th moon. For there was not at this time, beside this bishop Wini, any bishop canonically ordained in all Britain.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL246_493_2" id="target_note_LCL246_493_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Chad then being consecrated bishop began shortly to be zealous in care for ecclesiastical truth and purity of doctrine; to apply his heart to lowliness, abstinency and study; to visit continually the towns, country places, cottages, villages, houses for the sake of preaching the Gospel, not making his journey on horseback but going on foot as the apostles used. For he was one of Aidan’s scholars and laboured to instruct his hearers in the same way of life and behaviour after the example of Aidan and his own brother Cedd. Wilfrid also coming to Britain, now made a bishop, did himself too by his teaching bring into the churches of the English very many rules of catholic observance. Whereby it came to pass that the catholic practice daily continuing to increase, the whole company of the Scots which lived among the Englishmen either yielded to the same or returned back to their country.</p>
