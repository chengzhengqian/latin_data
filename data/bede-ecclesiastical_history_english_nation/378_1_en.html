<h4><span class="italic">How Egbert, a holy man, would gladly have come to Germany to preach, and could not: further, how Witbert went thither in deed, but because he had not either done any good, returned back to Ireland, from whence he had come.</span></h4>
<p><span class="sc">At</span> that time the venerable servant of Christ and priest<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL248_235_1" id="target_note_LCL248_235_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Egbert, of me to be named with all honourable mention, who (as we said before) lived like a pilgrim in the isle of Ireland to obtain a country in the heavens, purposed with himself to profit many, that is to say, to take upon him the work of an apostle, and by preaching of the Gospel to bring the word of God to some of those nations which had not yet heard it: and many such countries he knew to be in Germany, of whom the English or Saxons, which now inhabit Britain, are well known to have had beginning and offspring; whereby it is that to this day they are corruptly called Garmans by the Britons that are their neighbours. Such now are the Frisons, Rugins,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL248_235_2" id="target_note_LCL248_235_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Danes, Huns, Old Saxons, and Boructuars:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL248_235_3" id="target_note_LCL248_235_3"><sup>3</sup></a> there are very many other nations in the same parts, observing yet the rites of paynims, to whom the foresaid soldier of Christ purposed to go after he had sailed round about Britain, if haply he might be able to deliver any of them from Satan and trade them toward Christ; or if this could not come to pass, he thought to come to Rome to see and to worship the churches of the blessed apostles and martyrs of Christ.</p>
