time. Whatsoever moon, therefore, is at full before the day and night be of one length, being to wit 14 or 15 days old, that moon pertaineth to the last month the year before, and therefore is not meet for keeping Easter. But that moon which is at full after the day and night be of equal length or in the very point of that equality, in that doubtless (because it is the full moon of the first month) we must understand both that the ancients were wont to keep the Passover, and that we ought to keep Easter, when the Sunday cometh. And that it should be so, this reason without doubt enforceth, that in Genesis it is written that,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL248_343_1" id="target_note_LCL248_343_1"><sup>1</sup></a> ‘God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day; and the lesser light to rule the night’: or as another rendering hath,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL248_343_2" id="target_note_LCL248_343_2"><sup>2</sup></a> ‘the greater light to begin the day; and the lesser light to begin the night.’ Therefore as first the sun coming forth from the midst of the east made by that his rising the equality of day and night in the spring; and after, the moon (the sun going down at evening) followed itself also at the full from the midst of the east; so every year the same first month of the moon must be observed after the same order, so that she should be at the full not before the day and night be of one length, but either on the very day of that equality, as was done in the beginning, or when it is past. But if the full moon go but one day before the day and night be of one length, the aforesaid reason proveth that this moon must be assigned not to the first month of the year beginning, but rather to the last month of the year that is past; and for that consideration is not meet for the celebration of the Paschal festival.</p>
