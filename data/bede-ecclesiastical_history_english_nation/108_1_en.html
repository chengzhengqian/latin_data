<p>After this the beloved man of God, father Augustine, died, and his body was laid by the church of the blessed apostles Peter and Paul (of which church we have made mention before), without the door thereof, because it was not yet finished nor dedicated. But as soon as the church was dedicated, his body was brought in and decently buried in the north chapel of the church: where also were interred the bodies of all the archbishops following, except two only, that is Theodore and Bertwald; whose bodies were laid in the church itself, because the said chapel could receive no more. This chapel hath almost in the middle of it an altar dedicated in the honour of the blessed pope Gregory, at the which altar every Saturday masses<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL246_217_1" id="target_note_LCL246_217_1"><sup>1</sup></a> in their memory are solemnly celebrated by the priest of that place. Moreover, in the tomb of the same Augustine was written such an epitaph as followeth:</p>
<p>“Here lieth in rest the lord Augustine, first archbishop of Canterbury, who aforetime sent hither of the blessed Gregory, bishop of the city of Rome, and strengthened of God by working of miracles, won over Ethelbert the king and his people from the worship of idols to the faith of Christ, and so fulfilling in peace the days of his office he died the 26th of May<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL246_217_2" id="target_note_LCL246_217_2"><sup>2</sup></a> in the reign of the same king.”</p>
