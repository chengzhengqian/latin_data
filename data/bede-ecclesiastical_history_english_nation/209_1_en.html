<p>Why make a long story? In process of time he both builded himself a monastery wherein he might with more liberty attend to the study of heavenly things: and therein being stricken with sickness he was taken out of the body,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL246_419_1" id="target_note_LCL246_419_1"><sup>1</sup></a> as the book written of his life doth sufficiently testify: and from evening until cockcrow being out of the body he was thought worthy to behold the sight of the angelical company, and to hear their blessed thanksgivings. Further, he was wont to tell that among other things he openly heard them sing: “Holy men shall go from virtue to virtue.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL246_419_2" id="target_note_LCL246_419_2"><sup>2</sup></a> And again: “The God of gods shall be seen in Sion.” And this man, being restored again to the body and within three days after taken out again, saw not only greater joys of the blessed, but also mighty conflicts of wicked spirits which without rest went about to stop him of his journey toward heaven with their often accusations, but yet by the warding of the angels availed naught against him: of all the which things if any listeth more at large to be instructed, as with what spiteful subtleties the evil spirits unfolded his doings and superfluous words as well as his very thoughts, as if they had been written in a book; what glad and heavy tidings he learned of the holy angels, and what things of righteous men appearing unto him amongst the angels, let him read the little book itself of his life, of which I have spoken, and he shall receive therefrom, as I think, much spiritual advantage.</p>
<p>Among the which yet one thing there is that we have thought profitable to many to set down in this History. At what time then he was carried away heavenward, he was commanded of the angels who conducted him, to look back upon the world.
