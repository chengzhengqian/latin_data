being at length near burnt and the furious flashes extending themselves to the bishop’s palace, the bishop trusting in God’s help, where the help of man now failed, commanded that he might be carried out of his house and set against these fierce flaws of fire flying all round about. Now in that part where the assault of the flames fell most sorely there was the tomb of the blessed Four Crowned Martyrs.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL246_239_1" id="target_note_LCL246_239_1"><sup>1</sup></a> When the bishop by the hands of his servants was brought thither, he began with prayer, sick as he was, to drive away the peril which the stout strength of strong men with much labour could not before bring to pass. And behold, the wind that blew from the south, whereby this fire was spread abroad over the city, now suddenly being bent against the south, first drew off the blast of his fury from hurting the places right over in the other side, and straightway sinking utterly to rest stayed his blowing, while the flames in like manner were quieted and died out. And for as much as the man of God did fervently burn with the fire of divine charity, seeing he was wont with his often prayers and exhortations to drive from the hurt of himself and all his the storms of the powers of the air,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL246_239_2" id="target_note_LCL246_239_2"><sup>2</sup></a> he might now justly prevail against the winds and flames of the present world, and obtain that they injured not him nor his.</p>
<p>And this man then, after he had ruled the Church 5 years, passed away to the heavens in the reign of Eadbald, and was buried with his fathers in the oft-mentioned monastery and church of the most blessed chief of the apostles, in the 624th year of the Lord’s incarnation, on the 24th day of April.</p>
