<p>Now Chad died the second day of March and was buried first by Saint Mary’s church; but afterward, when the church of Peter, the most blessed chief of the apostles, was built in the same place, his bones were removed thither. In both which places, in token of his virtue, often miracles of healing are wont to be wrought. In short, of late a certain man that had a frenzy and ran up and down wandering everywhere, came thither at an evening, by the ignorance or negligence of them that kept the place and remained there all the night, and in the morning came out well in his wit, and declared to the wonder and joy of all men what soundness of mind by the gift of the Lord he got there. Now the same place of the sepulchre is covered with a wooden tomb made like a little house, having a hole in the wall, at which they that come thither for devotion’s sake are wont to put in their hand and take to them some of the dust therefrom: the which they put into water and then give it to taste to sick beasts or men, whereby the grief of their sickness is anon taken away, and they will return to their joyful desired health.</p>
<p>In the place of Chad, Theodore ordained Wynfrid, a virtuous and sober man, to rule and have the office of bishop, as his predecessors had before him, over the provinces of the Marchmen and Middle English and of the men of Lindsey: in all which countries Wulfhere (who yet lived) did hold the crown and sceptre. Moreover, Wynfrid was of the clergy of that bishop whom he had succeeded, and executed the office of deacon under him no small time.</p>
