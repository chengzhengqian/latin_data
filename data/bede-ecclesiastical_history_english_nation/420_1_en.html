toward the south side, as also we signified before; and above is this epitaph written concerning him:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">“Wilfrid the noble prelate rests his body in this grave,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Who moved with godly love to Christ, his Lord,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent4">this temple gave,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Which men by Peter’s hallowed name St. Peter’s</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent4">church shall call,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Whom Christ the keys of heaven gave, the Governor</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent4">of all;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">He decked it in his zeal with gold, and hung with</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent4">purple o’er,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">And likewise reared a shining cross, on high above</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent4">the floor;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Here was his trophy set, and here in golden letters</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent4">writ</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">He bade the four evangelists be shewn in order fit;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">And of red gold he had for them a worthy casing</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent4">made.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Of Easter’s solemn festival the course he also laid,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">According to the catholic rule, canonically right,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Fixed by the fathers once, and so he banished out</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent4">of sight</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Erroneous doubt by shewing clear the true way to</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent4">his race:</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">A goodly company of monks he gathered in this</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent4">place,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">And holding fast the fathers’ rule was zealous to</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent4">provide</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">By warning words: at home, abroad, he was by</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent4">perils tried,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Tossed beyond measure for long years, but after</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent4">he had spent</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Thrice fifteen years ordained to hold a bishop’s</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent4">government,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
