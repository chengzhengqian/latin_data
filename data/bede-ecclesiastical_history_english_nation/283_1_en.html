which man indeed, both when he was bishop and before he was bishop, is reported to have been most holy, as also even now the signs of mighty heavenly works do well declare. For until this day his horse-litter, wherein he was wont to be carried when he was sick, being kept by his scholars, ceaseth not to cure such as have agues or are wearied by any other infirmity. Moreover, not only sick parties that are put under or laid by the said litter be so healed, but also the chips that are cut off from it and brought to sick folk are wont to bring them speedy remedy.</p>
<p>This man had indeed, before he was made bishop, builded two goodly monasteries, one for himself, the other for his sister Ethelburga,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL248_45_1" id="target_note_LCL248_45_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and had established them both very well in regular discipline. That which was for himself was in the Country of Sudergeona,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL248_45_2" id="target_note_LCL248_45_2"><sup>2</sup></a> by the river of Thames at the place that is called Cerotaesei,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL248_45_3" id="target_note_LCL248_45_3"><sup>3</sup></a> that is to say, Isle of Cerot; while that for his sister was in the province of the East Saxons at the place that is named In Berecingum,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL248_45_4" id="target_note_LCL248_45_4"><sup>4</sup></a> where she should be able to be a mother and nurse of women devoted to God. And after she had taken upon her the rule of the monastery, she behaved herself in all things as became the sister of the bishop her brother, both for her own right way of life, and godly guiding of them that were under her charge in monastical rule; as also was well proved by miracles from heaven.</p>
