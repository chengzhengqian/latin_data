one corner of the uttermost island of the earth to be put above the universal Church of Christ dispersed throughout the world?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL246_477_1" id="target_note_LCL246_477_1"><sup>1</sup></a> And if he your father Columba (yea, and our father if he was Christ’s) was holy and mighty in works, can he by any means be chosen above the most blessed chief of the apostles, to whom our Lord said:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL246_477_2" id="target_note_LCL246_477_2"><sup>2</sup></a> “Thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it, and I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven”?</p>
<p>When Wilfrid thus concluded the king said: “Were these things, Colman, indeed spoken to that Peter of our Lord?” And the bishop said: “They were indeed, my lord king.” Whereat the king saith: “Can you bring forward any so special authority given your Columba?” Whereon the bishop said: “No.” Again the king said: “Whether do ye both agree in this without any question, that these words were principally spoken unto Peter, and that unto him the keys of the kingdom of heaven were given of the Lord?” They answered: “Yea, certainly.” Whereon the king thus concluded and said: “And I say unto you that I will not gainsay such a porter as this is; but as I know and have power, I covet in all points to obey his ordinances; lest it may be, when I come to the doors of the kingdom of heaven, I find none to open unto me, having his displeasure who is proved to hold the keys thereof.”</p>
<p>When the king so spake, all that sat or stood by, the greater along with them of mean degree, gave their consent thereto; and abandoning their former imperfect usage hastened to change over to those things which they had learned to be better.</p>
