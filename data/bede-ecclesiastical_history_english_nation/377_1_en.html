<p>Now Bertwald succeeded Theodore in the bishopric, who was abbot in a monastry called Raculf,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL248_233_1" id="target_note_LCL248_233_1"><sup>1</sup></a> which lieth hard by the north entry of the river Yenlade: a man who was too himself well travailed in the knowledge of the Scriptures and moreover fully instructed in ecclesiastical as well as monastical discipline, yet nothing to be compared to his predecessor: who was chosen indeed to be bishop in the 692nd year after the Lord’s incarnation, the first day of the month July, when Witred and Swebhard were kings<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL248_233_2" id="target_note_LCL248_233_2"><sup>2</sup></a> of Kent; but he was ordained the next year after upon a Sunday, being then the 29th of June, by Godwin,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL248_233_3" id="target_note_LCL248_233_3"><sup>3</sup></a> metropolitan bishop of France: and took his seat upon his throne the 31st day of August, being Sunday; who amongst many whom he ordained to be bishops, after Gebmund prelate of the church of Rochester was dead, also consecrated Tobias in his place, a man instructed in the Latin, Greek and Saxon tongues and of much learning beside in many ways.</p>
