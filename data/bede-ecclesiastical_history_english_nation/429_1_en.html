bread unto the Lord. Seven days ye must eat unleavened bread. In the first day ye shall have an holy convocation.’</p>
<p>“If therefore it were possible that the Sunday might always fall upon the 15th day of the first month, that is to say. upon the 15th day of the age of the moon, we might celebrate Easter always at one and the same time with the ancient people of God (albeit the inner meaning differeth in kind), as we do in one and the same faith. Because, however, the days of the week do not run equally with the course of the moon, the tradition of the apostles preached at Rome by blessed Peter, and confirmed by Mark the Evangelist his interpreter, at Alexandria, hath appointed that, when the first month is come, and the evening of the 14th day of the same, the Sunday also should be waited for from the 15th to the 21st day of the same month. For in whichsoever of those it shall be found, Easter shall be rightly kept in the same: because without doubt it appertaineth to the number of those 7 days in which the observance of unleavened bread is commanded to be kept. And so it cometh to pass that our Easter<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL248_337_1" id="target_note_LCL248_337_1"><sup>1</sup></a> never passeth the third week of the first month, nor over, nor under; but either it hath the whole week, that is to say, all the seven days of unleavened bread according to the Law, or at least some of them. For even if it compriseth but one of them, to wit that 7th day which the Scripture so highly commendeth;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL248_337_2" id="target_note_LCL248_337_2"><sup>2</sup></a> ‘In the 7th day shall be an holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work therein’; no man can reprove us, and say we keep not Easter Sunday (which we took of the Gospel) in the selfsame third week of the first month appointed by the Law, as we should do.</p>
