apostles Peter and Paul, and of the holy martyrs, Laurence, John and Paul and of Gregory and Pancras,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL246_501_1" id="target_note_LCL246_501_1"><sup>1</sup></a> all to be delivered truly to your excellency. For beside to your lady wife,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL246_501_2" id="target_note_LCL246_501_2"><sup>2</sup></a> our spiritual daughter, we have sent by the said bearers a cross having a golden key taken from the most holy chains of the blessed apostles Peter and Paul: of whose godly zeal we understanding and along with us the whole apostolic see as far rejoice as her godly works do smell sweet and blossom in the sight of God. We beseech therefore your highness, according to our wish, to hasten to dedicate all your island to God Christ. For assuredly you lack not herein a protector, our Lord Jesus Christ, the Redeemer of mankind, who will prosper you in all things, to the heaping up the number of the new people of Christ, and establishing there the catholic apostolic faith. For it is written<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL246_501_3" id="target_note_LCL246_501_3"><sup>3</sup></a>: ‘Seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you.’ For undoubtedly your highness seeketh and hath obtained, and all your islands (as we wish) shall be set under you. And so we salute your excellency with fatherly affection, beseeching continually the mercy of God that it vouchsafe to assist you and yours in all good works, that in the world to come ye may reign with Christ. May the grace from above have your excellency in its safe keeping!”</p>
<p>In the next book following we shall have better occasion to declare who it was that was found and dedicated bishop in place of Wighard.</p>
