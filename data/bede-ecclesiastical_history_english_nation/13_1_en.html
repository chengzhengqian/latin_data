<h4><span class="italic">How Claudius was the second of the Romans who came to the same land, which did also add the Orkney Isles unto the Roman empire. Moreover, how Vespasian sent by him did subdue the Isle of Wight under the Romans</span>. 43 <span class="sc">a.d.</span></h4>
<p>Now in the 798th year<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL246_27_1" id="target_note_LCL246_27_1"><sup>1</sup></a> from the building of Rome, Claudius, the fourth emperor after Augustus, being much desirous to show himself a prince profitable unto the commonwealth, sought war on all sides and victory whencesoever it might come. And so he made a voyage unto Britain, which was all in a mutiny, it seemed, for that such as were treacherously fled from them were not restored. He passed over into the island, whither, nor before Julius Caesar nor after, any durst adventure, and there without battle or bloodshed within very few days received by submission the greatest part of the island. Also he brought into subjection to the Roman empire the Orkney Isles<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL246_27_2" id="target_note_LCL246_27_2"><sup>2</sup></a> which lieth in the ocean above Britain, which done he returned to Rome the sixth month after that he departed thence, and caused his son to be surnamed Britannicus. And this war was brought to an end in the fourth year of his empire; which was the 46th year of the incarnation of our Lord: in the which year also there fell a great famine throughout all Syria, which in the Acts of the Apostles<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL246_27_3" id="target_note_LCL246_27_3"><sup>3</sup></a> is shewed to be fore-spoken by the mouth of Agabus the prophet.</p>
