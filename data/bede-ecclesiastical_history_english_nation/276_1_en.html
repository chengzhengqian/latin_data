<h4><span class="italic">How bishop Colman leaving Britain made two monasteries in the land of the Scots, one for the Scots, the other for the English whom he had brought with him</span> [667].</h4>
<p><span class="sc">In</span> the meantime Colman, who was a Scottish bishop, left Britain and took with him all the Scots that he had gathered together in the isle of Lindisfarne: moreover, about 30 Englishmen, and all of either race were brought up in the exercises of monastical life and conversation.
