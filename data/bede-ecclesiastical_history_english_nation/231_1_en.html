in the place which is called Inhrypum;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL246_463_1" id="target_note_LCL246_463_1"><sup>1</sup></a> which place indeed a little before he had given to those which followed the Scots, to have in possession for a monastery. But because afterwards, when choice was offered to them, they preferred to depart and yield up the place rather than to change their accustomed manner, it was given by the prince to him whose life and teaching he held to be worthy thereof. About that time Agilbert, bishop of the West Saxons, of whom we have made mention before,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL246_463_2" id="target_note_LCL246_463_2"><sup>2</sup></a> a friend of king Alchfrid and of Wilfrid the abbot, had come to the province of Northumberland and was staying with them for a space; who also at the request of Alchfrid made Wilfrid a priest in his monastery aforesaid. Now Agilbert had with him a priest named Agatho. The question therefore concerning Easter and the tonsure and other ecclesiastical matters being there raised, it was agreed on both sides that in the monastery called Strenaeshalc (which is by interpretation Lighthouse Bay,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL246_463_3" id="target_note_LCL246_463_3"><sup>3</sup></a> over which Hild, a woman vowed to God, was abbess), a synod<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL246_463_4a" id="target_note_LCL246_463_4a"><sup>4a</sup></a> should be kept for the deciding of this question. And thither came both the kings, namely, the father and the son; the bishops, Colman with his clergy of Scotland, and Agilbert with Agatho and Wilfrid, priests. On the part of these last were James and Romanus: Hild the abbess with her company were of the Scottish part, whereon also was the venerable bishop Cedd long since ordained of the Scots, as we have shewn before, who in that assembly came forward also as a most watchful interpreter on both sides.</p>
