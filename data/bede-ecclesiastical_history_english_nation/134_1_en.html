And verily that thou mayest have strength to fulfil this work by the help of the protection of His lovingkindness, we cease not to ask with continual prayer.</p>
<p>“In these words therefore sent in advance, shewing you the duty of our fatherly love, we exhort you that having found the opportunity of a bearer ye will as quickly as possible by favourable tidings give us comfort concerning those things which the power from above shall vouchsafe to work marvellously by you in the conversion of your husband and your subjects, that we (which carefully and longingly look for the happy news of the salvation of the soul of you and all yours) by this your tidings may be comforted, and acknowledging the brightness of the divine graciousness more richly spread abroad in your midst, we may with joyful confession give deservedly abundant thanks to God the giver of all good things and the blessed Peter, the chief of the apostles.</p>
<p>“Furthermore, we have sent you the blessing of your protector the blessed Peter, chief of the apostles, that is to say by a looking-glass of silver and a comb of ivory gilt with gold; and we pray your highness to accept this gift in that spirit of lovingkindness in the which, as ye understand, it hath been sent by us.”</p>
