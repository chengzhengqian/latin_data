<p>In the year 711 Bertfrith the reeve did battle with the Picts.</p>
<p>In the year 716 Osred, king of the Northumbrians, was slain, and Ceolred, king of the Marchmen, died; and the monks of Hy were brought of Egbert, the man of the Lord, to the catholic observance of Easter and right manner of ecclesiastical tonsure.</p>
<p>In the year 725 Witred, king of Kent, died.</p>
<p>In the year 729 comets appeared, the holy Egbert passed away, and Osric died.</p>
<p>In the year 731 archbishop Bertwald died. The same year was Tatwin consecrated ninth archbishop of the church of Canterbury, in the fifteenth year of the reign of Ethelbald king of the Marchmen.</p>
<p>This much concerning the Ecclesiastical History of Britain, and especially of the English nation (so far as I could learn either from the writings of the ancients, or by tradition of my elders, or by my own knowledge), has by the Lordâ€™s help been brought into order by me, Bede, the servant of Christ and priest of the monastery of the blessed apostles Peter and Paul, which is at Wearmouth and Jarrow.</p>
<p>Who being born in the territory of the same monastery, when I was 7 years of age, was delivered up by the hands of my kinsfolk to be brought up of the most reverend abbot Benedict, and afterward of Ceolfrid; and from that time spending all the days of my life in the mansion of the same monastery, I have applied all my diligence to the study of the Scriptures; and observing the regular discipline and keeping the daily service of singing in the church, I have taken delight always either to learn, or to teach, or to write.</p>
