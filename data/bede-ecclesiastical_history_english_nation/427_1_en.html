must be counted, as I have said, from the beginning of the third week, that is, from the 15th day of the first month to the 21st day of the same month fully complete. Further, the 14th day is noted down separately outside this number under the name of the Passover, as that which followeth in Exodus doth evidently declare<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL248_333_1" id="target_note_LCL248_333_1"><sup>1</sup></a>; where, after it was said: ‘For in this selfsame day will I bring your armies out of the land of Egypt’; it was added straightway: ‘And ye shall observe this day in your generations by an ordinance for ever. In the first month, on the 14th day of the month, ye shall eat unleavened bread until the 21st day of the month at even. Seven days shall there be no leaven found in your homes.’ For who cannot see, that from the 14th to the 21st be not only 7 days but rather 8, if the 14th be itself also reckoned in? But if we will count from the evening of the 14th day to the evening of the 21st (as the verity of Holy Scripture diligently searched out doth declare) we shall well perceive that the 14th day continueth its evening to the beginning of the Paschal feast in such manner that the whole sacred solemnity containeth only 7 nights with as many days; wherefore our decision is proved to be true, wherein we said that the time of Easter must be kept in the first month of the year and the third week of that month. For truly is it celebrated in the third week, because it beginneth from the evening of the 14th day, and is complete and ended in the evening of the 21st day.</p>
