<h3><span class="ac">Chapter VIII</span></h3>
<h4><span class="italic">How after the death of Theodore, Bertwald took the degree of archbishop upon him; and amongst many other ordained by him he made too Tobias, a man very well learned, bishop of the church of Rochester.</span></h4>
<p>Now the year after this in which Cadwalla died at Rome, that is to say in the 690th of the Lord’s incarnation, archbishop Theodore of blessed memory died, being an old man and full of days, to wit fourscore and eight years; the which number of years that he should live was long before signified unto him by revelation, as he was wont to make report to his friends. Now he continued in his bishopric 22 years, and was buried in St. Peter’s church, where the bodies of all the bishops of Canterbury were laid: of whom along with his fellows equal in degree it may rightly and truly be said, that “their bodies are buried in peace and their name shall live from generation to generation.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL248_231_1" id="target_note_LCL248_231_1"><sup>1</sup></a>” For that I may use few words, the English churches, for the time he was prelate, received so much increase in spiritual matters as they could never before. As touching his personage, his life, his age and death, the epitaph also written upon his sepulchre in four-and-thirty heroical verses<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL248_231_2" id="target_note_LCL248_231_2"><sup>2</sup></a> doth manifestly and clearly set them out to all that have access thither: of the which these are the first:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">“A holy prelate resteth here his body in the grave,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">To whom the name of Theodore the Greek tongue</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent4">newly gave.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p></blockquote>
