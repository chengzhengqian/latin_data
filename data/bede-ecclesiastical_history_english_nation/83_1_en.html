heavenly gift both thou joyest with fear and fearest with joy. Thou hast to joy, namely, for that by means of outward miracles the souls of the English are won to inward grace: but thou hast to fear, lest, in the midst of the miracles which be done, thy weak heart be lifted up in exaltation of thyself, falling as far inwardly by vainglory as thou art outwardly raised to honour. For we must remember that the disciples returning with joy from their preaching, when they said unto their heavenly Master:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL246_167_1" id="target_note_LCL246_167_1"><sup>1</sup></a> ‘Lord, even the devils are subject unto us through thy name;’ forthwith heard the words: ‘In this rejoice not, but rather rejoice, because your names are written in heaven.’ For they had fastened their mind upon a private and temporal joy, when they joyed of their miracles; but they are called back from private joy unto common, and from temporal to eternal, to whom it is said: ‘In this rejoice, because your names are written in heaven.’ For not all the chosen of God doth miracles; but yet all their names are recorded in heaven. For why? They which be the disciples of the truth ought to joy in nothing, but only in that good thing which they have in common with all, and whereof they have joy without end. This therefore remaineth, dear beloved brother, that of the things which by the power of God thou workest outwardly, thou exactly ever discuss with thyself inwardly, and accurately understand both thyself who thou art, and what plenty of grace there is in that same country for whose sake (to the intent it might be the rather converted) thou hast received the gift of working miracles. And if thou remember that thou hast at any time either by word or deed offended
