mind, if there shall follow no delight in sin, there is no sin at all committed: but when the flesh beginneth to take delight therein, then sin beginneth to spring: if, moreover, advisedly he doth also agree thereunto, then sin is found to be perfected.</p>
<p>“So then in suggestion is the beginning, in delight comes the feeding, in consent the finishing of sin. And it oft chanceth that the evil that the wicked spirit soweth in the thought, the flesh draweth unto delight, and yet the soul doth not agree to the same delight. And though the flesh can feel no delight without the mind, yet the mind himself striving against the pleasures of the flesh is in a measure against his will bound in the pleasure of the flesh, in such sort that with reason he doth gainsay it, lest he should agree unto it; and yet is bound with delight, but so that he much lamenteth his band. Whereupon that principal champion of the heavenly army, Saint Paul, bewaileth himself, saying,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL246_153_1" id="target_note_LCL246_153_1"><sup>1</sup></a> ‘I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.’ Now if he was in captivity, least of all did he fight; but yet too he did fight: wherefore he was both in captivity and therefore strove with the law of his mind, against the which the law, which is in our members, did fight. But if he fought, he was not in captivity. Lo! then man, that I may so speak, is in captivity and free; free through righteousness which he loveth, in captivity through delight which he beareth against his will.”</p>
