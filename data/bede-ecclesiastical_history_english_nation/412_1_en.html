to Kent to king Erconbert, which was her uncle’s<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL248_303_1" id="target_note_LCL248_303_1"><sup>1</sup></a> son, requiring him to send him honourably to Rome. And at this time Honorius, one of the blessed pope Gregory’s disciples, a man profoundly learned in ecclesiastical matters, held the degree of archbishop there. And whenas the young man, lacking not in lively spirit, was tarrying there a space, and employed his diligence to learn that which he overlooked, there repaired thither, as it fell, another young man whose name was Biscop, surnamed Benedict, an English noble, desirous too himself to go to Rome: of whom we have made mention before.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL248_303_2" id="target_note_LCL248_303_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>The king joined Wilfrid to Benedict’s company, with charge that he should bring him with him safe to Rome.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL248_303_3" id="target_note_LCL248_303_3"><sup>3</sup></a> And when they were come to Lyons, Wilfrid was stayed there of Dalfinus, bishop of the city,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL248_303_4" id="target_note_LCL248_303_4"><sup>4</sup></a> while Benedict hastened on to accomplish the journey he had begun to Rome. For the bishop was delighted with the young man’s wise talk, the fair comeliness of his countenance, his readiness in action, and the steadiness and ripe compass of his thought; for which cause also he gave him and his company all things that were needful plentifully, as long as they continued there; and further offered, if he would, to entrust him with the government of a large part of France, and give him to wife a maid that was his brother’s daughter, and look upon him always as his adopted son. But Wilfrid thanking him for the goodness that the bishop vouchsafed to shew unto him, being but a stranger, answered that he was fully determined upon another course of life, and therefore had forsaken his country and taken the journey to Rome.</p>
