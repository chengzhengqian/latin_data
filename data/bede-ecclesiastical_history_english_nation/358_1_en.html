it was his chance through the grace of Godâ€™s goodness to be healed suddenly by the relics of the most holy father Cuthbert. For when his brethren found his body not corrupted after it had lain many years buried, they took a part of the hair, which in manner of relics they might give to friends that asked of them, or shew for a sign of the miracle.</p>
<p>A little part of these relics were at that time in the keeping of one of the priests of the same monastery, Thrwidred by name, who now is abbot of that same house. Which man on a certain day went to the church, and after he had opened the shrine of the relics to give a part thereof to a friend who asked for it, it chanced the young man whose eye was afflicted was then present in the church. And when the priest had given his friend such part thereof as he would, he gave the rest to the young man to lay up again in his place. Whereupon he by a good motion that came to his mind, as soon as he had received the hairs of the holy head, put them to his sore eyelid, and held them there a space, endeavouring to keep down and assuage that noisome swelling. And that done he laid the relics up again in the shrine, as he had been bidden, believing that his eye should shortly be healed by the hair of the man of God, wherewith he had been touched. And his faith deceived him not. For it was at that time, as he was wont to tell, about the second hour of the day. But as he thought upon his business and went about other things, as that day required, towards the sixth hour of that very day he happened suddenly to touch his eye, the which he found, with the eyelid and all, as whole as if there had never been seen any blemish and swelling therein.</p>
