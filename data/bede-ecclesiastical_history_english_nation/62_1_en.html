<p><span class="italic">Gregory answereth</span>. “It is permitted by a secular law of the Roman commonwealth<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL246_125_1" id="target_note_LCL246_125_1"><sup>1</sup></a> that the son and daughter of a brother and sister<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL246_125_2" id="target_note_LCL246_125_2"><sup>2</sup></a> or of two brothers german or two sisters may be joined together. But experience sheweth that of such wedlock there can grow up no children: and the holy law forbiddeth that we should reveal the nakedness<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL246_125_3" id="target_note_LCL246_125_3"><sup>3</sup></a> of our kindred.
