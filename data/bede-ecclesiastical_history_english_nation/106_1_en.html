divided into 7 companies, with each company his several assigned ruler, none of these companies had less than 300 persons, who did all ever live by the labour of their own hands. A great number therefore of them, after three days’ fasting, had come with others to the aforesaid army to pray for the soldiers, having by them a defender named Brocmail who should keep them from the swords of the barbarians while they thus earnestly bent to their prayers. And when king Ethelfrith had understood the cause of their coming thither, he said: “Then if these men cry and call upon their God against us, truly though they themselves have no armour, yet they fight against us, who pursue us with curses to bring evil upon us.” Accordingly he commanded his soldiers to assault these men first, and so he vanquished after the other parts of this detestable host, but yet not without a great loss of his own men. It is reported that there were slain in that battle, of them which had come to pray, about 1200 men, and that only 50 escaped by flight. Brocmail at the first coming of the enemy turned his back with his men, and whom he ought to have defended, these he left without defence and naked to the strokes of the sword. And so in this manner was fulfilled the prophecy of the holy bishop Augustine (though he himself long before had been raised to the heavenly realms), so that these heretical men learnt by the vengeance also of temporal death, that they had despised the counsels of eternal salvation offered to them.</p>
