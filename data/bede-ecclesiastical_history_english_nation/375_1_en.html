<p class="noindent">“Here was buried Cadwal, also named Peter, king of the Saxons, on the 20th of April, in the second indiction; who lived 30 years or thereabouts, when our lord Justinian the most religious Augustus was emperor, in the 4th year of his consulship, in the second year that the apostolic lord Sergius was pope.”</p>
<p>Now as Cadwalla was taking his journey to Rome, Ini, one of the king’s blood, succeeded unto the crown; who after he had reigned 37 years over that nation, himself likewise gave over his kingdom and committed the governance of it to younger men, and set out to the churches of the blessed apostles, at the time that Gregory was pope, having a desire to wander like a pilgrim upon earth for a while in the neighbourhood of the holy places, that he might deserve to be received more willingly of the saints in heaven: the which practice in these days many Englishmen, both of the nobility and commons, spiritual and temporal, men and women, were wont to use with much emulation.</p>
