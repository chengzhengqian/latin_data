<h4><span class="italic">An Hymn concerning her.</span></h4>
<p><span class="sc">It</span> seemeth convenient to put also in this History an hymn of virginity, which many years past we made in the elegiac metre<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL248_113_1" id="target_note_LCL248_113_1"><sup>1</sup></a> in praise and laudation of the same queen and spouse of Christ, and therefore verily a queen, for that she is the spouse of Christ; and herein to follow the custom of Holy Scripture, in the history whereof many songs are put in among, which were, as is well known, made in metre and verse.</p>
