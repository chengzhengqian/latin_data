this in the sea, whatever is in here. It really is heavy; I
believe there’s gold in here. And nobody knows what I’ve
done. Now, Gripus, you’ve got this chance for the praetor<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL260_499_30" id="target_note_LCL260_499_30"><sup>30</sup></a>
to free you. Now I’ll act like this, my plan goes like

set up a big city. This city I shall call Gripus, as a memorial<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">935</span><span class="br"></span>
to my fame and deeds. There I shall set up a great
kingdom. I’m arranging to organize
great things here in
my mind. Now I’ll put away this trunk. But this king’s

tasty relish.</p></div><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL260_499_30"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL260_499_30" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">30</sup>Roman magistrate with chiefly judicial functions. Manumissions
