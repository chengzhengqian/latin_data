there, and that there was enormous profit
for prostitutes
there. He convinced him. A ship was hired in secret and
the pimp brought all his property from home onto the
ship. To the young man who had bought the girl from
him he said he wanted to fulfill a vow to Venus—this here<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">60</span><span class="br"></span>
is the temple of Venus (<span class="italic">points to it</span>)—and for this reason
he invited the young man here to lunch. He himself
embarked on the ship at once and sailed off with the
prostitutes. Others told the young man of the event, that<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">65</span><span class="br"></span>
the pimp had left. The young man came to the harbor.
Their ship had gone far out on the sea. When I saw that
the girl was being carried off, I brought help to her and
at the same time destruction to the pimp. I raised a
blustering storm and moved the waves of the sea. For I,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">70</span><span class="br"></span>
Arcturus, am the fiercest constellation of all. I am violent
when I rise, and when I set I am even more violent. Now
both of them, the pimp and his guest, are sitting on the
cliff together, cast out; their ship has been wrecked. But
that girl and also a second one, her maid, were frightened<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">75</span><span class="br"></span>
and jumped down from the ship onto the ship’s
boat. Now the waves are carrying them away from the
cliff onto the land, to the farmhouse where that old man
lives in exile. The wind has blown off his roof and tiles.
And that chap who is coming out is his slave. Soon you’ll<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">80</span><span class="br"></span>
see the young man arrive here, the one who bought that
girl from the pimp. Fare well, so that your enemies may
lose heart.</p></div>
