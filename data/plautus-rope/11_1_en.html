sitting in a boat alone. How the
poor wretches are being knocked about! Hurray, hurray,
excellent! The wave has turned the boat away from the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">165</span><span class="br"></span>
cliff toward the beach; a steersman could never have
done it equally well. I don’t
think I’ve ever seen higher
waves! They’re safe if they keep clear of them. Now, now
there’s a risk. (<span class="italic">Palaestra falls overboard</span>) The wave has
thrown one of them out! But she’s in shallow water, she’ll<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">170</span><span class="br"></span>
easily swim to land now. Hurray! [Can you see how the
wave has thrown one of them overboard?] She’s stood
up, she’s coming here. (<span class="italic">as Ampelisca leaves the boat</span>) All’s
well! This second one has jumped from the boat onto
land. How she’s fallen onto her knees in the waves out
of fear! She’s safe, she’s left the water. Now she’s on the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">175</span><span class="br"></span>
shore. But she’s turned to the right and is going to the
devil! Ha! She’ll go astray today.</p></div>
