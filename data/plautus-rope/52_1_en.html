<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">tra</span><p class="lineGroup">Listen. I saw someone who was committing a theft. I
knew the owner to whom this was being done. Then I
come to the thief myself and bring him my terms in this
way: “I know who this was stolen from. Now if you’re
willing to give me half, I won’t inform the owner.” He
still hasn’t
given me any reply. What is a fair part I should<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">960</span><span class="br"></span>
be given from it? I want you to say half.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">gri</span><p class="lineGroup">No, even more: if he doesn’t
give it to you, I think the
owner has to be told.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">tra</span><p class="lineGroup">I’ll follow your advice. Now pay attention, because all
this has to do with you.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">gri</span><p class="lineGroup">What’s happened?</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">tra</span><p class="lineGroup">I’ve known the man whose trunk this is for a long time
now.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">gri</span><p class="lineGroup">What’s that?</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">tra</span><p class="lineGroup">And how it got lost.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">gri</span><p class="lineGroup">But I know how it was found and I’m familiar with the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">965</span><span class="br"></span>
man who found it and I know who the owner is now. And
this is no more any of your business than what you say is
any of mine. I know the man who it belongs to now, you
the one who it belonged to before. No one will take this
away from me, so don’t
expect that you can.</p></div><notes></notes></section>
