unless you bring us some protection in action, Trachalio,
we’re done for.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">amp</span><p class="lineGroup">I’m resolved to die rather than let this pimp treat me
cruelly. But still, I have a woman’s mind; poor me, when<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">685</span><span class="br"></span>
death comes
to my mind, fear grips my limbs. Goodness,
this day is bitter!</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">tra</span><p class="lineGroup">Take courage, you two.</p></div>

<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">tra</span><p class="lineGroup">Stop being afraid, I tell you. Sit down here by the altar.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">amp</span><p class="lineGroup">How can that altar be of more use to us than the statue
of Venus here inside the temple, which we were clinging<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">690</span><span class="br"></span>
on to just now and which we were dragged away from by
force, poor us?</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">tra</span><p class="lineGroup">Just sit here, you two, I’ll still protect you from here.
Have this altar as your camp, and this as your ramparts;
from here I’ll defend you. Under Venus’ protection I’ll
defy the pimp’s wickedness.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">pal</span><p class="lineGroup">We’ll obey you and, kind Venus, we both entreat
you, clinging to this altar of yours in tears and kneeling,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">695</span><span class="br"></span>
that you may receive us into your protection and guard
us. Do take revenge on those criminals who have slighted
your temple and do allow us to sit by your altar by your
leave. We were both cleaned out by Neptune’s doing in
the night, so don’t
take offense and don’t
find fault with<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">700</span><span class="br"></span>
us if there’s anything there that you consider unclean.</p></div><notes></notes></section>
