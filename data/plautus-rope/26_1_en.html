so much joy in water. How happy I was to draw it up! The<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">460</span><span class="br"></span>
well seemed a lot less deep than before. How I drew it
up without effort! Touch wood!<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL260_451_11" id="target_note_LCL260_451_11"><sup>11</sup></a> Aren’t I naughty, since
I’ve fallen in love today? (<span class="italic">holding out the pot</span>) Here’s the
water for you, my pretty one. There, I want you to carry
it gracefully, the way I am carrying it, so that you will
please me. But where are you, playful girl? Take this<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">465</span><span class="br"></span>
water, will you? Where are you? (<span class="italic">to the audience</span>) She
really loves me, I think. She’s playing hide and seek, the
rogue. (<span class="italic">calling out</span>) Where are you? Aren’t you going to
take this pot? Where are you? Better not go too far. Really,
though, aren’t you going to take this pot? Where on
earth are you? (<span class="italic">to the audience</span>) I can’t see her anywhere.<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">470</span><span class="br"></span>
She’s making a fool of me. I’ll place this pot in the middle
of the road now. But what if someone takes it away, the
sacred pot of Venus? He’d create trouble for me. I’m
afraid that that woman could be setting a trap for me so<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">475</span><span class="br"></span>
that I’m caught with the sacred pot of Venus. No doubt
the magistrate would be perfectly entitled
to chain me
up and kill me, if anyone sees me in possession of it: it’s
lettered, it tells its own tale. Now I’ll call this priestess
out so that she can take this pot. I’ll go to the door here.<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">480</span><span class="br"></span>
(<span class="italic">knocking on the door of the temple, loudly</span>) Hey there,
come out, Ptolemocratia, take this pot. Some woman
brought it here to my place. (<span class="italic">to himself</span>) I have to carry
it in. A nice job I’ve found, if I even have to bring them
water of my own accord.</p><span class="stage"><span class="italic">Exit <span class="sc">sceparnio</span> into the temple.</span></span></div><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL260_451_11"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL260_451_11" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">11</sup><span class="italic">Praefiscini</span> is a formula used to avert bad luck that could arise
