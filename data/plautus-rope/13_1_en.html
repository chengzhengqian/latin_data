know the place and I<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">210</span><span class="br"></span>
haven’t
been here before. At least I’d like someone to
show me a way or a path out of this area: I’m uncertain
in my mind whether I should go this way or that. Nor can
I see cultivated land anywhere close by. The feelings of<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">215</span><span class="br"></span>
being cold, being lost, and being afraid all hold me in
their grip. My poor parents, you don’t
know that I’m as
wretched now as I am. Beyond all question I was born
free, but in vain. How am I less of a slave now than if I’d
been born a slave? Nor have I ever been of any use to
those who raised me.</p><span class="stage"><span class="italic">Enter <span class="sc">ampelisca</span> from the left, also wet and in rags; she does

life away from my body? That’s how unhappily I’m living
and that’s how many paralyzing worries are in my breast.
The situation is like this: I don’t
care for my life, I’ve lost
the hope that I delighted in. I’ve already run around every
nook and cranny and I’ve crawled through every
hiding place to look for my fellow slave, in order to find
her with my voice, eyes, and ears. I can’t find her anywhere<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">225</span><span class="br"></span>
and I have no idea where to go or in which way
to look for her; meanwhile I can’t find anyone to reply
whom I could ask, and desert lands aren’t more deserted
than this area and these regions. If she’s alive, I’ll never,
as long as I live, give up without finding
her.</p></div><notes></notes></section>
