allow those who are sleeping to rest. For instance, I
dreamed a strange and uncanny dream last night. I
dreamed that a monkey was trying to climb up to a swallows’
nest: as in all its ***, and it couldn’t
drag them away<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">600</span><span class="br"></span>
from there. Then the monkey seems to approach me
and ask me to lend it a ladder. I answer the monkey like
this<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL260_463_20" id="target_note_LCL260_463_20"><sup>20</sup></a> *** that swallows were born from Philomela and
Procne.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL260_463_21" id="target_note_LCL260_463_21"><sup>21</sup></a> I plead with it not to harm my compatriots,
and <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">605</span><span class="br"></span>
now it becomes
a lot more insolent. It seems to take the
offensive and threaten me with a beating. It summons
me to court. There somehow I seem to grab the monkey
around the middle in my anger. I put that vilest of animals<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">610</span><span class="br"></span>
in chains. Now today I haven’t
been able to arrive
at an interpretation of what I should say this dream pertains
to. But what noise arises here in the temple of
Venus in my neighborhood? It’s very surprising.</p></div><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL260_463_20"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL260_463_20" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">20</sup>In the missing line he presumably said that he is an Athenian
