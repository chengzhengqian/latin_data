<p>[4] Ah, Dolabella, how vastly greater is your misery
than that of him whom you wished to be most miserable!
“Trebonius suffered terribly.” Many endure worse sufferings
from severe illness; and yet we do not customarily call
them miserable, but sorely tried. “His pain was long drawn
out.” For two days; but for some, such pain often lasts for
many years. The tortures inflicted by executioners are no
worse than are sometimes the torments of disease. There<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">9</span><span class="br"></span>
are other miseries, others, I repeat, you ruthless criminals,
you madmen, far worse than these. In proportion as the
mind’s power is greater than the body’s, so mental pain is
worse than physical pain. Therefore, he who takes a crime
upon his conscience is more miserable than he who is
forced to undergo the misdeed of another. Trebonius was
tortured by Dolabella; and so was Regulus by the Carthaginians.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL507_143_3a" id="target_note_LCL507_143_3a"><sup>3</sup></a>
Therefore, since the Punic men are held to have
treated an enemy with great cruelty, what is to be thought
of the way Dolabella treated a fellow countryman? Is there
indeed any comparison, or is there any doubt which of the
two is the more miserable, the man whose death the senate
and people of Rome are eager to avenge, or the man who
has been declared a public enemy by a unanimous vote of
the senate? As for the rest of their lives, who could compare
Trebonius’ life to Dolabella’s without grossly insulting
Trebonius? Who does not know his wisdom, intellect, humanity,
integrity, and the greatness of spirit he showed in

peace treaty or an exchange of prisoners during the First Punic
War. In case the Romans rejected these offers, Regulus was to return
to Carthage, to which he committed himself by oath. In
Rome he argued against the Carthaginian proposals in the senate, which resulted in a negative decree. Thereupon Regulus, true to
his oath, returned to Carthage and was savagely tortured to death.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL507_143_3a').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
