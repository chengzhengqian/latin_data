hear that a province has been assigned to him before he
could suspect that any time has been given to this issue. I
fear that our armies too, who have come to the aid of the
Republic in voluntary enthusiasm, not under the compulsion
of a levy, may lose something of their ardor if they
think we have anything under consideration except the
present war. But if you consuls think it right to seek provinces,
as they have often been sought by many illustrious
men, first give us back Brutus, the pride and glory of the
community, who must be treasured like the image that fell
from the sky and is kept by the guardians of Vesta; if this is
safe, we will be safe.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL507_163_32" id="target_note_LCL507_163_32"><sup>32</sup></a> Then we shall even carry you to
heaven on our shoulders if we can; at least, we shall choose
for you provinces entirely worthy of yourselves. But now,
let us attend to the business in hand; and that business is
whether we are to live free or die, which latter is certainly
preferable to slavery.</p>
<p>Moreover, does not this proposal actually hold up the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">25</span><span class="br"></span>
pursuit of Dolabella? When will the consul arrive? Are we
waiting until the communities and cities of Asia are wiped
out completely? But perhaps the consuls will send one of
their staff.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL507_163_33a" id="target_note_LCL507_163_33a"><sup>33</sup></a> Am I expected to approve of that, when just
now I opposed an extraordinary command for a most illustrious
person who is a private citizen! But they will
send a worthy man. Worthier than Publius Servilius? But
our community contains nobody of that description. I was
against the command being given to anybody even by the
senate: am I to approve of an appointment made by a
single individual?</p>

to Rome, where it was kept in the innermost room of the Temple
