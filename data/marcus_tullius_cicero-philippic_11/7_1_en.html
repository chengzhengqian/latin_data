dispensation, this second Caesar Vopiscus, this marvel of
intellect and influence, who stands for the consulship on
the basis of an aedileship—even though, I believe, the laws
do not apply to so extraordinarily eminent a personage!
But I defended him five times and each time he was acquitted:
even a gladiator finds it hard to win a sixth palm
in the city. However, this is the jury’s fault, not mine. I defended
him in all good faith; they ought to have kept so
illustrious and outstanding a senator in the community.
However, he now seems to be solely out to prove to us that
the jurors whose verdict we have annulled judged properly
and to the public benefit.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL507_147_8" id="target_note_LCL507_147_8"><sup>8</sup></a> And this is no isolated case:<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">12</span><span class="br"></span>
there are others in the same camp honorably convicted
and disgracefully rehabilitated.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL507_147_9" id="target_note_LCL507_147_9"><sup>9</sup></a> Do you suppose these enemies
of all decent men have any but the cruelest intentions?
To these add one Saxa, whom Caesar brought from
the farthest parts of Celtiberia and gave us for a tribune of
the plebs, formerly a marker-out of military camps, now, as
he hopes, of the city. He is a stranger to Rome, so may the
omen be on his own head, and we unharmed.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL507_147_10" id="target_note_LCL507_147_10"><sup>10</sup></a> Associated
with him is the veteran Cafo, than whom no man is more
cordially hated by the veterans. On this pair, over and
above the dowry, as it were, that they had received in the
civil troubles, Antonius bestowed Campanian land,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL507_147_11" id="target_note_LCL507_147_11"><sup>11</sup></a> so
that they might have wet nurses for the rest of their estates.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL507_147_12" id="target_note_LCL507_147_12"><sup>12</sup></a>
If only they had been content with them! We would
have put up with that, even though it was intolerable;
but anything was worth bearing for the sake of avoiding
