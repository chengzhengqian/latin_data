<p>[11] Who
is that man? Either Marcus Brutus or Gaius Cassius or
both. In fact I should propose, as in many things, “the consuls,
one or both,” if we had not tied Brutus down in
Greece and preferred that the aid he offers be turned towards
Italy rather than Asia, not for us to have a place of
refuge from the battle line but so that the battle line itself
should have some support from overseas. Furthermore,
Members of the Senate, Marcus Brutus is still detained by
Gaius Antonius, who holds the large and important city
of Apollonia; he holds as well, I imagine, Byllis, holds
Amantia, threatens Epirus, presses upon Oricum,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL507_165_34" id="target_note_LCL507_165_34"><sup>34</sup></a> has
some cohorts and has cavalry. If Brutus is drawn away from
this theater of action to another war, we shall certainly
have lost Greece. We also have to look after Brundisium
and the adjacent coast of Italy. Yet I am surprised that
Antonius is hanging about for so long: he usually puts on
long gloves himself and does not endure the fear of siege
for very long.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL507_165_35a" id="target_note_LCL507_165_35a"><sup>35</sup></a> However, if Brutus finishes his business
and reaches the conclusion that he will better serve the Republic
if he pursues Dolabella instead of remaining in
Greece, he will act on his own initiative, as he has done
hitherto, and not wait for the senate when there are so
many trouble spots calling for immediate attention. For<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">27</span><span class="br"></span>
