the consulship of Publius Licinius and Lucius Valerius
there was a war to wage with Aristonicus.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL507_155_24" id="target_note_LCL507_155_24"><sup>24</sup></a> The people
were asked whom they wished to conduct it. The consul
Crassus, who was pontifex maximus, threatened a fine
against his colleague Flaccus, who was the priest of Mars,
if he should abandon his religious duties: the people remitted
the fine, but ordered the priest to obey the pontifex.
But not even on that occasion did the Roman people entrust
