distinction and integrity, who is, however, a private
citizen, thereby putting us in a very awkward position.
Suppose I support the motion: I shall be bringing electioneering
into the senate-house; suppose I say no: it will look
as though I have refused an honor to a close friend by my
vote, as in an election. Well, if elections are to be held in
