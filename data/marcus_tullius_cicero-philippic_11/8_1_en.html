to yourselves the other luminaries of Marcus Antonius’
camp? First, those two colleagues of the Antonii and
Dolabella, Nucula and Lento, the parcelers-out of Italy
under a law which the senate has declared to have been
passed by violence.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL507_149_13" id="target_note_LCL507_149_13"><sup>13</sup></a> One of them has composed mimes,
the other acted in a tragedy. What am I to say of Domitius
the Apulian?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL507_149_14" id="target_note_LCL507_149_14"><sup>14</sup></a> I noticed that his goods were put on the
auction block the other day. His business agents must be
very careless. Recently he gave his sister’s son poison, or
rather poured it down his throat. After all, they cannot
help living extravagantly, hoping as they do for our property
while they squander their own. I also saw Publius
Decius’ auction, that illustrious gentleman who, following
in the footsteps of his ancestors,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL507_149_15a" id="target_note_LCL507_149_15a"><sup>15</sup></a> has offered himself up
for debt. No buyer, however, was found at that auction. A
ridiculous fellow, who thinks he can get himself out of debt
by selling other people’s belongings! What am I to say of<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">14</span><span class="br"></span>
Trebellius? The Furies of debtors seem to have exacted
their vengeance; for we have seen the new tablet listing the
property of this defender against new tablets.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL507_149_16" id="target_note_LCL507_149_16"><sup>16</sup></a> What of Titus
Plancus? Aquila, a distinguished citizen, drove him out
of Pollentia, and with a broken leg; if only that had happened
to him sooner, to prevent him from coming back
