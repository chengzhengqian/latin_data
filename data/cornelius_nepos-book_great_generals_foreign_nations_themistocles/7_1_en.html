<p>As soon as he thought that the deputation had reached Athens, he appeared before the magistrates<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL467_35_1" id="target_note_LCL467_35_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and the senate of the Lacedaemonians and confessed to them with the utmost frankness that the Athenians, by his advice, and taking advantage of the rights granted by the common law of nations, had encircled with walls the gods of all Greece, of their native city and of their homes, in order the more easily to defend them against the enemy; and that in so doing they had acted for the best interests of Greece. For their city, he said, was like an outpost in the path of the barbarians, and upon it the king’s fleets had already twice suffered shipwreck. But the Lacedaemonians were acting wrongfully and unjustly in having in view rather what contributed to their own supremacy than to the welfare of Greece as a whole. Therefore, if they wished to recover their envoys which they had sent to Athens, they must let him go; otherwise they would never get them back again in their native land.</p>

In spite of all, Themistocles could not escape the distrust of his fellow-citizens; but because of the same feeling of apprehension that had led to the condemnation of Miltiades he was banished from the city by the shard-vote<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL467_35_2a" id="target_note_LCL467_35_2a"><sup>2</sup></a> and went to live in Argos.

The Prytanies and the popular assembly (ἐκκλησία) must first determine whether such a step was necessary. If they decided in the affirmative, each citizen wrote on a potsherd (ὄστρακον, whence the term “ostracism”) the name of the man whom he wished to banish. The one who had the greatest number of votes recorded against him, provided the total number of voters was 6000, was obliged to leave the city within ten days for an exile of ten, later of five, years, but without loss of rank or property. If the number of votes did not amount to 6000, no action was taken.
