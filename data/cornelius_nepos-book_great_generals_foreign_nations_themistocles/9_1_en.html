would save his life. The sailor, filled with pity for so distinguished a man, for a day and a night kept his ship at anchor out at sea far off from the island, and would not allow anyone to leave her. Then he went on to Ephesus and there landed Themistocles, who afterwards requited him for his services</p>
<p><span class="bold">9</span>. I am aware that many have written that Themistocles passed over into Asia during the reign of Xerxes, but I prefer to believe Thucydides, because among the writers who have left a history of those times he was most nearly contemporary with Themistocles, besides being a native of the same city. Now he says<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL467_39_1" id="target_note_LCL467_39_1"><sup>1</sup></a> that it was to Artaxerxes<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL467_39_2" id="target_note_LCL467_39_2"><sup>2</sup></a> that Themistocles came, and that he sent a letter to the king in the following words: “I, Themistocles, have come to you, the man of all the Greeks who brought the most ills upon your house, so long as it was necessary for me to war against your father and defend my native land. But I also did him many more favours, so soon as I began to find myself in safety and he was in danger. For when he wished to return to Asia after having fought the battle at Salamis, I informed him by letter of the enemy’s plot to destroy the bridge which he had made over the Hellespont and to cut off his retreat; and it was that message which saved him from danger. But now I have sought refuge with you, hounded as I am by all Greece, seeking your friendship;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL467_39_3" id="target_note_LCL467_39_3"><sup>3</sup></a> if I obtain it, you will have in me as good a friend as I was a courageous foeman of Xerxes. But with regard to the matters about which I wish to confer with you, I ask you to allow me a year’s delay and let me come to you at the end of that time.”</p>
