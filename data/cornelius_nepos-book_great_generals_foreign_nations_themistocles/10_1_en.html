<p><span class="bold">10.</span> The king, admiring his high spirit, and eager to win the friendship of such a man, granted his request. Themistocles devoted all that time to the literature and language of the Persians, in which he became so well versed that he is said to have spoken in much better style before the king than those could who were natives of Persia.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL467_41_1" id="target_note_LCL467_41_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Themistocles made many promises to the king, of which the most welcome was, that if Artaxerxes would consent to follow his advice, the king’s arms would subjugate Greece. Then, after receiving many presents from the monarch, he returned to Asia<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL467_41_2" id="target_note_LCL467_41_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and took up his residence at Magnesia; for the king had given him that city, with the remark that it would furnish him with bread (the annual revenue of the district was five hundred talents), also Lampsacus, to supply him with wine, and Myus, to furnish the rest of his fare.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL467_41_3" id="target_note_LCL467_41_3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>Two memorials of this man have endured to our own day: his tomb near the town in which he was buried,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL467_41_4" id="target_note_LCL467_41_4"><sup>4</sup></a> and his statue in the Forum at Magnesia. Of his death many different accounts are given by numerous writers, but once more I prefer to accept the testimony of Thucydides. That historian says that Themistocles died a natural death at Magnesia, admitting, however, that there was a report that he had poisoned himself, because he despaired of being able to keep his promises to the king with regard to the subjugation of Greece. Thucydides has also stated that Themistocles’ bones were buried in Attica by his friends secretly, since his interment there was contrary to law, because he had been found guilty of treason.</p>
