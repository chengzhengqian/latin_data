mules, dogs, and herdsmen.” “It will take only a short time to discuss them,” said Murrius; “for mules and hinnies are hybrids and grafts, not from roots after their own kind; for the mule is the offspring of a mare and an ass, while the hinny is the offspring of a horse and a jenny; each is useful for work, but neither brings any return from young. When an ass colt is newly born it is placed under a mare and becomes fatter on her milk, as they claim that such nourishment is more nutritious than the ass’s milk. They are reared, in addition, on straw, hay, or barley. Special care is also taken of the foster-mother, so that the mare may furnish the colt with an abundant supply of milk. A jack so reared may be used for breeding after three years, and because it is accustomed to horses it will not refuse to mate.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_393_1" id="target_note_LCL283_393_1"><sup>1</sup></a> If you use him at an earlier age, he himself tires sooner, and his offspring will be of poorer quality. Those who do not have such a jack, reared on mare’s milk, but want a breeding jack, pick one as heavy and handsome as they can find and of good breed—of the Arcadian breed, our ancestors used to say, but of Reatine breed, as we have found by experience; in that district several breeding asses have sold for three hundred and even four hundred thousand sesterces. In purchasing we observe the same rules as in the case of horses, and make the same stipulations in the matter of purchase and acceptance as were named in the case of horses.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_393_2" id="target_note_LCL283_393_2"><sup>2</sup></a> We feed these chiefly on hay and barley and increase the amount before breeding, so that we may furnish strength from the food for begetting; and we mate them at the same season in which we mate horses, and we are careful also to have them cover the mares with the help of a groom.
