<p>III. Cossinius, addressing him, said: “As you have bleated long enough, my dear Faustulus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_345_1" id="target_note_LCL283_345_1"><sup>1</sup></a> now hear from me, as from Homer’s Melanthius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_345_2" id="target_note_LCL283_345_2"><sup>2</sup></a> born out of due season, with regard to goats; and learn how one ought to speak, briefly and to the point.
