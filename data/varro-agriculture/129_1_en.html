for shearing is the period from the spring equinox to the solstice, after the sheep have begun to sweat; it is because of this sweat (<span class="italic">sudor</span>) that freshly-shorn
wool is called ‘juicy’ (<span class="italic">sucida</span>). Freshly clipped sheep are rubbed down on the same day with wine and oil, to which some add a mixture of white chalk and hog lard; and if they have been accustomed to wear a jacket,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_417_1" id="target_note_LCL283_417_1"><sup>1</sup></a> the skin with which they were covered is greased on the inside with the same mixture and placed on them again. If a sheep has been cut during the shearing, the wound is smeared with soft pitch. Sheep with coarse fleece are shorn about the time of the barley harvest, or at other places before the cutting of the hay. Some shear their sheep twice a year, as is done in Hither Spain, shearing every six months. They undergo the double work on the supposition that more wool is secured by this method—which is the same motive that leads some to mow their meadows twice a year. The more careful farmers spread out cloths and shear the sheep over them to prevent loss of the wool. Calm days are chosen for this work, and on these the shearing is done from about the fourth to the tenth hour. The fleece from a sheep that is clipped when the sun is rather warm is rendered softer by the sweat, as well as heavier and of better colour. When the fleece has been removed and rolled up it is called by some <span class="italic">vellus,</span> by others <span class="italic">vellimnum;</span> and it may be seen from these words that in the case of wool, plucking was discovered earlier than shearing.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_417_2" id="target_note_LCL283_417_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Some people pluck the wool even to-day; and these keep the sheep without food for three days before, as the roots of the wool hold less tightly when the sheep are weak.”</p>
