Some authorities allow about thirty days for such planting. In the third method, which consists in transferring shoots from a tree into the ground, if the shoot is buried in the earth, you must be careful, in the case of some, that the shoot be removed at the proper time—that is, before it shows any sign of budding or blossoming; and that what you transplant from the tree you tear from the stock<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_269_1" id="target_note_LCL283_269_1"><sup>1</sup></a> rather than break off a limb, as the heel of a shoot is steadier, or the wider it is the more easily it puts out roots. They are thrust into the ground at once, before the sap dries out. In the case of olive cuttings, care must be taken that they be from a tender branch, sharpened evenly at both ends.

You cannot, for instance, graft a pear on an oak, even though you can on an apple. This is a matter of importance to many people who pay considerable attention to soothsayers; for these have a saying that when a tree has been grafted with several varieties, the one that attracts the lightning turns into as many bolts as there are varieties, though the stroke is a single one.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_269_3a" id="target_note_LCL283_269_3a"><sup>3</sup></a> No matter how good the pear shoot which you graft on a wild pear, the fruit will not be as well flavoured as if you graft it on a cultivated pear.
