Gaul, Titus Pompeius has a hunting preserve so large that he keeps a tract of about four square miles enclosed. In addition to this, in the same enclosure are usually kept places for snails<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_491_1" id="target_note_LCL283_491_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and bee-hives, and also casks in which dormice are kept confined. But the care, increase, and feeding of all these, except the bees, is evident. For everybody knows that walled enclosures in warrens ought to be covered with plaster and ought to be high—in the one case to make it impossible for a weasel or a badger or other animal to enter, and in the other to keep a wolf from leaping over; and they should have coverts in which the hares may hide in the day-time under the brush and grass, and trees with spreading branches to hinder the swooping of an eagle. Who also does not know that if he puts in a few hares, male and female, in a short time the place will be filled? Such is the fecundity of this animal. For place only four in a warren and it is usually filled in a short time; for often, while they have a young litter they are found to have others in the womb.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_491_2" id="target_note_LCL283_491_2"><sup>2</sup></a> And so Archelaus writes of them that one who wishes to know how old they are should examine the natural openings, for undoubtedly one has more than another.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_491_3" id="target_note_LCL283_491_3"><sup>3</sup></a> There is a recent general practice of fattening these, too, by taking them from the warren and shutting them up in hutches and fattening them in an enclosed space. There are, then, some three species of these: one, this Italian species of ours, with short fore-legs and long hind
