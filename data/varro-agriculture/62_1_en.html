the fact that no questions were asked that no further discussion of nutrition was desired, he continued: “I shall discuss next the subject of harvesting the ripe crops. First the grass on the hay-meadows should be cut close with the sickle when it ceases to grow and begins to dry from the heat, and turned with the fork while it is drying out; when it is quite dry it should be made into bundles and hauled to the barn. Then the loose hay from the meadows should be raked up and added to the hay-pile. After doing this you should ‘sickle’ the meadows—that is, cut with the sickle what the mowers have passed over, leaving the field humped, as it were, with tufts of grass. I suppose the verb <span class="italic">sicilire</span>, used with meadow as object, is derived from this cutting (<span class="italic">sectio</span>).</p>

grain; and this, I suggest, is the derivation of the word. There are three methods of harvesting grain:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_283_1" id="target_note_LCL283_283_1"><sup>1</sup></a> the first, employed in Umbria, in which the stalk is cut close to the ground with the hook, and each bundle, as it is cut, is laid on the ground. When a number of bundles are formed, they go over them again, and cut the ears from each close to the stalk. The ears are cast into the basket and carried to the threshing-floor, while the straw is left in the field and afterwards stacked. In the second method, employed in Picenum, they use a curved handle of wood with a small iron saw attached to the end; when this catches a bundle of ears it cuts them off and leaves the straw standing in the field to be cut later. In the third method, employed near Rome and in numerous other places, seizing the top with the left hand they cut the straw in the middle; and I suggest
