As this animal feeds chiefly on mast, and next on beans, barley, and other grains, this food produces not only fat but a pleasant flavour in the flesh. In summer they are driven to pasture early in the day, and before the heat grows intense they are driven into a shady spot, preferably where there is water; then in the afternoon, when the heat has diminished, they are again turned out to pasture. In winter they are not turned out until the frost has disappeared and the ice has melted. In the matter of breeding, the boars are to be separated out two months ahead. The best time for service is from the beginning of the west wind to the spring equinox,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_355_1" id="target_note_LCL283_355_1"><sup>1</sup></a> as in this case the litter is produced in summer. For the sow is pregnant for four months and will thus bear her young when the land is rich in food. Sows should not be bred when less than a year old, and it is better to wait until they are twenty months old, so that they will be two years old when they bear. When they once begin bearing it is said that they continue to do so satisfactorily up to the seventh year. At the time of breeding they are driven into muddy lanes<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_355_2" id="target_note_LCL283_355_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and pools, so that they may wallow in the mud; for this is their form of refreshment, as bathing is to human beings.
