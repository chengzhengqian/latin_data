also be given to the proper period before breeding begins, during which the males should be kept away from the females—a period which both stockmen and shepherds usually fix at two months for all animals. The second division comprises the points to be watched in breeding, arising from the difference among species in the period of gestation; thus, the mare carries her young twelve months, the cow ten, the sheep and the goat five, the sow four. (Speaking of breeding, there is a story from Spain which, though incredible,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_325_1" id="target_note_LCL283_325_1"><sup>1</sup></a> is quite authentic, that on the shore of the ocean in Lusitania, in the district in which is situated the town of Olisipo, certain mares on Mount Tagrus, at a particular time of year, are impregnated by the wind; just as in this country frequently occurs in the case of those hens the eggs of which are called <span class="italic">hypenemia.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_325_2" id="target_note_LCL283_325_2"><sup>2</sup></a></span> But the foals of these mares do not live beyond three years.) Care must be taken that the young which have gone the full time or longer have a clean, soft place to stand in, and that they be not trampled. Lambs which are born after the full period are called <span class="italic">cordi,</span> the name being derived from the fact that they have remained in those deep-lying folds which are called <span class="italic">chorion.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_325_3" id="target_note_LCL283_325_3"><sup>3</sup></a></span> There is a third item—the practice to be observed in the matter of feeding, including the number of days on which the young may have the teat, at what times, and where; and if the mother is deficient in milk, that the young be allowed to suckle the udder of another mother. Such animals are called <span class="italic">subrumi,</span> ‘under the udder,’ the udder being called <span class="italic">rumis,</span> as I suppose, in old Latin.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_325_4a" id="target_note_LCL283_325_4a"><sup>4</sup></a> As a rule, lambs are not
