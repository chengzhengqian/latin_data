First, it is better to stow the hay crop under cover than in stacks, as by this method it makes better fodder—as is proved by the fact that when both kinds are offered them, cattle prefer the former.</p>

The walls and floor are to be coated with marble cement, or at least with clay mixed with grain-chaff and amurca, as this both keeps out mice and worms and makes the grain more solid and firm. Some farmers sprinkle the wheat, too, with amurca, using a quadrantal
