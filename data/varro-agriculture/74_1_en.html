<h2><span class="ac">Book II</span></h2>
<p><span class="sc">It</span> was not without reason that those great men, our ancestors, put the Romans who lived in the country ahead of those who lived in the city. For as in the country those who live in the villa are lazier than those who are engaged in carrying out work on the land, so they thought that those who settled in town were more indolent than those who dwelt in the country. Hence they so divided the year that they attended to their town affairs only on the ninth days, and dwelt in the country on the remaining seven.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_307_1" id="target_note_LCL283_307_1"><sup>1</sup></a> So long as they kept up this practice they attained both objects—keeping their lands most productive by cultivation, and themselves enjoying better health and not requiring the citified gymnasia of the Greeks. In these days one such gymnasium is hardly enough, and they do not think they have a real villa unless it rings with many resounding Greek names—places severally called <span class="italic">procoetion</span> (ante-room), <span class="italic">palaestra</span> (exercise-room), <span class="italic">apodyterion</span> (dressing-room), <span class="italic">peristylon</span> (colonnade), <span class="italic">ornithon</span> (aviary), <span class="italic">peripteros</span> (pergola), <span class="italic">oporotheca</span> (fruit-room). As therefore in these days practically all the heads of families have sneaked within the walls, abandoning the sickle and the plough, and would rather busy their hands in the theatre and in the circus than in the grain-fields and the vineyards, we hire a man to bring us from Africa and Sardinia the grain with which to fill our stomachs, and the vintage we store comes in ships from the islands of Cos and Chios.</p>
