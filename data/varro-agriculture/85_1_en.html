How will you get a ninefold division in the case of mules and herdsmen, where there is neither breeding nor bearing? I see how you can use it in the case of dogs. I grant you also that even in the case of the humans the ninefold division can be retained, as they keep women in their huts in the winter ranches, and some have them even in the summer, thinking that this is worth while in order the more easily to keep the herdsmen with their herds; and by the natural increase they enlarge their slave gangs and make the cattle-raising more profitable.” ‘The number,” I remark,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_329_2" id="target_note_LCL283_329_2"><sup>2</sup></a> “is not to be taken as precisely accurate, just as we do not mean to be taken exactly when we say that a thousand ships set forth against Troy, or speak of the centumviral court at Rome.
