Gallinaria, in the Tuscan Sea off the coast of Italy opposite the Ligurian mountains, Intimilium, and Album Ingaunum, is said to have got its name;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_481_1" id="target_note_LCL283_481_1"><sup>1</sup></a> others hold that they are the descendants of those barnyard fowls which were carried there by sailors and became wild. The African hens are large, speckled, with rounded back, and the Greeks call them ‘meleagrides.’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_481_2" id="target_note_LCL283_481_2"><sup>2</sup></a> These are the latest fowls to come from the kitchen to the dining-room because of the pampered tastes of people. On account of their scarcity they fetch a high price. Of the three species, it is chiefly the barnyard fowls which are fattened. These are shut into a warm, narrow, darkened place, because movement on their part and light free them from the slavery of fat. For this purpose the largest hens are chosen, but not necessarily those which are mistakenly called “Melic”; for the ancients<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_481_3" id="target_note_LCL283_481_3"><sup>3</sup></a> said “Melic” for “Medic,” just as they said “Thelis” for “Thetis.” Those were called so originally which, because of their size, were imported from Media, and the descendants of these; but later on all large hens got the name on account of their likeness. On these hens the feathers are pulled from wings and tail, and they are fattened on pellets of barley-meal, sometimes mixed with darnel flour, or with flax seed soaked in fresh water. They are fed twice a day, and are watched to see, from certain symptoms, that the last food taken has been digested before more is given. When they have eaten, and their heads have been cleaned to prevent their having lice, they are again shut up. This is continued as long as twenty-five days, and at this time they finally become fat. Some breeders fatten them also on wheat bread softened in water mixed
