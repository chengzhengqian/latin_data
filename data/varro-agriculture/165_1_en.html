<p>“There are also other species not unlike them, such as the teal, coot, and partridge, which, as Archelaus writes, conceive when they hear the voice of the male.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_489_1" id="target_note_LCL283_489_1"><sup>1</sup></a> These are not stuffed as are those above mentioned, either to increase their fecundity or to improve their flavour, but they become fat by merely feeding them as described.
