This can be done if you will run a pipe and attach to it small teats to squirt out the water in such a way that it will strike a stone and be scattered widely in a mist. They need little food, and require no one to feed them; they get their food, not only in the open while crawling around, but even discover any upright walls, if the stream does not prevent. In fact, even at the dealer’s they keep alive for a long time by chewing the cud,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_497_1" id="target_note_LCL283_497_1"><sup>1</sup></a> a few laurel leaves being thrown them for the purpose, sprinkled with a little bran. Hence the cook usually doesn’t know whether they are alive or dead when he is cooking them.

Not that they do not vary in these regions in distribution and size; thus, very large ones do come from Africa—the so-called <span class="italic">solitannae</span>—so large that 80 quadrantes<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_497_2" id="target_note_LCL283_497_2"><sup>2</sup></a> can be put into their shells; and so in other countries the same species are relatively larger or smaller. They produce innumerable young; these are very small and with a soft shell, but it hardens with time. If you build large islands in the yards, they will bring in a large haul of money. Snails, too, are often fattened as follows: a jar for them to feed in, containing holes, is lined with must and spelt—it should contain holes in order to allow the air to enter, for the snail is naturally hardy.</p>
