<span class="italic">flagellum</span>, while the larger from which the grapes spring they call <span class="italic">palma.</span> The first word by the change of one letter is derived from <span class="italic">flatus</span>,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_255_1" id="target_note_LCL283_255_1"><sup>1</sup></a> the blowing of the wind, so that they call it <span class="italic">flagellum</span> instead of <span class="italic">flabellum.</span> The second word seems at first to have been called <span class="italic">parilema</span>, from <span class="italic">parere</span>, to bear, because the shoot is sent out to bear grapes; thence, by change of letters, as in many words, it got to be called <span class="italic">palma.</span> On the other side, it bears a tendril; this is a vine twig twisted like a curl. It is by means of these tendrils that the vine holds the support on which it creeps to grasp a place, from which grasping (<span class="italic">capere</span>) it is called <span class="italic">capreolus.</span> All fodder crops should be cut, first clover, mixed fodder, and vetch, and last hay. <span class="italic">Ocirium</span> is derived, as is the garden clover (<span class="italic">ocimum</span>), from the Greek word ὠκέως, which means ‘quickly.’ It is called <span class="italic">ocinum</span> for the further reason that it moves (<span class="italic">citat</span>) the bowels of cattle, and is fed to them on that account, as a purgative. It is cut green from the bean crop before it forms pods. <span class="italic">Farrago</span>, on the other hand, is so called from a crop where a mixture of barley, vetch, and legumes has been sowed for green feed, either because it is cut with the steel (<span class="italic">ferrum, ferrago</span>) or for the reason that it was first sowed in a spelt (<span class="italic">far</span>) field. It is with this that horses and other animals are purged and fattened in the spring. Vetch is so called from <span class="italic">vincire</span>, to bind, because it also has tendrils as the vine has, with which, when it creeps up to cling to the stalk of the lupine or some other plant, it usually binds (<span class="italic">vincit</span>) it. If you have meadows to be irrigated, as soon as you have gathered the hay, irrigate them. During droughts water should be given every evening to the fruit trees that are grafted. It may be that they are called <span class="italic">poma</span> from the fact that they need drink (<span class="italic">potus</span>).</p>
