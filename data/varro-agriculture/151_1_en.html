chicks for each hen, and these, when they are grown, he sells for fifty denarii each, so that no other fowl brings in so high a revenue. He buys eggs, too, and places them under hens, and the chicks which are hatched from these he places in that domed building<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_461_1" id="target_note_LCL283_461_1"><sup>1</sup></a> in which he keeps his peafowl. This building should be made of a size proportioned to the number of peafowl, and should have separate sleeping quarters, coated with smooth plaster, so that no serpent or animal can get in; it should also have an open place in front of it, to which they may go out to feed on sunny days. These birds require that both places be clean; and so their keeper should go around with a shovel and pick up the droppings and keep them, as they are useful for fertilizer and as litter for chicks.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_461_2" id="target_note_LCL283_461_2"><sup>2</sup></a> It is said that Quintus Hortensius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_461_3" id="target_note_LCL283_461_3"><sup>3</sup></a> was the first to serve these fowl; it was on the occasion of his inauguration as aedile, and the innovation was praised at that time rather by the luxurious than by those who were strict and virtuous. As his example was quickly followed by many, the price has risen to such a point that the eggs sell for five denarii each, the birds themselves sell readily for 50 each, and a flock of 100 easily brings 40,000 sesterces—in fact, Abuccius used to say that if one required three chicks to every hen, the total might amount to 60,000.</p>
<p>VII. Meanwhile Appius’s bailiff comes with a message from the consul that the augurs are summoned, and he leaves the villa. But pigeons fly into the villa, and Merula, pointing to them, remarks to Axius: “If you had ever built a dove-cote<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_461_4" id="target_note_LCL283_461_4"><sup>4</sup></a> you might think these were your doves, wild though they are.
