their appetite. Separate enclosures should also be built, so that you may take the pregnant ones away from the flock, and also those that are sick. These measures concern most the flocks which are folded at the steading. On the other hand, in the case of those that feed on the ranges and are far from cover, hurdles or nets are carried with which to make enclosures in a desolate district, as well as other necessary things; for they usually graze far and wide in all sorts of places, so that frequently the winter grazing grounds are many miles away from the summer.” “I am well aware of that,” said I,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_337_1" id="target_note_LCL283_337_1"><sup>1</sup></a> “for I had flocks that wintered in Apulia and summered in the mountains around Reate, these two widely separated ranges being connected by public cattle-trails, as a pair of buckets by their yoke.” “Such<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_337_2" id="target_note_LCL283_337_2"><sup>2</sup></a> flocks, even when they feed in the same locality, are treated differently at different seasons; thus, in summer they begin feeding at daybreak, because at that time the grass, filled with dew,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_337_3" id="target_note_LCL283_337_3"><sup>3</sup></a> is superior to the grass of midday, which is drier. At sunrise they are driven<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_337_4" id="target_note_LCL283_337_4"><sup>4</sup></a> to water, to make them more eager to graze when they come back. During the midday heat they are driven under shady cliffs and wide-spreading
trees to cool off until the day grows cooler; and they feed again in the evening until sunset. Sheep should be headed in grazing in such a way as to have the sun behind them, as the head of the sheep is its weakest part. A short time after sunset they are driven to water, and then again they graze until it becomes quite dark; for at this time the succulence comes again to the grass. This practice is usually kept up from the rising of the Pleiades until the autumnal equinox.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_337_5" id="target_note_LCL283_337_5"><sup>5</sup></a> It is profitable to drive
