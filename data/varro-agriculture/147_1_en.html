the stream, where another stream runs into it, to the upper part of the stream, where the Museum is situated. Along the banks of this stream there runs an uncovered walk 10 feet broad; off this walk and facing the open country is the place in which the aviary stands, shut in on two sides, right and left, by high walls. Between these lies the site of the aviary, shaped in the form of a writing-tablet with a top-piece,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_453_1a" id="target_note_LCL283_453_1a"><sup>1</sup></a> the quadrangular part being 48 feet in width and 72 feet in length, while at the rounded toppiece
it is 27 feet. Facing this, as it were a space marked off on the lower margin of the tablet, is an uncovered walk with a <span class="italic">plumula</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_453_2" id="target_note_LCL283_453_2"><sup>2</sup></a> extending from the aviary, in the middle of which are cages; and here is the entrance to the courtyard. At the entrance, on the right side and the left, are colonnades, arranged with stone columns in the outside rows and, instead of columns in the middle, with dwarf trees; while from the top of the wall to the architrave the colonnade is covered with a net of hemp, which also continues from the architrave to the base. These colonnades are filled with all manner of birds, to which food is supplied through the netting, while water flows to them in a tiny rivulet. Along the inner side of the base of the columns, on the right side and on the left, and extending from the middle to the upper end of the open quadrangle, are two oblong fish-basins, not very wide, facing the colonnades. Between these basins is merely a path
