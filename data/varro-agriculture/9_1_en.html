For this reason the peasants even now call a road <span class="italic">veha</span>, because of the hauling; and they call the place to which and from which they haul <span class="italic">vella</span> and not <span class="italic">villa.</span> In the same way, those who make a living by hauling are said <span class="italic">facere velaturam.</span>” “Certainly,” said Fundanius, “grazing and agriculture are different things, though akin; just as the right pipe of the tibia is different from the left, but still in a way united, inasmuch as the one is the treble, while the other plays the accompaniment of the same air.” “You may even add this,” said I, “that the shepherd’s life is the treble, and the farmer’s plays the accompaniment, if we may trust that most learned man, Dicaearchus. In his sketch of Greek life from the earliest times, he says that in the primitive period, when people led a pastoral life, they were ignorant even of ploughing, of planting trees, and of pruning, and that agriculture was adopted by them only at a later period. Wherefore the art of agriculture ‘accompanies’ the pastoral because it is subordinate, as the left pipe is to the stops of the right.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_177_1" id="target_note_LCL283_177_1"><sup>1</sup></a> “You and your piping,” retorted Agrius, “are not only robbing the master of his flock and the slaves of their <span class="italic">peculium</span>—the grazing which their master allows them—but you are even abrogating the homestead laws, among which we find one reciting that the settler may not graze a young orchard with the offspring of the she-goat,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_177_2a" id="target_note_LCL283_177_2a"><sup>2</sup></a> a race which

“The two pipes were tuned so that the melody played on one could be accompanied an octave lower on the other.”<span class="linebreak"></span>

Book II, Chap. 3, 7, and Book II, Chap. 1, 7. The argument is, that if grazing is not to be included, the master is deprived of his flocks, and the slaves of their right to graze an animal of their own; and the homestead laws clearly do not exclude grazing, as is evident from this prohibition.
