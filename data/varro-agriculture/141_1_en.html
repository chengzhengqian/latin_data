Each of these divisions may be subdivided into at least two: thus, under the first head, those which are content with the land only, as peafowl, turtle-doves, fieldfares; under the second, those which are not content with the land only, but need water also, as geese, teal, and ducks. In the same way the second head—that of game—contains its two diverse classes, one under which come the boar, the roe, and the hare, and the second, those which are also outside the villa, such as bees, snails, and dormice. There are likewise two divisions of the third class, the aquatic, inasmuch as fish are kept sometimes in fresh water, sometimes in sea-water. For the three classes formed of these six subdivisions must be secured three classes of craftsmen—fowlers, hunters, fishers—or else you must purchase from these those creatures which you are to preserve by the activity of your own servants during the period of gestation and up to the time of birth, and when they are born to rear and fatten so that they may reach the market.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_441_1" id="target_note_LCL283_441_1"><sup>1</sup></a> And there are, moreover, certain other creatures which are to be brought into the villa without the use of net by fowler or hunter or fisher, such as dormice, snails, and chickens.
