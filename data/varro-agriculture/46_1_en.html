<p>XXIX. “These are the things which should be done in the first period, from the rising of the west wind to the vernal equinox:—All kinds of nurseries should be set out, orchards pruned, meadows manured, vines trenched and outcropping roots removed, meadows cleared, willow beds planted, grain-land weeded.
