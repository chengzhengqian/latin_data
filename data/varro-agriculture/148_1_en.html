giving access to the <span class="italic">tholos,</span> which is a round domed building outside the quadrangle, faced with columns, such as is seen in the hall of Catulus, if you put columns instead of walls. Outside these columns is a wood planted by hand with large trees, so that the light enters only at the lower part, and the whole is enclosed with high walls. Between the outer columns of the rotunda, which are of stone, and the equal number of slender inner columns, which are of fir, is a space five feet wide. Between the exterior columns, instead of a wall there is netting of gut, so that there is a view into the wood and the objects in it, while not a bird can get out into it. In the spaces between the interior columns the aviary is enclosed with a net instead of a wall. Between these and the exterior columns there is built up step by step a sort of little bird-theatre, with brackets<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_455_1" id="target_note_LCL283_455_1"><sup>1</sup></a> fastened at frequent intervals to all the columns as bird-seats. Within the nettings are all manner of birds, chiefly songsters, such as nightingales and blackbirds, to which water is supplied by means of a small trench, while food is passed to them under the netting. Below the base of the columns is stone-work rising a foot and nine inches above the platform;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_455_2" id="target_note_LCL283_455_2"><sup>2</sup></a> the platform itself rises about two feet above a pond, and is about five feet wide, so that the guests<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_455_3a" id="target_note_LCL283_455_3a"><sup>3</sup></a> can walk in among the benches and the small columns. At the foot of the platform inside, is the pond, with a border a foot wide, and a little island in the middle. Along the platform also docks<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_455_4" id="target_note_LCL283_455_4"><sup>4</sup></a> have been hollowed out as shelters for ducks. On the island is a small column, and on the inside of it is a post, which holds up, instead of a table, a wheel
