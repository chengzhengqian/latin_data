you know, an unusually learned man (his writings are quite in the manner of Lucilius), who used to remark likewise that his estate near Alba was always beaten in feeding by his steading? for his land brought in less than 10,000, and his steading more than 20,000 sesterces. He also claimed that if he had got a villa near the sea, where he wanted one, he would take in more than 100,000 from the villa. Come, did not Marcus Cato, when he took over the guardianship of Lucullus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_439_1" id="target_note_LCL283_439_1"><sup>1</sup></a> recently, sell the fish from his ponds for 40,000 sesterces?” “My dear Merula,” said Axius, “take me, I beg, as your pupil in this villa-feeding.” “Certainly,” he replied; “I will begin as soon as you promise the <span class="italic">minerval.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_439_2" id="target_note_LCL283_439_2"><sup>2</sup></a></span> “That is satisfactory to me; you may have it to-day, or I’ll pay it time and again from that feeding.” “Humph,” replied Appius, “the first time some geese or peacocks out of your flock die!” “Well,” retorted Axius, “what does it matter if you eat fowls or fish that have died,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_439_3" id="target_note_LCL283_439_3"><sup>3</sup></a> seeing that you never eat them unless they are dead? But, I pray you,” said he, “lead me into the way of the science of villa-husbandry, and set forth its scope and method.”</p>
<p>III. Merula began without hesitation: “In the first place, the owner ought to have so clear an idea of those creatures which can be reared or fed in the villa and around it that they may afford him both profit and pleasure. There are three divisions of this science: the aviary, the hare-warren, and the fish-pond. Under the head of aviary I include enclosures for all fowls which are usually reared within the walls of the villa. Under the head of hare-warrens I wish you to understand, not those which our forefathers called by that name—places
