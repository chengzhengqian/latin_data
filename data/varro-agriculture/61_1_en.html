The hard inner part is called the grain; the husk is its envelope; and the beard is the part which rises from the husk like a long, slender needle, just as if the husk and beard formed a peaked cap for the grain. ‘Beard’ and ‘grain’ are familiar words to most people, but ‘husk’ (<span class="italic">gluma</span>) to few; thus the only place where it occurs, to my knowledge, is in Ennius, in his translation of Euhemerus. The word (<span class="italic">gluma</span>) seems to be derived from <span class="italic">glubere</span>, ‘strip,’ because the grain is stripped (<span class="italic">deglubitur</span>) from this envelope; so the same word is used for the envelope of the edible fruit of the fig tree. The beard is called arista from the fact that it is the first part to dry (<span class="italic">arescere</span>). The grain is so called from <span class="italic">gerere</span>; for the seed is planted that the ear may ‘bear’ (<span class="italic">gerat</span>) the grain, not the husk or the beard; just as the vine is planted not to bear leaves but grapes. The ear, however, which the peasants, in their old-fashioned way, call <span class="italic">speca</span>, seems to have got its name from <span class="italic">spes</span>; for it is because they hope (<span class="italic">sperant</span>) to have this grow that they plant. An ear which has no beard is said to be ‘hornless,’ as the beard may be said to be the ‘horns’ of the ear. When these are just forming and are not yet quite visible, the green envelope under which they are hidden is called the sheath, being like the sheath in which a sword is encased. The part at the top of the full-grown ear, which is smaller than the grain, is called <span class="italic">frit</span>;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_281_2" id="target_note_LCL283_281_2"><sup>2</sup></a> while the part, also smaller than the grain, at the bottom of the ear where it joins the top of the stalk is called <span class="italic">urru.</span>”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_281_2" id="target_note_LCL283_281_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
