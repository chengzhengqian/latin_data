the senator, a member of my tribe, and I, after casting our ballots, wished, though the sun was hot, to be on hand to escort the candidate whom we were supporting when he returned home. Axius remarked to me: “While the votes are being sorted, shall we enjoy the shade of the Villa Publica,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_429_1" id="target_note_LCL283_429_1"><sup>1</sup></a> instead of building us one out of the half-plank of our own candidate?”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_429_2" id="target_note_LCL283_429_2"><sup>2</sup></a> “Well,” I replied, “I think that the proverb is correct, ‘bad advice is worst for the adviser,’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_429_3" id="target_note_LCL283_429_3"><sup>3</sup></a> and also that good advice should be considered good both for the adviser and the advised.

There we find Appius Claudius, the augur,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_429_4a" id="target_note_LCL283_429_4a"><sup>4</sup></a> sitting on a bench so that he might be on hand for consultation, if need should arise. There were sitting at his left Cornelius Merula (‘Blackbird’), member of a consular family, and Fircellius Pavo (‘Peacock’), of Reate; and on his right Minucius Pica (‘Magpie’) and Marcus Petronius Passer (‘Sparrow’). When we came up to him, Axius said to Appius, with a smile: “Will you let us come into your aviary, where you are sitting among the birds?” “With pleasure,” he replied, “and especially you; I still ‘bring up’ those hospitable birds which you set before me a few days ago in your villa at Reate, when I was on my way to lake Velinus in the matter of the dispute between the people of Interamna and those of Reate.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_429_5" id="target_note_LCL283_429_5"><sup>5</sup></a> But,”
