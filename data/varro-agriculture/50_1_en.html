and the making of the vintage falls between the autumnal equinox and the setting of the Pleiades; then the pruning and layering of vines and the planting of fruit trees should begin. In some localities, where severe frosts come earlier, these operations are best carried on in spring.</p>
<p>XXXV. “In the seventh period, between the setting of the Pleiades and the winter solstice, they say that these operations should be carried out:—Planting of lilies and crocus. A rose which has already formed a root is cut from the root up into twigs a palm-breadth long and planted; later on the same twig is transplanted when it has made a living root. It is not profitable to plant violet beds on a farm for the reason that beds must be formed by heaping up the soil, and irrigation and heavy rains wash these away and thus make the ground poorer. From the beginning of the west wind to the rising of Arcturus, it is proper to transplant from the nursery wild thyme, which gets its name (<span class="italic">serpillum</span>) from the fact that it ‘creeps’ (<span class="italic">serpit</span>). Dig new ditches, clear old ones, prune vineyards and orchards, provided you do not do this, or in fact most things, during the fifteen days preceding and following the solstice. And yet some trees, such as the elm, are properly planted at that time.</p>
<p>XXXVI. “In the eighth period, between the solstice and the beginning of the west wind, these operations should be carried out:—Any water in the grain lands should be drained, but if there is a drought and the land is friable, harrow. Prune vineyards and orchards. When work cannot be carried out on the land, indoor tasks should be completed then in the early winter mornings.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_259_1" id="target_note_LCL283_259_1"><sup>1</sup></a> You should keep the rules
