says that when bees are sickly, because of their feeding in the early spring on the blossoms of the almond and the cornel, it is diarrhoea that affects them, and they are cured by drinking urine. <span class="italic">Propolis</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_513_1" id="target_note_LCL283_513_1"><sup>1</sup></a> is the name given to a substance with which they build a <span class="italic">protection</span> (‘gable’) over the entrance opening in front of the hive, especially in summer. This substance is used, and under the same name, by physicians in making poultices, and for this reason it brings even a higher price than honey on the Via Sacra. <span class="italic">Erithace</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_513_2" id="target_note_LCL283_513_2"><sup>2</sup></a> is the name given a substance with which they fasten together the ends of the comb (it is a different substance than either honey or <span class="italic">propolis</span>) and it is in it that the force of the attraction<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_513_3a" id="target_note_LCL283_513_3a"><sup>3</sup></a> lies. So they smear with this substance, mixed with balm, the bough or other object on which they want the swarm to settle. The comb is the structure which they fashion in a series of cells of wax, each separate cell having six sides, the same number as that of the feet given to each bee by nature. It is said that they do not gather wholly from the same sources the materials which they bring in for making the four substances, <span class="italic">propolis, erithace,</span> comb, and honey. Sometimes what they gather is of one kind, since from the pomegranate and the asparagus they gather only food, from the olive tree wax, from the fig honey, but of a poor quality. Sometimes a double service is rendered,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_513_4" id="target_note_LCL283_513_4"><sup>4</sup></a> as both wax and food from the bean, the balm, the gourd, and the cabbage; and similarly a double service of food and honey from the apple and wild pear, and still another double service in combination,
