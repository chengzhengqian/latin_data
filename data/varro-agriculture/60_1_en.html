not been touched by the planter show that this is true; for roots grow before the plant which comes from them, but they go no deeper than the point to which the sun’s warmth reaches. The growth of roots is determined by two factors: that nature thrusts one kind of wood to a greater distance than another; and that one kind of soil yields more readily than another.</p>
<p>XLVI. “As a result of factors of this kind there are several remarkable differences of character; so that, for instance, the season may be told from the leaves of such trees as the olive, the silver poplar, and the willow, by the direction in which they lie; thus when the leaves of these trees turn over it is said that the summer solstice has passed. No less remarkable is the behaviour of the flowers which are called ‘heliotropes’ from the fact that they face the rising sun in the morning and follow his course until the setting, facing him the whole time.</p>
<p>XLVII. “Plants such as the olive and fig, which, reared in the nursery from shoots and naturally somewhat delicate on top, should be protected at the top by two boards tied right and left; and the weeds should be cleared. These should be pulled while they are young; for after they become dry they resist more strongly, and break off more readily than they yield. On the other hand, growth that springs up on a meadow for haying must not only not be plucked while it is maturing, but also must not be trampled. For this reason flocks, and every sort of animal, including even man, must be kept off a meadow; for the foot of man is death to grass, and marks the beginning of a path.</p>
<p>XLVIII. “Now, in the case of grain crops, that by which the stalk puts forth the grain is the head. If
