that the word <span class="italic">messis</span> is derived from this middle (<span class="italic">medium</span>) which they cut. The part of the stalk below the hand remains attached to the ground, and is cut later; while the part which is attached to the ear is carried to the threshing-floor in baskets. The name for straw, <span class="italic">palea</span>, may be derived from the fact that there, in an uncovered place, it is detached ‘openly’ (<span class="italic">palam</span>); some derive the other word, <span class="italic">stramentum</span>, from <span class="italic">stare</span>, as they do also the word <span class="italic">stamen</span>, and others from stratus, because it is ‘spread’ (<span class="italic">substernitur</span>) under cattle. The grain should be cut when it is ripe; and on easily worked land it is held that the reaping of one <span class="italic">iugerum</span> is approximately a day’s work for one man—this should include the carrying of the reaped ears to the threshing-floor in baskets.</p>
<p>LI. “The threshing-floor should be on the place, in a somewhat elevated spot, so that the wind can sweep over it; the size should be determined by the size of the harvest. It should preferably be round, with a slight elevation at the centre, so that, if it rains, the water will not stand but be able to run off the floor in the shortest line—and of course in a circle the shortest line is from the centre to the circumference. It should be built of solid dirt, well packed, and especially if it is of clay, so that it may not crack in the heat and allow the grain to hide, or take in water and open the door to mice and ants. For this reason it is customary to coat it with amurca,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_285_1" id="target_note_LCL283_285_1"><sup>1</sup></a> which is poison to weeds, ants, and moles. Some farmers build up the floor with stone to make it solid, or even pave it. Others, such as the Bagienni,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_285_2" id="target_note_LCL283_285_2"><sup>2</sup></a> go so far as to build a shelter over the floors, because in that country rain-storms frequently occur at threshing time.
