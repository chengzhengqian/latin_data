<p>VIII. “As an argument against the vineyard, there are those who claim that the cost of upkeep swallows up the profits. In my opinion, it depends on the kind of vineyard, for there are several: for some are low-growing
and without props, as in Spain; others tall, which are called ‘yoked,’ as generally in Italy. For this latter class there are two names, <span class="italic">pedamenta</span> and <span class="italic">iuga</span>: those on which the vine runs vertically are called <span class="italic">pedamenta</span> (stakes), and those on which it runs transversely are called <span class="italic">iuga</span> (yokes); and from this comes the name ‘yoked vines.’ Four kinds of ‘yokes’ are usually employed, made respectively of poles, of reeds, of cords, and of vines: the first of these, for example, around Falernum, the second around Arpi, the third around Brundisium, the fourth around Mediolanum.
There are two forms of this trellising: in straight lines, as in the district of Canusium, or yoked lengthways and sideways in the form of the <span class="italic">compluvium</span>,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_199_1" id="target_note_LCL283_199_1"><sup>1</sup></a> as is the practice generally in Italy. If the material grows on the place the vineyard does not mind the expense; and it is not burdensome if much of it can be obtained in the neighbourhood. The first class I have named requires chiefly a willow thicket, the second a reed thicket, the third a rush bed or some material of the kind. For the fourth you must have an arbustum,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_199_2" id="target_note_LCL283_199_2"><sup>2</sup></a> where trellises can be made of the vines,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_199_3" id="target_note_LCL283_199_3"><sup>3</sup></a> as the people of Mediolanum do on the trees which they call <span class="italic">opuli</span> (maples), and the Canusians on lattice-work in fig trees. Likewise, there are, as a rule, four types of props. The best for common use in the vineyard is a stout post, called <span class="italic">ridica</span>, made of oak or juniper. The second best is a stake made
