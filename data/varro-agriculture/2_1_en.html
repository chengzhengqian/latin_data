the gods help those who call upon them, I will first invoke them—not the Muses, as Homer and Ennius do, but the twelve councillor-gods<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_163_1" id="target_note_LCL283_163_1"><sup>1</sup></a>; and I do not mean those urban gods, whose images stand around the forum, bedecked with gold, six male and a like number female, but those twelve gods who are the special patrons of husbandmen.
