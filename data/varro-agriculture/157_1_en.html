comb reddish, beak short, wide, and sharp, eyes yellowish or black, wattles red with a trace of white, neck particoloured or golden, thighs feathered, lower leg short, claws long, tail large, feathers thick; also by their stretching and crowing often, being stubborn in a fight—those which not only do not fear animals which attack the hens but even fight for the hens. In choosing a strain, however, it is not well to go after the Tanagrian, Median,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_473_1" id="target_note_LCL283_473_1"><sup>1</sup></a> or Chalcidian; these are undoubtedly handsome birds and very well fitted for fighting one another, but they are rather poor for laying. If you wish to raise 200 you should assign them an enclosed place, and on it construct two large connecting hen-houses, facing eastward, each about ten feet in length, one-half smaller in width, and a little less in height.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_473_2a" id="target_note_LCL283_473_2a"><sup>2</sup></a> In each of these there should be a window three feet wide and one foot higher; these should be made of withes so spaced as to allow plenty of light to enter, and yet to keep from passing through them any of the things which usually injure fowls. Between the two houses there should be a door through which their keeper, the <span class="italic">gallinarius</span>, can enter. In the houses should be run a number of perches sufficient to hold all the hens. Facing the several perches separate nests should be

Moreover, in Columella it contains only a fireplace, the smoke from which “is very salutary for hens.” Columella states that this room connects the two hen-houses, but we can only infer that this is true in Varro. It appears that the caretaker’s room was surrounded by nests, but the word <span class="italic">plena</span> (Sec. 7) seems very odd.
