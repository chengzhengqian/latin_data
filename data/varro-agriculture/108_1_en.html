I attend to this matter following the rising of the constellation which the Greeks call Lyra, and which our people call Fides<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_375_1" id="target_note_LCL283_375_1"><sup>1</sup></a>—it is only then that I turn the bulls into the herd. The bull shows by the way he dismounts whether a male or female has been conceived by his act: if it is a male he comes down on the right side, and if a female on the left. Why this is true,” he remarked to me, “you who read Aristotle<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_375_2" id="target_note_LCL283_375_2"><sup>2</sup></a> will have to find out. Cows should not be covered which are less than two years old, so that they may be three years old when they bear; and it will be all the better if they are four years old. Most of them continue bearing up to ten years, and some of them even longer. The best time for mating is from the rising of the Dolphin up to forty days or a little more; for cows which conceive at that time drop their calves at the most temperate season, as cows carry their calves for ten months. On this subject I have seen a remarkable statement—that if you turn in a bull immediately after he has been castrated, he can get a calf. The cows should be pastured in grassy and watered ground, and care should be taken not to let them crowd, be struck, or run against one another. As cattle-flies<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_375_3a" id="target_note_LCL283_375_3a"><sup>3</sup></a> have a way of tormenting them in summer and certain minute insects grow under their tails, some breeders keep them shut up in pens, to keep them from being worried.
