to buy it and have sent it to the farm-house.” “Just as if,” replied Pica, “there weren’t many of them in the city, also. Or doesn’t it seem to you that people who have dove-cotes on their roof-tiles possess pigeon-houses, inasmuch as some of them have equipment worth more than 100,000 sesterces? I suggest that you buy the complete outfit from one of these, and before you build in the country learn here in the city to put in your purse every day the big profit of a penny or two.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_469_1a" id="target_note_LCL283_469_1a"><sup>1</sup></a> But go ahead with your subject, Merula.”</p>

But instead of nests set in the walls it should have brackets or poles in a row, and over these there should be placed small mats of hemp. The bottom row should be not less than three feet from the ground, between the other rows there should be a space of nine inches, with a half-foot interval between the top and the cupola; and the row should be as wide as the bracket can stand out from the wall, as they feed on the brackets day and night. As to food, dry wheat is given them, about a half-modius for 120 turtle-doves, and their quarters are swept out every day so that they may not suffer harm from the dung—and this is also kept for fertilizing the ground. The most suitable time for fattening is about harvest, for at that time their mothers are at their best, when most chicks are being born, these latter being better for fattening; and hence the income from them is greatest at this time.”</p>

They are constantly poking fun at Axius’s greed, and Pica ironically advises him to learn from the city man a thing or two about “big” profits before setting up in the business in the country. Another interpretation, with no humour intended, comes from Iucundus’s conjecture, <span class="italic">ex asse semissem</span>: i.e. a gain of one-half as from every <span class="italic">as</span> invested, or a profit of fifty per cent.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL283_469_1a').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
