<p>XIV. â€œNow I shall speak<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_217_1" id="target_note_LCL283_217_1"><sup>1</sup></a> of the enclosures which are constructed for the protection of the farm as a whole, or its divisions. There are four types of such defences: the natural, the rustic, the military, and the masonry type; and each of these types has several varieties. The first type, the natural, is a hedge, usually planted with brush or thorn, having roots and being alive, and so with nothing to fear from the flaming torch of a mischievous passer-by.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_217_2" id="target_note_LCL283_217_2"><sup>2</sup></a> The second type, the rustic, is made of wood, but is not alive. It is built either of stakes planted close and intertwined with brush; or of thick posts with holes bored through, having rails, usually two or three to the panel, thrust into the openings; or of trimmed trees placed end to end, with the branches driven into the ground.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_217_3" id="target_note_LCL283_217_3"><sup>3</sup></a> The third, or military type,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_217_4" id="target_note_LCL283_217_4"><sup>4</sup></a> is a trench and bank of earth; but the trench is adequate only if it can hold all the rain water, or has a slope sufficient to enable it to drain the water off the land. The bank is serviceable which is close to the ditch on the inside, or so steep that it is not easy to climb. This type of enclosure is usually built along public roads and along streams. At several points along the Via Salaria, in the district of Crustumeria, one may see banks combined with trenches to prevent the river from injuring the fields. Banks built without trenches, such as occur in the district of Reate, are sometimes called walls. The fourth and last type of fence, that of masonry, is a wall, and there are usually four varieties: that which is built of stone, such as occurs in the district of Tusculum; that of burned brick, such as occurs in the Ager Gallicus;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_217_5" id="target_note_LCL283_217_5"><sup>5</sup></a> that
