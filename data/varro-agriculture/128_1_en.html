while those made of goat’s milk have the least nutriment and are most easily voided. There is also a difference depending on whether the cheeses are soft and fresh or dry and old, as the soft cheeses are more nutritious and less constipating, while the old, dry cheeses are just the opposite. The period for making cheese extends from the rising of the Pleiades in spring until the Pleiades in summer.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_415_1" id="target_note_LCL283_415_1"><sup>1</sup></a> In spring the milk for cheese making is drawn in the morning, while at other seasons the milking takes place toward midday; but the practice is not entirely uniform because of differences in locality and food. To two congii of milk is added a bit of rennet the size of an olive, to make it coagulate; this is better when made from a hare or a kid than when made from a lamb. Others use, instead of rennet, the milk from the stem of a fig, and vinegar; they also curdle with various other substances—a thing which, in Greek, is sometimes called ὀπός, and sometimes δάκρυον.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_415_2" id="target_note_LCL283_415_2"><sup>2</sup></a> “Ι should not be surprised,” I remarked, “if that is the reason that a fig tree was planted by shepherds near the shrine of the goddess Rumina; you know at that place sacrifice is offered with milk instead of with wine and sucklings.

In the farmer’s calendar which Columella gives (XI, 2), they are said to “appear fully” on that day, in the morning. He states that they rise in the evening on lOth October. The only explanation of the term “Pleiades in summer” would seem to be that at that time they appear near midnight, which would fix the period from May to mid-July. Columella (XII, 13) advises July for cheese-making.
