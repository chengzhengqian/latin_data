practices by experiment, their descendants for the most part by imitation. We ought to do both—imitate
others and attempt by experiment to do some things in a different way, following not chance but some system:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_233_1" id="target_note_LCL283_233_1"><sup>1</sup></a> as, for instance, if we plough a second time, more or less deeply than others, to see what effect this will have. This was the method they followed in weeding a second and third time, and those who put off the grafting of figs from spring-time to summer.</p>
<p>XIX. “With regard to the second division of equipment, to which I have given the name of inarticulate, Saserna says that two yoke of oxen are enough for 200 iugera of cultivated land, while Cato states that three yoke<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_233_2" id="target_note_LCL283_233_2"><sup>2</sup></a> are needed for 240 iugera of olive-yard. Hence, if Saserna is right, one yoke is needed for every 100 iugera; if Cato is right, one to every 80. My own opinion is that neither of these standards will fit every piece of land, and that each will fit some particular piece. One piece, for instance, may be easier or harder to work than another, and there are places which oxen cannot break unless they are unusually powerful, and frequently they leave the plough in the field with broken beam. Wherefore on each farm, so long as we are unacquainted with it, we should follow a threefold guide: the practice of the former owner, the practice of neighbouring owners, and a degree of experimentation. As to his addition of three donkeys to haul manure and one for the mill (for a vineyard of 100 iugera, a yoke of oxen, a pair of donkeys, and one for the mill); under this head of inarticulate equipment it is to be added that of other animals only those are to be kept which are of service in agriculture, and the few which are usually
