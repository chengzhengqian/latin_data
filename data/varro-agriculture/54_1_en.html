<p>XL. “In the first place, the seed, which is the origin of growth, is of two kinds, one being invisible, the other visible. There are invisible seed, if, as the naturalist Anaxagoras holds, they are in the air, and if the water which flows on the land carries them, as Theophrastus writes.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_267_1" id="target_note_LCL283_267_1"><sup>1</sup></a> The seed which can be seen should be carefully watched by the farmer; for some seed, such as that of the cypress, though capable of generating, is so small that it can hardly be seen; (for the pods which it bears, that look like little balls of bark, are not the seeds but Contain them). The original seeds were given by nature, while the later were discovered in the experiments of the farmer.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_267_2" id="target_note_LCL283_267_2"><sup>2</sup></a> The first are those which, without the aid of the farmer, grow without being sown; the second are those which, derived from these, do not grow without being sown. In the case of the first,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_267_3a" id="target_note_LCL283_267_3a"><sup>3</sup></a> care should be taken to see that they are not dried out from age, and that they are clean and not mixed with seed of similar appearance. The age of the seed is of such importance in the case of some plants that it alters their nature; thus from the planting of old cabbage seed it is said that rape grows, and on the other hand that cabbage grows from old rape seed. In the case of the second class of seed,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_267_3a" id="target_note_LCL283_267_3a"><sup>3</sup></a> you should be careful not to transplant them too early or too late. The proper time is that given by Theophrastus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_267_4" id="target_note_LCL283_267_4"><sup>4</sup></a>—spring, autumn, and at the rising of the Dog Star—but the time is not the same for all localities and all species. In ground that is dry, thin, or clayey, spring is the proper season, because it is less humid; in good, rich land the autumn, because in spring it is very wet.
