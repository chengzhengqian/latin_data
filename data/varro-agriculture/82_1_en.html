is the first point, there are three divisions: the preferable locality for the pasturage of the several species, the time, and the manner; thus, it is better to pasture goats on a bushy hillside than on a grassy plain, while the opposite is true of mares. Again, the same localities are not equally suited in summer and winter to the pasturing of all species. Hence, flocks of sheep are driven all the way from Apulia into Samnium for summering, and are reported to the tax-collectors, for fear of offending against the censorial regulation forbidding the pasturing of unregistered<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_323_1" id="target_note_LCL283_323_1"><sup>1</sup></a> flocks; and mules are driven in summer from the level Rosea<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_323_2" id="target_note_LCL283_323_2"><sup>2</sup></a> into the high mountains of Burbur.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_323_3" id="target_note_LCL283_323_3"><sup>3</sup></a> One must also consider the preferable method of pasturing each species—by which I do not mean merely that a horse or an ox is content with hay, while swine will have none of it and seek mast, but that barley and beans should be fed at intervals to some of them, and that lupines should be fed to oxen, and alfalfa and clover to milch cows; and besides that for thirty days before mating more food should be given rams and bulls to increase their vigour, and food should be lessened for the females, because it is claimed that they conceive more readily when they are thin. The second topic is that of breeding—by which I mean the process from conception to birth, these being the limits of pregnancy. The first point to be observed, therefore, is that of mating—the time at which opportunity for coition should be allowed each species; thus, the period from the beginning of the west wind to the vernal equinox<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_323_4" id="target_note_LCL283_323_4"><sup>4</sup></a> is deemed best suited to swine, while that from the setting of Arcturus to the setting of Aquila is considered best for sheep.
