called a villa because cattle are fed and stabled there, for a like reason that also should have the name in which a large revenue is derived from pasturing.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_435_1" id="target_note_LCL283_435_1"><sup>1</sup></a> For if you get a revenue from flocks, what does it matter whether they are flocks of sheep or of birds? Why, is the revenue sweeter on your place from oxen which give birth to bees<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_435_2" id="target_note_LCL283_435_2"><sup>2</sup></a> than it is from the bees which are busy at their task in the hives of Seius’s villa? And do you get more from the butcher for the boars born on your place there than Seius does from the market-man for the wild boars from his place?” “Well,” replied Axius, “what is there to prevent me from keeping these at my villa at Reate?

And that if mast which has to be bought feeds a boar on his place it makes him fat, while that which is had for nothing on my place makes him thin?” Whereupon Appius remarked: “Merula did not say that you could not have husbandry like Seius’s on your place; but I have, with my own eyes, seen that you have not. For there are two kinds of pasturing: one in the fields, which includes cattle-raising, and the other around the farmstead, which includes chickens, pigeons, bees, and the like, which usually feed in the steading; the Carthaginian Mago, Cassius Dionysius, and other writers have left in their books remarks on them, but scattered and unsystematic. These Seius seems to have read, and as a result he gets more revenue from such pasturing out of one villa than others receive from a whole farm.” “You are quite right,” said Merula; “for I have seen there large flocks of geese, chickens, pigeons, cranes, and peafowl, not to speak
