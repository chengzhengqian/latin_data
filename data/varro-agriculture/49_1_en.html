Ploughing should be completed, and it will be more valuable in proportion as it is done in warm ground; if you are ‘breaking up’ the ground it should be crushed, that is, gone over a second time so that the clods may be broken; for in the first ploughing large clods are cut from the ground.

After the winter solstice, unless necessity requires, there should be no sowing—a point of such importance that seeds which, when planted before the solstice, sprout in seven days, hardly sprout in forty if sowed after the solstice. And they hold that sowing should not begin before the equinox, because, if unfavourable seasons follow, the seeds usually rot.
