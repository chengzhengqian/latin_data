Even now there are several species of wild animals in various places: as of sheep in Phrygia, where numerous flocks are seen, and in Samothrace those goats which are called in Latin <span class="italic">rotae<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_315_1" id="target_note_LCL283_315_1"><sup>1</sup></a></span>; for there are many wild goats in Italy in the vicinity of Mount Fiscellum and Mount Tetrica. As to swine, everybody knows—except those who think that wild boars ought not to be called swine. There are even now many quite wild cattle in Dardania, Maedica,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_315_2" id="target_note_LCL283_315_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and Thrace; wild asses in Phrygia and Lycaonia, and wild horses at several points in Hither Spain.</p>

in Libya, from which Hercules brought from Africa to Greece golden <span class="italic">mala,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_315_4" id="target_note_LCL283_315_4"><sup>4</sup></a></span> which is the ancient manner of naming goats and sheep. For the Greeks called these <span class="italic">mela</span> from the sound of their bleating; and in fact our people give them a similar name from the same bleating, but with a different consonant (for the bleating seems to give the sound <span class="italic">be,</span> and not <span class="italic">me</span>), and they call the bleating of sheep <span class="italic">baelare,</span> and hence later, by the excision of a letter, as occurs in many words, <span class="italic">balare.</span> But if the flock had not been held in high honour among the ancients, the
