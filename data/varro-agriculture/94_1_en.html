coast of Italy, derives its name from these. As she-goats which bear twins are of better stock, it is from these, preferably, that the males are usually chosen for service.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_347_1" id="target_note_LCL283_347_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Some owners are even careful to import she-goats from the island Melia,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_347_2" id="target_note_LCL283_347_2"><sup>2</sup></a> because it is thought that the largest and finest kids are produced there.</p>
<p>“With regard to purchase, my rule is different from the usual practice, as no man sound of mind guarantees that goats (which are never free of fever) are sound of body. And so the bargain is struck with only a few exceptions made, after a formula derived from the code of Manilius:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_347_3" id="target_note_LCL283_347_3"><sup>3</sup></a> ‘Do you guarantee that the said goats are to-day in good condition and able to drink, and that the title is in proper form?’ There is a remarkable thing about these animals, and even Archelaus is authority for the statement: some shepherds who have watched quite closely claim that goats do not breathe, as other animals do, through the nostrils, but through the ears.</p>
<p>“Of the other four points, I have this to say with regard to feeding: It is better to have the goat stalls face the sunrise in winter, as the animals feel the cold acutely. Such stalls, and in fact all stalls, should be floored with stone or tile, to prevent the goat-house from being wet and muddy. When they have to spend the night outdoors, their pens should face in the same direction, and they should be bedded down with twigs so that they may not be muddied. The care of this animal in the matter of feeding is about the same as that of the sheep, though each has certain peculiarities; thus, the goat prefers wooded glades to meadows, as it eats eagerly the field bushes and crops the undergrowth on cultivated land. Indeed, their name <span class="italic">oapra</span> is derived from <span class="italic">carpere,</span>
