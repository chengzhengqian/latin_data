<p>And so, in a land where the shepherds who founded the city taught their offspring the cultivation of the earth, there, on the contrary, their descendants, from greed and in the face of the laws, have made pastures out of grain lands<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_309_1" id="target_note_LCL283_309_1"><sup>1</sup></a>—not knowing that agriculture and grazing are not the same thing. For the shepherd is one thing and the ploughman another; and it does not follow that because cattle can graze in a field the herdsman is the same as the ploughman. For grazing cattle do not produce what grows on the land, but tear it off with their teeth; while on the other hand the domestic ox becomes the cause why the grain grows more easily in the ploughed land, and the fodder in the fallow land.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_309_2" id="target_note_LCL283_309_2"><sup>2</sup></a> The skill and knowledge of the farmer, I repeat, are one thing, and those of the herdsman another; in the province of the farmer are those things which are made to spring from the earth by cultivation of the land; in that of the herdsman, however, those that spring from the herd. As the association between them is very close, inasmuch as it is frequently more profitable to the owner of the farm to feed the fodder on the place than to sell it, and inasmuch as manure is admirably adapted to the fruits of the earth, and cattle especially fitted to produce it, one who owns a farm ought to have a knowledge of both pursuits, agriculture and cattle-raising,
and also of the husbandry of the steading. For from it, too, no little revenue can be derived—from
the poultry-yards, the rabbit-hutches, and the fishponds. And since I have written a book<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_309_3" id="target_note_LCL283_309_3"><sup>3</sup></a> for my wife, Fundania, on one of these subjects, that of agriculture, on account of her owning a farm, for you, my dear Turranius Niger, who take keen delight
