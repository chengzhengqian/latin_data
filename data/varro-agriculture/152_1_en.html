rock-pigeon, which lives in turrets and gable-ends (<span class="italic">columina</span>) of the farmhouse—whence the name <span class="italic">columbae</span>—and these, because of their natural shyness, hunt for the highest peak of the roof; hence the wild pigeons chiefly hunt for the turrets, flying into them from the fields and back again, as the fancy takes them. The other species of pigeon is gentler, and being content with the food from the house usually feeds around the doorstep. This species is generally white, while the other, the wild, has no white, but is variously coloured. From these two stocks is bred for profit a third hybrid species; these are put in a place called by some <span class="italic">peristeron</span> and by others <span class="italic">peristerotrophion</span>, and often a single one of these will contain as many as 5,000. The <span class="italic">peristeron</span> is built in the form of a large building, with a vaulted roof; it has one narrow door and windows of the Punic style,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_463_1" id="target_note_LCL283_463_1"><sup>1</sup></a> or wider ones with double lattice-work, so that the whole interior is light, but so that no snake or other noxious creature can get in. The whole of the walls and chambers in the interior is covered with the smoothest possible plaster made of marble dust, and the exterior is also plastered around the windows, so that no mouse or lizard can crawl into the pigeon nests; for nothing is more timid than a pigeon. Round nests are constructed for each pair, side by side in a row, and as many rows as possible are run from the floor up to the vaulted roof. Each nest should be so constructed as to have an opening large enough to allow only entrance and exit, and on the interior should be three palms in all directions. Under each row there should be fixed a board two palms wide, to serve as an entrance and walk-way. Provision should be made for water to flow in, so that
