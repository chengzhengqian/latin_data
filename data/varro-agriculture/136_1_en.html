he added, “isn’t this villa, which our ancestors built, simpler and better than that elaborate villa<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_431_1" id="target_note_LCL283_431_1"><sup>1</sup></a> of yours at Reate? Do you see anywhere here citrus wood or gold, or vermilion or azure, or any coloured<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_431_2" id="target_note_LCL283_431_2"><sup>2</sup></a> or mosaic work? At your place everything is just the opposite. Also, while this villa is the common property of the whole population, that one belongs to you alone; this one is for citizens and other people to come to from the Campus, and that one is for mares and asses; and furthermore, this one is serviceable for the transaction of public business—for the cohorts to assemble when summoned by the consul for a levy, for the inspection of arms, for the censors to convoke the people for the census.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_431_3" id="target_note_LCL283_431_3"><sup>3</sup></a> “Do you really mean,” replied Axius, “that this villa of yours on the edge of the Campus Martius is merely serviceable, and isn’t more lavish in luxuries than all the villas owned by everybody in the whole of Reate?

Further, while that villa is not without its large farm, and one which has been kept clean by tillage, this one of yours has never a field or ox or mare. In short, what has your villa that is like that villa which your grandfather and great-grandfather had? For it has never, as that one did, seen a cured hay harvest in the loft, or a vintage in the cellar, or a grain-harvest in the bins. For the fact that a building is outside the city no more makes it a villa than the same fact makes villas
