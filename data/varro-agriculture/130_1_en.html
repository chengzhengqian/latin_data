<p>In fact, it is claimed that barbers first came to Italy from Sicily 453 years after the founding of the city of Rome<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_419_1" id="target_note_LCL283_419_1"><sup>1</sup></a> (as is recorded still on a public-monument
at Ardea), and that they were introduced by Publius Titinius Mena. That there were no barbers in early days is evident from the statues of the ancients, many of which have long hair and a large beard.”</p>
<p>Cossinius resumed: “As the sheep affords a profit from its wool to be used for clothing, so the goat from her hair is of service for nautical purposes, as well as for military engines and for workmen’s equipment.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_419_2" id="target_note_LCL283_419_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Some barbarous people, too, use their skins for clothing, as, for instance, in Gaetulia and Sardinia. That this usage obtained among the ancient Greeks also is evident from the fact that the old men who appear in the tragedies get their name of <span class="italic">diphtheriae<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_419_3" id="target_note_LCL283_419_3"><sup>3</sup></a></span> from the goat skin, and in the comedies those who are engaged in rustic labour, such as the young man in Caecilius’s <span class="italic">Hypobolimaeus,</span> and the old man in Terence’s <span class="italic">Heautontimorumenos.</span> Because they have long hair, goats are clipped over a large part of Phrygia; and it is from this that hair-cloth (<span class="italic">cilicia</span>) and other fabrics of the kind are made. But it is said that the Cilicians gave the name to it from the fact that this clipping was first practised in Cilicia.”</p>
<p>This was their contribution, and Cossinius found nothing to alter in it. At the same time a freedman of Vitulus, on his way to the city from the park, turned aside to us and said: “I was sent to you, and was on my way to your house to ask you not to make the holiday shorter but to come early.” And so Scrofa and I set out to Vitulus’s place, and the others, my dear Turranius Niger, some for their homes and some to Menates.</p>
