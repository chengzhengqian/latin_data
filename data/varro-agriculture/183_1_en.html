of us is not content with one such pond? Who, on the other hand, who starts with one of the sea-water ponds doesn’t go on to a row of them? For just as Pausias<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_525_1" id="target_note_LCL283_525_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and the other painters of the same school have large boxes with compartments for keeping their pigments of different colours, so these people have ponds with compartments for keeping the varieties of fish separate, as if they were holy and more inviolate than those in Lydia about which, Varro, you used to say that while you were sacrificing, they would come up in schools, at the sound of a flute, to the edge of the shore and the altar, because no one dared catch them (the same time as that at which you saw the ‘dancing islands’ of the Lydians);<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_525_2" id="target_note_LCL283_525_2"><sup>2</sup></a> just so no cook dares ‘haul these fish over the coals.’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_525_3" id="target_note_LCL283_525_3"><sup>3</sup></a> Though our friend Quintus Hortensius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_525_4a" id="target_note_LCL283_525_4a"><sup>4</sup></a> had ponds built at great expense near Bauli, I was at his villa often enough to know that it was his custom always to send to Puteoli to buy fish for dinner.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_525_5" id="target_note_LCL283_525_5"><sup>5</sup></a> And it was not enough for him not to feed from his ponds—nay,
he must feed his fish with his own hands; and he actually took more pains to keep his mullets from getting hungry than I do to keep my mules at Rosea from getting hungry, and indeed he furnished them nourishment in the way of both food and drink much more generously than I do in caring for my donkeys. For I keep my very valuable asses with the help of a single stable-boy, a bit of barley, and water
