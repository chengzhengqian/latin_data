<p>“It remains to speak of the science of animal husbandry, and our friend, Scrofa,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_319_3" id="target_note_LCL283_319_3"><sup>3</sup></a> to whom this generation presents the palm in all agricultural matters, and who is therefore better fitted, will discuss it.” When the eyes of all were turned on him Scrofa began:—“Well, there is a science of assembling and feeding cattle in such fashion as to secure the greatest returns from them; the very word for money is derived from them, for cattle<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_319_4" id="target_note_LCL283_319_4"><sup>4</sup></a> are the basis of all wealth. The science embraces nine divisions under three topics of three divisions each: the topic of the smaller animals, with its three divisions, sheep, goats, swine; the second topic, that of the larger animals, with likewise its three classes naturally separate, oxen, asses, horses. The third topic comprises animals which are kept not for the profit derived from them, but for the purpose of the above groups, or as a result of them, mules, dogs, and herdsmen. Each one of these divisions includes at least nine general subdivisions; and of these four are necessarily involved in assembling and an equal number in feeding; while one is common to both. There are, then, at the lowest 81 subdivisions, all of them important and not one insignificant.
