One who wants to set up a poultry-farm<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_471_4" id="target_note_LCL283_471_4"><sup>4</sup></a> of these—that is, wants to gain a large profit by the exercise of knowledge and care, as the Delians<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_471_5" id="target_note_LCL283_471_5"><sup>5</sup></a> generally have done—should observe especially the following five points: purchase, including the breed and number to secure; breeding, including the manner of mating and laying; eggs, including the manner of sitting and hatching; chicks, including the manner of rearing and the birds by which they are reared; and to these is added, as an appendix, the fifth topic—the method of fattening. Of the three species, the proper name for the female of the barn-yard fowl is hen, for the male is cock, while that of the half-males, which have been castrated, is capon. Cocks are castrated, to make them capons, by burning with a red-hot iron at the lowest part of the leg until it bursts;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_471_6" id="target_note_LCL283_471_6"><sup>6</sup></a> and the sore which results is smeared with potter’s clay. One who intends to have a complete poultry-farm should, of course, procure all three species, but chiefly the barn-yard fowls. In buying these he should choose hens which are prolific, usually of a reddish plumage, with black wing feathers, toes of uneven length, large heads, upright crest, full-bodied, as these are better fitted for laying.
