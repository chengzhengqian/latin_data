will not tell you that he would as soon have his pond full of frogs as of such fish as these? You remember that Philippus once, when he had turned aside to visit his friend Ummidius at Casinum, was served with a fine pike from your river; he tasted it, spat it out, and exclaimed: I’ll be hanged if I didn’t think it was fish!’ So our generation, with the same extravagance with which it extended the boundaries of its warrens, has thrust its fish-ponds to the sea, and has brought into them whole schools of deep-sea fish.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_445_1" id="target_note_LCL283_445_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Was it not from these that Sergius Orata (Goldfish) and Licinius Murena (‘Lamprey’) got their names?

<p> “There are,” resumed Merula, “two kinds of <span class="italic">ornithon;</span> one merely for pleasure, such as our friend Varro has built near Casinum, which has found many admirers, and the other for profit. Of the latter class are the enclosures which those who supply fowl for the market keep, some in the city, others in the country; especially the leased enclosures in the Sabine district, as, because of the nature of the country, large flocks of fieldfares are found there.
