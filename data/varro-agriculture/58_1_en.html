were imported into Italy. For a similar reason, the seed of the olive being a nut, we prefer to plant in our nurseries the cuttings which I have described, as the stem was found to spring more slowly from the olive nut than from others.</p>
<p>XLII. “Be especially careful not to plant in ground that is very dry or very wet, but rather in moderately moist ground. Authorities state that the proper amount of alfalfa is a modius and a half to the iugerum, if the ground is by nature moderately moist; the method of sowing is to broadcast the seed, as is done in sowing forage crops and grain.</p>
<p>XLIII. “Snail-clover is sowed on land that has been thoroughly worked, like cabbage seed; then it is transplanted at intervals of a foot and a half, or, when the plant is more mature, shoots are detached, and it is set out in planting as above.</p>
<p>XLIV. “Beans are sowed 4 modii to the iugerum, wheat 5, barley 6, spelt 10, the amount being a little more or less in some localities; more being sowed on rich ground and less on thin. You should therefore note the amount that is usually sowed in the district and follow this practice; for the locality and the type of soil is so important that the same seed in one district yields tenfold and in another fifteen-fold—as at some places in Etruria. Around Sybaris in Italy the normal yield is said to be even a hundred to one, and a like yield is reported near Gadara<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_275_1" id="target_note_LCL283_275_1"><sup>1</sup></a> in Syria, and for the district of Byzacium<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_275_2" id="target_note_LCL283_275_2"><sup>2</sup></a> in Africa. It also makes a great difference whether the planting is on virgin soil or on what is called <span class="italic">restibilis</span>—land cultivated every year—or on <span class="italic">vervactum</span>,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_275_3" id="target_note_LCL283_275_3"><sup>3</sup></a> which is allowed sometimes to lie fallow between crops.” “In Olynthia” remarked Agrius, “they say that the land
