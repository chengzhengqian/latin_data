as you all seem to be looking to me, and I shall speak of the earliest branch of animal husbandry, as you claim that sheep were the first of the wild animals to be caught and tamed by man. The first consideration is that these be in good condition when purchased; with respect to age that they be neither too old nor mere lambs, the latter being not yet, and the former no longer profitable—though the age which is followed by hope is better than the one which is followed by death. As to form,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_333_1" id="target_note_LCL283_333_1"><sup>1</sup></a> sheep should be full-bodied, with abundant soft fleece, with fibres long and thick over the whole body, especially about the shoulders and neck, and should have a shaggy belly also. In fact, sheep which did not have this our ancestors called ‘bald’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_333_2" id="target_note_LCL283_333_2"><sup>2</sup></a> (<span class="italic">apicas</span>), and would have none of them. The legs should be short; and observe that the tail should be long in Italy but short in Syria. The most important point to watch is to have a flock<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_333_3" id="target_note_LCL283_333_3"><sup>3</sup></a> from good stock. This can usually be judged by two points—the form and the progeny; by the form if the rams have a full coating of fleece on the forehead, have flat horns curving towards the muzzle, grey eyes, and ears overgrown with wool; if they are full-bodied, with wide chest, shoulders, and hindquarters, and a wide, long tail. A black or spotted tongue is also to be avoided, for rams with such a tongue usually beget black or spotted lambs.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_333_4" id="target_note_LCL283_333_4"><sup>4</sup></a> The stock is determined by the progeny if they beget handsome lambs. In purchasing we take advantage of the variation which the law allows, some making more and others fewer exceptions; thus, some purchasers, when the price is fixed by the head, stipulate that two late-born lambs count as one sheep, and in the case of those which have lost their teeth from age,
