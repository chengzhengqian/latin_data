<p>On all sides there was unanimous criticism of the Aetolians, and the Roman commander declared that he would have given them a reply had he not seen all the delegates so opposed to them that they needed to be mollified rather than provoked. He was, he said, content with the opinions expressed about the Romans and the Aetolians, and he was now laying before them the question of what their pleasure would be with regard to a war with Nabis if he refused to return Argos to the Achaeans.
