day. These towns were to be handed over to the Romans free of troops and under no constraint, and with no slave removed, whether he belonged to the king,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL295_525_99" id="target_note_LCL295_525_99"><sup>99</sup></a> the state, or an individual (and with any slaves formerly removed being duly restored to their owners).</p>
<p>Nabis was to return the vessels that he had appropriated from the coastal communities and himself retain no ship apart from two cutters that were propelled by no more than sixteen oars.</p>
<p>He was to restore deserters and prisoners of war to all city-states allied to the Roman people, and also give back to the Messenians any property that was found and its owners recognized.</p>
<p>He was also to return to exiled Spartans their children and wives, but only those wives willing to follow their husbands, with no woman involuntarily accompanying an exile.</p>
<p>All possessions were to be duly returned to mercenaries of Nabis who had deserted either to their own city-states or to the Romans.</p>
<p>Nabis was to hold no city on the island of Crete and was to hand over to the Romans those that he had occupied.</p>
<p>He was to enter into no alliance and wage no war with any of the peoples of Crete or any other people at all.</p>
<p>With respect to all the city-states that he himself had surrendered or had delivered themselves and their possessions to the protection and authority of the Roman people, Nabis was to withdraw all his garrisons from them, and keep his own hands, and those of his allies, off them in future.</p>
