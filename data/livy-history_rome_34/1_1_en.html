<p class="noindent">1. Amid concerns over serious wars that were either barely terminated or else looming on the horizon there occurred an event that was insignificant for the record but which led to acrimonious debate with the passions it aroused. The plebeian tribunes Marcus Fundanius and Lucius Valerius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL295_425_1" id="target_note_LCL295_425_1"><sup>1</sup></a> brought before the popular assembly a proposal to annul the Oppian law.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL295_425_2" id="target_note_LCL295_425_2"><sup>2</sup></a> The law had been enacted by the plebeian tribune Gaius Oppius in the consulship of Quintus Fabius and Tiberius Sempronius,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL295_425_3" id="target_note_LCL295_425_3"><sup>3</sup></a> when the flames of the Punic War were burning fiercely; and its provisions were that no woman was to own more than a half-ounce of gold, wear colored clothes,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL295_425_4" id="target_note_LCL295_425_4"><sup>4</sup></a> or ride a horse and carriage in the city or a town, or within a mile of a town, except to attend public religious rites.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL295_425_5" id="target_note_LCL295_425_5"><sup>5</sup></a> The plebeian tribunes Marcus and Publius Iunius Brutus defended the Oppian law and said they would not permit its repeal; many eminent men came forward to speak for or against its annulment; and the Capitol was filled with hordes of the law’s supporters and opponents.</p>
