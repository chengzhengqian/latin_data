from Antiochus the cities of Asia that are of Greek stock. For colonies were not sent out to Aeolis and Ionia to be slaves of a king but rather to increase the Greek race and spread this ancient people throughout the world.”</p>

Hegesianax was in a quandary; he could not deny that a more honorable front was provided by the label “freedom” than “slavery.” “Enough of all this beating about the bush,” said Publius Sulpicius, who was the eldest of the ten commissioners. “Choose one of the two conditions eloquently laid down by Quinctius just now, or else stop talking about a treaty of friendship.” “In fact,” replied Menippus, “we have neither the wish nor the power to make any agreement by which Antiochus’ regal power may be diminished.”</p>
<p>The next day Quinctius brought before the senate all the deputations from Greece and Asia so they could see the attitude of the Roman people and that of Antiochus toward the city-states of Greece, and he presented the demands of the king as well as his own. The envoys were to report back to their governments that if Antiochus did not quit Europe the Roman people would champion their states’ liberty from him with the same courage and loyalty as they had from Philip. At this Menippus proceeded to entreat both Quinctius and the senators not to rush into a decision by which they would shake the entire world. He should allow both himself and the king time to reflect, he said; the king would reflect when the conditions were reported to him and would either gain some concessions or else make some for the sake of peace. And so the whole question was shelved. It was decided that the envoys to be sent to the king would be those who had been with him at Lysimachia: Publius Sulpicius, Publius Villius, and Publius Aelius.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL295_581_163" id="target_note_LCL295_581_163"><sup>163</sup></a></p>
