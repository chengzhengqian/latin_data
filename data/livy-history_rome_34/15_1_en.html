En masse they all blockaded the doors of the Bruti, who were for vetoing the proposal of their colleagues, and they did not give up until the veto they had threatened was withdrawn by the tribunes. After that there was no question but that all the tribes<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL295_453_30" id="target_note_LCL295_453_30"><sup>30</sup></a> would repeal the law. And twenty years after it was passed, the law was repealed.</p>
<p>After the repeal of the Oppian law, the consul Marcus Porcius immediately left for the port of Luna<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL295_453_31" id="target_note_LCL295_453_31"><sup>31</sup></a> with twenty-five warships, five of them belonging to the allies. He had earlier ordered the army to muster at the same place and by an edict relayed along the coastline had also assembled here ships of all kinds. Setting out from Luna he issued instructions for these ships to attend him to the port of Pyrenaeus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL295_453_32" id="target_note_LCL295_453_32"><sup>32</sup></a> saying that he would proceed against the enemy from there with his fleet united.

From Rhoda they came with a favorable wind to Emporiae,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL295_453_35a" id="target_note_LCL295_453_35a"><sup>35</sup></a> and there the entire force, with the exception of the crews, was set ashore.</p>
