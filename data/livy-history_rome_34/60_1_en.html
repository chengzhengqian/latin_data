<p>When the matter of the provinces was raised, a full house of the senate decided that the two consuls should have Italy as theirs since the wars in Spain and Macedonia were now finished. Scipio expressed the opinion that one consul was sufficient for Italy and that Macedonia should be officially mandated to the other. A momentous war with Antiochus was impending, he said, and Antiochus had already himself crossed to Europe on his own initiative.
