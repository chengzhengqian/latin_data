Quinctius, not unaware that such was their thinking, declared that he would have been duty bound not to entertain any suggestion of peace with the tyrant had that been possible without the destruction of Sparta. As it was, he said, Nabis could not be crushed without the ruin of a very important city-state, and it therefore seemed better for the tyrant to be left in place, crippled and with almost all his power to harm anyone wrested from him. Rather that than to allow the state to die from remedies too drastic for her to bear, and see it destroyed in the very act of claiming its freedom.</p>
<p>He added to his account of past events the comment that he intended to leave for Italy and take all of his army with him. Within ten days they would hear of the withdrawal of the garrisons of Demetrias and Chalcis, and he would immediately, and before their very eyes, hand Acrocorinth over to the Achaeans free of troops.

Liberty they should use judiciously, he said.
