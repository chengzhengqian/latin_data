Many were attributed to Servius Tullius, the penultimate king (traditionally, 578–535), though most probably belong to the fourth century. But the argument here is specious in any case, as the Spartan (Lycurgan) system, to which Nabis refers, rested on suppression of the helots and Messenians.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL295_511_90').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
