<p>“There are indeed laws that are not temporary measures but enacted to stand for ever because of their continued practicality. I myself grant that none of these should be repealed, unless experience demonstrates it to be ineffective or some political situation renders it impractical. But I also see that there are some laws that have been required by temporary emergencies, mortal laws, as it were, which can change as circumstances themselves change. Measures passed in peacetime are often annulled in time of war, and those passed in war are often annulled in peace. It is like steering a ship, for which some maneuvers are useful in fair weather, others in foul.</p>
<p>“Legal measures falling by nature into two categories, to which class then does this law that we wish to repeal seem to belong? Is it a law of the kings, born when the city itself was born, or (next to that) was it inscribed on the Twelve Tables by the decemvirs appointed to establish our legal code?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL295_445_22" id="target_note_LCL295_445_22"><sup>22</sup></a> In that case it was a law without which our forefathers thought the dignity of married women could not be protected, and we should also be concerned that in annulling it we might be annulling the modesty and purity of womanhood. But who does not know that the law is a new one, passed twenty years ago in the consulship of Quintus Fabius and Tiberius Sempronius? Since our married women lived without it for many years with the highest morals, what danger is there that they will lapse into extravagant living if it is repealed? If the purpose of that legislation had been specifically to repress female passions, then we ought to fear that its annulment would actually kindle them; but its very date will reveal why it was passed.</p>
