<p>After the defeat of the Boii near the forest of Litana,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL295_541_111" id="target_note_LCL295_541_111"><sup>111</sup></a> the consul Lucius Valerius had peace in his province. He returned to Rome for the elections and declared Publius Cornelius Scipio Africanus and Titus Sempronius Longus elected consuls (Scipio for the second time).<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL295_541_112" id="target_note_LCL295_541_112"><sup>112</sup></a> The fathers of these men had been consuls in the first year of the Second Punic War.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL295_541_113" id="target_note_LCL295_541_113"><sup>113</sup></a></p>
<p>The praetorian elections were then held; those elected were Publius Cornelius Scipio, the two Gnaei Cornelii (Merenda and Blasio), Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus, Sextus Digitius, and Titus Iuventius Thalna. At the end of the elections the consul returned to his province.</p>
<p>That year the people of Ferentinum attempted to secure a new legal prerogative: that Latins who had merely submitted their names for membership in a Roman colony should become Roman citizens. Those who had submitted their names for Puteoli, Salernum, and Buxentum<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL295_541_114" id="target_note_LCL295_541_114"><sup>114</sup></a> were enrolled as colonists, and because of this they comported themselves as if they were Roman citizens. The senate adjudged that they were not Roman citizens.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL295_541_115" id="target_note_LCL295_541_115"><sup>115</sup></a></p>
<p>43. At the beginning of the year when Publius Scipio Africanus and Tiberius Sempronius Longus were consuls (Scipio for the second time) envoys came to Rome from the tyrant Nabis. They were given an audience with the senate outside the city in the temple of Apollo.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL295_541_116a" id="target_note_LCL295_541_116a"><sup>116</sup></a> They asked for ratification of the peace treaty that had been concluded with Titus Quinctius, and their request was granted.</p>
