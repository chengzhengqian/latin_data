Then word spread abroad that the consul was going to lead his army into Turdetania,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL295_473_57" id="target_note_LCL295_473_57"><sup>57</sup></a> and there was even a false report that he had already begun to march against the remote mountain peoples. In response to this empty and groundless rumor seven fortified towns in the state of the Bergistani rebelled. The consul brought his army to the area and subdued them once more without a fight of any note. Not much later there was a second revolt of the same peoples, after the consul’s return to Tarraco and before he left again.
