Land that had belonged to the Campanians was divided among the colonists. A second board of triumvirs, comprising Decimus Iunius Brutus, Marcus Baebius Tamphilus, and Marcus Helvius, also founded a colony of Roman citizens at Sipontum,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL295_547_128" id="target_note_LCL295_547_128"><sup>128</sup></a> on land that had belonged to the Arpini.

The land at Tempsa had been captured from the Bruttii—the Bruttii had driven out the Greeks—and Croton had been inhabited by Greeks. The founding triumvirs for Croton were Gnaeus Octavius, Lucius Aemilius Paullus and Gaius Laetorius; for Tempsa they were Lucius Cornelius Merula, Quintus . . . ,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL295_547_130" id="target_note_LCL295_547_130"><sup>130</sup></a> and Gaius Salonius.</p>
