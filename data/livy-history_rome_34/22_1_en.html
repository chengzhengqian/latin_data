Thinking the Romans had lost their nerve and were in retreat, the Spaniards burst forth from their gate and filled the area between their camp and their enemyâ€™s battle line with armed men. As they scrambled to deploy their formation, the consul, who had everything ready and in order, attacked them while they in disarray. He first of all led the cavalry into the fight on both wings.
