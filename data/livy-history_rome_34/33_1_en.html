theirs on Philip’s defeat. Alexander further accused the Romans of duplicity. They were occupying Chalcis and Demetrias with their garrisons after bandying about the empty term “freedom”—and it was they who had persistently criticized Philip when he hesitated to withdraw his garrisons from those towns, saying that Greece would never be free as long as Demetrias, Chalcis, and Corinth<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL295_489_70" id="target_note_LCL295_489_70"><sup>70</sup></a> were occupied. And finally, he said, they were making Argos and Nabis a pretext for staying in Greece and keeping their armies there. Let them take their legions back to Italy, he concluded—the Aetolians guaranteed that Nabis would either withdraw his garrison from Argos on their terms and according to their wishes or they would oblige him by force of arms to accept the authority of a united Greece.</p>

<p>“May Jupiter Optimus Maximus not permit it to come to pass,” he said, “nor Queen Juno in whose protection Argos lies, that the city should become a prize set between a Spartan tyrant and Aetolian bandits, in danger of suffering more from being recovered by you than it did from its capture by Nabis! A sea lies between us but it does not protect us from those marauders, Titus Quinctius. What will become of us if they establish a citadel for themselves in the heart of the Peloponnese? The only Greek feature they possess is the language, just as their only human one is their shape! They live with customs and practices more barbaric than those of any foreigners—no, more barbaric than those of beasts of the wild. We therefore ask you, Romans, to recover Argos from Nabis and also to settle matters in Greece in such a fashion as to leave these areas untroubled by the depredations of the Aetolians, as well.”</p>
