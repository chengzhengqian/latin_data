force of sailors drawn from three fleets completed in a matter of days all the preparations that had to be made for an assault upon a city defended by land and sea. The tortoise formations<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL295_505_85" id="target_note_LCL295_505_85"><sup>85</sup></a> were brought up, and soon a start was made on undermining the wall, which was also pounded by the battering rams. One of the towers was demolished by the repeated blows and by its collapse the adjacent section of the wall was also brought down. The Romans thereupon attempted to break through from the direction of the harbor (from which access lay along more even ground) in order to divert the enemy from more vulnerable spots and at the same time to burst in where a path had been opened up by the breach. They were not far from gaining entry at the designated point, but their momentum was slowed when they were offered hope of the cityâ€™s surrender, a hope that was soon frustrated.</p>
<p>Dexagoridas and Gorgopas had joint command of the city. Dexagoridas had sent word to the Roman legate that he would deliver the town. Then, after the timing and procedure for this had been settled, the traitor was killed by Gorgopas and the city was defended with greater energy by the one commander. In fact, the assault on Gytheum would have been more difficult had not Titus Quinctius appeared with 4,000 elite troops. When he had exposed his battle line to view drawn up on the brow of a hill not far distant from the city, while on the other side Lucius Quinctius was piling on the pressure from his siege works on land and sea, desperation then obliged Gorgopas also to adopt the strategy for which he had actually punished the other commander with death. After striking a bargain to be allowed to take away the soldiers he had there serving as a garrison, he delivered the city to Quinctius.
