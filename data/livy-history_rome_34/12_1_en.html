<p>“Hannibal was in Italy, the victor at Cannae. He now held Tarentum, Arpi, and Capua.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL295_447_23" id="target_note_LCL295_447_23"><sup>23</sup></a> It looked as if he was going to move his army up to the city of Rome; the allies had deserted us; we had no soldiers in reserve, no sailors<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL295_447_24" id="target_note_LCL295_447_24"><sup>24</sup></a> to maintain the fleet, and no money in the treasury. Slaves were being bought up to be put under arms on the understanding that their masters would be paid for them when the war was finished. With that same date fixed also for their payment, contractors offered to provide wheat and the other things needed for the conduct of the war. At our </p>
<p class="noindent">own expense we supplied slaves to act as oarsmen, their number being dependent on our tax assessment. We, following the lead of the senators, contributed all our gold and silver to the public weal, and widows and orphans contributed their money to the treasury. There was a provision against our having at home more than a fixed quantity of wrought gold and silver, and of silver and bronze coin. At a time like that were married women so preoccupied with extravagant living and clothing that an Oppian law was needed to repress this tendency—a time when the ceremonies in honor of Ceres were suspended because all the married women were in mourning, and the senate decreed that the period of mourning be limited to thirty days? No, who cannot see that it was financial exigency and the miseries suffered by our state that drafted that law—because the moneys of all private individuals had to be diverted to public use—and that the law was intended to last only as long as the reason for its drafting remained with us? If measures that were at that point decreed by the senate or dictated by the people to meet a temporary crisis must be kept in force for ever, then why do we repay loans to private citizens? Why do we tender public contracts
