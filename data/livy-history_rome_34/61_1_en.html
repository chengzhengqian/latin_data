had not been followed, and the senators accordingly voted that the ceremony be repeated under the direction of the pontiffs. They also voted that the Great Games, which had been promised in a vow at the same time as the Sacred Spring,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL295_545_119" id="target_note_LCL295_545_119"><sup>119</sup></a> be celebrated with the usual level of expenditure. It was further decided that the Sacred Spring applied to all animals born between March 1st and April 30th in the consulship of Publius Cornelius and Tiberius Sempronius.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL295_545_120" id="target_note_LCL295_545_120"><sup>120</sup></a></p>
<p>The election of the censors came next.

They rejected, in all, three senators, none of whom had held a curule office. They won enormous gratitude from the senatorial class by ordering the curule aediles to separate senatorial seating from the public at the Roman Games;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL295_545_122" id="target_note_LCL295_545_122"><sup>122</sup></a> before that there had been mixed seating for spectators. Very few equestrians had their horses confiscated, and no class was severely treated. The Hall of Freedom and the Public Villa<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL295_545_123" id="target_note_LCL295_545_123"><sup>123</sup></a> were restored and extended by these same censors.</p>
