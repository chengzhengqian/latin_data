<p>Blandus said: “Let <span class="italic">him</span> first fill in Athos and<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">7</span><span class="br"></span> restore the sea to its old appearance.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_559_1" id="target_note_LCL464_559_1"><sup>1</sup></a> He wants to appear to posterity as he was when he came; let him appear as he was when he went back.”</p>
<p>Triarius rejected all division, merely exulting that Xerxes was heard to be on his way: a new victory, fresh trophies were at hand.</p>
<p>Pompeius Silo used a pretty type of epigram: “‘Unless you remove the trophies I shall come.’ What Xerxes means is: ‘Unless you remove these trophies, you will have others to put up.’”</p>
<p>The other side was declaimed only by Gallio; in<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">8</span><span class="br"></span> advising them to remove the trophies, he said that this was no detraction from their glory. The memory of their victory was eternal and would remain. Trophies themselves are worn by weather and the passage of time. War had had to be undertaken in the past in defence of freedom, of wives and children;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_559_2" id="target_note_LCL464_559_2"><sup>2</sup></a> it should not now be undertaken for the sake of something of no consequence, whose absence would do no harm. Here he said that Xerxes would come in any case, and he described him as swelling with pride against the very gods. Then, Xerxes had great power; he had not brought all his forces to Greece, nor had he lost them all in Greece. The mutability of fortune was to be feared. The strength of Greece was exhausted, and could not now withstand a second war, while Xerxes had an unmeasured multitude. At this point he spoke a most eloquent epigram, that deserved to find a place in oratory or history: “<span class="italic">They</span> can go on dying for longer than <span class="italic">we</span> can go on winning.”</p>
