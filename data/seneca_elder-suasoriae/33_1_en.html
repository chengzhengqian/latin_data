bustling about one head! They announce the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> future. Many, according to them, will live long—yet
their day has come suddenly upon them when they feared nothing. To others they have assigned an imminent end—yet they have survived to draw breath that brings them no profit. They have promised fortunate years to the new-born—yet Fortune has hurried to do them every injury. For the destiny under which we live is uncertain. These are fictions devised for individuals as a show of cleverness, not from any belief in them.—Shall there be one place in the whole world that has not seen you victorious? Is Babylon closed for the man to whom the Ocean stood open?</p>

<p>In this <span class="italic">suasoria</span> Fuscus, I know, dealt with nothing<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span> else besides the questions related above about knowledge of the future. I cannot pass over something that gave us pleasure. Fuscus had once declaimed the <span class="italic">controversia</span> on the woman who after she had had three stillborn babies said she had dreamed of giving birth in a grove. I should be insulting you if &lt;I expounded&gt; the whole <span class="italic">controversia,</span> for I know &lt;you are familiar with it&gt;. Fuscus’ declamation was on the side of the grandfather who would not recognise the son. Developing the commonplace against dreams and divine providence, he said that anyone who sent the gods out to minister at childbirths was undervaluing their greatness. And amid loud applause he recited the line of Virgil:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_549_1" id="target_note_LCL464_549_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line indent1">“Naturally that is a task for the gods, that is a care</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent1">That troubles them in their calm.”</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
