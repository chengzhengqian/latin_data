to avoid the fate of the Athenians on one occasion, when their publicly expressed blandishments were not only detected but punished. For Antony once<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_495_1" id="target_note_LCL464_495_1"><sup>1</sup></a> wanted to be known as Father Liber, ordering this name to be inscribed on the base of statues to him and aping Liber in his dress and attendants. Athenians came to him on his arrival with their wives and children, and saluted him as Dionysus. It would have been better for them if their Attic wit had stopped there. But they went on to say that they were offering him their Minerva in marriage, and asked him to marry her. Antony said that he would do so, but that as dowry he ordered them to contribute a thousand talents. Then one of the Greeklings said: “Lord, Zeus took your mother Semele without a dowry.” He got away with that; but the Athenians’ betrothal cost them a thousand talents. When the sum was demanded, several abusive lampoons were put about, and some even reached the eyes of Antony himself: for example the one written on the base of a statue of his because he had both Octavia and Cleopatra to wife: “Octavia and Athena to Antony: take your property.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_495_2" id="target_note_LCL464_495_2"><sup>2</sup></a> The best thing was said by<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">7</span><span class="br"></span> Dellius. He was called by Messala Corvinus the “vaulter” of the civil wars,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_495_3" id="target_note_LCL464_495_3"><sup>3</sup></a> because he deserted from Dolabella to Cassius on the promise of immunity if he killed Dolabella, then crossed from Cassius to Antony, and finally went over from Antony to Caesar.
