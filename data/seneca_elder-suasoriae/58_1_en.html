Pompey, father and son, Afranius, Petreius, Catulus, Marcus Antonius (who did not deserve such a successor to his name); if he is reprieved, he will live alongside men like Ventidius, Canidius and Saxa. Can there then be any doubt whether it is preferable to lie dead with those or live with these?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_599_1" id="target_note_LCL464_599_1"><sup>1</sup></a>—You are purchasing the life of one man at the cost of a public loss.—I know that any price fixed by that man is unfair; I am not prepared to buy Cicero’s life at a price asked by Antony. If these were the terms he offered: “You shall live—but your eyes will be gouged out: you shall live—but your feet will be crippled”—even if you were ready to tolerate other mutilations, you would have made an exception of your tongue. What has become of that revered phrase of yours: “For to die is the end granted by nature, not a punishment”?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_599_2" id="target_note_LCL464_599_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Are <span class="italic">you</span> the only man who does not realise its obvious truth? You may think you have persuaded Antony. Claim your freedom, rather, and let your enemy have one crime the more; die—and make Antony the guiltier.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_599_3" id="target_note_LCL464_599_3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

The restoration of Pompey and Cato and the old senate of republican days, worthiest audience for Cicero?—Many who have been prepared to pay a high price for their lives have been crushed by those who despised their lack of spirit; many on the point of death have been rescued by the very admiration felt for a brave man ready to perish—they lived because they faced death
