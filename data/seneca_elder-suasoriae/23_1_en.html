thing that was big, he was given a cognomen (or, as Messala puts it, a <span class="italic">cognomentum</span>),<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_529_1" id="target_note_LCL464_529_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and came to be known as Seneca Grandio. Once when I was a youth, during this <span class="italic">suasoria,</span> after posing the objection “But the Greek contingents have all fled,” he raised his hands, stood on tip-toe (as he normally did in his desire to get bigger)<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_529_2a" id="target_note_LCL464_529_2a"><sup>2</sup></a> and shouted: “I am glad, I am glad!” We wondered what good fortune could have befallen him. Then he added: “Xerxes will be all mine.” He also said: “A man who has stolen the seas with his fleets, who has set a limit to the earth, while extending the deep, who orders nature to put on a new look, can certainly fortify his camp against the sky: I shall have the gods in the ranks with me.”</p>
<p>Saenianus said, much more forcefully: “He besieges<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">18</span><span class="br"></span> land with arms, heaven with arrows, seas with chains.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_529_3" id="target_note_LCL464_529_3"><sup>3</sup></a> Unless you go to the rescue, Spartans, the universe is at his feet.”</p>
<p>I will tell you a foolish epigram of a very decadent nature spoken by my fellow townsman Statorius Victor (his plays are noteworthy and may give some people pleasure). When this <span class="italic">suasoria</span> came up, he put forward the objection: “But there are only three hundred of us.” His reply was: “Three hundred, yes—but men, but armed, but Spartans, but at Thermopylae; I have never seen three hundred so numerous.”</p>
