citizen now. <span class="italic">I</span> am pretty sure of the character of the man; he will do it, he will beg pardon. As to slavery, he will not refuse it; his neck is already worn—Pompey
and Caesar have broken him in: you see before you an experienced slave.” And, as usual, he had many other jeers to make.</p>
<p>His division was: if Cicero were to beg pardon, he<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">13</span><span class="br"></span> would do so with honour and with success. In the first section he placed the point that there is nothing shameful in the defeated begging pardon of a victorious fellow-citizen. Here he observed how many had begged pardon of Julius Caesar, for instance Ligarius. Nor, again, was it unfair that Cicero should make amends: he had been the first to proscribe Antony and dub him public enemy. Making amends should always start with the man on the defensive; let Cicero pluck up his courage—and ask. Again, he would not be pleading for his own life but for the republic.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_575_1" id="target_note_LCL464_575_1"><sup>1</sup></a> He had lived long enough for himself—but not long enough for Rome. In the second section he said enemies are often won over; Cicero had been won over and had defended Vatinius.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_575_2" id="target_note_LCL464_575_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Antony could be won over more easily; being only one of three, he would not want one of the other two to snatch from him so splendid an opportunity for clemency. Perhaps Antony was angry with Cicero for not thinking him worth begging. He described<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">14</span><span class="br"></span> how dangerous flight was, adding that Cicero must be a slave wherever he went: he had to put up with either Cassius’ violence, Brutus’ hauteur or Pompey’s stupidity.</p>
