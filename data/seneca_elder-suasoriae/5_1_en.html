tradition particularly proud, puffed up beyond mortal standards. Finally, leaving aside other proofs, the terms of the <span class="italic">suasoria</span> in themselves demonstrate his arrogance; the world that is his is not enough for him.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_493_1" id="target_note_LCL464_493_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Cestius accordingly used to say that nothing should be said that did not show the highest respect towards the king, in case the speaker should meet with the same fate as Alexander’s tutor, a cousin of Aristotle,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_493_2a" id="target_note_LCL464_493_2a"><sup>2</sup></a> whom the king killed because of a witticism that was both outspoken and untimely. Alexander wanted to be regarded as god; once he was wounded, and, seeing his blood, the tutor said he was surprised that it was not the “ichor, such as flows in the veins of the blessed gods.” Alexander used the spear to get revenge for this joke.</p>
<p>The point is neatly made in a letter of Cassius to Cicero:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_493_3" id="target_note_LCL464_493_3"><sup>3</sup></a> after a good deal of pleasantry about the stupidity of the young Pompey, who recruited an army in Spain and was defeated at the battle of Munda, he says: “Here we are deriding him—but I’m afraid he may have his sneer back—with his sword.” In dealings with every king, one has to be shy of this sort of wit.</p>
<p>Cestius, then, used to say that in Alexander’s<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">6</span><span class="br"></span> presence one’s opinion must be given in such a way that his feelings were soothed by lavish flattery, though some moderation must be preserved so as to give an impression not of flattery but of due respect,
