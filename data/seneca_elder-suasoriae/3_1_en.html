<p><span class="sc">Albucius Silus.</span> Even the earth has its end; the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> very universe has its setting. Nothing is infinite. <span class="italic">You</span> must give greatness its limits, seeing that Fortune does not.—It is the sign of a great spirit to be moderate in prosperity.—Fortune makes the limit of your victories the same as the limit of nature: your empire is closed by the Ocean.—How far has your greatness surpassed even nature! Alexander is great for the earth: for Alexander the earth is cramped.—Even
greatness has some end; the heavens do not proceed beyond their fixed limits, the seas toss within their bounds.—Whatever has reached its peak leaves no room for increase.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_489_1" id="target_note_LCL464_489_1"><sup>1</sup></a>—We know nothing beyond Alexander, just as we know nothing beyond Ocean.</p>

Look how the sea rages with squalls and waves, look at the breakers it drives shorewards: such is the conflict of the winds, such the raving of a sea churned up from its depths. Sailors have here no ready haven, nothing to save them, nothing they know. All that is primitive and incomplete in nature
