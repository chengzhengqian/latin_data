judgement on the shame of flight by so long refusing to flee.—Every
city has its claim to fame: Athens is celebrated for eloquence, Thebes for religious ritual, Sparta for war.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_515_1" id="target_note_LCL464_515_1"><sup>1</sup></a> That is why the Eurotas river flows around Sparta, the river that hardens our children to withstand soldiering later. That is why the wooded ridges of Taygetus are so difficult of access—for all except Spartans. That is why we boast of Hercules, the god who deserved heaven by his deeds.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_515_2" id="target_note_LCL464_515_2"><sup>2</sup></a> That is why our walls are our weapons.—Weighty is the disgrace<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">6</span><span class="br"></span> brought on our ancestors’ bravery!—Spartans thinking of their numbers, not their valour.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_515_3a" id="target_note_LCL464_515_3a"><sup>3</sup></a>—Let us see how big the enemy host is: Sparta should at least have truthful messengers, if it cannot have brave soldiers.—Are we then conquered not by force of arms but by a message? If Spartans cannot bear the news of his coming, how right he was to despise everything!—If it is not ours to beat Xerxes, let it be ours to see him; I want to know what I am fleeing.—Up
to now, I am in no respect like the Athenians, in walls or in upbringing. Am I to start by imitating their flight?</p>

[We shall be the most fugitive among the brave—and the most tardy among the fugitives.]<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_515_4" id="target_note_LCL464_515_4"><sup>4</sup></a> It makes no difference how great are the nations that the East has poured into our part of the world, how many peoples Xerxes drags along with him. We have to do only with the number this spot will hold.</p>
