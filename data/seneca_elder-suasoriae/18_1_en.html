<p>I have mentioned this <span class="italic">suasoria</span> not because it contained<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">10</span><span class="br"></span> anything very subtle that might stimulate you, but so that you could learn how brilliantly Fuscus spoke—or how licentiously: <span class="italic">I</span> shall not vote on that issue.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_519_1" id="target_note_LCL464_519_1"><sup>1</sup></a> It will be up to <span class="italic">you</span> to decide whether you think his developments self-indulgent or lively.

Then, It is as dangerous to retreat as to fight. Lastly, It is more dangerous to retreat. Those who fight have the enemy to fear; those who retreat have the enemy <span class="italic">and</span> their own people to fear.</p>
