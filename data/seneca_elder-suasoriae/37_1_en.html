<p>Finally: “Even if he does come, who will accompany him? He will have to assemble the remnants from our victory.

He judged that neither Xerxes nor any future Persian would dare to pour his men into Greece. All the more reason, then, why the trophies must be maintained, in case of any invasion from that quarter, so that the sight of them should fire the spirit of the home soldiers, and break that of the enemy.</p>
