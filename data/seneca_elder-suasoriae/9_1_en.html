<p>Cestius’ description went like this: “The Ocean roars, as though angry that you are leaving the land behind.”</p>
<p>It was generally agreed that the most decadent<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">12</span><span class="br"></span> thing said since the eloquent began to go mad was a remark of Dorion paraphrasing Homer, where the blinded Cyclops flings a rock into the sea.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_501_1a" id="target_note_LCL464_501_1a"><sup>1</sup></a> Maecenas used to say that you could tell from Virgil how this, instead of being decadent, could be made grand and yet sane at the same time. It is bombastic to say: “Mountain is torn from mountain.” So what does Virgil say? His character seizes “no small part of a mountain.” He keeps size in mind without ill-advised
departure from the truth. It is inflated to say: “and an island is picked up and flung.” What does Virgil say of ships? “You might suppose there floated the Cyclades uptorn.” He doesn’t say it does happen—but that it seems to happen. However incredible it may be, anything excused before it is uttered is received with favour.</p>
<p>I have come across in this same <span class="italic">suasoria</span> a much<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">13</span><span class="br"></span> more decadent epigram by one Menestratus, a declaimer
of some repute in his day, when he was describing the huge size of the monsters bred in the Ocean . . . The result of the epigram is that I am ready to forgive Musa for something more monstrous even than Scylla and Charybdis: “Charybdis, wrecker of the sea itself.” And, so as to avoid an isolated folly on the same topic, he said: “What can be safe where even the sea perishes?”</p>
