I am ashamed to say it: we are still doubtful whether we were the victors. Will Xerxes come? His mind is strangely cast down as he ponders on his losses; it shrinks from the thought of that rout. Former fear is a guarantee of future fear; what he lost warns the man vulnerable to further loss not to be daring. Just as a spirit is sometimes uplifted at joy, and measures its hopes by its present success, so it can be broken by adverse fortune.

What of Salamis? What of Cynaegiros and Polyzelos? And still the question is raised, Did we win?
