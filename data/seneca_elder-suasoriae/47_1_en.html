<p>Since I have happened on this theme, it’s not, I think, irrelevant to point out how each of the historians showed up in treating the memory of Cicero. All concede that Cicero was neither coward enough to plead with Antony, nor stupid enough to hope that Antony could be won over: all, that is, except Asinius Pollio,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_577_1" id="target_note_LCL464_577_1"><sup>1</sup></a> who remained the most implacable enemy of Cicero’s reputation.

<p>However, my dear young men, I don’t want you to<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">16</span><span class="br"></span> get depressed because I am passing from declamation to history.
