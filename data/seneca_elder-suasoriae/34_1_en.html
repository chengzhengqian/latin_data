<p class="noindent">A pupil of Fuscus’, whose shame I will respect,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_551_1" id="target_note_LCL464_551_1"><sup>1</sup></a> when<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span> declaiming our <span class="italic">suasoria</span> on Alexander the Great before his master, thought that this same line could come in equally prettily here, and said:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line indent1">“Naturally that is a task for the gods, that is a care</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">That troubles them in their calm.”</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">Fuscus said to him: “If you had said that in the hearing of Alexander you’d have been made aware there’s another verse in Virgil:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line indent3">‘he buried the sword to its hilt.’”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_551_2" id="target_note_LCL464_551_2"><sup>2</sup></a></span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p></blockquote>
<p>Now because you keep bothering me about Fuscus and why no-one was thought a more elegant speaker, I shall keep piling Fuscan delevopments on you. He was very ready to speak <span class="italic">suasoriae,</span> more frequently in Greek than Latin.</p>
<p>It was in this <span class="italic">suasoria</span> that Hybreas said: “What a shield Babylon has found in an augur!”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_551_3" id="target_note_LCL464_551_3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p><span class="sc">Arellius Fuscus.</span> I am ashamed of your victory if<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1</span><span class="br"></span> you believe the rout of Xerxes was such as to leave him capable of returning.
