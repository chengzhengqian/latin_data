<p>On this theme, Latro, after discussing all the points<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">19</span><span class="br"></span> the theme had room for—that they might even win, and could certainly return unbeaten, thanks to their position—then used the epigram: “At worst we shall put a brake on the war.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_531_1" id="target_note_LCL464_531_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Later I recall that Latro’s pupil Abronius Silo, father of the Silo who wrote mime plays, thus profaning as well as neglecting his distinguished talents, recited a poem in which we recognised Latro’s idea in the lines:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line indent1">“Go forward, Greeks, singing a great paean:</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">Go in triumph. Hector, brake on war, has</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent3">fallen.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_531_2" id="target_note_LCL464_531_2"><sup>2</sup></a></span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">So assiduous (not to say carping) were audiences in those days that not even a single word could be plagiarised. Nowadays anyone can pass off the Verrines for his own without being detected.</p>
<p>But, to let you see that a well-expressed idea can<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">20</span><span class="br"></span> all the same find a better expression, notice particularly how much more fittingly Virgil put this popular phrase: “Hector, brake on war, has fallen.”</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line indent1">“Whatever pause there was by the walls of hostile</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent3">Troy,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">It was by Hector’s hand and Aeneas’ that victory</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">Was stayed for the Greeks.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_531_3" id="target_note_LCL464_531_3"><sup>3</sup></a></span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">Messala used to say that Virgil should have stopped there, and that what follows</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line indent1">“and retreated from them till the tenth year”</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
