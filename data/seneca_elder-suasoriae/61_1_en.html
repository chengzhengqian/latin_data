tolerate Cicero burying what is best in him before he is buried himself? Let your genius survive you, to proscribe Antony for ever.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Arellius Fuscus Senior.</span> So long as the human race survives, so long as literature has the honour due to it, eloquence its reward, so long as the fortune of our country holds or its memory is preserved, your genius shall flourish in the admiration of posterity.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_605_1" id="target_note_LCL464_605_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Proscribed for a generation, you shall proscribe Antony for all generations.—Believe me, it is the least valuable part of you that can be taken from you or granted to you. The true Cicero is the one who Antony thinks can only be proscribed by Cicero.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_605_2" id="target_note_LCL464_605_2"><sup>2</sup></a>—He
is not reprieving <span class="italic">you</span> from proscription, but looking<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">9</span><span class="br"></span> for escape from his own.—If Antony breaks faith, you will die; if he keeps it, you will be a slave. As for me, I prefer his treachery.—I beg you, Cicero, by your sixty-four years nobly lived, by your consulship that saved the republic, by the memory of your genius (eternal, if you allow it to be so), by the republic, which—in case you should think you are leaving him anything you hold dear—has perished before you, I beseech you not to die acknowledging how little you wished to die.</p>
<p>I know of no-one who declaimed the other side in<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">10</span><span class="br"></span> this <span class="italic">suasoria,</span> everybody worrying about Cicero’s books, no-one about Cicero: though in fact that side is not so bad that Cicero would have been unready to consider it if he had really been faced with these terms. So nobody declaimed this <span class="italic">suasoria</span> more
