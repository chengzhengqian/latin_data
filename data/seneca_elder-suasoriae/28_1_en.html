<p><span class="italic">Division</span></p>
<p>In his division of this <span class="italic">suasoria,</span> Fuscus first said that<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> even if sailing was otherwise impossible, they should not kill Iphigenia. His treatment was as follows: they should not do it because it was murder, because it was parricide, because the price paid was greater than the object sought—Helen was the object, Iphigenia the price; adultery was being avenged, and parricide committed. Then he said that Agamemnon would eventually set sail even if he did not make the sacrifice; there were natural causes for the delay, sea and winds; the will of the gods was inscrutable to mortals.</p>
<p>This point was carefully divided by Cestius; he said that gods do not make their wishes felt in human affairs; even if they do, men cannot know their will; even if men do know it, the fates are irrevocable. If there are no fates, the future is inscrutable; if there are, it cannot be changed.</p>
<p>Pompeius Silo said that even if there were some<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span> sure method of divination, no belief should be placed
