name Cestius was supplied a number of times, but he kept forgetting. Finally a slave, hoping to make his memory more retentive by giving it something to hang on to, said, when his master asked who that was on the lowest couch: “This is Cestius, who said your father didn’t know his letters.” Marcus called for scourges at the double, and, as was only right, avenged Cicero on the hide of Cestius.</p>
<p>Marcus, however, was quarrelsome even when<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">14</span><span class="br"></span> piety did not demand it. To the son of the eloquent Hybreas, who was making a mess of a case he was conducting before him, he said: “Do we, then, claim to be better than our fathers?”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_611_1" id="target_note_LCL464_611_1"><sup>1</sup></a> And when in some application or other Hybreas spoke a whole passage from his father’s writings to the letter and everyone recognised it, Marcus said: “Come now, do you think <span class="italic">I</span> haven’t got off by heart my father’s: How much longer, Catiline, will you abuse our patience?”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_611_2" id="target_note_LCL464_611_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Gargonius, most amiable of fools, said two things on this theme unsurpassed in stupidity even by himself. One came in his proem. He began, as schoolmen now frequently tend to, with an oath. This Went on for some time. Then, so as to come as soon as possible to his point of maximum bombast, he added: “So may Cicero wholly live or wholly die, I assert I shall agree on no terms to destroy what I say today on the genius of Cicero.” The other remark came when he was giving examples of courageous deaths: “Juba and Petreius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_611_3" id="target_note_LCL464_611_3"><sup>3</sup></a> clashed with mutual wounds, and lent each other death.”</p>
