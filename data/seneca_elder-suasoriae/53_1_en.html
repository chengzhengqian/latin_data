Would that he could have shown more temperateness in prosperity, more stoutness in adversity! For when either had befallen him, he could not visualise their ever changing. Hence storm-clouds of hatred gathered heavily over him, giving his enemies the more confidence in their attacks on him—for he displayed more spirit in picking quarrels than in carrying them through. But it has fallen to no mortal to be perfectly virtuous: one must judge of a man in accordance with the greater part of his life and character. Indeed, <span class="italic">I</span> should not judge him as having even met an end to be pitied, were it not that <span class="italic">he</span> thought death so pitiable.” I am ready to swear to<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">25</span><span class="br"></span> you that there is nothing in his history more eloquent than the passage I have cited; Pollio, I think, here not merely praises Cicero—he rivals him. I do not say this to deter you from a strong desire to read his history. Desire to do so—and you will make amends to Cicero.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_589_1" id="target_note_LCL464_589_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
