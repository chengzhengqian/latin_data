connection with some Virgilian description. Thus in this very <span class="italic">suasoria</span> he said: “Why did <span class="italic">this</span> man find favour for the task of mediator?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_543_1" id="target_note_LCL464_543_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Why did the god choose <span class="italic">this</span> mouth? Why does he light on this heart in particular to fill with such vast power?” He said that he had imitated the Virgilian <span class="italic">plena deo</span>,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_543_2a" id="target_note_LCL464_543_2a"><sup>2</sup></a> “she full of the God.”</p>
<p>My friend Gallio often brings this phrase in very<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">6</span><span class="br"></span> nicely. I remember we once both visited Messala after listening to Nicetes. Nicetes’ flood of words had much pleased the Greeks. Messala asked Gallio what he thought of Nicetes. “She’s full of the god,” said Gallio. Whenever he heard one of the declaimers that the schoolmen call “the hot ones,” he used to say at once: “She’s full of the god.” In fact, Messala himself used invariably to phrase his question when Gallio arrived from hearing a new declaimer
with these words: “Was she full of the god?” Indeed, it was so habitual with Gallio that it used to drop from his lips despite himself. Once when the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">7</span><span class="br"></span> emperor was present, and the conversation turned to the genius of Haterius, Gallio relapsed into habit, and said: “He too was full of the god, she was.” The emperor asked what this meant, and Gallio recited the line of Virgil and told him how the phrase had once slipped out of him at Messala’s and how it had been liable to slip out of him ever since. Tiberius himself, being a Theodorean,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_543_3" id="target_note_LCL464_543_3"><sup>3</sup></a> used to be offended by Nicetes’ manner, and so he much enjoyed Gallio’s anecdote.</p>
