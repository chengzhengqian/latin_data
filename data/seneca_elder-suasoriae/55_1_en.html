<p>I shall not deprive my fellow townsman of the credit<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">27</span><span class="br"></span> for a good line that gave rise to the even better one by Cornelius Severus:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line indent1">“The eloquence of the Latin tongue grew dumb</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent3">with sadness.”</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">Sextilius Ena was a man of talent rather than learning, an uneven poet, and in some passages very like the poets of Corduba as described by Cicero,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_593_1" id="target_note_LCL464_593_1"><sup>1</sup></a> with “a thick and foreign tone.” Proposing to recite on the subject of this same proscription in the house of Messala Corvinus, he had invited Asinius Pollio. And he started his recital with a line that was greeted with some applause:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line indent1">“I must lament Cicero and the silence of the Latin</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent3">tongue.”</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">Asinius Pollio did not take this lying down. He said: “Messala, <span class="italic">you</span> can decide for yourself what goes on in your own house; <span class="italic">I</span> do not propose to listen to someone who thinks I am dumb”—and he immediately got up. I know that Cornelius Severus was also present at Ena’s recitation; and it’s obvious that he didn’t dislike the line as much as Pollio, seeing that he composed a similar, though better, line himself.</p>
<p>If I stop at this point, I know <span class="italic">you</span> will stop reading where <span class="italic">I</span> abandoned the schoolmen;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_593_2" id="target_note_LCL464_593_2"><sup>2</sup></a> so, to encourage you to unwind the book right to the end of the roll, I shall append a <span class="italic">suasoria</span> on a subject related to its neighbour.</p>
