This is the Dellius whose obscene letters to Cleopatra are in circulation. Now when the Athenians were asking time to get the money together, and not being given it, Dellius said: “Still, you can say they owe you this day next year, two years hence, three years hence.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_497_1" id="target_note_LCL464_497_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>However, I have got too far from the point in my delight in stories. I must return to my theme.</p>
<p>Cestius used to say that this advice to Alexander<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">8</span><span class="br"></span> should be accompanied by the highest praises of him. His division went like this. First, even if the Ocean could be sailed, it should not be—Alexander had won enough glory; he should rule and put in order what he had conquered <span class="italic">en passant,</span> have some consideration for soldiers tired out by so many victories, and take thought for his mother: and he added several other reasons. Then he went on to argue that the Ocean could <span class="italic">not</span> be sailed.</p>
<p>Fabianus the philosopher put the same point first:<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">9</span><span class="br"></span> Even if the Ocean could be sailed, it should not be. But his first reason was different: a limit must be set to prosperity.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_497_2" id="target_note_LCL464_497_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Here he spoke this epigram: “The only great felicity is that which stops of its own will.” He then spoke the commonplace on the variability of Fortune. He described how nothing is stable, everything fluid, now raised, now depressed in unpredictable change, lands being swallowed, seas drained, mountains subsiding.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_497_3" id="target_note_LCL464_497_3"><sup>3</sup></a> He gave examples of kings who have been tumbled from the height of their power. Then he added: “Allow nature rather than your fortune to run out.”</p>
