in augury. “Why, then, if Calchas is ignorant, does he make assertions? First of all, he thinks he does know”—here he spoke a commonplace against all those who pretended to such knowledge; “secondly, he is angry with you, he does not want to go to war; and he seeks universal recognition by so notable a token.”</p>
<p>In the description which I put first in this <span class="italic">suasoria,</span> Arellius Fuscus wished to imitate certain lines of Virgil; but they were far from his point, and he put them in almost against the interests of his theme, which assuredly had no need of them.
