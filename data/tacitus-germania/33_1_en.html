<p>38. Now I must treat of the Suebi,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL035_193_2a" id="target_note_LCL035_193_2a"><sup>2</sup></a> in whom are comprised not one tribe only, as with the Chatti and the Tencteri; for they occupy the greater part of Germany, and are also distinguished by special national names, though styled in general Suebi. One mark of the race is to comb the hair back over the side of the head and tie it low in a knot behind: this distinguishes the Suebi from other Germans, and the free-born of the Suebi from the slave. In other tribes, whether from some relationship to the Suebi, or, as often happens, from imitation, the same thing may be found; but it is rare and confined to the period of youth. Among the Suebi, even till the hair is grey, the rough locks are twisted backward, and often knotted on the very crown: the chieftains wear theirs somewhat more ornamentally, to this extent interested in appearances, but innocently so.

The name certainly embraced the Semnones, Hermunduri, Marcomani, and Quadi; and the Triboci, Vangiones, and Nemetes (and the Naristi?) were related to them. About 100 <span class="sc">b.c</span>. Suebic tribes on the Elbe, especially the Suebi of Julius Caesar’s campaigns, came through the Thuringian Forest to the junction of the Main and the Rhine, and crossed both rivers. Then one host headed by the Triboci followed by the Nemetes and the Vangiones moved up the left bank of the Rhine; another up the right into Baden; and another moved along the Main into Bavaria. The Helvetii were forced to move almost wholly into Switzerland. The crowds which crossed the Rhine at Mainz became powerful especially in Alsace under Ariovistus from 71 <span class="sc">b.c.</span> onwards until 58, after which they were checked by Julius Caesar. See above, p. 174, on the Vangiones, etc. In the third century <span class="sc">a.d</span>. the Germans themselves in Baden and Wurttemburg began to call themselves Suabians and their land Suabia; and the Germans of Württemberg can still call themselves Schwaben.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL035_193_2a').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
