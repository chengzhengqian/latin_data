Ann., I. 51) and of the Gambrivii (Strabo, VII. 1.3—a central tribe) is not known. The Vandilii or Vandalii (the later Vandals) of east Germany included, according to Pliny, the Gutones (Goths—see below), the Burgondiones (Burgundians), and others; in Tacitus the Vandalii seem to be the same as the Lugii (see below, p. 202). For the Suebi, see pp. 192–3.

G. C. Anderson’s edition of the Germania, 42 ff. <span class="italic">Germani</span> as the national name of all Germans was certainly an extension, as usually happens, of a native tribal name. So <span class="italic">Germani</span> must not be derived from a Celtic word; and the Romans were quite wrong in connecting it with <span class="italic">germani</span> “brothers.” There was an inroad of Germans, about 500 <span class="sc">b.c</span>., into south Holland and east Belgium and to the foot of the Ardennes, which we can ignore in this context. The name <span class="italic">Germani</span> arose later among the Gauls after a second invasion of Germans not much later than 250 <span class="sc">b.c</span>. These Germans included the Tungri and others—five such tribes are said by Julius Caesar to have the collective name <span class="italic">Germani</span> who had settled in north-eastern Gaul. The Gauls, and from them the Romans later, called all these peoples <span class="italic">Germani</span>. Tacitus wrongly says that it was the German Tungri themselves who first called all Germans “<span class="italic">Germani</span>” to scare the Gauls into believing that other peoples east of the Rhine were likewise <span class="italic">Germani</span> who might support them. There is no sign that all Germans were calling themselves <span class="italic">Germani</span>. The subsequent German invaders of Gaul were the Cimbri and the Teutoni or Teutones and the Ambrones <span class="italic">c.</span> 120–102 <span class="sc">b.c.</span>; the Suebi and other Suebic tribes the Vangiones, Triboci, and Nemetes <span class="italic">c.</span> 100 <span class="sc">b.c</span>. (see p. 174); the followers of the Suebic king Ariovistus 71–58 <span class="sc">b.c</span>.; and the Usipetes and Tencteri in 55 <span class="sc">b.c.</span> It was the Romans who came to call all the tribes of Germans by the generic name <span class="italic">Germani</span>; the Germans themselves did not call their whole race by any name until about a thousand years later.
