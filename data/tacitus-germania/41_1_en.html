human protection, and guarantees to the votary of the goddess a mind at rest even in the midst of foes. They use swords rarely, clubs frequently. Grain and other products of the earth they cultivate with a patience out of keeping with the lethargy customary to Germans: nay, they ransack the sea also, and are the only German people who gather in the shallows and on the shore itself the amber, which they call in their tongue “glesum.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL035_209_1a" id="target_note_LCL035_209_1a"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Nor have they, being barbarians, inquired or learned what substance or process produces it: nay, it lay there long among the rest of the flotsam and jetsam of the sea, until Roman luxury gave it fame. To the natives it is useless: it is gathered crude; is forwarded to Rome unshaped: they are astonished to be paid for it. Yet you may infer that it is the exudation of trees: certain creeping and even winged creatures are continually found embedded:

Our “glaze,” “glare,” and “glass” come from the same root as <span class="italic">glesum</span>. Amber (Baltic) is succinite, the fossilised resin which had flowed from now extinct pine trees probably in the Tertiary (Eocene) era and certainly later, in the Lower Oligocene era, and was deposited in submarine sands. Today most of it is got by mining, but pieces torn from the present sea-floor, and rounded by being rolled about, are often cast up by the waves. The big headland of Samland to the north and north-west of Kaliningrad=Königsberg, part of the coastland of the Aestii, is still the main source of amber. But the Greek explorer Pytheas, c. 323 <span class="sc">b.c</span>., learnt that it was obtained on an island off Jutland; the fleet of Germanicus in <span class="sc">a.d.</span> 16 found it on a West Frisian island; and Pliny, writing in Vespasian’s time (<span class="sc">a.d.</span> 69–79) records that it came also from other parts of the Baltic coast and from coasts and islands of the North Sea. From quite early times it had reached the Mediterranean lands, by overland transport mainly.
Archaeology has shown that, contrary to Tacitus’ belief, amber had been used by the Aestii and west Baltic tribes ever since the Stone Age, and by the peoples of the Mycenaean period in Greece. Later Greek artists found it unsuitable; nor was it used much in early Italy except in the north and the centre. Towards the end of the Roman Republic, in the first century <span class="sc">b.c.</span>, amber came into favour in Rome. Then, in the time of Nero (<span class="sc">a.d</span>. 54–68) the Romans learnt where it came from, and an official of Nero, by travelling from Carnuntum (Petronell near Vienna) in Pannonia through Moravia and Poland to Samland, began a vigorous trade in it which did not decline until it did so after <span class="italic">c</span>. <span class="sc">a.d</span>. 150 because of unrest in Germany. Discoveries of Roman coins in Upper Silesia testify to the use of this route; and coin-finds indicate a western route also from Samland through Pomerania to the lower Elbe. (Cf. Pliny, <span class="italic">N.H.</span> XXXVII. 30–51.)</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL035_209_1a').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
