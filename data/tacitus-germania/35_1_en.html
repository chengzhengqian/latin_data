by lack of number: set in the midst of numerous and powerful tribes, they are delivered not by submissiveness, but by peril and pitched battle. Then come the Reudigni and the Aviones, and the Anglii, and the Varini, the Eudoses and Suarines and Nuitones.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL035_197_1a" id="target_note_LCL035_197_1a"><sup>1</sup></a> These tribes are protected by forests and rivers, nor is there anything noteworthy about them individually, except that they worship in common Nerthus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL035_197_2" id="target_note_LCL035_197_2"><sup>2</sup></a> or Mother Earth, and conceive her as intervening in human affairs, and riding in procession through the cities of men. In an island of the ocean is a holy grove, and in it a consecrated chariot, covered with a robe: a single priest is permitted to touch it: he feels the presence of the goddess in her shrine, and follows with deep reverence as she rides away drawn by cows: then come days of rejoicing, and all places keep holiday, as many as she thinks worthy to receive and entertain her. They make no war, take no arms: every weapon is put away; peace and quiet are then, and then alone, known and loved, until the same priest returns the goddess to her sacred precinct, when she has had her fill of the society of mortals. After this the chariot and the robe, and, if you are willing to credit it, the deity in person, are washed in a sequestered lake: slaves are the ministrants and are straightway swallowed by the same lake: hence a mysterious terror and an ignorance full of piety as to what that may be which men only behold to die.</p>

The Reudigni (really Reudingi—the Saxons?) were certainly in Holstein; the Aviones (”islanders”) probably in the North Frisian Islands; the Anglii in Schleswig (where a district is still named Angeln); the Varini apparently north of them (the north-east end of Sundewitt is still called Warnitz); and the Eudoses in south Jutland.
