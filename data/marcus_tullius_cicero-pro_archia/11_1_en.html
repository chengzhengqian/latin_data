presume upon your kindness, since I see you give so careful a hearing to my unconventional digression,—how often, I say, have I seen him, without writing a single letter, extemporizing quantities of excellent verse dealing with current topics! How often have I seen him, when recalled, repeat his original matter with an entire change of word and phrase! To his finished and studied work I have known such approval accorded that his glory rivalled that of the great writers of antiquity. Does not such a man deserve my affection and admiration? Should I not count it my duty to strain every nerve in his defence? And yet we have it on the highest and most learned authority that while other arts are matters of science and formula and technique, poetry depends solely upon an inborn faculty, is evoked by a purely mental activity, and is infused with a strange supernal inspiration Rightly, then, did our great Ennius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL158_27_a" id="target_note_LCL158_27_a"><sup>a</sup></a> call poets “holy,” for they seem recommended to us by the <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">19</span><span class="br"></span> benign bestowal of God. Holy then, gentlemen, in your enlightened eyes let the name of poet be, inviolate hitherto by the most benighted of races! The very rocks of the wilderness give back a sympathetic echo to the voice; savage beasts have sometimes been charmed into stillness by song;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL158_27_b" id="target_note_LCL158_27_b"><sup>b</sup></a> and shall we, who are nurtured upon all that is highest, be deaf to the appeal of poetry? Colophon asserts that Homer<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL158_27_c" id="target_note_LCL158_27_c"><sup>c</sup></a> is her citizen, Chios claims him for her own, Salamis appropriates him, while Smyrna is so confident that he belongs to her that she has even dedicated a shrine to him in her town; and many other cities besides engage in mutual strife for his possession.</p>
