each term were predicated substantially it would be affirmed of the three Persons both separately and collectively. It is evident that these terms are relative, for the Father is some one’s Father, the Son is some one’s Son, the Spirit is some one’s Spirit. Hence not even Trinity is predicated substantially<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL074_37_a" id="target_note_LCL074_37_a"><sup>a</sup></a> of God; for the Father is not Trinity—since he who is Father is not Son and Holy Spirit—nor yet, by parity of reasoning, is the Son Trinity nor the Holy Spirit Trinity, but the Trinity consists in plurality of Persons, the unity in simplicity of substance.</p>
<p>Now if the Persons are separate, while the substance is undivided, it must needs be that that term which is derived from Persons does not belong to Substance. But the diversity of Persons makes the Trinity, wherefore Trinity does not belong to substance. Hence neither Father, nor Son, nor Holy Spirit, nor Trinity is predicated substantially of God, but only relatively, as we have said. But God, truth, justice, goodness, omnipotence, substance, immutability, virtue, wisdom and all other conceivable predicates of the kind are said of the divinity substantially.</p>
<p>If these things are right and in accordance with the Faith, I pray you confirm me; or if you are in any point of another opinion, examine carefully what has been said, and if possible, reconcile faith and reason.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL074_37_b" id="target_note_LCL074_37_b"><sup>b</sup></a></p>
