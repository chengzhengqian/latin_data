the gods, you will pass, Magnus, to your loved city, and the chief Pontiff will bear your ashes. Even now, if any man travels to Syene, parched by flaming Cancer, and to Thebes, unwetted even under the rain-bearing Pleiads, in order to behold the Nile; if any man seeks the quiet waters of the Red Sea or the ports of Arabia to traffic in Eastern wares—that gravestone, and those ashes, perhaps disturbed and lying on the surface of the sand, will call him aside to worship, and bid him appease the spirit of Magnus, and give it the preference over Casian<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL220_501_1" id="target_note_LCL220_501_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Jupiter. That grave will never mar his fame; the dead would be less precious if buried in temples and gold. Fortune, lying in this tomb, is now at last a supreme deity;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL220_501_2" id="target_note_LCL220_501_2"><sup>2</sup></a> prouder than all Caesar’s altars is the sea-beaten stone on the shore of Africa.

One day it will prove a gain that no lofty pile of massive marble was raised here to last for ever. For a short space of time will scatter the little heap of dust; the grave will fall in; and all proof of Pompey’s death will be lost. A happier age will come, when those who point out that stone will be disbelieved, and perhaps our descendants will consider Egypt as false in her tale of Pompey’s tomb as Crete when she claims the tomb of Jupiter.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL220_501_4" id="target_note_LCL220_501_4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
