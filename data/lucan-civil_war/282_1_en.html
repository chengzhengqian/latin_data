plagues of Africa the <span class="italic">seps</span> bears off the palm for destruction: all the rest take life, but it alone carries off the dead body.</p>
<p>But lo! a form of death is seen, the opposite to death by liquefaction. Nasidius, once a tiller of Marsian soil, was smitten by a burning <span class="italic">prester.</span> His face grew fiery red, and swelling distended the skin till all shape was lost and all features were confounded; then, as the strong poison spread, the hurt, larger than the whole body or than any human body, was blown out over all the limbs; the man himself was buried deep within his bloated frame, nor could his breast-plate contain the growth of his swollen chest. The foaming cloud of steam pours forth less strongly from a heated caldron; and smaller are the curves of bellying sails in a tempest. The distended limbs can no longer be contained by the body—a round and featureless mass with no distinct parts. The body remained untouched by the beaks of birds, and menaced death to wild beasts that feasted on it; the soldiers dared not consign it to a pyre, but fled from it, leaving it still swelling, with a growth not yet arrested.</p>
<p>But even greater marvels were shown by the serpents of Africa. Tullus, a courageous youth who worshipped Cato, was bitten by a fierce <span class="italic">haemorrhois.</span> And as Corycian saffron, when turned on, is wont to spout from every part of a statue at once,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL220_565_1" id="target_note_LCL220_565_1"><sup>1</sup></a> so all his limbs discharged red poison together instead of blood. His tears were blood; blood flowed abundantly from all the openings that the body’s moisture uses; his mouth and open nostrils were filled with it; he sweated blood; all his limbs streamed with the contents of his veins; his whole body was one wound.</p>
