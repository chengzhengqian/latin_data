looking on at civil war with no prayer for the success of either.</p>
<p>The fortune of war did not remain unchanged all the world over, but dared to strike one blow against Caesar’s side. Where the Adriatic wave beats on the straggling town of Salonae, and where mild Iader<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL220_205_1" id="target_note_LCL220_205_1"><sup>1</sup></a> runs out towards the soft West winds, there Antonius, trusting in the warlike race of the Curictae,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL220_205_2" id="target_note_LCL220_205_2"><sup>2</sup></a> who dwell in an island surrounded by the Adriatic waters, was pent up within his camp on the edge of the shore. He was safe against armed attack, if only he could keep famine at bay—famine which takes the impregnable fortress. The earth sends up no fodder to feed his horses; golden Ceres puts forth no corn there; the soldiers had robbed the field of its grass; and, when they had nibbled the blades close with starving teeth, they had torn the withered tufts from the sods that formed the camp. As soon as they saw a friendly force commanded by Basilus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL220_205_3a" id="target_note_LCL220_205_3a"><sup>3</sup></a> on the mainland opposite, they devised a novel plan to steal in flight across the deep. They built no long hulls, no high sterns, as the custom is, but joined stout planks together on unwonted lines to carry heavy structures. This raft rested entirely upon empty barrels, a succession of which, lashed together in double rows by long chains, supported the planks laid transversely across them. Nor were the rowers she carried exposed to missiles along an open front; but they struck the water enclosed by the timbers; and the raft presented the puzzle of mysterious motion, because it carried no sail and did not thrash the waves visibly.
