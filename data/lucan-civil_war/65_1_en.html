The nations of Syria came also, leaving behind the Orontes, and Ninos of whose prosperity legend tells; they left wind-swept Damascus, Gaza, Idume rich in palm-plantations, tottering Tyre,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL220_131_1" id="target_note_LCL220_131_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and Sidon precious for its purple.
