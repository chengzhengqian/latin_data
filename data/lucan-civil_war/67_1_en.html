neutral between the army of Caesar and the host opposed to him: it was enough for them that they had reduced the rivals to two.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL220_135_1" id="target_note_LCL220_135_1"><sup>1</sup></a> The nomad peoples of Scythia, bounded by the cold stream of Bactros and the endless forests of Hyrcania, dipped their arrows in poison. From one quarter came the Heniochi of Spartan blood, a dangerous people when they shake their bridles, and the Sarmatians, akin to the savage Moschi. Men came from the regions where the Phasis cleaves the rich land of the Colchians,
where flows the Halys that brought doom to Croesus, and where the Tanais, falling down from the Riphaean heights, gives the names of two worlds to its two banks, bounding Asia and Europe as well—it keeps the central part of earth from union, and, according to its windings, enlarges now one continent and now the other—and where the Euxine drains the rushing waters of the Maeotian Mere through the strait; and thus men deny that Gades alone lets in the Ocean,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL220_135_2" id="target_note_LCL220_135_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and the Pillars of Hercules are robbed of their boast.
