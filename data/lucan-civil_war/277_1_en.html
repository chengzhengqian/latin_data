Pillars of the West; and when the gods in time past dreaded the serpent-legged Giants at Phlegra, she changed the rebels into high mountains, till that awful battle of the gods was won by the Gorgon on the centre of the breast of Pallas.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL220_555_1" id="target_note_LCL220_555_1"><sup>1</sup></a> To this land came Perseus, sprung of Danae’s womb and the shower of gold; he was borne aloft on the Parrhasian
