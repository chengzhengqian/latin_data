<p><span class="sc">But</span> far away, in the outermost region of earth,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL220_175_1" id="target_note_LCL220_175_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Caesar fiercely carried on war—war not guilty of much bloodshed, but destined to turn decisively the scales of fate for the rival leaders. Afranius and Petreius ruled the army<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL220_175_2" id="target_note_LCL220_175_2"><sup>2</sup></a> in Spain with equal authority: united in heart, they shared their command equally and in turn, and the watchful guard that kept the rampart safe obeyed the watchword of each in turn. Besides Roman soldiers they had active Asturians and nimble Vettones, and Celts, emigrants from an ancient tribe of Gaul, who added their own name to that of the Hiberians.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL220_175_3" id="target_note_LCL220_175_3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>The fertile land rises in a hill of moderate height and ascends with easy slope; and on this stands Ilerda, founded by hands of old. The Sicoris, not least among western rivers, flows by with quiet waters; and a stone bridge, fit to withstand the winter floods, spans the river with mighty arch. A steep hill close by was occupied by the army of Magnus; and Caesar pitched his camp aloft on another hill as high; the river flowed between and divided the camps. Beyond, the level land spreads out in plains whose limit the eye can scarce embrace; but the rushing Cinga bounds the plains—Cinga,
whose own swift waters may never smite the shore and the sea; for the Hiberus, which gives its name to the country, mixes its flood with the Cinga and steals its name from it.</p>
