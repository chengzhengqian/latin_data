and sea: the narrow bounds of the Asylum<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL220_11_1" id="target_note_LCL220_11_1"><sup>1</sup></a> pitted its owners one against the other.</p>

So the Isthmus of Corinth divides the main and parts two seas with its slender line, forbidding them to mingle their waters; but if its soil were withdrawn, it would dash the Ionian sea against the Aegean. Thus Crassus kept apart the eager combatants; but when he met his pitiable end and stained Syrian Carrhae with Roman blood, the loss inflicted by Parthia let loose the madness of Rome.

But loyalty was shattered by the death of Julia, and leave was given to the chiefs to begin the conflict. Rivalry in worth spurred them on; for Magnus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL220_11_4" id="target_note_LCL220_11_4"><sup>4</sup></a> feared that fresher exploits might dim his past triumphs, and that his victory over the pirates might give place to the conquest of Gaul, while Caesar was urged on by
