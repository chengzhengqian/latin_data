camp. Shame upon Fate! How dread that day, the day when victorious Marius seized the city! With what mighty strides cruel death stalked abroad! High and low were slain alike; the sword strayed far and wide; and no breast was spared the steel. Pools of blood stood in the temples; constant carnage wetted the red and slippery pavement. None was protected by his age: the slayer did not scruple to anticipate the last day of declining age, or to cut short the early prime of a hapless infant in the dawn of life. How was it possible that children should deserve death for any crime? But it was enough to have already a life to lose. The violence of frenzy was itself an incentive; and it was deemed the part of a laggard to look for guilt in a victim. Many were slain merely to make up a number; and the bloodstained conqueror seized a head cut off from a stranger’s shoulders, because he was ashamed to walk with empty hands.

The Crassi were mutilated and mangled by Fimbria; and the blood of tribunes wetted the cruel wood.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL220_65_2" id="target_note_LCL220_65_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Scaevola
