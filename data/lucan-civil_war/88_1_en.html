<p>The first day of the campaign was innocent of bloodshed: it only displayed to view the forces of the leaders and the multitude of their troops. Men loathed their own wickedness; shame held back the weapons of their frenzy, and they granted one day’s respite to their country and the laws they had broken. But when the sky was westering towards night, Caesar surrounded his army with a trench dug in haste, while his front rank kept their ground; thus he deceived the enemy, screening his camp with a line of troops drawn up near at hand.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL220_177_1" id="target_note_LCL220_177_1"><sup>1</sup></a> At dawn he ordered his men to move with speed and climb the hill, which lay between Ilerda and the camp and protected the town.

None was at leisure to hurl his weapon: each drives in his javelin to assure his slippery foothold; they clutch at rocks and trees; they pay no heed to the enemy but hack a path with their swords.
