For he knows where the blood of the empire runs, the pulse of the machine; he knows in what quarter Rome must be struck, and the vulnerable points of Liberty now making her last stand on earth. Senators mixed with knights are borne down by the steel, and noble corpses lie low; they slay Lepidi and Metelli, they slay Corvini together with the stock of Torquatus—often leaders of the State, and raised above all men, Magnus alone excepted.

Though conquered so often by Caesar, he died without losing his freedom. Now he fell gladly under a thousand wounds, and rejoiced not to be pardoned a second time.
