offended the gods so grievously that they visited you beyond other lands with such a holocaust of victims and such a myriad of deaths in civil war? No lapse of time is long enough to make posterity forget and forgive the losses which your battle wrought; each crop will rise discoloured and with tainted blades from your soil; and all your ploughshares will do violence to Roman dead. Meanwhile, fresh armies will meet, and you will offer your plains for a second crime<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL220_433_1" id="target_note_LCL220_433_1"><sup>1</sup></a> before this blood has dried off them. Though we empty out all the tombs of our ancestors—both those that are still erect, and those which, when their masonry was split by ancient roots, spilt their urns—yet the plough turns up more relics in the furrows of Thessaly, and the harrows that till those fields strike against more bones. No sailor would fasten his cable to the shore of Thessaly; no ploughman would stir the soil where the Roman people lies buried; the husbandmen would flee from the haunted plains; the thickets would shelter no flocks, and no shepherd would dare to let his sheep crop the grass that grows from Roman bones—Thessaly
would be an unknown desert, as if icy cold or the zone of oppressive heat made it unfit for habitation, if it had been the only land, and not merely the first, to be the scene of civil war. Ye gods, give us the power to curse the country that is guilty. Why do ye condemn all the world, and so acquit it all? The slaughter in the West and the mournful sea of Pachynum, Mutina and Leucas,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL220_433_2" id="target_note_LCL220_433_2"><sup>2</sup></a> have washed away the guilt of Philippi.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL220_433_3" id="target_note_LCL220_433_3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
