fall which no eminence can escape; it was the grievous collapse of excessive weight, and Rome unable to support her own greatness. Even so, when the framework of the world is dissolved and the final hour, closing so many ages, reverts to primeval chaos, then [all the constellations will clash in confusion,] the fiery stars will drop into the sea, and earth, refusing to spread her shores out flat,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL220_9_1" id="target_note_LCL220_9_1"><sup>1</sup></a> will shake off the ocean; the moon will move in opposition to her brother, and claim to rule the day, disdaining to drive her chariot<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL220_9_2" id="target_note_LCL220_9_2"><sup>2</sup></a> along her slanting orbit; and the whole distracted fabric of the shattered firmament will overthrow its laws. Great things come crashing down upon themselves—such is the limit of growth ordained by heaven for success. Nor did Fortune lend her grudge to any foreign nations, to use against the people that ruled earth and sea: the doom of Rome was due to Rome herself, when she became the joint property of three masters,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL220_9_3" id="target_note_LCL220_9_3"><sup>3</sup></a> and when despotism, which never before was shared among so many, struck its bloody bargain. Blinded by excess of ambition, the Three joined hands for mischief. What boots it to unite their strength and rule the world in common? As long as earth supports the sea and air the earth; as long as his unending task shall make the sun go round, and night shall follow day in the heavens, each passing through the same number of signs<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL220_9_4" id="target_note_LCL220_9_4"><sup>4</sup></a>—so long will loyalty be impossible between sharers in tyranny, and great place will resent a partner. Search not the history of foreign nations for proof, nor look far for an instance of Fate’s decree: the rising walls of Rome were wetted with a brother’s blood. Nor was such madness rewarded then by lordship over land
