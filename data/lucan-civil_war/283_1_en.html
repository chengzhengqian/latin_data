<p>Next, a serpent of the Nile froze the blood of hapless Laevus and stopped his heart. By no pain did he confess the wound, but suffered death by sudden unconsciousness, and went down by the way of sleep to join the ghosts of his comrades. The ripened poisons plucked by the wizards of Sais—poisons
whose deadly stalks resemble the twigs of Arabia—do not infect the cup with so swift a death.</p>
<p>Behold! a fierce serpent, called by Africa <span class="italic">iaculus</span>, aimed and hurled itself at Paulus from a barren tree far off; piercing the head and passing through the temples, it escaped. Poison played no part there: death simultaneous with the wound snatched him away.
