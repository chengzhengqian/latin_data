of his renown into the scale of adversity and crushes him beneath his former successes. Now he feels that his honours came too quick upon him; now he curses the exploits of his triumphant youth in Sulla’s day; now he hates in his fall to remember the fleets of Cilicia<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL220_439_1" id="target_note_LCL220_439_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and the armies of Pontus. Thus length of days and life surviving power humble the proudest heart.

But see! a ship spreading her sail towards the harbours of Lesbos.’
