in battle and in flight, you who represent our country, though I, who ask your counsel and seek to set a new enterprise on foot, stand here on a barren shore in the land of Cilicia, and have no armies round me, yet hear me with proud hearts. I did not fall for ever on the field of Pharsalia; nor has my destiny sunk so low that I can never again raise my head and shake off the defeat I have suffered. If the ruins of Carthage could raise Marius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL220_457_1" id="target_note_LCL220_457_1"><sup>1</sup></a> to office and replace him in the Calendar, full already of his name, shall Fortune keep me down, whom she has smitten with a lighter blow?
