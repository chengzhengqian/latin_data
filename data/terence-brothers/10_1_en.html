I hereby assert her claim to freedom. So choose
which you like: accept the money or prepare your case.
Ponder that until I come back, pimp. (<span class="italic">he exits into

</span><p class="lineGroup">(<span class="italic">to himself</span>) Almighty Jupiter! No wonder that victims of
injustice are driven insane. This fellow dragged me from
my house, beat me up, took away a girl without my consent,
and rained more than five hundred blows on my
poor head. All I get for my pains is a demand that she be
handed over at cost price. (<span class="italic">ironically</span>) But, since he’s deserving,
so be it; he’s only demanding his rights. (<span class="italic">shrugging
his shoulders</span>) All right, I’ll accept the offer, if only
he does pay up. But I foresee that, once I’ve agreed to let
him have her at that price, he’ll get witnesses on the spot
to say she’s sold, but leave me dreaming about the money.
“Soon,” he’ll say, “come back tomorrow.” I can even bear
that as long as he does pay up, unfair as it is. I’ve got to
face the facts of the situation. When you’ve entered this
profession, you have to accept the misbehaviour of young
men and grit your teeth. (<span class="italic">resignedly</span>) But nobody’s going
to pay me; I’m wasting my time trying to balance my
books.</p></div>
