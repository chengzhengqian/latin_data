I’ve got just the fish I wanted, and I must make sure
they’re not spoiled. That’s as much a disgrace for us,
Demea, as for you to neglect the things you were talking
about just now. As far as I can, I instruct my fellow slaves
on the same principles as yours. “Too salty,” I say. “A bit
burnt. Not clean enough. Just right: be sure to do the
same next time.” I do my best to advise them with such
wisdom as I have. Above all I tell them to look into the
saucepans as if into a mirror, Demea, and I advise them
what lessons to learn. I realise that the goings-on in our
house are silly. But what can you do? You have to take
people as you find them. (<span class="italic">turning to go</span>) Is there anything

has gone to the farm. He’s the one I care for, the one that
concerns me. Since my brother wants it that way, he can
see to the other one. (<span class="italic">looking down the street</span>) But who’s
that I see in the distance? Is it our fellow tribesman<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL023_301_21" id="target_note_LCL023_301_21">
