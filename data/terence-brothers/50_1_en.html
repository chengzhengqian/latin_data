that don’t come naturally: “my good fellow” and “how
are things?” and “how are you doing?” (<span class="italic">to Syrus</span>) You’ve
shown yourself quite a gentleman for a slave, and I’d be
delighted to do you a good turn.</p></div>

admirable fellow. In my view, a slave has assuredly
proved his worth who is concerned for his master’s interests,
as I see you are, Geta. For that reason, if the opportunity
arises, I’d be delighted to do you a good turn.
