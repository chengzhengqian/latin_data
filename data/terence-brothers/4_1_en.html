else’s house. He’s beaten the master and the whole
household practically to death. And he’s abducted a girl
he’d taken a fancy to. Everybody is protesting that it’s
outrageous behaviour. The number of people who spoke
of it, Micio, as I came into town! The whole population is
talking about it. All I can say is, if he needs an example,
why doesn’t he look at his brother, who is devoting himself
to work and living a sober frugal life on the farm?
Their behaviour’s totally different. And when I complain
about Aeschinus, I’m complaining about you, Micio.
You’re the one who’re letting him go to the bad.</p></div>
