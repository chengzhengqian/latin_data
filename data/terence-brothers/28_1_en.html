and comfort your daughter as best you can. I’ll find
Micio, if he’s in the forum, and tell him the story from the
beginning. If he’s intending to do his duty, let him do it.
But if he takes a different view of the matter, he must
give me an answer, so that I can decide what to do without
delay. (<span class="italic">he exits right in the direction of the forum</span>)</p></div>
