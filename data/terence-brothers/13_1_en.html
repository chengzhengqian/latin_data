Has Aeschinus no shame? He’s loosened all my teeth,

happened here, rather than take you to court, let
me at least get back the price I paid for her, Syrus. I know
you haven’t enjoyed my friendship in the past, but you’ll
find I don’t forget a favour.</p></div>

when you’re in need. But it doubles the pleasure if the
person who does the kindness is the right person to do it.
Oh brother, brother, how can I now praise you? I’m quite
sure I can’t say anything extravagant enough to do you
justice. I reckon I’m uniquely blessed in the whole world:
nobody else has a brother who is such a master of every
noble quality.</p></div>
