</span><p class="lineGroup">Good man. (<span class="italic">to Micio</span>)Well then, if you want my opinion,
it’s only right that Syrus should receive his freedom today.</p></div>

for both the boys right from childhood. I taught them,
guided them, and always gave them the best training I
could in everything.</p></div>

things besides: buying food on credit, hiring girls, arranging
drinking parties in broad daylight. These are the
services of no ordinary person.</p></div>

girl today; in fact he arranged it. It’s only right to reward
him; it will be an incentive for the others. Anyway, (<span class="italic">indicating
