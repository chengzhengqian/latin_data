treated him and loved him as my own. In him I find my
pleasure; he’s the only thing I really care about. And I do
my best to see that he returns my affection. I’m generous,
I turn a blind eye, I don’t find it necessary to exert my authority
all the time. In short I’ve accustomed my son not
to hide from me those youthful escapades which others
get up to behind their fathers’ backs. A boy who sets out
to lie and deceive his father and is bold enough to do that
will be all the more bold with others. I believe that it is
better to discipline children by gaining their respect
and showing generosity than through fear. My brother
doesn’t agree with me on this; he just doesn’t approve.
He often comes to me shouting “What are you doing,
Micio? Why are you ruining our boy? Why is he having a
love affair? Why is he drinking? Why are you supplying
him with money for these things? Why are you spoiling
him with expensive clothes? You’re being all too silly
about it.”Well, he’s being all too strict, well beyond what
is fair or right; and he’s making a big mistake, in my opinion
at least, if he thinks that authority imposed by force is
stronger or surer than one based on affection. This is my
philosophy and the principle I’ve adopted. A person who
acts as he ought under threat of punishment watches his
step only as long as he believes he’ll be found out; if he
thinks he can go undiscovered, he reverts to his natural
tendencies. A person who is won over by kindness acts
from the heart. He is eager to repay you; he will be the
same whether he is with you or not. A father’s duty is to
accustom his son to do right of his own accord rather than
through fear of someone else. That’s the difference between
a father and a master. Anyone who can’t see this
should admit he has no idea how to manage children.
