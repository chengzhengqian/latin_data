</span><p class="lineGroup">That you’ve got this quite wrong, Demea. It’s not a scandal,
believe me, for a young lad to chase after girls or go
drinking. It really isn’t, nor to break down a door. If you
and I didn’t do these things, it was because we couldn’t
afford them. Are you now claiming credit for behaviour
forced on you by poverty? That’s not reasonable. If we’d
had the means to do these things, we would have done
them. And, if you had any humanity, you would allow that
son of yours to do them while he has the excuse of youth,
rather than have him do them at a less appropriate age
when he has at long last seen you to your grave.</p></div>

complaints. You gave me your son to adopt. He’s now
mine, and, if he does anything wrong, Demea, I’m the
one who’s affected, I’m the one who bears the brunt of it.
He wines and dines and smells of perfume: it’s at my expense.
He’s in love: I’ll keep him in funds as long as it
suits me; when it doesn’t, maybe he’ll be thrown out. He’s
broken down a door: it can be repaired. He’s torn some
clothes:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL023_263_8" id="target_note_LCL023_263_8">

</a> they can be mended. I have the means to pay,
thank heaven, and so far it isn’t a problem. So in the end
either shut up or name an arbitrator:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL023_263_9" id="target_note_LCL023_263_9">
