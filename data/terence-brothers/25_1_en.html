Hegio? By heaven it is, if my eyes don’t deceive me.
Splendid! A man who’s been a friend of ours right from
boyhood. Heaven knows, there’s a great shortage of such
citizens these days. A man of old-fashioned virtue and
honour. It’ll be a long time before <span class="italic">he</span>’s the cause of any
public scandal. How delighted I am, when I see that
there are still people left of his type! Ah! Life still seems
worth living. I’ll wait here to pay my respects and have a
word with him.</p></div>

<span class="italic">Enter <span class="sc">hegio</span> left from the direction of the country, talking to
Geta.</span>

<div class="sp"><span class="speaker">

</span><p class="lineGroup">It’s the truth.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">heg</span>
</span><p class="lineGroup">Such ungentlemanly conduct from that family! Oh
Aeschinus! In this, by heaven, you’re not your father’s son.</p></div>

</span><p class="lineGroup">(<span class="italic">aside</span>) He’s evidently heard about the music girl. It distresses
him as an outsider, whereas the boy’s father
doesn’t care a damn. Oh dear! If only he were here somewhere
and could hear all this!</p></div>

</span><p class="lineGroup">All our hope lies in you, Hegio. You’re the only person we
have, our champion, our father. It was to you that the old
man entrusted us on his deathbed. If you abandon us,
we’re lost.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker">

</span><p class="lineGroup">Don’t speak of it. I wouldn’t do that. I deem it inconsistent
with my sense of duty.</p></div>
