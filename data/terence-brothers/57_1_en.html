your good nature and generosity is not the product of sincerity
or indeed of anything right or good but of weakness,
indulgence, and extravagance, Micio. (<span class="italic">turning to
Aeschinus</span>) Now, Aeschinus, if you two don’t like my ways
because I won’t go along with everything you do indiscriminately
right or wrong, I wash my hands of you.
Spend, squander, do what you like. If on the other hand,
where your youth makes you short-sighted, hot-headed
or reckless, you need reproof and correction and support
from time to time, here I am at your service.</p></div>

by Donatus, assign it to Micio. In Micio’s mouth, its interpretation
is problematical, either grudging, “<span class="italic">That</span>‘s fair enough, but not your
other arrangements” (as Donatus suggests), or simply, “All right, I
acquiesce.”</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL023_367_52').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL023_367_53"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL023_367_53" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">53</sup>See <span class="italic">Phormio</span> note 74.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL023_367_53').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
