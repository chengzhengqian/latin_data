</span><p class="lineGroup">I can’t see any reason why you should praise me so much
in this matter, Hegio. I’m doing my duty; I’m putting
right a wrong for which we are responsible. Or did you
suppose I was one of those who think themselves the injured
party when you reproach them for injuring others
and then proceed to accuse you in turn? Are you thanking
me because I haven’t behaved like them?</p></div>

<span class="sc">heg</span>
</span><p class="lineGroup">No! Not at all. I’ve never entertained the thought that
you are other than you are. But would you please come
with me to the girl’s mother, Micio, and tell her in person
exactly what you’ve told me, that this is all a misunderstanding
on account of his brother and the music girl?</p></div>

</span><p class="lineGroup">You’re very kind. You’ll put her mind at rest—she’s pining
away in pain and misery—and you’ll have done your
duty. But if you’d rather not, I’ll tell her myself what you
told me.</p></div>

</span><p class="lineGroup">You’re very kind. People who are less prosperous are
more mistrustful somehow; they tend to take everything
as an insult. Because of the weakness of their position,
they always believe that they’re being taken advantage of.
So it’s more likely to satisfy her if you explain the situation
in person to her face.</p></div>
