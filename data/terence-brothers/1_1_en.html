<p class="noindent">The playwright is aware that his works are being subjected to
unfair criticism and that his opponents are misrepresenting the
play we are about to perform. He will himself present the evidence
in his own trial, and you shall judge whether what he has
done merits praise or censure. <span class="italic">Synapothescontes</span> is a comedy by
Diphilus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL023_255_5" id="target_note_LCL023_255_5">
<sup>5</sup>
</a> on which Plautus based his play <span class="italic">Commorientes.</span>
<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL023_255_6" id="target_note_LCL023_255_6">
<sup>6</sup>
</a> At
the beginning of the Greek version there is a young man who
abducts a girl from a pimp. Plautus left that scene out, and our
author has taken it over for his <span class="italic">The Brothers</span>, reproducing it
word for word. We are presenting this as a brand new play. It is
for you to decide whether you deem us guilty of plagiarism or of
the reclaiming of a scene which had been carelessly omitted.</p>
<p>As for the malicious accusation that members of the nobility
assist our author and collaborate with him in his writing all the
time, which his enemies consider a serious reproach, he regards
it as a great compliment, if he finds favour with men who find favour
with all of you and the people at large, men whose services
have been freely available to everyone in time of need in war, in
peace, and in their daily affairs.</p>
