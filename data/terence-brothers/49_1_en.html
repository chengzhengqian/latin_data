in reality nothing is better for a man than to be generous
and easygoing. Anyone can easily see the truth of this by
comparing my brother and myself. He has always lived a
life of leisure and conviviality; he’s easygoing and even-tempered,
he never gives offence, he smiles at everybody.
He’s lived for himself, he’s spent for himself.
Everyone speaks well of him, everyone loves him. I on
the other hand am your typical rustic: aggressive, surly,
stingy, ill-tempered, tight-fisted. I married a wife, and
what misery that brought me! I had sons, another worry.
Oh yes! In my eagerness to make as much as possible for
them, I’ve worn out the best years of my life in money
grubbing. And now at the end of my time the reward I get
from them for my labours is hatred, while that brother
of mine without lifting a finger gets all the benefits of
fatherhood. They love him, they avoid me. They confide
all their plans to him, they’re fond of him, they both frequent
his house; I’m left on my own. They wish him a
long life; you can be sure they can’t wait for me to die. I
brought them up with a lot of labour; he has made them
his with little expense. I get all the misery, he has all the
joy. Very well then, let’s see if I am capable on my side of
winning words and kind deeds, since this is the challenge
he throws down. I too have a right to be loved and valued
by my family. If that’s achieved by being generous and indulgent,
I won’t be left behind. The money will run out;
but I couldn’t care less, since I’m well on in years.</p></div>
