foreign to my way of life, if you both want it so much, all right.</p></div>

</span><p class="lineGroup">But—(<span class="italic">aside</span>) What shall I ask next, since this is going just
as I wanted? (<span class="italic">aloud</span>) There still remains Hegio: what
about him? He’s their nearest relative, he’s a family connection,
and he’s poor. We should do something for him.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">mic</span>
</span><p class="lineGroup">Do what?</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">dem</span>
</span><p class="lineGroup">There’s that small plot of land just outside town which
you let out. Let’s give him the enjoyment of that.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">mic</span>
</span><p class="lineGroup">That’s a little plot?</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">dem</span>
</span><p class="lineGroup">Even if it’s a large one, we should do it. He’s like a father
to the girl, he’s a good man, he’s one of us. It’s a gift well
given. When all’s said and done, can’t I adopt for myself
the remark which you made just now, Micio, so wisely
and so well? “It’s a common fault of all of us that in old
age we are too worried about money.” We should avoid
that reproach. It’s sound advice and we should carry it
out in practice.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker">

</span><p class="lineGroup">Please, my dear father!</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">mic</span>
</span><p class="lineGroup">All right, then. He shall have it, since that’s what
Aeschinus wants.</p></div>
