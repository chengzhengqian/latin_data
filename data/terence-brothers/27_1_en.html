honour of your family, Demea. Let her gain of your own
free will what the force of the law demands. I pray
heaven first of all that you people handle the matter in
a way that does you credit. But, if your intentions are
otherwise, Demea, I shall defend her and her dead father
with all my might. He was a relative of mine; we were
brought up together from early boyhood; we stood together
always in war and peace; we endured the burdens
of poverty together. So I will do my utmost, go to court,
and indeed lay down my life before I abandon these
women. What is your answer?</p></div>

</span><p class="lineGroup">All right, Demea, but be sure to keep this in mind: the
easier your life is, the more powerful, rich, and prosperous
you are, the higher the status you enjoy, the more it is
your duty to be fair-minded and to act justly, if you want
to be regarded as honourable men.</p></div>
