</span><p class="lineGroup">Yes, there is. That can be borne somehow. He was led
astray by darkness, love, wine, youthful ardour: it’s only
human. When he realised what he had done, he went to
the girl’s mother of his own accord, weeping, begging,
entreating, promising, swearing that he would marry the
girl. He was forgiven, the matter was hushed up, his word
was trusted. The girl became pregnant from that assault,
and she’s in her tenth month.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL023_305_22" id="target_note_LCL023_305_22">

fine fellow has acquired a music girl to live with, and
abandoned the other one.</p></div>

</span><p class="lineGroup">The girl’s mother will vouch for it, then there’s the girl
herself, and the sheer facts of the case. And besides
there’s Geta here, who’s honest and resourceful, as slaves
go; he keeps these women from starving; the whole family
depends on him. Take him away, tie him up, interrogate
him.</p></div>
