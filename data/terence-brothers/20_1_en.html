took part with Aeschinus in the abduction of the girl.
That’s all I need to complete my misery, if the son who is

led him astray, I’ll be bound. (<span class="italic">looking down the street</span>)
But look, there’s Syrus coming. I’ll find out from him
where Ctesipho is. But, by heaven, he’s one of the gang.
If he realises I’m looking for Ctesipho, he won’t tell me a
thing, the gallows bird. I won’t let him see that’s what I
want.</p></div>
