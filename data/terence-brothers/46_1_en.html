Didn’t we agree (and it was your suggestion) that you
would not concern yourself with my son or I with yours?
Answer me that.</p></div>

</span><p class="lineGroup">So why is my son drinking at your house? Why do you
take him in? Why do you buy him a mistress, Micio? Isn’t
it fair that I should have the same rights with you as you
with me? Since I’m not concerning myself with your son,
don’t concern yourself with mine.</p></div>

</span><p class="lineGroup">Just listen to me a moment, if you don’t mind, Demea. In
the first place, if what’s annoying you is the money our
sons are spending, please think of it this way. You were
once bringing up the two of them according to your
means; you reckoned that your property would be sufficient
for both and at that time you presumably believed
that I would get married. Well, stick to your original plan.
