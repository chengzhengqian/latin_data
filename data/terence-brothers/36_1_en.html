(<span class="italic">pointing to Sostrata’s house</span>) is all my own fault, I admit.
Fancy not telling my father the whole story, bad as it was!
I should have persuaded him to let me marry her. You’ve
put things off long enough, Aeschinus: now you’ve got to
stir yourself! The first thing to do is to face the women
and clear myself. I’ll go up to the door. (<span class="italic">he does so</span>) Damn
it! Oh dear, I shudder every time I’m about to knock
here. (<span class="italic">plucking up courage and knocking</span>) Hello there!
Hello! It’s Aeschinus. Hurry up and open the door, somebody!
(<span class="italic">to himself</span>) There’s someone coming out. I’ll stand
aside here.</p></div>
