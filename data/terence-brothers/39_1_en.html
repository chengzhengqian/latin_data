</span><p class="lineGroup">God knows, I don’t doubt you. I know that your nature is
honourable. But I’m afraid that you are being much too
thoughtless. In what country, may I ask, do you think
you’re living? You raped a girl you had no right to touch.
That was your first wrongdoing and serious enough, but it
was human. Many good<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL023_331_34" id="target_note_LCL023_331_34">

</a> men have done the same. But
after the event, tell me, did you give the matter any
thought? Did you think of the future: what needed to be
done and how? If you were ashamed to tell me about this
yourself, how was I to find out? While you sat around doing
nothing, ten months<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL023_331_35" id="target_note_LCL023_331_35">
<sup>35</sup>
</a> have passed. You’ve betrayed
yourself and the poor girl and the child: you couldn’t have
behaved worse. Well, did you suppose the gods would
take care of this for you while you were asleep? And she
would be conducted to your home as your bride<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL023_331_36" id="target_note_LCL023_331_36">
<sup>36</sup>
</a> without
any effort on your part? I hope you won’t be equally
casual in the rest of your affairs. (<span class="italic">changing his tone again</span>)
Cheer up! You shall marry her.</p></div>
