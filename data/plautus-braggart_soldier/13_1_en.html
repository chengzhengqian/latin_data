Look at that, will you, how he’s positioned himself, worrying
and thinking with an earnest countenance. He’s
tapping his chest with his fingers, I think he’s going to call
out his heart. Look, he’s turned away; he has his left hand
leaning on his left thigh, with his right hand he’s making
calculations on his fingers, beating his right thigh. He’s<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">205</span><span class="br"></span>
beating so strongly, he can hardly think of anything to do.
He’s snapped his fingers; he’s anxious, he’s frequently
changing positions. But look, he’s shaking his head: he
doesn’t like what he’s found. Whatever it is, he won’t produce
it half-baked, he’ll give it done to a turn. But look,

anything, do it now, stay awake, stop going to sleep, unless
you prefer to keep night watches here striped with
strokes. I’m talking to you! You didn’t get drunk yesterday,
did you? Hey, I’m speaking to you, Palaestrio! Wake
up, I tell you, get up, I tell you, it’s getting light, I tell you!</p></div>
