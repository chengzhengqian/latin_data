<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc"><span class="inline">milph</span></span><p class="lineGroup noindent">But still too little.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc"><span class="inline">pal</span></span><p class="lineGroup noindent">Take heart; the whole business is shaping up well under
our hands. Just continue to give me your helpful attention,
as you’ve begun. Yes, the soldier went inside himself<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1145</span><span class="br"></span>
to ask his concubine to go away from him to Athens together
with her sister and mother.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc"><span class="inline">pleu</span></span><p class="lineGroup noindent">Well done!</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc"><span class="inline">pal</span></span><p class="lineGroup noindent">What’s more, he even gives her all the gold and jewelry
he himself provided her with as a present so that she may
leave him; that’s how I advised him.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc"><span class="inline">pleu</span></span><p class="lineGroup noindent">That’s easy, if she wants it and he desires it.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc"><span class="inline">pal</span></span><p class="lineGroup noindent">Don’t you know that it’s when you’ve climbed from a<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1150</span><span class="br"></span>
deep well up to the top that you’re in the greatest danger
of falling back down again? Now this business is being
done at the top of the well. If the soldier gets wind of it,
none of this can be fulfilled. Now we need our tricks the
most.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc"><span class="inline">pleu</span></span><p class="lineGroup noindent">I can see that there’s a forest of supply for this at home:
three women, you the fourth, I the fifth, and the old man<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1155</span><span class="br"></span>
the sixth. I know for sure, with the deceptions that belong
to the six of us any town can be taken by our trickery.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc"><span class="inline">pal</span></span><p class="lineGroup noindent">Just make an effort, all of you.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc"><span class="inline">acr</span></span><p class="lineGroup noindent">That’s why we’ve come to you, to see if you want anything.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc"><span class="inline">pal</span></span><p class="lineGroup noindent">That’s nice of you. Now I command you to undertake this
commission.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc"><span class="inline">acr</span></span><p class="lineGroup noindent">You’ll be successful, commander, with what I can do and<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1160</span><span class="br"></span>
what you wish.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc"><span class="inline">pal</span></span><p class="lineGroup noindent">I want the soldier to be made a fool of in a lovely, amusing,
and neat way.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc"><span class="inline">acr</span></span><p class="lineGroup noindent">Your command is a pleasure to me.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc"><span class="inline">pal</span></span><p class="lineGroup noindent">Do you know how?</p></div>
