for not getting any tips; then the midwife has complained
to me that she’s received too little. What? You’re not going
to give anything to the nurse feeding the slaves born
in the house?” These losses caused by women and many
others, similar to these, keep me away from a wife who’d<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">700</span><span class="br"></span>

Now I’m living well, happily, as I want, and as it pleases
me. On my death I’ll distribute my goods among my relatives,
I’ll divide them among them. They’ll be with me,
look after me, visit me to see how I am and what I want.
Before it’s light they’re present and ask me if I’ve slept
well. Those who send me gifts I treat as my children.<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">710</span><span class="br"></span>
They sacrifice; from there they give a bigger part to me
