If I disclose it, I’m dead; I’m dead all the same if I keep
quiet and if it comes out. What’s worse or more daring
than a woman? While I was on the roof, she slipped outside,
out of her quarters. She really did a daring deed. If
the soldier finds out about this, I believe he’ll crucify the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">310</span><span class="br"></span>
entire house and this man here (<span class="italic">points to himself</span>). Whatever
it is, I’ll keep mum rather than perish miserably. I
can’t guard a woman who sells herself.</p></div>
