than to themselves and bring me to the innards. They invite
me to lunch and dinner. The one who’s sent me least
considers himself the most wretched. They’re competing
among each other with their gifts, and I mutter to myself:
“They’re staring at my possessions with mouths wide<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">715</span><span class="br"></span>
open, they’re cherishing me and giving me gifts as if it
were a competition.”</p></div>
