<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc"><span class="inline">pal</span></span><p class="lineGroup noindent">So if that fellow slave of mine accuses her in front of the
soldier, saying that he’s seen her kissing someone else, I’ll
rebut him and say that he’s seen this one at your place
embracing and kissing her lover.<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">245</span><span class="br"></span></p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc"><span class="inline">per</span></span><p class="lineGroup noindent">Perfect! I’ll say the same if the soldier asks me.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc"><span class="inline">pal</span></span><p class="lineGroup noindent">But you must say that they’re absolutely alike, and Philocomasium
needs to be taught so that she knows, so she
won’t make a slip if the soldier questions her.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc"><span class="inline">per</span></span><p class="lineGroup noindent">A terribly clever trick! But if the soldier wants to see both
together, what do we do?<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">250</span><span class="br"></span></p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc"><span class="inline">pal</span></span><p class="lineGroup noindent">That’s easy: hundreds of excuses can be found: “She’s not
at home, she’s gone for a walk, she’s sleeping, she’s getting
dressed, she’s bathing, she’s having lunch, she’s having
drinks: she’s busy, she doesn’t have time, she can’t,” as
much delay as you wish, so long as we can make him believe
from the outset that the lies she’ll be telling are
true.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc"><span class="inline">per</span></span><p class="lineGroup noindent">I like it the way you tell me.<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">255</span><span class="br"></span></p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc"><span class="inline">pal</span></span><p class="lineGroup noindent">Then go in and if she’s there, have her return home
quickly, and tell her, show her, teach her this, so that she
knows how we’ve established our plans about the twin
sister.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc"><span class="inline">per</span></span><p class="lineGroup noindent">I’ll give her to you shrewdly and thoroughly instructed.
Anything else?</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc"><span class="inline">pal</span></span><p class="lineGroup noindent">Yes, go in.</p></div>
