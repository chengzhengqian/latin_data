take it, have it, carry it off. And you must say it’s high time
for her to go home. Tell her that her twin sister and
mother are here, in whose company she’ll get home all
right.</p></div>

<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc"><span class="inline">pal</span></span><p class="lineGroup noindent">The captain who brought them here said she was lying on
the ship, with bleary and swollen eyes. This captain is<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1110</span><span class="br"></span>
lodging at these people’s place.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc"><span class="inline">pyr</span></span><p class="lineGroup noindent">What about him? Is he good-looking?</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc"><span class="inline">pal</span></span><p class="lineGroup noindent">Go away, will you? You’d have made a proper stallion for
the mares, you who pursue both males and females. Now
pay attention.</p></div>

about that: you get on really well with her.</p></div>

your relatives are urging you, your friends are pushing
you.</p></div>

<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc"><span class="inline">pyr</span></span><p class="lineGroup noindent">I’ll go in then. You keep watch here in front of the house
in the meantime so that you can call me out when that
other woman comes out.</p></div>
