awake which you say seemed to do so in your sleep?
Goodness, there is your dream come true! Go in and
pray. I should think the soldier needs to be told about<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">395</span><span class="br"></span>
this.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc"><span class="inline">phil</span></span><p class="lineGroup noindent">I’m resolved to do so, and I won’t let it go unpunished
that I’ve been wrongly accused of unchastity.</p><span class="stage"><span class="italic">Exit PHILOCOMASIUM into the soldier’s house.</span></span></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc"><span class="inline">sce</span></span><p class="lineGroup noindent">I’m in fear about what I may have done wrong, my entire
back is itching so badly.</p></div>

<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc"><span class="inline">sce</span></span><p class="lineGroup noindent">Now she’s definitely at home. I’m resolved to guard our
door now, wherever she is.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc"><span class="inline">pal</span></span><p class="lineGroup noindent">But Sceledrus, please, how similar a dream to that incident<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">400</span><span class="br"></span>
she dreamed and how corresponding to your suspicion
of having seen her kissing!</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc"><span class="inline">sce</span></span><p class="lineGroup noindent">I don’t know what I should believe any longer: I don’t any
longer think I’ve seen what I believe I’ve seen.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc"><span class="inline">pal</span></span><p class="lineGroup noindent">You will indeed regain your senses when it’s too late, I

prettily.</p></div>

<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc"><span class="inline">pal</span></span><p class="lineGroup noindent">It’s been evident for a while already since she was in here
throughout.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc"><span class="inline">sce</span></span><p class="lineGroup noindent">I don’t have anything definite to say: I didn’t see her, even
if I did.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc"><span class="inline">pal</span></span><p class="lineGroup noindent">You almost ruined us with your idiocy. While you wanted
to show yourself a slave faithful to his master, you were
almost ruined. But the door of our next-door neighbor<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">410</span><span class="br"></span>
has creaked. I’ll fall silent.</p></div><notes></notes></section>
