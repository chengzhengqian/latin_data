to you than me, I’m still very grateful to you for everything.<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1355</span><span class="br"></span>
And if it were your decision, I’d much rather be
your slave than another’s freedman.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc"><span class="inline">pyr</span></span><p class="lineGroup noindent">Cheer up.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc"><span class="inline">pal</span></span><p class="lineGroup noindent">Dear me! When I think about how I shall have to change
my ways! I shall have to learn women’s ways and forget
the military ones.</p></div>

<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc"><span class="inline">pyr</span></span><p class="lineGroup noindent">And farewell to you.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc"><span class="inline">pal</span></span><p class="lineGroup noindent">Please remember not to desert me if by chance I begin
the life of a free man; I’ll send you a message.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc"><span class="inline">pyr</span></span><p class="lineGroup noindent">It isn’t my way.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc"><span class="inline">pal</span></span><p class="lineGroup noindent">Think again and again how faithful I’ve been to you. If<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1365</span><span class="br"></span>
you do this, you will at last know who is good to you and
who is bad.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc"><span class="inline">pyr</span></span><p class="lineGroup noindent">I know and I’ve often come to understand it.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc"><span class="inline">pal</span></span><p class="lineGroup noindent">But even though you’ve known it before, you’ll know it
best today. Indeed, I’ll bring it about later today that
you’ll say even more that it’s turned out true.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc"><span class="inline">pyr</span></span><p class="lineGroup noindent">I can barely refrain from ordering you to stay.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc"><span class="inline">pal</span></span><p class="lineGroup noindent">Don’t do that. People would say that you’re a liar and
not truthful, that you’re absolutely faithless; they’d say<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1370</span><span class="br"></span>
none of the slaves apart from me is faithful. Indeed, if I
thought you could do so honorably, I’d advise you to; but
it’s impossible. Don’t do it.</p></div>
