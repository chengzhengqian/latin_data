order to report to his master what has happened. He is taken

houses so that the lovers would have a secret opportunity to

in order to cajole the soldier. That man is taken in; he
hopes for a wedding, lets his concubine go, and is beaten as an<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">15</span><span class="br"></span>
adulterer.</p>
