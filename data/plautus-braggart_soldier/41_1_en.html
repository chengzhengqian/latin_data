who’d censure them would be stupid and ignorant. Now
we ought to stop such talk. Now I want to buy food, my
guest, so that I can receive you kindly in my house, as
befits you and me, nicely and with nice dishes.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc"><span class="inline">pleu</span></span><p class="lineGroup">I have put you to enough expense already: no guest can<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">740</span><span class="br"></span>
put up at such a great friend’s place that he wouldn’t be a
nuisance as soon as it’s been three days in a row; but when
it’s ten days in a row, it’s a whole Iliad<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL163_219_27" id="target_note_LCL163_219_27"><sup>27</sup></a> of hatred. Even if
the master doesn’t put up with it unwillingly, the slaves
mutter.</p></div>

me around or for me to be obliged to them. Even if
they’re upset at what I enjoy, they do their job under my
direction and they still have to do what they hate, with
beatings and against their wishes. Now I’ll continue what
I’ve begun, my shopping.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc"><span class="inline">pleu</span></span><p class="lineGroup">If you must, shop moderately, not with big expense; anything<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">750</span><span class="br"></span>
is enough for me.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc"><span class="inline">per</span></span><p class="lineGroup">Why don’t you get rid of that old, hackneyed waffle? Now
you’re using the poor man’s way of speaking, my guest:
when they’ve reclined at table and when the food has
been placed before them, they usually say: “Why was it
necessary to make such a great expense for our sake? You<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">755</span><span class="br"></span>
went crazy! This same amount would have been enough
for ten.” They find fault with what was bought for their
sake and yet they eat it up.</p></div>
