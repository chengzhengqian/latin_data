may be space to sit for someone who does want to listen.
Now as to the reason why you’ve sat down in this place of
joy, I’ll tell you both the plot and the name of the comedy<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">85</span><span class="br"></span>
we’re going to stage. In Greek this comedy has the name
<span class="italic">Alazon</span>, which we call “The Braggart” in English.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL163_153_10" id="target_note_LCL163_153_10"><sup>10</sup></a> This
city is Ephesus. That soldier is my master, the one who
went away to the forum, a boastful creature, shameless,
like dung, full of false oaths and adultery. He says that all<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">90</span><span class="br"></span>
women are running after him of their own accord; wherever
he goes, he’s everyone’s laughingstock. That’s why
the prostitutes here, while alluring him with their lips,
mostly have crooked mouths.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL163_153_11" id="target_note_LCL163_153_11"><sup>11</sup></a> I haven’t been a slave<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">95</span><span class="br"></span>
his house for long. I’d like you to know how I happened
to become this man’s slave from the man whose slave I
was before. Pay attention: now I’ll begin the plot summary.
In Athens I had an excellent young man as master.
He was madly in love with a prostitute in Attic Athens,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">100</span><span class="br"></span>
and she in turn with him. That’s the best type of love to
cultivate. He was sent to Naupactus on official business,
on a matter of great importance for the state. Meanwhile
this soldier arrives in Athens by chance and finds his way<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">105</span><span class="br"></span>
to that girlfriend of my master’s. He begins to wheedle
her mother with wine, jewelry, and lavish meals, and
that’s how the soldier comes to be on very close terms</p></div><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL163_153_10"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL163_153_10" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">10</sup>Lit. “<span class="italic">gloriosus</span>” in Latin.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL163_153_10').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL163_153_11"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL163_153_11" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">11</sup>Because while blowing him kisses they cannot suppress their
