<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc"><span class="inline">per</span></span><p class="lineGroup noindent">But however much has been placed in front of them, the
same people never say: “Have that taken away; take this
platter off; remove the ham, I don’t care for any; take<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">760</span><span class="br"></span>
that pork dumpling away, the eel is best if it’s kept cold,
remove it, go on, take it away.” You’d hear none of them
tell you this; rather, they throw themselves down, with

<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc"><span class="inline">per</span></span><p class="lineGroup noindent">For what purpose?</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc"><span class="inline">pal</span></span><p class="lineGroup noindent">When I have it, I’ll give you the rationale behind my
machinations.</p></div>
