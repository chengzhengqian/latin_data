care for what’s allowed,
only for what’s pleasurable: bribery is now sanctioned by
custom and free from the laws; through custom people
think they have the freedom to throw their shields away
and flee from the enemy. Through custom, public office<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1035</span><span class="br"></span>
is sought as a reward for criminal behavior.</p></div>
