<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">lys</span></span> I’ve always considered this to be a shield for my youth;
I’ve diligently
refrained from entering any meeting
where loss is sustained, from going around at night to<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">315</span><span class="br"></span>
meet others, from taking another’s possessions away
from him, and from upsetting you, my father. I’ve always
kept your teachings in good repair through my self-
restraint.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">phil</span></span> Why are you blaming it on me? What you did well you

<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">lys</span></span> If you’re not against it, father, I want to do a good turn
to this young chap from a family of the highest standing,
a friend and contemporary of mine, who hasn’t

his affairs very cautiously and thoughtfully.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">phil</span></span> You mean from your own funds, don’t
