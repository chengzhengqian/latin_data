<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">sta</span></span> Nothing is laid down as binding by law for them. The
laws are slaves to custom, while customs hurry to carry
off everything
both sacred and profane.</p></div>

be punished by the state?
People of this sort are opposed to each and all and harm
the entire populace. By keeping faith badly they take
away faith even from those who haven’t
done anything
wrong; the reason is that people judge the character of
one group from that of the other. You wonder how this 1050
has occurred to me? I’ve just been reminded by an actual
instance. If you lend someone something,
it’s lost instead
of being your own. When you claim it back, you find your
friend is your enemy because of your good deed. If you
begin to demand it more strongly, a choice between two
alternatives arises: either you lose what you lent, or you
lose that friend.</p></div>

<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">sta</span></span> Well, I loaned a talent to someone; with that talent I
bought myself an enemy and sold my friend. But it’s
rather stupid of me to look after public affairs instead of
looking out for my back, which is of immediate concern.
I’m going home.</p></div>
