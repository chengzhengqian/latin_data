<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">meg</span></span> And he should say that he was bringing gold to the girl as
a dowry from her father and that her father had told him
to give this gold to you. Do you catch the idea now?<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">780</span><span class="br"></span></p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">cal</span></span> Almost, and I listen to you with great pleasure.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">meg</span></span> Then at last you’ll give the gold to the young man, when
the girl has been given in marriage.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">cal</span></span> Terrifically
clever!</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">meg</span></span> This way you’ll remove all suspicions from the young
man’s mind when you’ve dug up the treasure;
he’ll think<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">785</span><span class="br"></span>
the gold was brought to you from his father, but you will
take it from the treasure.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">cal</span></span> Quite clever
and proper! Although I’m ashamed to deal
in deceit at my time of life. But when he brings those
letters all sealed, [but when he brings those letters all
sealed,] don’t
you think that this young fellow knows the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">790</span><span class="br"></span>
seal of his father’s ring?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">meg</span></span> Won’t you be quiet? Six hundred excuses can be produced
for this matter: he lost the one he had before and
made a new one; furthermore, if he doesn’t
bring them
sealed, it can be said that they were unsealed at the
custom officers’
and inspected. In business of this kind<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">795</span><span class="br"></span>
it’s sheer waste of time to use up the day with chattering.
Chattering of any length can be produced. Off with you
to the treasure
now in a hurry and in secret; send away
your male and female slaves. (<span class="italic">as Callicles turns to go</span>)
And can you hear me?</p></div>
