knew how I ought to be, but I couldn’t
do it, poor me;
that’s how I fell into ruin, bound by the power of Venus
and idle by nature. And I’m very grateful to you now, the
way you deserve.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">lys</span></span> But I can’t bear it that my effort should come to nothing<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">660</span><span class="br"></span>
in this way and that you should despise this in your heart;
at the same time I’m unhappy that you aren’t ashamed
enough; and finally,
if you don’t
listen to me and do this
the way I’m telling you, you’ll easily stand in your own
light so that Esteem can’t find you, and you’ll lie in a
hidden place when what you want most is to be well
known. I know your noble character perfectly, Lesbonicus.<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">665</span><span class="br"></span>
I know that you didn’t
go wrong on purpose, but that
Love beclouded your breast; and I myself know all of
Love’s ways. Love is like a hurled missile: nothing is as
quick, and nothing flies like it; and he makes people’s
characters stupid and difficult.
You like less what you’re<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">670</span><span class="br"></span>
more advised to do, you like what you’re advised against;
you’re keen when there’s no possibility, you don’t
want
to when you have the possibility; the man who drives you
off forces you into it, the man who recommends it forbids
it. It’s a dreadful misfortune to put up at Cupid’s
lodgings. But I urge you again and again to consider what
you’re bent on doing. If you make that destructive fire,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">675</span><span class="br"></span>
as you’re trying to, you’ll set your family on fire; then
you’ll have a desire for water in order to quench your
family again, and if you get hold of it, clever
as lovers are
