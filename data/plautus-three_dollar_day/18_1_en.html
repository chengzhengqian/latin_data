<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">phil</span></span> How did he lose it? Was he engaged in business for the

<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">lys</span></span> None of that.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">phil</span></span> Well then?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">lys</span></span> Through his generosity, father; moreover, he wasted
quite a sum on his own entertainment, indulging himself.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">phil</span></span> (<span class="italic">with irony</span>) Goodness, a man recommended in a very<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">335</span><span class="br"></span>
friendly way! He ruined his wealth in no legitimate business
and is broke now. I don’t
care for you having him as
your friend with virtues of this kind.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">lys</span></span> Because he’s without any bad disposition, I want to support
him in his poverty.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">phil</span></span> A man who gives a beggar something
to eat or drink does
him bad service:
what he gives him gets wasted and he<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">340</span><span class="br"></span>
prolongs his life in misery. My saying this doesn’t
mean
that I don’t
want what you want or that I wouldn’t
do it
with pleasure;
but when I’m saying this word against that
particular fellow, I’m advising you beforehand to have
pity on others only to the extent that others won’t have
to have pity on you.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">lys</span></span> I feel shame to desert him and to fail to act in his misfortune.</p></div>
