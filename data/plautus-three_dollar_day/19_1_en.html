<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">lys</span></span> Thanks to the gods—I may say so, father—and to our
ancestors and to you, we have much property, acquired
well, so that, if you’ve done a friend a good turn, you
shouldn’t
be upset to have done so, and so that you
should rather feel shame if you haven’t
done so.</p></div>

away from great wealth, does it get
more or less?
lys Less, father; but don’t
you know the ditty one usually has<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">350</span><span class="br"></span>
for a citizen not doing his duty? “May you not have what
you have now, and may you have what you don’t
have
now, a thrashing, since you can’t bear it that either you
yourself or someone else should have a good time.”</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">phil</span></span> I know that’s what usually happens; but, my son, that
man isn’t
doing his duty who has no money with which

want.</p></div>
