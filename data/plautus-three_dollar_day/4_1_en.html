today
I shall remonstrate with a friend of mine for a wrong
committed, and I’ll do so against my will, but my sense
of loyalty requires me to do so. Well, a plague has made
sad inroads upon moral standards here, so much so that
they’re pretty much all dead by now. But in the meantime,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">30</span><span class="br"></span>
while they were ill, moral laxity has sprung up in
great abundance like well-watered
weeds. You can now
harvest an enormous crop of it, and nothing is cheap
here these days apart from moral laxity. A part of the
people hold the favor of a minority in higher esteem here<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">35</span><span class="br"></span>
than what benefits
the majority. In this way expedience
is sacrificed
to the desire for favor, which is obstructive
in many things, is hateful, and hinders personal and public
welfare.</p></div>
