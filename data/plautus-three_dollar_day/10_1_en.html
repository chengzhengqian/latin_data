alone, he entreated me in tears by our friendship and by
my good faith that I shouldn’t
entrust this to his son or<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">155</span><span class="br"></span>
to anyone from whom it could leak out to him. Now if he
returns here safely, I’ll return his possessions to him; if
anything happens to him, I certainly have the means to
give a dowry to his daughter, who was entrusted to me,
so that I can give her in a marriage worthy of her.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">meg</span></span> Immortal gods, how quickly you have, with a few words,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">160</span><span class="br"></span>
turned me into a different man from the one that had
come to you! But as you’ve begun, go on speaking.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">cal</span></span> Why should I tell you how that good-for-
nothing
almost
ruined completely his father’s wisdom, my trustworthiness,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">165</span><span class="br"></span>
and all our secrets?</p></div>

he advertised this house for sale in my absence, without

<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">meg</span></span> The wolf waited until the dogs were drowsy. He got hungrier<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">170</span><span class="br"></span>

<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">cal</span></span> He would have done so, if this dog hadn’t

But now I want to ask you in turn: what was it my duty

the treasure
to him, against his father’s entreaties, or
should I have allowed another to become master of this
