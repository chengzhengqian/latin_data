name before sunrise, it would be bedtime before you
reach the last.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">char</span></span> From what you say, one needs to provide a travel fund
in the case of a name like yours.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">syc</span></span> There’s a tiny other one, like a wine label.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">char</span></span> What’s your name, young man?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">syc</span></span> “Presto,” that’s my name. This is the one for everyday<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">890</span><span class="br"></span>

<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">char</span></span> Goodness, an absurd name! As if you were saying that if
I were to entrust anything to you, “presto”—it would be
gone at once. (<span class="italic">aside</span>) This chap is an impostor through

<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">char</span></span> Tell me, what do those people you’re looking for owe
you?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">syc</span></span> The father of that young chap, Lesbonicus, has given me
these two letters. (<span class="italic">shows them</span>) He’s a friend of mine.<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">895</span><span class="br"></span></p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">char</span></span> (<span class="italic">aside</span>) I’ve got him cornered. He says that I have given
him the letters. I’ll make fun of him in style.</p></div>

telling you in the

<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">syc</span></span> (<span class="italic">holding up the letters one by one</span>) He told me to give
this letter to his son Lesbonicus, and he also told me to
give this other one to his friend Callicles.</p></div>
