wife herself: there’s never anything she can keep silent
about. Why are you standing around now? Why don’t
you
remove yourself from here and get a move on? Open it,
take out a sufficient

from there, and close it again at once; but in secret, as<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">805</span><span class="br"></span>
I’ve instructed you; throw everybody
out of the house.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">cal</span></span> Yes, I’ll do so.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">meg</span></span> But really, we’re talking for far too long, we’re wasting
the day when haste is needed now. There’s no reason for

<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">meg</span></span> I’ll hire an impostor from the forum at once, I’ll put a<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">815</span><span class="br"></span>
seal on two letters at once, and I’ll send him here to the
young chap well primed.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">cal</span></span> I’ll go inside to my duty then. You, carry this out.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">meg</span></span> I’ll make sure that the trick is carried out to perfection.</p></div>
