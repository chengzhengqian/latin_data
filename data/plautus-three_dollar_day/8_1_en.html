<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">cal</span></span> I do and I did. In order that you should believe this to
be the case, I give you a fact as proof: after his son ruined
his wealth here and he saw that he himself had been
dragged down to poverty, that his daughter was a grown-<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">110</span><span class="br"></span>

young woman, and that her mother and his wife was
dead, at the time when he was about to go to Seleucia,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL328_133_4" id="target_note_LCL328_133_4"><sup>4</sup></a>
he entrusted me with his virgin daughter, his entire possessions,
and that decadent
son of his. If he were my<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">115</span><span class="br"></span>
enemy, I trust he wouldn’t
have trusted me with this.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">meg</span></span> Well then? Why don’t
you change the young man back
and bring him back to responsible behavior, when you
can see that he’s decadent
and when he was entrusted to
your faith and reliability? This is what would have been
far more appropriate for you to take care of, to see if you<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">120</span><span class="br"></span>
could in any way make him more decent, not to succumb
to the same notoriety yourself and mix his depravity with
yours.</p></div>
