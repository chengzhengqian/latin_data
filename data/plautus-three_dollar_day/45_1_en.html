<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">char</span></span> (<span class="italic">aside</span>) This chap belongs to the mushroom variety:
he’s
completely covering himself with his own head. His appearance
seems Illyrian,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL328_207_32" id="target_note_LCL328_207_32"><sup>32</sup></a> that’s the dress he’s coming
in.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">syc</span></span> (<span class="italic">aside</span>) When the man who hired me hired me, he took
me home, told me what he wanted, and taught and
showed me first how I should do everything;
now then,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">855</span><span class="br"></span>
if I add anything more, my employer will get that much
more trickery for his money. I am dressed the way he
dressed me; the money does this. He himself borrowed
this costume from the stage manager at his own risk. If
I can now cheat him out of the costume, I’ll bet that he<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">860</span><span class="br"></span>
realizes that I’m an impostor through and through.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">char</span></span> (<span class="italic">aside</span>) The more I look, the less I like his appearance. I
wouldn’t
be surprised if he’s a night prowler<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL328_207_33" id="target_note_LCL328_207_33"><sup>33</sup></a> or a cutpurse.
He’s examining the area, looking around himself,
and acquainting himself with the houses. I do believe
he’s spying out places where he can soon come to steal.
I’m all the keener to observe what he’s up to; that’s what<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">865</span><span class="br"></span>
I’ll give my attention to.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">syc</span></span>  (<span class="italic">aside</span>) That employer of mine showed me this area; this
is the house at which my tricks must be set on foot. I’ll
knock at the door.</p></div>
