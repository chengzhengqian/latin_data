<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">cal</span></span> You ask? I guard my own breast against committing an
offense; but suspicion resides in another’s breast. For
instance, if I were to suspect now that you’ve stolen the
crown from the Capitoline Temple from the head of
Jupiter, who stands on the rooftop:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL328_131_3" id="target_note_LCL328_131_3"><sup>3</sup></a> if you hadn’t<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">85</span><span class="br"></span>
done
this and if I still wished to suspect it, how could you
prevent me from suspecting it? But I’m keen to know
what’s troubling you.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">meg</span></span> Do you have any friend or intimate who possesses sound<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">90</span><span class="br"></span>
sense?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">cal</span></span> I’ll tell you frankly: there are people whom I know to be
friends, there are people whom I suspect to be friends,
and there are people of whom I can’t find out whether
their minds and hearts belong to the side of friend or foe;
but of my certain friends you are the most certain. If you<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">95</span><span class="br"></span>
know that I’ve done something
in a foolish or inappropriate
way and if you don’t
reproach me for it, you deserve
to be rebuked yourself.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">meg</span></span> I know, and if I’ve come here to you for any other reason,
you have cause for complaint.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">cal</span></span> I’m waiting to see if you’re going to say anything.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">meg</span></span> Well, first of all you’re commonly defamed in conversations:
your fellow citizens call you greedy for dishonest<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">100</span><span class="br"></span>
gain; then again there are others who call you a vulture,
claiming that you care little whether you eat up foreigners
or citizens. When I hear this being said against you,
I agonize over it, poor me.</p></div>
