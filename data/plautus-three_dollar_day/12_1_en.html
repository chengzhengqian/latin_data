<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">meg</span></span> There really isn’t
anything more stupid and more idiotic,
or more lying and more garrulous, or speaking more<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">200</span><span class="br"></span>
boldly and with perjury, than the unremitting city-folks
they call the men about town. And I count myself in the
same category, since I swallowed the false words of those
who pretend to know everything
and don’t
know anything.<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">205</span><span class="br"></span>
They know what the king said into the queen’s ear,
they know what Juno<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL328_141_7" id="target_note_LCL328_141_7"><sup>7</sup></a> talked about with Jupiter; they
know what everyone
has or will have in mind; and what
won’t be and isn’t
the case, they know it all the same.
They don’t
care a straw whether it is rightly or wrongly<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">210</span><span class="br"></span>
that they praise and find fault with anyone they wish, so
long as they may know whatever they like. All mortals
said that Callicles here was unworthy of the community
and of himself, since he’d cheated this young man out of
his possessions. Moved by the words of these gossips I<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">215</span><span class="br"></span>
rushed forth without investigation in order to reproach
an innocent friend. But if the authority for the claim
were examined down to its very roots, from where they
say they’ve heard everything,
and if it were a matter of
fine and punishment for the gossip if he couldn’t
produce
his source, well, if it were like that, it would be for<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">220</span><span class="br"></span>
the public benefit,
I’d bet there would be few people
who know what they don’t
know, and that they’d keep
their foolish talk more to themselves.</p></div>
