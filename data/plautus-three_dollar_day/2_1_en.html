<p class="noindent">The stage represents a street in Athens. On it is the house of
Charmides, with a small annex attached to it; this annex can be
reached through a separate door. The houses of Megaronides
and Philto are offstage, the former to the right and the latter to
the left; at least the house of Philto is close by. To the left the
street leads to the harbor and to the right to the city center.</p>
