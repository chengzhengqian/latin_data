said “I promise”; now here, when there is a need, he can’t
speak.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">les</span></span> I’m very grateful to all of you, Philto, for considering me<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">505</span><span class="br"></span>
worthy of a connection with you. But even if my situation
has turned out harshly through my own stupidity, Philto,
we still have a plot of land here below the city; this I’ll
give to my sister as a dowry: this alone is the sole remainder
of my wealth, apart from my life.<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">510</span><span class="br"></span></p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">phil</span></span> I honestly don’t
care about the dowry.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">les</span></span> I’m resolved to give her one.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">sta</span></span> Master, do you want to take our nurse away from us, the
one who nurtures us? Please don’t
do that. What will we
ourselves eat afterward?</p></div>

<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">sta</span></span> (<span class="italic">aside</span>) We’re plainly dead unless I think up something.
(<span class="italic">aloud</span>) Philto, I want to speak to you.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">phil</span></span> If you want anything, Stasimus. </p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">sta</span></span>  Walk over here a bit.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">phil</span></span> All right. (<span class="italic">they withdraw a little</span>)</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">sta</span></span>  I’m telling you this in secret; neither he nor anyone else
should know this from you.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">phil</span></span> Entrust me boldly with anything you wish.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">sta</span></span> I beg you by gods and men, don’t
ever let that land become<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">520</span><span class="br"></span>
yours or your son’s. I’ll tell you the reasons for
this.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">phil</span></span> I’m keen to hear them.</p></div>
