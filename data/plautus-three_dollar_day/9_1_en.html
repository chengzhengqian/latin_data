<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">meg</span></span> To what faithlessness the young fellow was entrusted!
Haven’t
you given him a sword with which to kill himself?
What else is it, what difference is there, when you<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">130</span><span class="br"></span>
give a lovesick young man without self-restraint
money
into his hands, with which he can complete building the
ruin he has begun?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">cal</span></span> Shouldn’t
I have paid him?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">meg</span></span> No, you shouldn’t
have, and you shouldn’t
have bought
or sold anything from him or given him the means to be<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">135</span><span class="br"></span>
even more depraved. Haven’t
you got the man who was
entrusted to you into trouble and haven’t
you thrown the
man who entrusted him to you out of his house? Goodness,
the job was placed into your care beautifully and
carried out properly! Trust this chap with the guardianship:
he’ll look after his own interests better.</p></div>

and forcing me unexpectedly, so that what was secretly
entrusted to my silence, my faith and reliability, so that
I shouldn’t
tell anyone or make it known—so that I can’t
avoid entrusting it to you now.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">meg</span></span> Whatever you entrust me with you’ll be able to recover<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">145</span><span class="br"></span>

<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">cal</span></span> Just look around you to make sure that we don’t

go abroad, he showed me a treasure
