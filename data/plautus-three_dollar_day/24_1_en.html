me, I haven’t

you deserve it. But as I said: my son has asked me to<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">450</span><span class="br"></span>
request your sister as his wife.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">les</span></span> It’s right for me to understand the status

with my financial

skirmisher on
horseback, but as the noun is derived from <span class="italic">ferre</span>, “bring,” Plautus treats
it as if it still had the meaning “someone who brings (help).” This fits with the etymology in Paul. <span class="italic">Fest</span>. 75 L., while the ones in Varro and
Festus are slightly different (<span class="italic">ling.</span> 7.57: a soldier carrying weapons;
Fest. 506 L.: a servant bringing weapons and drink to soldiers). The
modern derivation from ferire, “to strike,” is morphologically problematic.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL328_165_17a').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
