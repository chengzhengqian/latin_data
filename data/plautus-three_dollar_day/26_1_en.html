<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">sta</span></span> I’ll tell you without guile: I’ll step aside for him from the
street, from the path, from public office;
<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL328_169_21" id="target_note_LCL328_169_21"><sup>21</sup></a> but as far as
my stomach is concerned, not this far (<span class="italic">indicates with his</span>
<span class="italic">fingers</span>), unless he wins against me with his fists. With
the present high prices a dinner is an inheritance without
sacrifices.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL328_169_22" id="target_note_LCL328_169_22"><sup>22</sup></a></p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">phil</span></span> Lesbonicus, always make sure that you consider it to be<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">485</span><span class="br"></span>
best to be the best yourself; if you can’t be that, at least
that you should be next to the best. Now, Lesbonicus, I
want you to grant and accept this match which I’m bringing
to you and seeking from you. Only the gods are rich,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">490</span><span class="br"></span>
and displays of power and connections are only appropriate
for the gods; but we are mere men: as soon as we
let go of the little seed of our soul, the beggar in his death
is rated with an equal rating in the Underworld as the
richest of men.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">sta</span></span> (<span class="italic">aside</span>) It’s a wonder that you don’t
take your riches there<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">495</span><span class="br"></span>
with you. When you’re dead, you should be so in the full
sense of the word.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">phil</span></span> (<span class="italic">to Lesbonicus</span>) Now so that you may know that connections
and means don’t
count here and that it’s your
friendship that matters to us, I ask for your sister to
marry my son without a dowry. May this turn out well—<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">500</span><span class="br"></span>
have I got it settled? Why are you silent?
sta Immortal gods, what a match!</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">phil</span></span> (<span class="italic">to Lesbonicus</span>) Why don’t
you say, “may the gods grant
it success, I promise her to him”?</p></div>
