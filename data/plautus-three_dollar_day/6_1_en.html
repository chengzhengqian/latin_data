<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">cal</span></span> (<span class="italic">with irony</span>) Yes, for you will have taken me by surprise,
I suppose.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">meg</span></span> Seriously, I’ll make sure that you know exactly what
you’ve done.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">cal</span></span> Keep her as you’ve got hold of her: the evil that’s known
is the evil that’s best; if I were to take on an unfamiliar
one now, I wouldn’t
know what to do.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">meg</span></span> Yes, one lives best in the way to which one has grown<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">65</span><span class="br"></span>
accustomed. But pay attention and stop your jokes; I’ve
come here to you with a definite
errand.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">cal</span></span> Why have you come?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">meg</span></span> In order to reproach you a lot with a lot of harsh words.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">cal</span></span> Me?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">meg</span></span> There isn’t
anyone here apart from me and you, is
there?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">cal</span></span> No.<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">70</span><span class="br"></span></p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">meg</span></span> Then why do you ask if it’s you that I’m reproaching?
Unless you think that I’m going to denounce myself.
Well, if your old ways are sick within you, [if you wish to
change your character because of the habits of this age,]
or if the habits of this age are changing your character
and you aren’t preserving those old ones, but taking
on new ones, you’ll inspire a grave affliction
in all<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">75</span><span class="br"></span>
your friends, so that it’ll make them sick to see and hear
you.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">cal</span></span> Why did you come up with the idea of saying those
words?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">meg</span></span> Because all good men and women
ought to make sure
that they keep suspicion and offense away from themselves.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">cal</span></span> Not both of these things can be done.<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">80</span><span class="br"></span></p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">meg</span></span> Why?</p></div>
