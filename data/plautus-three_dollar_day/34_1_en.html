enough, I can see well enough for myself what’s in my

<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">lys</span></span> Is this being intelligent, to reject a good turn from someone
wishing you well?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">les</span></span> I don’t
consider a good turn something
that the person
for whom you do it doesn’t
like. I know and understand
myself what I’m doing, my mind doesn’t
evade its duty,
and I won’t be deterred by your words from having regard<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">640</span><span class="br"></span>

can now cover up your mistakes through this deed? Ha!
It doesn’t
work like that. Do get hold of virtue and drive<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">650</span><span class="br"></span>
your laziness from your heart. Apply yourself to your
male friends in the forum, not to your girlfriend in bed,
which is what you do at the moment. And I earnestly
desire that that land should remain with you, for the
simple reason that you should have the means to mend
your ways, so that the citizens you have as your enemies
can’t cast your abject poverty in your teeth.</p></div>
