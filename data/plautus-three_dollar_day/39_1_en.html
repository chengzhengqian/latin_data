<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">meg</span></span> The way you tell me the story, Callicles, it’s absolutely
necessary that a dowry be given to the girl.<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">730</span><span class="br"></span></p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">cal</span></span> al Yes, it really cannot happen in any decent way that I
should allow her to get married without dowry, when I
have her father’s money with me at home.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">meg</span></span> The dowry is ready at home; unless you want to wait for<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">735</span><span class="br"></span>
her brother to give her in marriage without dowry. You
might go to Philto later and say that you’d give her a
dowry and that you’d do this out of friendship with her
father. But I’m afraid that that promise would expose you
to accusation and ill repute with the people. They’d say<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">740</span><span class="br"></span>
that it’s not without good reason that you’re generous
toward the girl; that you were given a dowry by her father
to pass on to her, that you were giving her only a part of
it, and that you weren’t
handing it over to her intact, as
it was given to you; and they’d say that you’d taken something
away. Now if you want to wait for the arrival of
Charmides, it’ll be a very long time; in the meantime this<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">745</span><span class="br"></span>
chap will lose interest in marrying her, and this match is
absolutely first-rate
for her.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">cal</span></span> Yes, all your points come to my mind as well. See if you
find it more useful and to the point that I should approach
Lesbonicus himself and inform him what the
situation is like. But should I now point out the treasure<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">750</span><span class="br"></span>
to an untameable young man full of love and licentiousness?
No, absolutely not: I know for sure, he’ll even eat
up that entire place where it’s buried. I’m afraid to dig it
up, in case he might hear the sound and ferret the matter<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">755</span><span class="br"></span>
out, if I should say I’m providing a dowry.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">meg</span></span> Then how can the dowry be taken out in secret?</p></div>
