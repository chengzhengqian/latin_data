there to be anyone on earth whose reliability and trustworthiness
toward his friend equals yours: had it not
been for you, he’d have dispossessed me of this house.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">cal</span></span> If I did a good turn to a friend or looked after his interests
reliably, I don’t
think that I’ve deserved praise,
merely that I’ve remained free from reproach; a gift<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1130</span><span class="br"></span>
that’s given to someone outright is lost at once, but what’s
given as a loan you may demand back whenever you
wish.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">char</span></span> It’s as you say. But I can’t wonder enough that he engaged
his sister into such a powerful family.<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1135</span><span class="br"></span></p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">cal</span></span> Yes, to Lysiteles, the son of Philto.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">lys</span></span> (<span class="italic">aside</span>) Well, he’s mentioning me.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">char</span></span> He’s secured an excellent family.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">lys</span></span> (<span class="italic">aside</span>) Why am I hesitating to address them? But I’d
better keep waiting, I think, because he’s beginning to
say such an agreeable thing.</p></div>

<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">cal</span></span> What is it?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">char</span></span> I forgot to tell you a while ago: just now, on my arrival,
some trickster crossed my way, an absolutely classic impostor;
he said he was bringing one thousand gold Philippics<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1140</span><span class="br"></span>
provided by me to you and my son Lesbonicus; I
didn’t
know who he is and I’ve never seen him before.</p><p class="lineGroup">But why are you laughing?</p></div>
