destroy you, if I care one straw about whether you’d
been killed earlier. I’ve received my money for this job
and you can have my curse; as for everything
else, I
couldn’t
care less who you are and who you aren’t. I’ll go<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">995</span><span class="br"></span>
to the fellow who gave me the three dollars and report,
so that he knows that he’s lost them. I’m off. Live and
fare badly! May all the gods ruin you on your arrival from
abroad, Charmides!</p></div>

my breast for some time now, what business he had in
front of my house: that letter and those one thousand
Philippics marshal fear in my heart about what they’re
up to. A bell never rings without a cause; unless someone<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1005</span><span class="br"></span>
pulls at it or moves it, it’s silent and quiet. But who is this
who is running into the street here? I’m keen to observe
what he’s up to; I’ll go over here. (<span class="italic">does so</span>)</p></div>
