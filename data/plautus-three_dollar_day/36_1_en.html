your enemy. But while you’re chiding me, you’re hurrying<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">680</span><span class="br"></span>
me from my errors onto an even worse road. You
advise me to give you my sister without a dowry. Ah! It
isn’t
appropriate that I, who have squandered my father’s
enormous wealth, should continue to live in riches and
have a plot of land, and that she, by contrast, should be
poor, so that she’d hate me deservedly. Someone who
forfeits respect among his own family will never possess
influence
among strangers. I’ll do as I told you; I don’t<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">685</span><span class="br"></span>

my own sister to you into concubinage rather than marriage,
if I were to give her to you without dowry. Who
would be considered to be more worthless than me? This
rumor would bring honor to you and disgrace to me, if
you were to marry her without dowry. You would have
an advantageous position of honor, I would have something
they could cast in my teeth.</p></div>
