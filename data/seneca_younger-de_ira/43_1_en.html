Or are they, on the contrary, all despised and loathsome and ugly, and for this and no other reason are feared? So anger is in itself only repulsive and is by no means to be dreaded, yet most people fear it just as children fear a repulsive mask. And what of the fact that fear always recoils upon those who inspire it and that no one who is feared is himself unafraid? You may recall in this connexion the famous line of Laberius:</p>

There is no reason, then, why any wise man should desire to be feared, nor should he think that anger is a mighty thing simply because it arouses dread, since even the most contemptible things, such as poisonous brews<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL214_191_c" id="target_note_LCL214_191_c"><sup>c</sup></a> and noxious bones<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL214_191_d" id="target_note_LCL214_191_d"><sup>d</sup></a> and bites are likewise feared.
