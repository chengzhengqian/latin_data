oft-repeated indulgence and surfeit has arrived at a disregard for mercy and has expelled from the mind every conception of the human bond, it passes at last into cruelty. And so these men laugh and rejoice and experience great pleasure, and wear a countenance utterly unlike that of anger, making a pastime of ferocity.</p>
<p>When Hannibal saw a trench flowing with human blood, he is said to have exclaimed, “O beauteous sight!” How much more beautiful would it have seemed to him if the blood had filled some river or lake! What wonder, O Hannibal, if you, born to bloodshed and from childhood familiar with slaughter, find especial delight in this spectacle? A fortune will attend you that for twenty years will gratify your cruelty, and will everywhere supply to your eyes the welcome sight; you will see it at Trasumennus and at Cannae, and last of all at your own Carthage! Only recently Volesus, governor of Asia under the deified Augustus, beheaded three hundred persons in one day, and as he strutted among the corpses with the proud air of one who had done some glorious deed worth beholding, he cried out in Greek, “What a kingly act!” But what would he have done if he had been a king? No, this was not anger, but an evil still greater and incurable.</p><p>“If,” some one argues, “virtue is well disposed toward what is honourable, it is her duty to feel anger toward what is base.” What if he should say that virtue must be both low and great? And yet this is what he does say—he would have her be both exalted and debased, since joy on account of a right action is splendid and glorious, while anger on account of another’s sin is mean and narrow-minded.
