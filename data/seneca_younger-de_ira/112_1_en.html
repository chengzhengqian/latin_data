although we have been aroused by mere trifles, we continue to be angry for fear that we may seem to have had no reason to be so from the first, and—what is most unjust—the very injustice of our anger makes us the more obstinate.

For we become angry at our dearest friends because they have bestowed less than we anticipated, and less than they conferred upon another; and yet for both troubles there is a ready remedy. More favour has been shown another; then let us without making comparison be pleased with what we have. That man will never be happy whom the sight of a happier man tortures. I may have less than I hoped for; but perhaps I hoped for more than I ought.
