if it can find no other way to harm, equally hating and hated. Or, if you will, let us take the picture from our poets:</p>
<p class="lineGroup">
<span class="line">Flaunting her bloody scourge the War-dame strides,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Or Discord glorying in her tattered robe.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL214_249_a" id="target_note_LCL214_249_a"><sup>a</sup></a></span><span class="linebreak"></span>

<p>Or make you any other picture of this dread passion that can be devised still more dread.</p><p>As Sextius remarks, it has been good for some people to see themselves in a mirror while they are angry; the great change in themselves alarmed them; brought, as it were, face to face with the reality they did not recognize themselves. And how little of the real ugliness did that image reflected in the mirror disclose! If the soul could be shown, if it were in some substance through which it might shine, its black and mottled, inflamed, distorted and swollen appearance would confound us as we gazed upon it. Even as it is, though it can only come to the surface through flesh, bones, and so many obstacles, its hideousness is thus great—what if it could be shown stark naked? You may perhaps think that no one has really been frightened out of anger by a mirror. Well, what then? The man who had gone to the mirror in order to effect a change in himself was already a changed man; while men remain angry no image is more beautiful than one which is fierce and savage, and they wish also to look the sort they wish to be.</p>
<p>This, rather, is what we ought to realize—how many men anger in and of itself has injured. Some through too much passion have burst their veins, a shout that strains our strength has carried with it blood, and too powerful a rush of tears to the eyes
