Now the cause of anger is an impression of injury, and to this we should not easily give credence. We ought not to be led to it quickly even by open and evident acts; for some things are false that have the appearance of truth. We should always allow some time; a day discloses the truth. Let us not give ready ear to traducers; this weakness of human nature let us recognize and mistrust—we are glad to believe what we are loth to hear, and we become angry before we can form a judgement about it. And what is to be said when we are actuated, not merely by charges, but by bare suspicions, and having put the worse interpretation on another’s look or smile, become angry at innocent men? Therefore we should plead the cause of the absent person against ourselves, and anger should be held in abeyance; for punishment postponed can still be exacted, but once exacted it cannot be recalled.</p><p>Every one knows the story of the tyrannicide who having been arrested before he had finished his task was put to torture by Hippias<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL214_215_b" id="target_note_LCL214_215_b"><sup>b</sup></a> in order that he might be forced to reveal his accomplices; whereupon he named the friends of the tyrant who were gathered around him, the very ones to whom, as he knew, the safety of the tyrant was especially dear. After Hippias had ordered them to be slain one by one, as they were named, he asked whether there was still any other. “No,” said the man, “you alone remain; for I have left no one else who cares anything about you.” The result of his anger was that the tyrant lent his might to the tyrant-slayer and slew his own protectors with his own sword.</p>
