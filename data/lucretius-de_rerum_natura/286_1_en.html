the bronze comes between, all this quarrel is caused, because doubtless when the current from the bronze has come first and taken possession of the open channels of the iron, afterwards comes the current<span class="marginNote right">the bronze partictes having filled the pores in the iron first.</span>
from the stone to find all full in the iron, and no way to swim through as it had before: it is therefore compelled to beat and buffet the iron texture with its flood; and in this way it rejects from itself and sets moving through the bronze that which without the bronze it often sucks back.</p>
<span class="innerMarginNote left">1056</span><p>In this connexion, you must not allow yourself<span class="marginNote right">Some things are unaffected by the magnet;</span>
to feel surprise that the current from this stone has not the power to propel other things also. For some stand firm by their weight, of which kind is gold; while others, because they are of a body so porous that the current flies through unresisted, cannot be propelled anywhere, in which kind the substance of<span class="marginNote right">but iron is driven away only when bronze particles have come in first.</span>
wood is seen to be. Between the two, then, nature of iron, and when it receives certain minute bodies of bronze, the result is that the magnet stones tides have drive it by their flow.</p>

other things that I could not find good store of similar examples to hand which I might mention, of things that have affinity for each other and for nothing else. Firstly you see stones cemented by mortar<span class="marginNote right">stones and mortar, wood and bull’s glue,</span>
