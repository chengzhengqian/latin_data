When this has let itself down upon the land and dissolved, it vomits forth a prodigious violence of whirlwind and storm. But because this rarely happens at all, and on land the mountains must get in the way, this same is seen more often upon the sea with its wide prospect and open sky.</p>

the sky above a large number of flying bodies have suddenly come together, which are rougher and, though they are entangled in a slight degree, are yet able to hold together in mutual attachment. These first cause small clouds to be formed; then these<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL181_527_b" id="target_note_LCL181_527_b"><sup>b</sup></a> take hold together and cluster together, and by combining together grow, and are carried along by the winds until the time when a wild tempest arises.</p>

mountain-tops are to heaven, so much the more busily in their lofty place they smoke with the thick blackness of a dust-coloured cloud; because, when the clouds first take their being, before the eye can see them, so thin they are, the winds drive and carry them together to the mountain-tops. Now at length gathered together in greater mass and packed together they are able to show themselves, and appear at the same time to rise from the very peak
