the breaking-up of things, by this time the bodies of matter would have been so reduced by the breakings of ages past, that from them nothing could within any fixed time be conceived and attain the full maturity of its life. For we see that anything can more quickly be dissolved than it can be remade again; therefore what all the long ages of infinite time past, disturbing and dissolving, had broken up before now, could never be made new in the time remaining. But as it is, in fact there remains appointed a fixed limit for the breaking, since we see each thing being remade, and at the same time definite periods fixed for things after their kind, in which they may attain the flower of life.</p>

matter are perfectly solid, yet it is possible to give an explanation how all those things which are soft—air, water, earth, fire<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL181_47_a" id="target_note_LCL181_47_a"><sup>a</sup></a>—are formed, and by what force each is directed, when once void is intermingled in things. But contrariwise, if the first-beginnings of things were soft, no explanation will be possible to say out of what hard flints and iron could be produced; for all nature will utterly lack a foundation to begin upon. Therefore they are mighty by their solid singleness, and, by a denser combination of these, all things can be more closely packed and show hard strength.</p>
