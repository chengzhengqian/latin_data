over the whole sea is made clear, when clothes are hung up on the shore and absorb the sticky moisture: which makes it more likely that many bodies can gather upwards to swell the clouds from the salt movement of the ocean, since there is a complete kinship between both these moistures.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL181_529_a" id="target_note_LCL181_529_a"><sup>a</sup></a></p>

starry ether presses on them from above, and by them down! packing them close seems to weave a texture of cloud beneath the blue.</p>

It is no wonder then if often within a short time tempest and darkness overhanging above cover up sea and land with storm-clouds so great, since from all quarters through all the passages of the ether, and as it were through the breathing-channels of the great world around, there are comings-in and goings-out for the elements.</p>
