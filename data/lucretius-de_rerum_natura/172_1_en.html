the nature of each living body seeks its own food untaught. I have shown<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL181_345_a" id="target_note_LCL181_345_a"><sup>a</sup></a> you in fact that many bodies are thrown off flowing from things in many ways, but most must be thrown off from living creatures; for since these are always in quick movement, and many bodies are pressed out from their depths in sweat, many are exhaled through the mouth when they pant from exhaustion, by these means therefore the body becomes rarefied and its whole nature is undermined; and on this pain follows. For this reason food is taken, that it may prop up the frame and recreate the strength by filling the interstices, and may stop up the gaping desire to eat throughout limbs and veins.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL181_345_ba" id="target_note_LCL181_345_ba"><sup>b</sup></a> Fluid also passes into all the different parts that demand fluid, and the bodies of<span class="marginNote right">drink quenches the inward parching.</span>
