from the truth. They say<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL181_33_aa" id="target_note_LCL181_33_aa"><sup>a</sup></a> that water yields to the<span class="marginNote right">out Void, by changing places; but how could the motion begin without room?</span>
pressure of scaly creatures and opens liquid ways, because fish leave room behind them for the yielding waves to run together; that so other things also are able to move in and out and to change place, although all is full. You must know that this has been accepted on reasons wholly false. For whither, I ask, will the scaly fish be able to move forward, unless the water shall give place? Into what place, again, will the water be able to move back, when the fish will be unable to go? Either then all bodies must be deprived of movement, or we must say that void is intermingled in things, as a result of which each thing may begin to move.</p>

after contact, of course it is necessary that air take possession of all the void which is made between the bodies. Further, however swiftly this air may run together with currents hurrying all around, yet the space will not be able to be filled all at one time; for the air must occupy each point of space in succession before the whole is occupied. But if by<span class="marginNote right">nor indeed could air be condensed between them without Void.</span>
chance anyone thinks that this happens at the moment when the bodies have leapt asunder because the air becomes compressed, he goes astray; for in that case a void is made which was not there before, and a void also is filled which was there before; nor can air be compressed in such a way, nor, granting that it could, could it, I think, without void withdraw into itself and condense its parts together.</p>

many objections, confess you must, nevertheless, that there is void in things. Many another proof besides
