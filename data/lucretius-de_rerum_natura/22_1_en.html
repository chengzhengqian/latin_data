<span class="innerMarginNote left">520</span><p>Then further, if there were nothing void and<span class="marginNote right">(3) the universe consists of both Body and Void, and so there must be definite bodies, which because they contain no Void, are indis-soluble;</span>
empty, the universe would be solid; unless on the other hand there were definite bodies to fill up the places they held, then the existing universe would be vacant and empty space. Therefore without doubt body is marked off from void alternately, since the universe is not completely full nor yet empty. There are therefore definite bodies to mark off empty space from full. These can neither be dissolved by blows when struck from without, nor again be pierced inwardly and decomposed, nor can they be assailed and shaken in any other way, as I have shown you above a little while ago.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL181_45_a" id="target_note_LCL181_45_a"><sup>a</sup></a> For it is seen that without void nothing can be crushed, or broken, or split in two by cutting, nothing can admit liquid or again percolating cold or penetrating fire, by which all things are destroyed. And the more each thing holds void within it, so much the more thoroughly it is shaken when these things attack it. Therefore, if the first bodies are solid and without void, as I have taught, these must be everlasting.</p>
<span class="innerMarginNote left">540</span><p>Besides, unless matter had been everlasting,<span class="marginNote right">(4) if not, all things would have come to nothing, and been renewed from nothing;</span>
before this all things would have returned utterly to nothing, and whatever we see would have been born again from nothing. But since I have shown above<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL181_45_b" id="target_note_LCL181_45_b"><sup>b</sup></a> that nothing can be produced from nothing and what has been made cannot be brought back to nothing, there must be first-beginnings of immortal body, into which each thing can be resolved at its last moment, that matter may be forthcoming for the renewal of things. The first-beginnings are therefore of solid singleness, nor can they in any other way be preserved
