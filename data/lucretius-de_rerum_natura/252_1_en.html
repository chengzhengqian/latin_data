receives the lightning, it is suddenly kindled and burns up with a loud din, as if the mountains were covered with laurel, and a flame were driven over by a tempest of winds, consuming them with mighty rush; and there is no other thing that burns with more terrible sound in the crackling flames than the Delphic laurel of Phoebus.</p>

the eyes see the lightning is that things always take longer to reach the ears than to produce vision. The truth of this you may understand from another experience: if you should see someone at a distance cutting down a well-grown tree with a double-headed axe, you see the stroke before its thud sounds in your ears; so also we see lightning before we hear the thunder, which is produced at the same time and by the same cause as the fire and born of the same collision.</p>
