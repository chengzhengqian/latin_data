dark room: you will see many minute particles mingling in many ways throughout the void<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL181_105_a" id="target_note_LCL181_105_a"><sup>a</sup></a> in the light itself of the rays, and as it were in everlasting conflict struggling, fighting, battling in troops without any pause, driven about with frequent meetings and partings; so that you may conjecture from this what it is for the first-beginnings of things to be ever tossed about in the great void. So far as it goes, a small thing may give an analogy of great things, and show the tracks of knowledge.</p>
<span class="innerMarginNote left">125</span><p>Even more for another reason it is proper that you give attention to these bodies which are seen to be in turmoil within the sun’s rays, because such turmoil indicates that there are secret and unseen motions also hidden in matter. For there you will see how many things set in motion by unseen blows change their course and beaten back return back again, now this way, now that way, in all directions. You may be sure that all take their restlessness from<span class="marginNote right">and indeed the motes derive their motion from the atoms.</span>
the first-beginnings. For first the first-beginnings of derive°their things move of themselves; then the bodies that form a small combination<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL181_105_b" id="target_note_LCL181_105_b"><sup>b</sup></a> and, as one may say, are atoms, nearest to the powers of the first-beginnings, are set moving, driven by the unseen blows of these, while they in their tum attack those that are a little larger. Thus the movement ascends from the first-beginnings and by successive degrees emerges upon our senses,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL181_105_c" id="target_note_LCL181_105_c"><sup>c</sup></a> so that those bodies also are moved which we are able to perceive in the sun’s light, yet it does not openly appear by what blows they are made to do so.</p>
