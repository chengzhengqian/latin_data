the earth with terrifying blackness. But this is very far removed from true reasoning. For when the sun, acting upon the exposed body of water, was unable to make it hot on its upper part, although his light above is possessed of heat so great, how could he when under so gross a body of earth boil the water through the earth and soak it with warming heat? Especially when he can scarcely make his warmth pass through the walls of a house for all his burning rays.</p>
<span class="innerMarginNote left">861</span><p>How comes it then? Assuredly because the<span class="marginNote right">because the earth is there porous, and contracting by night presses its heat into the spring;</span>
ground keeps more porous about the spring than the rest of the earth, and there are many seeds of fire near the body of water. Therefore when night has overwhelmed the earth with its dewy waves, the earth suddenly grows cold to the heart and contracts; in this fashion, as though compressed by a hand, it presses out into the spring whatever seeds of fire it has, which cause the warm touch and heat of the water. Next when the sun rising has stirred apart<span class="marginNote right">but when the sun opens the pores of the earth, the heat returns to the earth.</span>
the earth with his rays and made it porous as his warming heat mingles with it, the first-beginnings of fire return to their ancient places, and all the heat’ warmth of the water passes into the earth. For this reason the spring becomes cold in the daylight.</p>
<span class="innerMarginNote left">874</span><p>Besides, the fluid of the water is tossed about<span class="marginNote right">The sun also shakes the water and makes it porous.</span>
by the sun’s rays, and the quivering heat makes it the porous at the coming of light; for which reason it discharges all its seeds of fire, just as water often discharges the cold which it contains, and melts the ice and loosens its knots.</p>
