For the very nature of divinity must necessarily enjoy<span class="marginNote right">But the gods dwell apart in eternal peace,</span>
immortal life in the deepest peace, far removed and separated from our affairs; for without any pain, without danger, itself mighty by its own resources, needing us not at all, it is neither propitiated with services nor touched by wrath.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL181_147_a" id="target_note_LCL181_147_a"><sup>a</sup></a> The earth indeed<span class="marginNote right">and earth has no felling, but contains many elements.</span>
lacks sensation at all times, and only because it receives into itself the first-beginnings of many things does it bring forth many in many ways into the sun’s light. Here if anyone decides to call the sea Neptune, and corn Ceres, and to misapply the name of Bacchus rather than to use the title that is proper to that liquor, let us grant him to dub the round world Mother of the Gods, provided that he forbears in reality himself to infect his mind with base superstition.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL181_147_ba" id="target_note_LCL181_147_ba"><sup>b</sup></a></p>

are woolly sheep and the warrior breed of horses and horned herds of cattle, beneath the same canopy of heaven, and quenching thirst from one river of water, which live each in a different shape and each race keeps its parents’ nature and imitates their ways after its kind: so great a diversity of matter is there in each kind of herbage, so great in each river.</p>
<span class="innerMarginNote left">669</span><p>Hence also any animal of them all is made up<span class="marginNote right">one creature contains different constituents,</span>
of bones, blood, veins, warmth, fluid, flesh, sinews; which are also things very different, made of first-beginnings that have dissimilar shapes.</p>
