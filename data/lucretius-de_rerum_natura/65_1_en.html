shapes. Amongst the first in this class, diamond stones, for example, stand in the front rank, accustomed to despise blows; and stout stone and the strength of hard iron, and bronze sockets that shriek out as they resist the bolts. Those others, the fluids<span class="marginNote right">liquids,</span>
which consist of liquid body, must be of elements smoother and rounder. Indeed you may scoop up poppy seed as easily as water, for the individual round particles are no hindrance to each other; and when poppy seed is knocked over, it runs downhill just as readily.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL181_131_a" id="target_note_LCL181_131_a"><sup>a</sup></a> Lastly, all that you see dispersing in a moment of time, as smoke and clouds and flame,<span class="marginNote right">smoke,</span>
if not wholly made of smooth and round elements, must at least necessarily not be hampered by elements entangled, that they may be able to sting the body and penetrate stones<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL181_131_b" id="target_note_LCL181_131_b"><sup>b</sup></a> without clinging together; so that you may easily recognize that whatever we see to be spiky to the senses consists of elements sharp but not entangled. But it should be no marvel that you see the same things both bitter and fluid, as the brine of the sea; for being fluid it consists<span class="marginNote right">sea water</span>
of smooth and round elements, and many rough bodies that cause pain are intermingled with them; and yet it is not necessary that these be held together by hooks: you must know that they are round although they are rough, so that they can roll on and at the same time hurt the senses. And to show you more clearly that there are rough elements<span class="marginNote right">indeed the</span>
