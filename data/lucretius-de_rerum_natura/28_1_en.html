and sound in those fires of theirs,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL181_57_b" id="target_note_LCL181_57_b"><sup>b</sup></a> or you will find that all things return utterly into nothing, and that from nothing the supply of things is born again and lives. Now therefore, since there are certain most definite bodies which preserve their nature always the same, by the going and coming of which and their changed order things change their nature and bodies transform themselves, we may be sure that these elements of things are not made of fire. For it will be of no use that some should separate and depart, and others be added, and some change place, if nevertheless all retained the nature of fire; for whatever they should make would be altogether fire. But, as I think, the truth is this: there are certain bodies which by their concurrences, motions, order, positions, shapes, produce fire, and which, when their order is changed, change the nature of the thing, and are not like fire, nor like any other thing that can emit particles to the senses and by impact touch our sense of touch.</p>
<span class="innerMarginNote left">690</span><p>Further, to say that all things are fire, and that<span class="marginNote right">(4) this theory defles the senses, our final court of appeal;</span>
there exists no true thing in the number of things except fire, as this same man does, appears to be raving madness. For on the basis of the senses he himself fights against the senses, and shakes the credit of that upon which all belief depends, by which this very fire as he names it is known to himself; for he believes that the senses can truly perceive fire, but not the other things which are no less clear: which seems to me to be at once folly and raving. For to what shall we appeal? What can we find more certain than the senses themselves, to mark for us truth and falsehood?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL181_57_c" id="target_note_LCL181_57_c"><sup>c</sup></a></p>
