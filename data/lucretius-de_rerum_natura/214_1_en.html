stars which revolve for vast years<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL181_429_a" id="target_note_LCL181_429_a"><sup>a</sup></a> in vast orbits, may move driven by airs this way and that way. Do you not see also that clouds driven by contrary winds in contrary directions move in layers, the lower<span class="marginNote right">as we see with clouds.</span>
contrary to the upper? Is it not equally possible that those constellations can be carried by contrary tides through the great orbits of the ether?</p>
<span class="innerMarginNote left">650</span><p>But night buries the earth in vasty blackness,<span class="marginNote right">Night comes, (1) because the sun is put out each day, (2) or because he travels under the earth.</span>
either when the sun after his long course has struck upon the extremity of the sky and breathed out his fires in weariness, shaken by the journey and made weak by passing through so much air; or because he is compelled to turn round his course beneath the earth by the same force which carried his orb above the earth.</p>
<span class="innerMarginNote left">656</span><p>At a fixed time also Matuta<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL181_429_b" id="target_note_LCL181_429_b"><sup>b</sup></a> diffuses the rosy<span class="marginNote right">Dawn comes, (1) either because the coming sun sends rays before him; (2) or because his fires gradually collect,</span>
dawn through the regions of ether and spreads out her light, either because the same sun returning under the earth takes his first hold on the sky as he tries to kindle it with his rays, or because there is a gathering together of fires, and many seeds of heat are accustomed to flow together at a fixed time, which make each day the light of a new sun arise: just as it is said that from the lofty mountains of Ida<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL181_429_ca" id="target_note_LCL181_429_ca"><sup>c</sup></a> at sunrise scattered fires are seen, and then as it were these gather together into one globe and together form an orb.</p>
<span class="innerMarginNote left">666</span><p>Yet here it must not be thought wonderful that these seeds of fire can flow together at so fixed a time and restore the brightness of the sun: for we see many things that come to pass at a fixed time
