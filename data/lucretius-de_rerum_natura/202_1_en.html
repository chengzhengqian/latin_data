things have been the same before, but that the generations of men have perished in scorching heat, or that their cities have been cast down by some great upheaval of the world, or that after incessant rains rivers have issued out to sweep over the earth and overwhelm their towns, so much the more you must own yourself worsted, and agree that destruction will come to earth and sky. For when things were assailed by so great afflictions and so great dangers, if then a more serious cause had come upon them, there would have been widespread destruction and a mighty fall. And in no other way are we seen to be mortal than that we see one another fall sick of the same diseases as those whom nature has taken away from life.

Delia Valle in maintaining that Amafinius and Lucr. were contemporaries, his arguments, though important, are not entirely convincing. But if indeed Amafinius had written earlier than Lucr., why does Lucr. ignore him? The answer may be that Amafinius’ works were brief and dealt mainly with ethical doctrine, and that Lucr. was the first Latin writer to give a detailed account of Epicurean physics.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL181_405_ca').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL181_405_d"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL181_405_d" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">d</sup>So the afflictions of the earth prove its mortality.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL181_405_d').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
