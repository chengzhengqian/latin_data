grow from nothing; for youths would be made on a sudden from small infants, and trees would leap forth suddenly arising out of the earth. But manifestly none of these things takes place, since all things grow little by little, as is proper, from a fixed seed, and in growing<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL181_19_a" id="target_note_LCL181_19_a"><sup>a</sup></a> preserve their kind; so that you may infer that every kind grows and is nourished from its own proper material.</p>

in the year the earth cannot put forth her cheering fruits, nor furthermore can living things kept apart from food beget their kind and preserve life; so that you may more readily believe many bodies to be common to many things, as we see letters to be common to words, than that anything can exist without first-beginnings.</p>

Therefore we must confess that nothing can come from nothing, since all things must have seed, from which each being created may be brought forth into the soft breezes of air.</p>
