meadows shone with the colour of green; then to the various kinds of trees came a mighty struggle, as they raced at full speed to grow up into the air. As feathers and hair and bristles first grow on the frame of four-footed creatures or the body of strong-winged birds, so then the new-born earth put forth herbage and saplings first, and in the next place<span class="marginNote right">then living creatures by different processes.</span>
created the generations of mortal creatures, arising in many kinds and in many ways by different processes. For animals cannot have fallen from the sky, nor can creatures of the land have come out of the salt pools.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL181_441_a" id="target_note_LCL181_441_a"><sup>a</sup></a></p>

First the race of winged things and the different birds issued from their eggs being hatched in the springtime, just as now in summer the cicadas of their own accord leave their neat husks, to seek life and living.
