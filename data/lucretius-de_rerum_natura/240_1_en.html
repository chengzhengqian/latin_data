The she-lions enraged bounded this way and that, and leapt straight for the faces of those that met them, or tore at others unawares from behind, and clasping them close bore them to the ground helpless from the wound, holding fast to them with strong jaws and curving claws. The bulls tossed their own friends and trampled them underfoot, and laid bare flanks and bellies of horses, striking from below with their horns, and scored up the earth with threatening in­tent.

But he and other commentators are mistaken in thinking that Lucr. is writing of primitive times, as is shown by the mention of <span class="italic">vinclis</span> (1312) and <span class="italic">tela</span> (1327). The <span class="italic">arma antiqua</span> were hands, nails, teeth, stones, branches, and fire (1283-1285); the discovery of metals came later. On the other hand, 1339 implies that the experiments with bulls, boars, and lions are supposed to have occurred before the introduction of elephants. As for the allegation that the passage is “fantastic,” even if there were no authority for stories of such experiments, Lucr., in accordance with the Epicurean belief that developments are made gradually by a process of trial and error, might reasonably have thought it unlikely that men immediately made successful experiments with one wild animal, the elephant, and did not try other fierce beasts (<span class="italic">cf.</span> 1269-1272, on experiments with metals). However, there is no need to suppose that the whole story is a flight of the poet’s imagination: <span class="italic">cf. S.H.A., Antoninus</span> <span class="italic">Caracalia</span> 6.4: <span class="italic">dehinc per Cadusios et Babylonios ingressus tumultuarie cum Parthorum satrapis manum contulit, feris etiam bestiis in hostes inmissis.</span> The passage could perhaps be regarded as unnecessarily long and detailed, if Lucr. were interested merely in giving a straightforward account of an experimental stage in the development of military techniques. But surely he is, as so often in this last section of Book 5, also making a moral point: whereas primitive men (see 982-993) ran away <span class="italic">spumigeri suis adventu validique leonis</span> (985) and occasionally an individual became the victim of a wild beast, in more recent times men deliberately instigated these animals to kill wholesale. The suggestion that his account was partly inspired by contemporary <span class="italic">venationes</span> (see K. L. McKay, <span class="italic">AJPhil.</span> 85 [1964] 125-126) is highly probable. See also S. R. West, <span class="italic">Philol.</span> 119 (1975) 150-151.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL181_481_aa').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL181_481_b"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL181_481_b" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">b</sup>By “crests ” Lucr. almost certainly means the lions’ natural manes, not artificial crests (see E.
