The moon, when furthest from the sun, is perceived by us as at the full, the earth being between sun and moon (but not in the same straight line). As it approaches the sun, we see less and less of its light; when it is opposite to us, the lines from the earth to sun and moon forming a right angle, it is half full; when nearest to the sun, the lines forming an obtuse angle, we see nothing. When all three are in one straight line, there is an eclipse either of sun or of moon.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL181_433_c').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
