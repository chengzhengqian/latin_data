different food is suited to different creatures, and why what is sour and bitter for some may yet seem very delicious to others. Indeed, there is so great a difference and distinction in these things that what is food to some creatures, is to others rank poison. Thus there is even a serpent, which when touched by manâ€™s spittle perishes and gnaws itself to death.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL181_327_a" id="target_note_LCL181_327_a"><sup>a</sup></a> Besides, hellebore is rank poison to us, but given to goats and quails makes them fat.</p>
<span class="innerMarginNote left">642</span><p>That you may know how this comes about, in<span class="marginNote right">(1) because there are many different seeds in the food,</span>
the first place you must remember what I said before,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL181_327_b" id="target_note_LCL181_327_b"><sup>b</sup></a> that things contain many seeds mingled in various ways. Further, all creatures that take food, as they are different in outward appearance, and as the contour and circumscription of their shape limits and defines each according to its kind, so they are composed of seeds differing in shape. Since further<span class="marginNote right">(2) and the channels also differ in shape.</span>
    the seeds differ, the intervals and channels, which we call passages, must also differ throughout the frame and so also in mouth and palate. Some therefore must be smaller and some larger, some triangular and some square, many round, some again with many angles in many arrangements. For as the relation of shapes and as the motions demand, so the shapes of the passages must differ, and so the channels must vary as the texture compels.<span class="marginNote right">So what suits one does not suit another;</span> Therefore if what is sweet to some is bitter to others, for the creature to whom it is sweet very smooth bodies
