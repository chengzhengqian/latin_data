So when the image of the mirror has first thrown itself forwards, while it is on the way to our eyes, it pushes and drives all the air that is between itself and our eyes, and makes us able to perceive all this before we perceive the mirror; but when we have perceived the mirror itself also, at once the image which is carried from us to the mirror reaches it, and being flung back, comes back to our eyes, rolling and propelling before it another air, and makes us see this before we see itself; and that is why it seems to be withdrawn so far off from the mirror.
