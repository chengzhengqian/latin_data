For all the mass of matter must be stirred up together through the whole body, in order that thus stirred up together it may all with one combined effort follow the passion of the mind; thus you may see that the beginning of motion is made by the intelligence, and the action moves on first from the will of the mind, then to be passed onwards through the whole body and limbs.</p>
