demands: therefore they must all be carried with equal speed, although not of equal weight, through the unresisting void. So the heavier bodies will never be able to fall from above on the lighter, nor deal blows of themselves so as to produce the various motions by which nature carries on her processes. Therefore again and again I say, the bodies must<span class="marginNote right">thus the swerve is necessary,</span>
incline a little; and not more than the least possible, or we shall seem to assume oblique movements, and thus be refuted by the facts. For this we see to be manifest and plain, that weights, as far as in them lies, cannot travel obliquely, when they drop straight from above, as far as one can perceive; but who is there who can perceive that they never swerve ever<span class="marginNote right">and it is possible.</span>
so little from the straight undeviating course?</p>

and new motion arises out of the old in order invariable, and if the first-beginnings do not make by swerving a beginning of motion such as to break the decrees of fate, that cause may not follow cause from infinity, whence comes this free will in living creatures all over the earth, whence I say is this will wrested from the fates by which we proceed whither pleasure leads each, swerving also our motions not at fixed times and fixed places, but just where our mind has taken us?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL181_115_a" id="target_note_LCL181_115_a"><sup>a</sup></a> For undoubtedly it is his own will<span class="marginNote right">Motion begins in the will or mind, which acts on the limbs.</span>
