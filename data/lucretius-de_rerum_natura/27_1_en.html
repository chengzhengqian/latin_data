various, if they are made of fire pure and simple; for it would be of no use that hot fire should become denser or rarefied, if the particles of fire still had the same nature as the whole fire has also; for the heat would be more intense with the particles compressed, but more faint if they were thrust apart and scattered apart: there is nothing else but this that you can suppose to be possible in such conditions, much less could there be all this variety of things produced from density or rarity of fire.</p>

void be mixed within things, fire will then be able to grow dense and be left rare; but because they see many things that fight against them, and they shrink from leaving pure void in things, while they fear the steep they lose the true path; nor again do they perceive that, if void be taken from things, all are condensed together and all become one mass, unable to emit anything briskly from itself, as burning fire throws off light and heat, so that you may see that it does not consist of closely crowded parts.</p>
