You may be sure that this is what happens, when clouds are thick and at the same time piled high one above another in a wonderful mass, that you may not be deceived because from below we see more readily how wide they are than how far they extend piled upwards. For do but apply your scrutiny when the winds carry clouds like mountains across through the air, or when you see them piled about the great mountains one above another, pressing down from above, and lying still with the winds deep buried on every side: then you will be able to recognize the great masses of them,<span class="marginNote right">in masses of cloud</span>
