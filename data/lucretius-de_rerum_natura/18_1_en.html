bodies are and through which they move this way and that. For sensation common to men declares that body has its separate existence<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL181_37_a" id="target_note_LCL181_37_a"><sup>a</sup></a>; and unless our belief in sensation is first firmly established, there will be no principle of appeal in hidden matters, according to which we may establish anything by the reason.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL181_37_b" id="target_note_LCL181_37_b"><sup>b</sup></a> Then further, if there were no place and space which we call void, bodies could not be situated anywhere nor could they move anywhere at all in different directions, as I have already shown you above a little while ago.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL181_37_c" id="target_note_LCL181_37_c"><sup>c</sup></a></p>
<span class="innerMarginNote left">430</span><p>Besides, there is nothing which you can call<span class="marginNote right">There is no third nature; for if it can be touched, it is Body, if not, it is Void:</span>
wholly distinct from body and separate from void, to be discovered as a kind of third nature.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL181_37_d" id="target_note_LCL181_37_d"><sup>d</sup></a> For whatever is to be, that must be something in itself; and if it shall be sensible to touch however light and small, it will increase the quantity of body by some increment either great or small if you will, provided it do exist, and will go to make up the sum. But if it shall be intangible, being unable to forbid anything to pass through it in motion at any point, undoubtedly this will be that which we call empty void. Besides, whatever shall exist of itself will either act upon something, or will necessarily be<span class="marginNote right">if it acts or is acted upon, it is Body; if things can be done in it, Void:</span>
passive itself while other things act upon it, or it will be possible that things be and be done in it. But nothing can act or be acted upon without body, nothing can afford space but the void and the empty.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL181_37_e" id="target_note_LCL181_37_e"><sup>e</sup></a>
