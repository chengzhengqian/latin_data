of their streams, and earth, cherished by the sun’s heat, renews its produce, and the generation of living things springs up and flourishes, and the gliding fires of heaven do live; which they would by no means do, unless a store of matter could arise up out of the infinite, from which they are accustomed to replace in season all that has been lost. For as the nature of animals, deprived of food, wastes away, losing its body, so all things must be dissolved away as soon as matter, turned somehow from its course, has ceased to be supplied. Nor can blows from without on all sides conserve the whole of every world which has been formed by the union of atoms. They can indeed batter it frequently, and delay one part until others shall come and the sum can be filled up; yet they<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL181_87_a" id="target_note_LCL181_87_a"><sup>a</sup></a> are compelled sometimes to rebound and thereby to give the first-beginnings of things ample time and space to escape, so that they can fly clear away from their combination. Therefore again and again I say, it is necessary that they should arise up in large numbers; indeed, in order that even the blows themselves be supplied, there is need of an infinite quantity of matter on all sides.</p>

However, D. J. Furley, <span class="italic">BICS</span> 13 (1966) 16–23, following E. Bignone, has argued that Lucr. does not have the Stoics in mind at all, but only the Peripatetics. Since Lucr.’s argument is no doubt derived from Epicurus, who probably <span class="italic">was</span> arguing chiefly against Aristotle (so far as we know, Epicurus himself did not attack the Stoics), it is natural that it should be most applicable to the Peripatetic form of the theory, but it is hard to believe that Lucr., writing at a time when Stoicism was his school’s chief rival, did not aim it at the Stoics at all, even if it was not relevant to the Stoic view in every detail. Epicurean writers did not always present the views of their opponents fully and fairly.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL181_87_ba').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
