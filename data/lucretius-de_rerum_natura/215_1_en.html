No less at a fixed time our age commands the teeth to fall out, and bids the ungrown youth to put on the soft vestures of growth and to let his beard grow equally down either cheek. Lastly lightnings, snow, rain, clouds, and winds come at fairly fixed seasons of the year. For since the first-beginnings of causes have been<span class="marginNote right">the causes being constant , and the effects following.</span>
so, and since things have thus befallen from the first beginning of the world, with regular sequence also they now come back in fixed order.</p>
