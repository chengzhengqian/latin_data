has never existed apart by itself nor will ever have force to do so, since it is essentially a part of something else, a first part with unity of its own, and then other and other like parts, each in its own place, in close formation fill up the nature of the atom; and since these cannot exist separately, they must necessarily so adhere to the whole that they cannot by any means be torn away.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL181_51_aa" id="target_note_LCL181_51_aa"><sup>a</sup></a> The first-beginnings, therefore, are of solid singleness, made of these smallest parts closely packed and cohering together, not compounded by the gathering of these parts, but strong rather by their eternal singleness, and from these nature allows nothing to be torn away or diminished any longer, but keeps them as seeds for things.</p>

each littlest<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL181_51_b" id="target_note_LCL181_51_b"><sup>b</sup></a> body will consist of infinite parts, since of course a half of the half of anything will always have a half of its own, and there will be no limit to the division. Then what difference will there be between the sum of things and the least of things? There will be no difference; for although the whole sum of things be absolutely infinite, yet the bodies which are littlest will equally consist of infinite parts.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL181_51_c" id="target_note_LCL181_51_c"><sup>c</sup></a> But since true reasoning protests against this, and denies that the mind can believe it, you must yield and confess that there are things which no longer consist of any parts and are of the smallest possible
