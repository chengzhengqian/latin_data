impious deeds: as when at Aulis<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL181_11_a" id="target_note_LCL181_11_a"><sup>a</sup></a> the altar of our Lady of the Crossways<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL181_11_b" id="target_note_LCL181_11_b"><sup>b</sup></a> was foully defiled by the blood of Iphianassa, shed by chosen leaders of the Danai, chieftains of the host. So soon as the ribbon<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL181_11_c" id="target_note_LCL181_11_c"><sup>c</sup></a> had bound her maiden tresses falling in equal lengths down either cheek, so soon as she saw her father standing sorrowful before the altar, and by his side attendants hiding the knife, and the people shedding tears at the sight of her, dumb with dread, she sank to the ground upon her knees. Alas, poor girl! no help could it be to her at such a time that the name of father had been bestowed on the king first by her; for uplifted by the hands of men, all trembling she was brought to the altar, not that amidst solemn and sacred ritual she might be escorted by loud hymeneal song, but a clean maiden to fall by unclean hands at the very age of wedlock, a victim sorrowful slain by a father’s hand: all in order that a fair and fortunate release might be given to the fleet. So potent was Superstition in persuading to evil deeds.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL181_11_d" id="target_note_LCL181_11_d"><sup>d</sup></a></p>
