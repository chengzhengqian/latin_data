But when the intelligence is moved by more vehement<span class="marginNote right">but when deeply moved, it affects the spirit, and through this the body.</span>
fear, we see the whole spirit throughout the frame share in the feeling: sweatings and pallor hence arise over the whole body, the speech falters, the voice dies away, blackness comes before the eyes, a sounding is in the ears, the limbs give way beneath<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL181_201_a" id="target_note_LCL181_201_a"><sup>a</sup></a>; in a word we often see men fall to the ground for mental terror; so that everyone may easily recognize from this that the spirit is conjoined with the mind, and when this has been smitten by the mind’s power, straightway it strikes and drives forward the body.</p>
<span class="innerMarginNote left">161</span><p>This same reasoning teaches that the nature<span class="marginNote right">Mind and spirit are bodily, since they act upon the body, which can be done only by touch,</span>
of mind and spirit is bodily; for when it is seen to drive forward the limbs, to arouse the body from sleep, to change the countenance, to guide and steer<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL181_201_b" id="target_note_LCL181_201_b"><sup>b</sup></a> the whole man, and we see that none of these things can be done without touch, and further that there is no touch without body, must we not confess that mind and spirit have a bodily nature? Besides you perceive the mind to suffer along with the body, and<span class="marginNote right">and the body acts upon the mind.</span>
to share our feeling in the body. If the grim force of a weapon driven deep to the dividing of bones and sinews fails to hit the life, yet a languor follows and a blissful<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL181_201_ca" id="target_note_LCL181_201_ca"><sup>c</sup></a> fall to the ground, and upon the ground a turmoil that comes about in the mind, and sometimes a kind of hesitating desire to rise. Therefore the nature of the mind must be bodily, since it suffers by bodily weapons and blows.</p>
