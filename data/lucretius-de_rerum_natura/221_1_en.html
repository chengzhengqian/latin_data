Earth gave food for the children, warmth gave the raiment, the herbage, a bed with abundance of down rich and soft.

So therefore time changes the nature of the whole world, and one state of the earth gives place to another, so that what she bore she cannot, but can bear what she did not bear before.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL181_443_b" id="target_note_LCL181_443_b"><sup>b</sup></a></p>
