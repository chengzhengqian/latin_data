seem to be round at a distance, yet it is better that<span class="marginNote right">It is better to allow that reasoning may be at fault than to break up the foundations of reason and life.</span>
one who finds no reason explain the shape of either figure in a faulty manner, rather than anywhere to let slip from your hands the holdfast or the obvious,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL181_317_a" id="target_note_LCL181_317_a"><sup>a</sup></a> and to break the credit from which all begins, and to tear up all the foundations upon which life and existence rest. For not only would all reasoning come to ruin, but life itself would at once collapse, unless you make bold to believe the senses, avoiding precipices and all else that must be eschewed of that sort, and following what is contrary. Therefore, believe me, vain is all that array of words which has been prepared and marshalled against the senses.</p>

warped, if the square is faulty and deviates from straight lines, if the level is a trifle wrong in any part, the whole house will necessarily be made in a faulty fashion and be falling over, warped, sloping, leaning forward, leaning back, all out of proportion, so that some parts seem about to collapse on the instant, and some do collapse, all betrayed by false principles at the beginning. So therefore your reasoning about things must be warped and false whenever it is based upon false senses.</p>
