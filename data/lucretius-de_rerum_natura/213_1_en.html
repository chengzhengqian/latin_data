how the moon is seen to traverse month by month the space which the sun’s course takes a year to travel. No single reason, I say, is given for these things.</p>

which the venerable judgement of that great man Democritus puts forward<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL181_427_b" id="target_note_LCL181_427_b"><sup>b</sup></a>: that the nearer the different heavenly bodies are to the earth, the less can they be carried along with the whirling sky, since the swiftness of force in that movement vanishes away and its power grows less in the lower regions, and so the sun is gradually left behind with the signs that are behind him, because he is much lower than the burning signs<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL181_427_ca" id="target_note_LCL181_427_ca"><sup>c</sup></a> And the moon, he says, still more than this: in proportion as her course is still lower, farther from the sky and nearer the earth, so much the less can she keep up with the<span class="marginNote right">This would explain why the moon seems to move back-wards through the signs.</span>
signs; and in proportion as she is carried with fainter whirling movement, being lower than the sun, so much the sooner do the signs catch her up all around and pass by. That is why she seems to move back to each sign more quickly, because it is the signs that more quickly return to her.</p>

across the sun’s path two airs may flow alternately each at its own fixed time, one strong enough to push him away from the summer signs as far as the midwinter solstice and the stiffening cold, one to throw him back from the icy shades of cold as far as the regions full of heat and the burning signs.
