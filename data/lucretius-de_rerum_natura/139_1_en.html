of the mind, from what elements it takes its strength when combined with the body, and how when torn away from the body it returns to its first elements, you shall now see me begin to deal with what is of high importance for this subject, and to show that there exist what we call images<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL181_279_ba" id="target_note_LCL181_279_ba"><sup>b</sup></a> of things; which, like films<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL181_279_c" id="target_note_LCL181_279_c"><sup>c</sup></a> drawn from the outermost surface<span class="marginNote right">Images or films are thrown off from the surface of things.</span>
of things, flit about hither and thither through the air; it is these same that, encountering us in wakeful hours, terrify our minds, as also in sleep, when we often behold wonderful shapes and images of the dead, which have often aroused us in horror while we lay languid in sleep<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL181_279_d" id="target_note_LCL181_279_d"><sup>d</sup></a>; lest by chance we should think that spirits escape from Acheron or ghosts flit about amongst the living, or that anything of us can be left after death, when body and mind both taken off together have dissolved abroad, each into its own first-beginnings. I say, therefore, that semblances and thin shapes of things are thrown off from their outer surface. This can be recognized by the dullest brain from what follows.</p>
