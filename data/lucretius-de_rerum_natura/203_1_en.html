The door of death therefore is not closed for the heavens, nor for sun<span class="marginNote right">therefore it is mortal.</span>
and earth and the deep waters of the sea, but stands open and awaits them with vast and hideous maw. Therefore also you must confess that these same things have had their birth; for things which are of mortal body could not have despised the mighty strength of immeasurable ages from infinite time up to this present.</p>
