now from this part, now from that, burst the fires out of the clouds and rush along; it is a common thing for the fiery bolt to fall on the earth.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL181_113_a" id="target_note_LCL181_113_a"><sup>a</sup></a></p>

to understand: that while the first bodies are being carried downwards by their own weight in a straight line through the void, at times quite uncertain and uncertain places, they swerve a little from their course, just so much as you might call a change of motion.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL181_113_ba" id="target_note_LCL181_113_ba"><sup>b</sup></a> For if they were not apt to incline, all would fall downwards like raindrops through the profound void, no collision would take place and no blow would be caused amongst the first-beginnings: thus nature would never have produced anything.</p>
<span class="innerMarginNote left">225</span><p>But if by chance anyone believes it to be<span class="marginNote right">All atoms fall at the same speed through the void;</span>
possible that heavier elements, being carried more quickly straight through the void, fall from above on the lighter, and so deal blows which can produce generative motions, he is astray and departs far from true reasoning. For whatever things fall through water and through fine air, these must speed their fall in accordance with their weights, because the body of water and the thin nature of air cannot delay each thing equally, but yield sooner overcome by the heavier; but contrariwise empty void cannot offer any support to anything anywhere or at any time, but it must give way continually, as its nature

Lucr.’s account (216-293) is the fullest which we have. Epicurus, influenced above all by Aristotle, rejected the determinism of Democritus and believed in the freedom of the individual will, and the theory of the atomic swerve was designed to explain free will (see 251-293) as well as to account for collisions between atoms moving through the void.
