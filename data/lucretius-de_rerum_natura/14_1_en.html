to be growing less because they are rubbed away; but what particles are separated on each occasion, our niggardly faculty of sight has debarred us from proving.</p>

little adds to things, compelling them to grow in due measure, no keenness of sight, however strained, can perceive; nor further when things grow old by age and wasting, nor when rocks hanging over the sea are eaten away by the gnawing salt, could you discern what they lose upon each occasion. Therefore nature works by means of bodies unseen.</p>
<span class="innerMarginNote left">329</span><p>Yet everything is not held close and packed<span class="marginNote right">There is also Void</span>
everywhere in one solid mass, for there is void in things: which knowledge will be useful to you in many matters, and will not allow you to wander in doubt and always to be at a loss as regards the universe and to distrust my words. Therefore there is intangible space, void, emptiness.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL181_29_a" id="target_note_LCL181_29_a"><sup>a</sup></a> But if there<span class="marginNote right">or (1) things could not move,</span>

But as it is, we discern before our eyes, throughout seas and lands and the heights of heaven, many things moving in many ways and various manners, which, if there were no void, would not so much lack altogether their restless motion, as never would have been in any way produced at all, since matter would have been everywhere quiescent packed in one solid mass.</p>
