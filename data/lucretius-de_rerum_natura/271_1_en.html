<span class="innerMarginNote left">655</span><p>For is there any of us who feels wonder, if someone has got into his limbs a fever that gathers with burning heat, or any other pain from disease seeds which throughout his body? For the foot suddenly swells, a sharp aching often seizes the teeth, or invades the eyes themselves, the accursed fire<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL181_543_a" id="target_note_LCL181_543_a"><sup>a</sup></a> appears creeping over the body and burning each part it takes hold on, and crawls over the limbs, assuredly because there are seeds of many things, and this earth and sky produce enough noxious disease that from it may grow forth an immeasurable quantity of disease.
