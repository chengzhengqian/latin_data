amours and the parturition of wild beasts is plainly too ridiculous—immortal spirits awaiting mortal frames in number numberless, and struggling together in hot haste which first and foremost shall creep in; unless perhaps the spirits have contracts so arranged, that the spirit which comes flying up first may creep in first, and they need not come to blows one whit.</p>

clouds be in the deep sea, nor fish live in the fields, nor can blood be in sticks nor sap in rocks. It is fixed and arranged where each thing is to grow and have its being. So the nature of the mind cannot arise alone without body, nor exist far from sinews and blood. But if it could do this, the power of the mind itself could much more easily be in head or shoulders or the heels of the feet, and be born in any part, and at least remain in the same man, the same vessel.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL181_249_ba" id="target_note_LCL181_249_ba"><sup>b</sup></a>But since even in our body there is seen to be a fixed rule and ordinance in what place mind and spirit may exist and grow apart, so much the more must we deny that they can endure and be produced wholly outside the body. Therefore, when the body has perished, you must confess that the spirit has passed away, torn to pieces throughout the body.</p>
