white; as the sea, when great winds have stirred up the surface, turns into hoary waves with a white sheen; for you could say that often what we see as black, when its matter is mixed up and the order of its first-beginnings changed, some being added and taken away, immediately thereafter seems to be bright and white. But if the surface of the deep<span class="marginNote right">but if the seeds were of one colour, that could not change; if of many, these would be distinguishable.</span>
were made of blue seeds, it could not in any way become white; for however you may jumble up things that are blue, they can never change into a shining white colour. Or if different seeds that make up the sea’s uniform and pure brightness are steeped in different colours, just as often from different shapes and various figures something square is composed with a uniform figure, then it were fitting that, as in the square we perceive unlike forms to be contained,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL181_157_aa" id="target_note_LCL181_157_aa"><sup>a</sup></a> so on the surface of the deep or in any other pure and uniform brightness we should perceive various colours very different from one another. Besides, there is nothing in the unlike figures to hinder and debar the whole thing from being square on the outside; but the various colours of things do thwart and forbid the whole thing to be of one brightness.</p>
<span class="innerMarginNote left">788</span><p>Then further, the reason that leads and attracts us sometimes to attribute colours to the first-beginnings of things falls to the ground, since white things are not made from white, nor what are black from black, but from diverse colours. The fact is that white things will arise much more easily from no colour than from black or from any other colour that fights against it and thwarts it.</p>
