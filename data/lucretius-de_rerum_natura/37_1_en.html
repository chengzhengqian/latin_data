sweet and of like flavour to the milk from the udders of fleecy ewes; and assuredly, when clods of earth have been crumbled, various kinds of herbage ought often to be seen, and corn, and leaves, scattered about and lurking amid the earth in small portions; lastly, when wood is broken, smoke and ashes and fire should be seen lurking in small portions. But since plain matter of fact teaches that nothing of all this is to be seen, we may know that things are not thus mixed up in things, but seeds common to many things must in many ways lurk immingled in things.</p>

Do you see now, as I said a little while ago,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL181_75_c" id="target_note_LCL181_75_c"><sup>c</sup></a> that it is often of very great importance with what and in what position these same first-beginnings are held in union, and what motions they impart and receive mutually, and how the same elements a little changed in their relations create fires and firs? Just as the words themselves too
