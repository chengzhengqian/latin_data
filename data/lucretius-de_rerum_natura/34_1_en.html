Like the atomists, whom he preceded and influenced, he supposed that matter exists in the form of an infinite number of separate particles; but his particles differed from atoms in that they were heterogeneous in substance; moreover, unlike the atomists, he believed in the infinite divisibility of matter and denied the existence of void.
