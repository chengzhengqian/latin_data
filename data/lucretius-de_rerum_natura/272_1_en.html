the flame is excited which suddenly breathes out of the vast furnaces of Etna. Firstly, the whole mountain is hollow beneath, being supported for the caverns most part upon caverns in the basalt rock. In all the caverns, moreover, is wind and air; for wind arises when the air is excited by driving about. When this wind has grown hot, and has heated all the surrounding rocks by its fury wherever it touches, and also the earth, and from these has struck out hot fire<span class="marginNote right">and when the wind has grown hot in these, it bursts out through the mountain’s throat.</span>

From this sea, caverns reach underground right to the lofty throat of the mountain.
