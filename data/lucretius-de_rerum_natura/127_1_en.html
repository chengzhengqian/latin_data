and spirit exist compacted into one whole. Even if time should gather together our matter after death and bring it back again as it is now placed, and if once more the light of life should be given to us, yet it would not matter one bit to us that even this had been done, when the recollection of ourselves has once been broken asunder. And even now we are not concerned at all about any self which we have been before, nor does any anguish about it now touch us. For when you look back upon all the past expanse of measureless time, and think how various are the motions of matter, you may easily come to believe that these same seeds of which now we consist have been often before placed in the same arrangement they now are in. And yet we cannot call that back by memory; for in between has been cast a stoppage of life,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL181_255_a" id="target_note_LCL181_255_a"><sup>a</sup></a> and all the motions have wandered and scattered afar from those sensations.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL181_255_b" id="target_note_LCL181_255_b"><sup>b</sup></a></p>

pain in the future, he must himself also exist then in that time to be miserable. Since death takes away this possibility, and forbids him to exist for whom these inconveniences may be gathered together, we may be sure that there is nothing to be feared after death, that he who is not cannot be miserable, that it makes not one jot of difference whether or not<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL181_255_d" id="target_note_LCL181_255_d"><sup>d</sup></a> he has ever been born, when death the immortal has taken away his mortal life.</p>
