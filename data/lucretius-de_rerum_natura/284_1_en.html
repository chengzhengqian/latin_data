through stone, another through wood, another to pass through gold, another to find its way out through silver or glass; for through glass, as we see, images flow, through silver warmth, and one thing is seen to pass through more quickly than another by the same way. Assuredly the nature of the passages compels this to happen, for it varies in manifold ways, as we have shown a little while since, on account of the different nature and texture of the things.</p>

When this space is made empty and a large place becomes vacant<span class="marginNote right">An empty space is made between stone and iron,</span>
between, at once the first-beginnings of the iron gliding forward into the empty space fall in a body together, and the result is that the ring itself follows and passes in this way as a whole. And indeed there<span class="marginNote right">and the ring falls into it as a whole.</span>
is nothing that has its first elements more intertwined, nothing more closely connected together and coherent, than the substance of strong iron with its chilly roughness. For this reason it is less surprising . . .<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL181_569_a" id="target_note_LCL181_569_a"><sup>a</sup></a> if the large number of bodies emanating from the iron cannot move into the void without the ring itself following; this it does, and follows until it has reached that very stone and clung to it by unseen attachments. The same thing happens in all directions: wherever an empty space is formed, whether on the sides or above, the neighbouring bodies at
