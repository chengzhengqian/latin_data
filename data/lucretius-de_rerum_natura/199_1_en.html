water and air perish and are born again and increase once more, in the first place a large part of the earth, scorched with incessant suns and trampled by a host of feet, exhales a cloud of dust and flying mists which the strong winds disperse abroad through the whole sky. A part of the soil again is washed away by rain, and the scraping rivers nibble at their banks. Besides, whatever the earth nourishes and increases is given back in its due proportion<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL181_399_a" id="target_note_LCL181_399_a"><sup>a</sup></a>; and since beyond all doubt the mother of all is seen also to be the universal sepulchre, therefore you see that the earth is diminished and is increased and grows again.</p>
