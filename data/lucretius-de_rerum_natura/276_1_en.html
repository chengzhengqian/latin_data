the very nostrils noxious and rough to the touch; and not a few exist which the touch must avoid and sight must shun and such as are unpleasant in taste.</p>
<span class="innerMarginNote left">781</span><p>Again, you may see how many things have for<span class="marginNote right">Hence the noxious effect of certain trees,</span>
man a violently noxious sensation, being loathsome and dangerous. Firstly, certain trees<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL181_553_a" id="target_note_LCL181_553_a"><sup>a</sup></a> have a shade so dangerous that they often cause headache, if one has lain beneath stretched out on the herbage. There is also in the great mountains of Helicon a tree, which is accustomed to kill men by the vile stench of its flower. You may be sure that the reason why all these things rise from the soil is that the earth has many seeds of many things which she holds mixed up in many ways and separates apart before passing them on. And when a night-light newly extinguished meets<span class="marginNote right">of a light snuffed out,</span>

makes a woman fall back asleep, dropping the dainty work from her tender hands, if she has smelt it at the time of her monthly courses. And many other things besides loosen the languid limbs all through the frame and shake the spirit in its habitations within. Again, if you should ever tarry long in the hot baths<span class="marginNote right">a hot bath after a meal,</span>
after a full meal, how easily you often collapse in the middle of the bath of hot water! And how easily the strong heavy fumes of charcoal creep into the<span class="marginNote right">the smell of charcoal,</span>
