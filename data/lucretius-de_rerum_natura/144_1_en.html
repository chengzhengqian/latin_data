these images arise, constantly flowing off from things and gliding away.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL181_289_a" id="target_note_LCL181_289_a"><sup>a</sup></a> For there is always something streaming from the outermost surface of things for them to shoot off.

things passes through, particularly through glass. But when it meets rough stone or solid wood, there at once it is broken, so that it can give back no image. But when the opposed object is bright and compact, as particularly a mirror, nothing happens of this sort; for the images cannot pass through as through glass, nor again can they be broken: so much safety the smoothness never forgets to afford. Therefore it follows that the images stream back from it upon us. And no matter how suddenly you<span class="marginNote right">so swiftly, that there must be a continuous stream of such images.</span>
place any object before a mirror at any time, its image appears, so that you may recognize that there is a constant flow from the surface of things of thin textures and thin shapes. Therefore many images arise in brief space, so that there is good reason to call the origin of these things rapid. And just as the<span class="marginNote right">See also how swiftly the sun sends forth his lights,</span>
sun must send up many lights in brief space, that all places may be full of them without a break, so in like manner from things also it must be that in a moment of time many images pass off in many ways and in all directions everywhere, since in whatever direction we tum the mirror to the shapes of things, something answers back of like form and colour.</p>
