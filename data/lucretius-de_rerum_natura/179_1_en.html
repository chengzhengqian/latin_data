For all generally fall towards a wound, and the blood jets out in the direction of the blow that has struck us, and if he is close by, the ruddy flood drenches the enemy. So therefore, if one is wounded by the shafts of Venus, whether it be a boy with girlish limbs who launches the shaft at him, or a woman radiating love from her whole body, he tends to the source of the blow, and desires to unite and to cast the fluid<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL181_359_a" id="target_note_LCL181_359_a"><sup>a</sup></a> from body to body; for his dumb desire presages delight.</p>

name<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL181_359_b" id="target_note_LCL181_359_b"><sup>b</sup></a>; from this first trickled into the heart that dewdrop of Venus’s sweetness, and then came up freezing care. For if what you love is absent, yet its images are there, and the sweet name sounds in your ears. But it is fitting to flee from images, to scare away what feeds love, to turn the mind in other directions, to cast the collected liquid into any body, and not to retain it, being wrapped up once for all in the love of one, nor to cherish care and certain pain for yourself. For the sore quickens and becomes inveterate by feeding, daily the madness takes on and the tribulation grows heavier, if you do not confuse the first wounds by new blows, and cure them in time while fresh by wandering with Venus light-o’-love, or tum your thoughts in some other direction.</p>
