out straight backwards, just as if someone should dash upon a pillar or beam some mask of plaster before it were dry, and if it should at once keep its shape undistorted in front and mould a copy of itself dashed backwards: it will happen that what was formerly the right eye now becomes the left, and that the left becomes right in exchange.</p>

For whatever lies hidden behind in the inner parts of a house, however tortuous and secluded be the ways in between, may yet be all brought out through these involved passages by means of a number of mirrors and seen to be in the house. So truly does the image shine across from mirror to mirror; and when it has been presented left, it becomes right again, then once more it comes back again and returns to the same position.</p>
