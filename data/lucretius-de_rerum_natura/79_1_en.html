into the light, you may be sure that they are covered with no colour. For what colour can there be in blind darkness? Why, a colour is changed by the light itself, according as the brightness responds to a direct or oblique impact of light; in this way the dove’s plumage shows itself in the sun, lying about the nape and encircling the neck; for at times it is red as the blazing carbuncle, again view it in a certain way and it comes to appear a fusion of emerald green with blue.

For it were fitting that crows also as they fly should often throw off a white colour from white feathers, and
