Scyllas,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL181_335_a" id="target_note_LCL181_335_a"><sup>a</sup></a> and faces of dogs like Cerberus, and images<span class="marginNote right">mind sees monsters and ghosts.</span>
of those for whom death is past, whose bones rest in earth’s embrace, since images of all kinds are being carried about everywhere, some that arise spontaneously in the air itself, some that are thrown off from all sorts of things, others that are made of a combination of these shapes. For certainly no image of a Centaur comes from one living, since there never<span class="marginNote right">For no real centaur ever existed.</span>
was a living thing of this nature; but when the images of man and horse meet by accident, they easily adhere at once, as I said before,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL181_335_b" id="target_note_LCL181_335_b"><sup>b</sup></a> on account of their fine nature and thin texture. All other things of this class are made in the same way. And since these are carried about with velocity because of their extreme lightness, as I explained before,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL181_335_c" id="target_note_LCL181_335_c"><sup>c</sup></a> any given one of these fine images easily bestirs our mind by a single impression; for the mind is itself thin and wonderfully easy to move.</p>
<span class="innerMarginNote left">749</span><p>That this happens as I say, you may easily recognize<span class="marginNote right">The mind sees images, just as the eye does,</span>
from what is now to be said. Since this is like that—what we see with the mind like what we see with the eye—it must come about in a like way.</p>
<span class="innerMarginNote left">752</span><p>Now therefore, since I have shown that I perceive a lion, it may be, by means of images which in such a case assail the eyes, we may be sure that the mind is moved in a like way, by means of the images of lions and of all else it sees, equally and no less than the eyes, except that it perceives what is more<span class="marginNote right">but the images are thinner.</span>
thin.</p>
<span class="innerMarginNote left">757</span><p>Nor is there any other reason why the mind’s<span class="marginNote right">It is the same in sleep,</span>
intelligence is awake, when sleep has relaxed the limbs, except that the same images assail our minds
