to compel all things to be resolved into their smallest parts, that same nature would no longer be able to make anything again out of them, because things which are not augmented by any parts cannot have what generative matter must have—the variety<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL181_53_a" id="target_note_LCL181_53_a"><sup>a</sup></a> of connexions, weights, blows, concurrences, motions, by which all things are brought to pass.</p>
