ring pushes it forward as it were and propels it for ward from the rear. For the air all round is for ever buffeting things; but the reason why it propels the iron at that moment is that on one side there is empty space which receives it. This air that I speak of insinuates itself in subtle fashion through the many interstices in the iron into its small particles, thrusting and driving it on as the wind drives a ship with its sails.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL181_571_b" id="target_note_LCL181_571_b"><sup>b</sup></a> Again, all things must have air in their body,<span class="marginNote right">and penetrating within.</span>
since they are of porous structure, and air surrounds and adjoins all things. This air, therefore, which is hidden in the inmost parts of the iron, is always being agitated with restless movement, and therefore beats the ring without doubt and sets it moving from within; the ring is assuredly carried in that direction whither it has once flung itself forward and taken its impulse towards the void.</p>
