produces fire, when a force of wind, sped forth cold without fire, has struck; doubtless because, when it has smitten with a violent blow, elements of heat may flow together from the wind itself and at the same time from that thing which then receives the blow; just as, when we strike stone with iron, out flies fire,<span class="marginNote right">like flint and iron.</span>
like flint nor do the seeds of hot fire any the less run together at the blow because iron is a cold thing. So therefore also a thing must be kindled by the thunderbolt if it happens to be fit and proper for flames. And no force of wind can easily be completely and utterly cold which has been sped from above with such force, but, even if it is not first kindled by fire in its course, it must nevertheless arrive warm and mingled with heat.</p>
