there were none such, you would see all things without labour of ours, of their own will, grow much better.</p>
<span class="innerMarginNote left">215</span><p>Add to this that nature resolves everything<span class="marginNote right">II. Nothing can be reduced to nothing, or else (1) things would be annihilated suddenly,</span>
again into its elements, and does not reduce things to nothing.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL181_21_a" id="target_note_LCL181_21_a"><sup>a</sup></a> For if anything were perishable in all its parts, each thing would then perish in a moment snatched away from our sight. For there would be no need of any force, to cause disruption of its parts and dissolve their connexions. But as it is, because the seed of all things is everlasting, nature allows no destruction of anything to be seen, until a force has met it, sufficient to shatter it with a blow, or to penetrate within through the void places and break it up.</p>
<span class="innerMarginNote left">225</span><p>Besides, if time consuming all the material<span class="marginNote right">(2) there would be no supply of material for the creation and replenishment of things,</span>
utterly destroys whatever by lapse of years it removes, whence does Venus restore living creatures to the light of life each after its kind, or, when they are restored, whence does the wonder-working earth nourish them and make them grow, providing food for each after its kind? Whence is the sea supplied by the springs within it, and by the rivers without, flowing from afar? Whence does the ether nourish the stars? For all things that are of perishable body must have been consumed by infinite time and ages past. But if through that space of time past there have been bodies from which this sum of things subsists being made again, imperishable indeed must their nature be; therefore things cannot severally return to nothing.</p>
<span class="innerMarginNote left">238</span><p>Again, the same force and cause would destroy<span class="marginNote right">(3) all things could be</span>
all things without distinction, unless everlasting
