to be, here is proof that you may discern them to be of less than solid consistency. In rocks and caves the liquid moisture of waters oozes through, and the whole place weeps with plenteous drops. Food is dispersed through all the body in living creatures. Trees grow and at their time put forth their fruits, because their food is distributed all over them<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL181_31_a" id="target_note_LCL181_31_a"><sup>a</sup></a> from the lowest roots through trunks and through branches. Sounds pass through walls and fly through closed houses, stiffening cold permeates to the bones. But, if there were no void there which bodies might pass through in each case, you could not see this happen in any way.</p>
<span class="innerMarginNote left">358</span><p>Lastly, why do we see some things surpass<span class="marginNote right">(3) things of one size would not differ in weight.</span>
others in weight when they are no larger? For if there is as much body in a ball of wool as in lead, it is fitting that they should both weigh the same, since it is the property of body to depress everything downwards, but contrariwise the nature of void remains without weight. Therefore that which is equally great and is seen to be lighter without doubt shows itself to have more void; but contrariwise the heavier makes clear that it has more body in it, and much less of void. There is therefore without doubt, intermingled with things, that which we seek with keen-scented reasoning, that which we call void.</p>
