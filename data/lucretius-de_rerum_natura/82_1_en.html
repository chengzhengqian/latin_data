beasts and the bodies of strong-winged birds increase. Therefore nature changes all foods into living bodies, and from them brings forth all the feelings of animals, very much in the same way as she expands dry sticks into flames and turns them all into fire. Now do you see then that it is of great moment in what order all the first-beginnings of things are placed, and with what commingled they cause and receive motions?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL181_165_aa" id="target_note_LCL181_165_aa"><sup>a</sup></a></p>

very mind, which moves it and compels it to express diverse feelings, forbidding you to believe that the sensible is born from the insensible? Surely that stones and sticks and earth though mingled together yet cannot produce the vital sense. But in this matter you will do well to remember that I do not say that without exception sensations are produced forthwith from all the substances that make sensible things, but that it is of great moment, first how small those elements are that make a sensible thing, and what shape they are endowed with, what lastly are their motions, arrangements, positions. And in the sticks and clods these conditions escape our vision; yet these, when they have become rotten as it were<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL181_165_b" id="target_note_LCL181_165_b"><sup>b</sup></a> by rain, bring forth little worms, because the bodies of matter, being moved from their ancient arrangements by a new condition, are combined together in the way by which living things must be produced.</p>

can be created out of sensible elements, which would furthermore be accustomed to derive their own sensation
