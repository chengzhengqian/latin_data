So true is it that there seems to be nothing solid in the world. But because nevertheless true reason and the nature of things compels, be with me, until in a few verses I make it clear that there are such things as consist of body solid and everlasting, which we teach to be seeds of things and their first-beginnings, out of which now all the sum of things has been built up.</p>
<span class="innerMarginNote left">503</span><p>First, since there has been found to exist a<span class="marginNote right">For (1) Body and Void are mutually exclusive;</span>
twofold and widely dissimilar nature of two things—of body, that is, and space in which all things are done—it is necessary that each exist by itself and for itself unmixed. For wherever is empty space, which we call void, there no body is; further, where body maintains itself, there by no means exists empty space. The first bodies therefore are solid and without void.</p>
<span class="innerMarginNote left">511</span><p>Besides, since there is void in created things,<span class="marginNote right">(2) compound objects contain Void, and this Void must be enclosed by Body that contains no Void (<span class="italic">i.e</span>. atoms);</span>
there must be solid matter round about it, nor can anything by true reasoning be proved to conceal void in its body and to hold it within, unless you grant that which holds to be solid. Further, that can be nothing but a union of matter, which can hold the emptiness of things within it. Matter therefore, which consists of solid body, may be everlasting, though all else<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL181_43_c" id="target_note_LCL181_43_c"><sup>c</sup></a> be dissolved.</p>
