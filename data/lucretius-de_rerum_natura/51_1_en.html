And to show you more clearly that all the bodies of matter are constantly being tossed about, remember that there is no bottom in the sum of things and the first bodies have nowhere to rest, since space is without end or limit, and I have shown at large and proved by irrefragable reasoning that it extends immeasurable from all sides in all directions.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL181_103_a" id="target_note_LCL181_103_a"><sup>a</sup></a> Since this stands firm, beyond doubt no rest is granted to the first bodies throughout the profound void, but rather driven by incessant and varied motions, some after being pressed together then leap back with wide intervals, some again after the blow are tossed about within a narrow compass. And all those which being held in combination more closely condensed<span class="marginNote right">those which are combined into groups move also.</span>
