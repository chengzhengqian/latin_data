its paths; for if so it ought to have an extremity. Again, clearly nothing can have an extremity unless there be something beyond to bound it, so that something can be seen, beyond which our sense can follow the object no further. Now since we must confess that there is nothing beyond the sum of things, it has no extremity, and therefore it is without end or limit.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL181_81_a" id="target_note_LCL181_81_a"><sup>a</sup></a> Nor does it matter in which of its quarters you stand: so true is it that, whatever place anyone occupies, he leaves the whole equally infinite in every direction.</p>

the moment to be finite, suppose someone proceeded to the very extremest edge and cast a flyinff lance, do you prefer that the lance forcibly thrown goes whither it was sent and flies afar, or do you think that anything can hinder and obstruct it? For you must confess and accept one of the two; but each of them shuts you off from all escape, and compels you to own that the universe stretches without end. For whether there is something to hinder and keep it from going whither it is sent and from fixing itself at its mark, or whether it passes out, that was no boundary whence it was sped.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL181_81_b" id="target_note_LCL181_81_b"><sup>b</sup></a> In this way I shall go after you, and wherever you place your extremest edge, I shall ask what at last happens to the lance.
