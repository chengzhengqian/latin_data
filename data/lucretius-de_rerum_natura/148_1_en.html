that we distinguish how far each thing is distant from us; for when it is sent off, at once it pushes and drives all the air that is between itself and our eyes, and thus this air all streams through our eyes and, as it were, brushes the pupils and thus passes through. This is how we come to see how far off each thing is; and the more air is driven before it, the longer the breeze that brushes our eyes, the more distant and far removed the thing is seen to be. Assuredly all<span class="marginNote right">All this is very swift.</span>
this passes in a supremely rapid manner, so that we see all at once both what it is and how far away.</p>
<span class="innerMarginNote left">256</span><p>But in this regard it should not be thought at all wonderful why the objects themselves<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL181_297_a" id="target_note_LCL181_297_a"><sup>a</sup></a> are per ceived, and yet the images that strike our eyes cannot be seen singly. For when the wind also beats<span class="marginNote right">We cannot perceive the single image any more than the single particles of wind or cold, or all the parts of a stone.</span>
upon us little by little, and when sharp cold flows upon us, we are not accustomed to feel every single particle of that wind and that cold, but rather the whole at once, and we see that the blows take effect upon our body exactly as if some object were striking us and giving us the feeling of its own body outside. Besides, when we knock a stone with a toe, we touch just the uppermost surface of the stone, and the outermost colour, but we do not feel this by the touch, but rather we perceive the real hardness of the stone in its inmost depths.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL181_297_ba" id="target_note_LCL181_297_ba"><sup>b</sup></a></p>
