the whole world; yet, unless the sum of matter be infinite from which it may be conceived and brought forth, it cannot be made, nor, moreover, can it grow and be nourished. Indeed, if I should go so far as to assume that the bodies generative of this one thing were finite in number, tossed about through the universe, whence, where, by what force, in what manner<span class="marginNote right">for if flnite they could no more combine</span>

They have no way, I think, to combine; but as when many great shipwrecks have come about, the high sea is accustomed to toss asunder transoms, ribs, yards, prow, masts,<span class="marginNote right">than the pieces of wrecked ships.</span>

It is therefore obvious that in each kind there is an infinity of the first-beginnings of things from which a supply of all things is brought up.</p>
