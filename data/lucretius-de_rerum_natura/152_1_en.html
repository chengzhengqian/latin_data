cannot see out of the light what is in the darkness, for this reason, because a grosser air of the darkness follows second, which nils all pores and besets the passages of the eyes, that no images of anything when thrown upon them may move them.</p>

of a city, they often appear to be round, for this reason, because every angle at a distance is seen blunted or rather it is not seen at all, its blow is lost and the stroke does not glide across to our eyes; because, while the images are rushing through a great space of air, the air with frequent buffetings forces it to become blunt. By this means when every angle at once has escaped our vision, the stone structures appear as though rounded on a lathe; not, however, like things that are close before us and really round, but they appear somewhat similar in a shadowy fashion.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL181_305_a" id="target_note_LCL181_305_a"><sup>a</sup></a></p>

For there are always new rays of light pouring out, and the first disappear
