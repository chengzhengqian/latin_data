<span class="innerMarginNote left">177</span><p>Now I shall go on to explain to you, of what<span class="marginNote right">The mind is made of very small rounded particles;</span>
kind of body this mind is, and of what it is formed. First I say that it is exceedingly delicate and formed of exceedingly minute particles. That this is so, you may consider the following points to convince you. Nothing is seen to be done so swiftly as the mind<span class="marginNote right">(1) because it acts more swiftly than anything else;</span>
determines it to be done and does its own first act<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL181_203_a" id="target_note_LCL181_203_a"><sup>a</sup></a>; therefore the mind bestirs itself more quickly than any of these things which are seen plain before our eyes. But that which is so readily moved must consist of seeds exceedingly rounded and exceedingly minute, that they may be moved when touched by a small moving power. For water moves and flows<span class="marginNote right">(causes of speed and slowness in water, honey,</span>
with so very small a moving power because it is made of small rolling shapes. But on the other hand the nature of honey has more cohesion, its fluid is more sluggish, and its movement more tardy; for the whole mass of its matter coheres more closely, assuredly because it is not made of bodies so smooth or so delicate and round. For a checked and light breath of air can make, as you may see, a high heap of poppy-seed slip down from the top; but contrariwise<span class="marginNote right">poppy seed,</span>

according as bodies are extremely small and smooth, they have power of motion; but contrariwise, whatever is found to be more weighty and rough is by so much the more stable. Now, therefore, since the nature of the mind has been found to be moved with unusual ease, it must consist of bodies exceedingly
