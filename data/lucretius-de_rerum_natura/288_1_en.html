    and water affects any who travel far from home and country, just because there is a great difference in these things? For what difference must we suppose to be between the climate of Britain and that of Egypt where the world’s pole leans aslant?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL181_577_aa" id="target_note_LCL181_577_aa"><sup>a</sup></a> What between that which is in Pontus, and at Gades right onwards to the tribes of black men with their roasted skin? And as we see these four climates to be diverse under the four winds and quarters of heaven, so the colour and aspect of men are seen to be widely different and diseases to possess the nations after their kind.
