travelling with their light around the great revolving region of heaven, taught men well that the seasons of the year come round, and that all is done on a fixed plan and in fixed order.</p>
<span class="innerMarginNote left">1440</span><p>Already men lived fenced in with strong<span class="marginNote right">Fortified towns, division of lands, navigation, international treaties, letters, poetry,</span>
towers, and the earth was divided up and distributed for cultivation. Then the deep sea was blooming with sail-flying ships, men had already allies and friends under formal treaty, when poets began to commemorate doughty deeds in verse: nor had letters been invented long before. For this reason our age cannot look back upon what happened before, unless in any respect reasoning shows the way.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL181_491_b" id="target_note_LCL181_491_b"><sup>b</sup></a></p>
<span class="innerMarginNote left">1448</span><p>Ships and agriculture, fortifications and laws,<span class="marginNote right">all the arts of life, which are continually progressing onwards.</span>
arms, roads, clothing and all else of this kind, all life’s prizes, its luxuries also from first to last, poetry and pictures, artfully wrought polished statues, all these as men progressed gradually step by step were taught by practice and the experiments of the active mind. So by degrees time brings up before us every single thing, and reason lifts it into the precincts of light. For they saw one thing after another grow clear in their minds, until they attained the highest pinnacle of the arts.</p>
