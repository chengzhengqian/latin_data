rainy moisture<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL181_531_a" id="target_note_LCL181_531_a"><sup>a</sup></a> grows together in the clouds on high, because and how showers fall sent down upon the earth, First of all you will concede that many seeds of water clouds, rise upward together with the clouds themselves from things of all sorts, and that in this way both grow together, the clouds and whatever water is in the clouds, just as in ourselves body grows along with blood, sweat also and in a word whatever moisture is in the frame. The clouds also often take up a great deal of sea-water besides, like hanging fleeces of wool, when the winds carry clouds above the great sea. In like fashion water is raised to the clouds from all rivers. And when into these clouds<span class="marginNote right">which becoming soaked discharge it downwards</span>
very many seeds of waters in many ways have gathered together, being increased from all sides, the discharge it clouds stuffed full strive to discharge the moisture in two ways: for the force of the wind thrusts them<span class="marginNote right">by pressure of the wind and by their own weight;</span>
together, and the very mass of the clouds, when a greater pack than usual has been collected, pushes and presses down from above and makes the showers flow out. Besides where the clouds are blown thin<span class="marginNote right">or when they become thin melted by the sun’s heat.</span>
by the winds, or loosened abroad, struck from above by the sun’s heat, they emit rainy moisture and drip, melted by as wax over a hot fire melts and grows fluid apace.</p>

the clouds are violently pressed by both forces, by their own pile and by the rushing of the wind. But rains are accustomed to persist and linger for a great<span class="marginNote right">and prolonged rains.</span>
while, when many seeds of waters are put in motion and clouds over clouds, storm-rack over storm-rack are carried along from every part, streaming from above, and when the earth smoking breathes back the moisture everywhere.</p>
