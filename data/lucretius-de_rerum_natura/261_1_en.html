regions of heaven with appalling din, if they cast fire whither it may be the will of each one, why do they not see to it that those who have not refrained from some abominable crime shall be struck and breathe out sulphurous flames from breast pierced through, a sharp lesson to mankind? Why rather<span class="marginNote right">instead of the innocent?</span>
does one with no base guilt on his conscience roll in flames all innocent, suddenly involved in a tornado from heaven and taken off by fire?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL181_523_a" id="target_note_LCL181_523_a"><sup>a</sup></a></p>
