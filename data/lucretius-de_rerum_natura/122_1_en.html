spirits can creep into the worms from without and come one by one into the bodies, if you do not ponder why many thousands of spirits gather together where one has gone away, Here is a question that it seems worth while to ask and to bring under examination,<span class="marginNote right">they do not hunt for bodies ready made, nor do they make them:</span>
whether in fact the spirits go a-hunting for all the seeds of little worms and themselves make them a habitation, or whether they creep as it were into bodies already formed. But there is no answer to the question why they should make bodies themselves, or why they should take that trouble. For,<span class="marginNote right">why should they take the trouble?</span>
when they are without bodies, they are not plagued with disease as they fly about, or with cold and hunger; for it is the body rather that is troubled through susceptibility to these infirmities, and the mind suffers many maladies by contact with it. Grant, however, that it be as useful as you will that these make them a body to enter: but how they can, there is no way to be seen. Spirits therefore do not make themselves bodies and limbs. Nor is there any possibility that they creep into bodies already made; for they will not be able to conjoin themselves closely together with these, nor will harmony be established through community of sensation.</p>
