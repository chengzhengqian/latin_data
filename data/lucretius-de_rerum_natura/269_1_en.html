present force of peril applies this goad of fear also from one part or another, that the earth may be suddenly withdrawn from under their feet, and fall into the bottomless pit, followed by the whole sum of things utterly giving way, and then may come the confused ruin of the world.</p>

Why the sea does no increase: the water that comes in is a mere drop in the ocean,</span>
does not increase the measure of the sea, for all the great running down of waters thither, for all the rivers that come into it from every side. Add the wandering showers, the flying tempests, which sprinkle and drench all seas and lands; add the seaâ€™s own fountains<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL181_539_b" id="target_note_LCL181_539_b"><sup>b</sup></a>; yet all compared with the whole mass of the sea will be scarce equal to the augmentation of one single drop; which makes it less wonderful that the great sea does not increase.</p>
