    bodies of matter, you may understand from what follows in a few words. First, when the dawn diffuses new light over the earth, and the different birds flitting about through pathless woods through the soft air fill every part with their liquid notes, how suddenly at such time the sun arising is accustomed to envelop and flood the whole world with his light, we see to be plain and manifest to all. But that heat and that light serene which the sun sends, does not pass through empty void;<span class="marginNote right">which is hindered by the air and because it is a compound,</span> therefore it is forced to go more slowly, while it beats its way so to speak through waves of air. Nor do the particles of heat move alone and singly, but linked together and massed together; therefore they are at the same time retarded by one another and obstructed from without, so that they are forced to
go more slowly. But the first-beginnings, which are of solid singleness,<span class="marginNote right">whereas the atoms are unchecked.</span>
when they pass through the empty void, are not delayed by anything from without, and being themselves units composed of their own parts,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL181_107_a" id="target_note_LCL181_107_a"><sup>a</sup></a> when they are carried each to that one point to which their first efforts tend, most certainly they must be of exceeding swiftness and must be carried far more quickly than the light of the sun, and traverse a space many times as wide in the same time that the sunâ€™s lightnings take to pervade the heavens.</p>
