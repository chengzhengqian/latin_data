made perfectly plain, we should try writing rhetorical exercises. In any of the examples given above let us practice this same exercise that one may prove how easy it is to do.</p>
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">77</span><span class="br"></span><p>Enough has, I think, been said about the parts and divisions of deductive reasoning. I should, however, like it to be understood that I am well aware that in philosophy deductive reasoning is treated in many other forms too; in fact they are intricate and involved, and a precise system has been formulated. But they seem to me to be quite unfit for oratorical practice. But as for the principles which are pertinent to speech, I would not claim that I have studied them more completely than all others, but I do assert that I have written with greater care and accuracy. And now we shall go on in order to the other points as originally proposed.</p>
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">78</span><span class="br"></span><p>XLII. The <span class="italic">refutation</span> is that part of an oration in which arguments are used to impair, disprove, or weaken the confirmation or proof in our opponentsâ€™ speech. It utilizes the same sources of invention that <span class="italic">confirmation</span> does, because any proposition can be attacked by the same methods of reasoning by which it can be supported. For nothing need be considered in all these quests for arguments except the attributes of persons or of actions. Therefore the rules for the invention and embellishment of arguments may properly be transferred from what has been said before to this part of the oration. In order, however, that some instructions may be given about this section too, we shall set forth the methods of refutation. Those who follow these rules will more easily be able to impair or disprove the arguments made against them.</p>
