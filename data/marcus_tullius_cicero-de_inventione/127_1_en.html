<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">88</span><span class="br"></span><p>The prosecutor will first defend, if he can, the person who the defendant says was responsible for the act. If he cannot do this, he will say that this court is not concerned with the fault of that other person, but only with the fault of the man whom he is accusing.
