some person or historical event. Instances and descriptions of these principles will be given with the rules for style.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL386_91_a" id="target_note_LCL386_91_a"><sup>a</sup></a></p>
<p>Now the sources of confirmatory arguments have been revealed as the occasion offered, and explained as clearly as the nature of the subject required. But in the second book we shall discuss in connexion with each class individually what treatment is to be given to each issue or subdivision of an issue or to the whole controversy, whether it depends on general reasoning or on written documents, and also what forms of argumentation are appropriate for each issue. For the present we have merely scattered in an irregular and random manner the categories, rules,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL386_91_b" id="target_note_LCL386_91_b"><sup>b</sup></a> and classes of argumentation. Later we shall choose and arrange, and from this material we shall explain in order what is appropriate to each kind of case.</p>

For that reason it seemed to us necessary to speak about the rules for this and to do so at this point so that the subject of invention of arguments may be combined with the theory of argumentation. This topic must be considered with great care and diligence not only because it is extremely useful, but also because there is great difficulty in formulating rules.</p>
