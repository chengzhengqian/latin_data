Shortly afterward, they too, began to be tossed about by a violent storm, so violent in fact that the owner of the ship who was also the pilot, took refuge in the skiff, and from there guided the ship, as far as he could, by the line by which the skiff was towed from the stern of the vessel. The owner of the cargo then and there fell on his sword on the ship. The shipwrecked sailor took the helm and did what he could to save the ship. When the weather changed and the sea went down the ship got into port. The merchant who had fallen on his sword proved to have only a slight wound and made a quick recovery. Each of the three claims the ship and cargo.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL386_323_aa" id="target_note_LCL386_323_aa"><sup>a</sup></a> In this instance all come into court relying on the letter of the law, and the controversy arises over the meaning of words.
