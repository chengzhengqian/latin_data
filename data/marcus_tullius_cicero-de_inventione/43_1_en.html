 be true or false. In the class of things which for the most part usually come to pass are probabilities of this sort: “If she is his mother, she loves him.” “If he is avaricious, he disregards his oath.” Under the head of ordinary beliefs or opinions come probabilities of this sort: “Punishment awaits the wicked in the next world.” “Philosophers are atheists.”</p>
<p>XXX. Resemblance is seen mostly in contraries, in analogies, and in those things which fall under the same principle. In contraries, as follows: “For if it is right for me to pardon those who have wronged me unintentionally, I ought not to be grateful to those who have assisted me because they <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">47</span><span class="br"></span>could not help it.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL386_87_a" id="target_note_LCL386_87_a"><sup>a</sup></a> In analogies, thus: “For as a place without a harbour cannot be safe for ships, so a mind without integrity cannot be relied on by friends.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL386_87_b" id="target_note_LCL386_87_b"><sup>b</sup></a> In the case of those things which fall under the same principle, probability is considered after this fashion: “For if it is not disgraceful for the Rhodians to farm out their customs-duties, neither is it disgraceful for Hermocreon to take the contract.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL386_87_c" id="target_note_LCL386_87_c"><sup>c</sup></a> Arguments of this kind are sometimes rigorous—for example: “Since there is a scar, there has been a wound”—sometimes they are only plausible, for instance: “If there was much dust on his shoes, he must have been on a journey.”</p>
<p>For the sake of making definite subdivision we may say that all <span class="italic">probability</span> that is used in argument is either a <span class="italic">sign,</span> or something <span class="italic">credible,</span> or a point on which <span class="italic">judgement</span> has been given, or something which <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">48</span><span class="br"></span>affords an opportunity for <span class="italic">comparison.</span> A <span class="italic">sign</span> is something apprehended by one of the senses and indicating something that seems to follow logically as a result of it: the sign may have occurred before
