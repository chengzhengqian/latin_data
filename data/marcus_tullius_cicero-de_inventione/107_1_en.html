answer is: “I did not commit lese-majesty.” The question is, “Did he commit lese-majesty?” The excuse is, “I used the authority which I had over my son.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL386_215_a" id="target_note_LCL386_215_a"><sup>a</sup></a> The denial of the excuse, “On the contrary, one who uses the authority belonging to him as a father—that is private authority—to lessen the authority of a tribune—that is, the authority of the people—is guilty of lese-majesty.” The point for the judge’s decision is, “Would he be guilty of lese-majesty, who used his authority as father against the authority of a tribune?” All arguments must be directed to this point.</p>

<p>The first topic in the prosecutor’s argument is a brief, clear and conventional definition of the word whose meaning is sought, as follows: Lese-Majesty is a lessening of the dignity or high estate or authority of the people or of those to whom the people have given authority. This brief exposition must be supported by a lengthy discussion of reasons, and shown to be as you have outlined it. Then it will be necessary to show the connexion between the act of the accused and your definition, and on the basis of what you have shown to be the meaning of lese-majesty
