the proper accusation, or at the proper time, the issue is called translative (or procedural). We should need very many examples if we should look for every kind of transfer or change; but because the principle of all the rules is the same, we must dispense with a multitude of examples. In legal procedure at Rome there are many reasons why speeches involving transfers rarely are made. For many actions are excluded by the <span class="italic">exceptiones</span> (counter-pleas) granted by the praetor, and the provisions of our civil law are such that one who does not bring his action in <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">58</span><span class="br"></span>the proper form loses his suit.
