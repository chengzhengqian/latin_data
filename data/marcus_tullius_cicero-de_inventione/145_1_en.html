<p>XLII. A controversy over the letter and the intent occurs when one party follows the exact words that are written, and the other directs his whole pleading <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">122</span><span class="br"></span>to what he says the writer meant. The one who bases his defence on the intent will sometimes show that the intent of the writer always had the same end in view and desired the same result, at other times he will show that the writer’s purpose has to be modified to fit the occasion as a result of some act or event. He may be proved to have always had the same end in view in the following way: A head of a family, having a wife but no children, drew his will as follows: “If one or more sons are born to me, he or they are to inherit my estate.” Then follow the usual phrases. Then comes, “If my son dies before coming of age, then So-and-So is to be my heir.” No son was born. The agnates dispute with the man who was to be the reversionary <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">123</span><span class="br"></span>heir in case the son died before coming of age.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL386_291_a" id="target_note_LCL386_291_a"><sup>a</sup></a> In this kind of case it cannot be said that the intent of the writer ought to be made to fit some time or some event, because the only possible meaning is shown to be that on which the litigant who opposes the literal interpretation of the will defends his own right to inherit. But there is another kind of argument brought forward by advocates of the intent in which the wish of the writer is shown not to be absolute, <span class="italic">i.e.</span> having the same weight for every occasion and for every action, but it is argued that his wishes ought to be interpreted to fit the occasion in the light of some act or some event. This argument will be supported largely by topics under the assumptive branch of the issue of equity. For example, sometimes <span class="italic">com­paratio</span> (comparison)
