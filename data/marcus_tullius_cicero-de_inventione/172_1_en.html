methodically, these may be divided into mind, body and external circumstances. The virtue of the mind is that whose parts we discussed only recently.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL386_345_a" id="target_note_LCL386_345_a"><sup>a</sup></a> The virtues of the body are health, beauty, strength, speed. Extraneous virtues are public office, money, connexions by marriage, high birth, friends, country, power, and all other things that are understood to belong to this class. And the principle ought to apply to these which applies everywhere; the opposites of these qualities and their nature will be apparent.</p>

For it is foolish to praise one’s good fortune and arrogant to censure it, but praise of a man’s mind is honourable and censure of it very effective.</p>
<p>Now that I have presented the principles on which arguments can be made in every kind of speech, enough has, I think, been said about Invention, which is the first and most important part of rhetoric. Therefore since one section has been brought to completion in this and the preceding book, and this book has grown to a great length, we shall leave the other topics for the later books.</p>
