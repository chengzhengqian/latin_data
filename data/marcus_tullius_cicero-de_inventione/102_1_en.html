done in this way. Part of these have reference to purpose or intent, which is an attribute of persons, as, for example, in the case which we outlined above.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL386_205_a" id="target_note_LCL386_205_a"><sup>a</sup></a> Pertinent circumstances before the deed are that he approached the rich man so familiarly, that he sought occasion to speak to him, that he stopped at the same inn and dined with him. The circumstances immediately connected with the deed are that it was night, and the victim was asleep. Pertinent events after the deed are that the accused left the inn alone, that he abandoned his intimate friend with such indifference, that he had a blood-stained sword.</p>

In this connexion one may inquire whether the event could not have occurred more readily in another way, or even have been a result of chance. For often, if money, assistance and assistants are lacking, there seems to have been no possibility of acting. If we watch carefully in this way we shall find that the attributes of actions and of persons are close,y connected.</p>

It is not necessary, because when the case is once stated the facts themselves will show what argument applies to each side; at least it will be plain to those who will not expect to find every detail set down in this book, but will <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">45</span><span class="br"></span>contribute only a fair grade of intelligence. It is not easy because it is an endless task to explain
