demonstrate how the one thing differs from the other; as a result we shall prove that different judgements should be passed on the thing compared and on the thing to which it is to be compared. We shall especially need the ability to do this when the criticism is to be directed against that particular form of argument which is handled by induction.</p>
<p>In case a decision or judgement is offered as an argument, it should, if truth or plausibility permits, be attacked by using the same topics by which it is supported, viz. by praising those who have made the decision,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL386_129_a" id="target_note_LCL386_129_a"><sup>a</sup></a> by the similarity between the matter under discussion and the matter about which judgement has been given; by stating that not only has the judgement not been attacked but that it has received universal approval; and by demonstrating that the case cited was more difficult or more important to decide than the present case.
