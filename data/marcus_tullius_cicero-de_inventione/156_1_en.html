law depends on the intention of the legislator and on the common weal, not on words: how unfair it is that justice and equity, which it is the intention of the legislator to protect, should be hindered by words.</p>
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">144</span><span class="br"></span><p>XLIX. A controversy arises from a conflict of laws when two or more laws seem to disagree; the following is an example. Law: A tyrannicide shall receive the reward commonly given to victors at the Olympic games and he shall ask the magistrate for whatever he wishes, and the magistrate shall give it to him. Another law: When a tyrant has been slain the magistrate shall execute his five nearest blood-relations. Alexander, who had set himself up as tyrant at Pherae in Thessaly, was killed by his wife, named Thebe, at night, when he was in bed with her. She demands as a reward her son whom she had by the tyrant. Some say that the boy ought to be executed according to law. The case is brought before a court.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL386_313_aa" id="target_note_LCL386_313_aa"><sup>a</sup></a></p>
<p>In this kind of case the same topics and the same rules will suit each side because each litigant will be under the necessity of supporting his own law <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">145</span><span class="br"></span>and attacking the one that conflicts. In the first place, then, one should compare the laws by considering which one deals with the most important matters, that is, the most expedient, honourable or necessary. The conclusion from this is that if two laws (or whatever number there may be if more than two) cannot be kept because they are at variance, the one is thought to have the greatest claim to be upheld which has reference to the greatest matters.</p>
