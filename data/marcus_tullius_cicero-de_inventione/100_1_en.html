<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">38</span><span class="br"></span><p>XII. Suspicions may be derived from the act itself, if one explores the whole course of the affair from all angles, and these suspicions may proceed in part from the act considered separately, and in part from the persons and the act taken together. They can be discovered in the action if we consider carefully the attributes of actions.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL386_201_a" id="target_note_LCL386_201_a"><sup>a</sup></a> All the main classes of these seem to fit this issue and most of the subdivisions. <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">39</span><span class="br"></span>It will be necessary to see first what is coherent with the action itself, that is, what cannot be separated from it. Under this head it will be sufficient to examine with care what occurred before the act from which it seems that hope of success was aroused or an opportunity to perform it was sought, what was actually done in carrying out the act, and what followed after it.</p>
<p>Next, the actual performance of the act should be considered. For this kind of attribute of the action <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">40</span><span class="br"></span>was put by us in the second place. Under this head we look into the place, time, occasion and facilities. The meaning of each of these was carefully explained in the rules for confirmation.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL386_201_b" id="target_note_LCL386_201_b"><sup>b</sup></a> We shall therefore insert here a discussion of what should be looked for under each head, in order that we may not seem to have omitted it here, but we shall be brief in order that we may not seem to repeat. In reference to place one should consider the opportunity which it afforded for the act, and in reference to time, length or duration, in reference to occasion, any circumstances lending themselves to the doing of the act, and under “facilities” the supply of, and access to, the means which make an act easier to perform or without which it cannot be done at all.</p>
