The equitable is that in which there is a question about the nature of justice and right or the reasonableness of reward or punishment. The legal is that in which we examine what the law is according to the custom of the community and according to justice: at Rome the jurisconsults are thought to be in charge of the <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">15</span><span class="br"></span>study of this subject.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL386_31_a" id="target_note_LCL386_31_a"><sup>a</sup></a> The equitable is itself divided into two parts, the absolute and the assumptive.
