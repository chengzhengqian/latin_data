is called the definitional issue, because the force of the term must be defined in words. When, however, the nature of the act is examined, the issue is said to be qualitative, because the controversy concerns the value of the act and its class or quality. But when the case depends on the circumstance that it appears that the right person does not bring the suit, or that he brings it against the wrong person, or before the wrong tribunal, or at a wrong time, under the wrong statute, or the wrong charge, or with a wrong penalty, the issue is called translative because the action seems to require a transfer to another court or alteration in the form of pleading. There will always be one of these issues applicable to every kind of case; for where none applies, there can be no controversy. Therefore it is not fitting to regard it as a case at all.</p>

In this case there must be a dispute about the definition, because there is no agreement about the essential point, not because the fact is not certain, but because the deed appears differently to different people, and for that reason different people

Ulysses chanced to pass by, saw that Ajax was dead and drew the blood-stained sword from the corpse. Teucer came by, saw his brother dead and his brother’s enemy holding the bloodstained sword. He charges Ulysses with murder.
