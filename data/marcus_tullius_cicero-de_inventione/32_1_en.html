Completeness is the quality by which we embrace in the partition all forms of argument which apply to the case, and about which we ought to speak, taking care that no useful argument be omitted or be introduced late as an addition to the plan of the speech, for this is faulty and unseemly in the highest degree. Conciseness in the partition is secured if only <span class="italic">genera</span> of things are given and they are not confused and mixed with their <span class="italic">species.</span> To explain: a <span class="italic">genus</span> is a class that embraces several <span class="italic">species,</span> as <span class="italic">animal.</span> A <span class="italic">species</span> is that which is a part of a <span class="italic">genus,</span> as <span class="italic">horse.</span> But often the same thing is a genus in relation to one thing and a species in relation to another. For example, man is a species of animal, but a genus of which Thebans or Trojans are species.</p>
