the premise, but in another argument the premise is weak unless the proof be added, then the proof is something different from the premise. There is, however, an argument in which the premise does not need proof and another in which it has no validity without the proof, as we shall show below. Therefore the proof is separate from the minor premise. We <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">65</span><span class="br"></span>shall show what we promised in this way: a minor premise which contains a truth plain to all does not need proof. Such an argument is of this nature: “If one ought to desire wisdom, it is proper to study philosophy.” Here the major premise needs proof; for it is not plain nor agreed upon by everyone; for many think that philosophy is no help and not a few think it is a positive disadvantage. The minor premise, however, is clear; it is as follows: “One should desire wisdom.” Because this is clear by itself and is known to be true, there is no point in proving it. Therefore the argument should be brought to a conclusion immediately. There is then a minor premise that does not need proof, and it is clear that some do need proof. Therefore proof is different from minor premise. It is, therefore, untrue that an argument cannot have more than <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">66</span><span class="br"></span>three parts.</p>
<p>XXXVII. And from this it is now clear that there is a certain form of argument in which neither the major nor the minor premise needs proof of this sort (to give a brief and definite instance as illustration): “If wisdom is to be sought above all things, then folly is to be avoided above all things; but wisdom <span class="italic">is</span> to be sought above all things, therefore folly is to be avoided above all things.” Here both the major and minor premise are clear, therefore neither needs proof. From all this it is clear that
