the writer neglected something more expedient, more honourable or more necessary. This can be brought about by saying that the interpretation which we make is honourable, expedient and necessary, and that of the opposition by no means of such a nature. Then if the controversy arises over an ambiguity in a law, we must try to make it appear that the interpretation which our opponent offers is dealt with <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">120</span><span class="br"></span>in another law. It will help greatly to show how he would have written if he had wished the opponent’s interpretation to be carried out or adopted. For instance, in this case which deals with the silver plate, the woman could say that there was no point in adding the words “as desired” if the testator was leaving the choice to his heir. For with these words omitted there is no doubt that the heir was to give what he himself wished. It was therefore stark madness, if he wished to provide for the interest of his heir, to add the words the omission of which would not prejudice the heir’s interest. <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">121</span><span class="br"></span>Therefore in such cases it will be necessary to make use of this kind of argument: “He would have written it in this way,” “He would not have used that word,” “He would not have put that word in that place.” For these considerations particularly reveal the intention of the writer. Then one might ask when it was written, so that it may be known what he was likely to write at such a time. Finally, by the topics of deliberative oratory we must show what was more expedient and more honourable both for the testator to write and for our opponents to sanction; and on the basis of these statements if there is any chance for amplification, both sides may use common topics.</p>
