third group possesses some of the characteristics of honour, and because honour is a higher quality, we may apply the better term to them and call them honourable, although it is understood that they are undoubtedly complex and belong to both groups. From this it follows that honour and advantage are the qualities of things to be sought, and baseness and disadvantage, of things to be avoided. These two classes—things to be sought and things to be avoided—are related to two important circumstances—necessity and affection.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL386_327_a" id="target_note_LCL386_327_a"><sup>a</sup></a> Necessity is considered with reference to force, and affection with reference to events and persons. We shall write at length with somewhat more detail about both later in the book.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL386_327_b" id="target_note_LCL386_327_b"><sup>b</sup></a> Now let us explain the nature of what is honourable.</p>

We shall call honourable<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL386_327_c" id="target_note_LCL386_327_c"><sup>c</sup></a> anything that is sought wholly or partly for its own sake. Now, since it has two divisions, one simple and the other complex, let us consider the simple one first. Everything in this class is embraced in one meaning and under one name, virtue. Virtue may be defined as a habit of mind in harmony with reason and the order of nature. Therefore when we have become acquainted with all its parts we shall have considered the full scope of honour, pure and simple. It has four parts: wisdom, justice, courage, temperance.</p>
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">160</span><span class="br"></span><p>Wisdom is the knowledge of what is good, what is bad and what is neither good nor bad. Its parts are memory, intelligence, and foresight. Memory is the faculty by which the mind recalls what has happened. Intelligence is the faculty by which it ascertains what is. Foresight is the faculty by which it is seen that something is going to occur before it occurs.</p>
