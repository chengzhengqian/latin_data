A general argument is one which is no less helpful to the opponents’ case than to ours, for example: “Therefore, gentlemen of the jury, I have summed up in a few words because justice was on my side.” A common argument is one which if granted now could be transferred to another situation not worthy of approval, as in the following sentence: “If he had not had justice on his side, gentlemen of the jury, he would not have entrusted himself to your decision.” A trifling argument is one which is offered too late, as: “If he had thought, he would not have done it,” or in which the pleader tries to cloak an obviously disgraceful act by a trifling defence, for example:</p>

Therefore this disaster seems attributable to Scipio.” The following lament is of the same nature:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">“Would God no axes e’er had felled to earth</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">The firs in Pelion’s wood.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL386_139_b" id="target_note_LCL386_139_b"><sup>b</sup></a></span><span class="linebreak"></span>
