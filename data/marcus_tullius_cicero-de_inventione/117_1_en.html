<p>It is illustrated by the following case: It was a nearly universal custom among the Greeks when they had fought with one another that the victors should set up a trophy in the country to commemorate the victory, but only for the time being, not that the record of the war might remain forever. The Thebans, having defeated the Lacedaemonians in battle, set up a trophy of bronze. They were accused before the Amphictyons, that is, before <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">70</span><span class="br"></span>the common council of Greece. The charge is: It was not right.” The reply is: “It was right.” The question is: “Was it right? “The defendants’ reason is: “By our valour we won such glory in war that we wished to leave a perpetual memorial of it to our descendants.” The counter-argument is: “Still it is not right for Greeks to set up a permanent memorial of their quarrels with Greeks.” The point for the judge’s decision is: “Granted that Greeks in order to publish abroad their consummate valour have set up a permanent memorial of their quarrels with Greeks, did they do right or wrong?” We have given this as the defendant’s reason in order to make clear the essential nature of this kind of case which we are discussing. For if we had given this reason, which perhaps they actually used: “You made war contrary to the dictates of justice and religion,” we should be going over to <span class="italic">relatio criminis</span> (retort of the accusation) of which we shall speak later. It is clear that either kind of issue fits this case. Arguments for it must be drawn from the same topics as in the legal issue <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">71</span><span class="br"></span>which was discussed above.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL386_235_a" id="target_note_LCL386_235_a"><sup>a</sup></a> It will be peimissible and right to take many weighty common topics both from the case itself if it contains any grounds
