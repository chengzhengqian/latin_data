either probable or certain is called an argument, and the same term is applied to the artistic embellishment <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">75</span><span class="br"></span>of this thought. Therefore, when they offer a statement of this sort: “Since she has borne a child, she has lain with a man,” they offer a thought, not embellishment.

Their line of reasoning, then, will not affect this matter; and by this distinction we shall repel other attacks which will seem to be damaging to this division of the argument into five parts; for example, if anyone should think that either the minor or the major premise may sometimes be omitted. And if this idea has any probability or cogency, it must have some sort of effect on the auditor. But if the bare statement of the argument were the only object, and it were of no consequence how the thought is developed and expanded, we should certainly not think that there is such a difference between the <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">76</span><span class="br"></span>greatest orators and the ordinary ones. Variety in the treatment of the speech will be the great necessity. For in everything monotony is the mother of boredom. Variety can be secured if we do not always approach the argument in the same way. For first of all it is desirable to produce diversity merely by using different kinds of arguments, that is, to use induction at one time and deduction at another; and again, in the deductive argument not to begin in every case with the major premise nor always employ all five possible parts nor embellish the parts in the same fashion, but sometimes to begin with the minor premise, sometimes use one of the two proofs, sometimes both, and finally, use now this and now that form of conclusion.
