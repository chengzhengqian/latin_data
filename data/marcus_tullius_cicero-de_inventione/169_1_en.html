Furthermore, I seem to see that there are some necessities with qualifications and some that are simple and absolute. For example, we use the word in one sense when we say: “It is necessary for the people of Casilinum to surrender to Hannibal,” but in a different sense when we say: “It is necessary for Casilinum to fall into the power of Hannibal.” In the first case there is this qualification: “Unless they prefer to die of starvation.” For if they prefer that, it is not necessary to surrender.

For when the necessity is simple there is no reason for saying a great deal since it is <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">172</span><span class="br"></span>utterly impossible to modify it.
