<p>A legal issue is one which has a dispute involving only a point of civil law. The following is an example: A certain man made a ward his heir; the ward, however, died before coming of age. A dispute arises between the reversionary heirs of the father of the ward and the agnates<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL386_227_a" id="target_note_LCL386_227_a"><sup>a</sup></a> of the ward over the property which the ward had inherited. The reversionary heirs have possession. The complaint of the agnates is: “We should have the property concerning which he, whose agnates we are, left no will.” The answer is: “On the other hand, it belongs to us who are the heirs under the father’s will.” The question is: “Who takes?” The plaintiff’s argument is: “The father made a will for himself and for his son as long as he should be a ward; therefore the property of the son must be ours according to the father’s will.” The reply to the argument is: “On the other hand, the father made his will for himself, and named reversionary heirs for himself, but not for his son; therefore nothing except what belonged to the father can come to you by his will.” The point for the judge’s decision is: “Can anyone bequeath property of a son who becomes a ward? Or are the reversionary heirs heirs of the father only, and not of his minor son also?”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL386_227_ba" id="target_note_LCL386_227_ba"><sup>ba</sup></a></p>
