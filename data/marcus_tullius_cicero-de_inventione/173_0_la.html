<p><sup><span class="italic">a</span></sup> In <span class="italic">de Inv.</span> I, 9, 12 Cicero objects to Hermagoras’ division of the <span class="italic">constitutio generalis</span> into (<span class="italic">pars</span>) <span class="italic">deliberativa, demonstrativa, iuridicialis</span> and <span class="italic">negotialis.</span> The criticism arises because Cicero has (in I, 5, 7) divided all oratory into three classes, deliberative, demonstrative and forensic. This is the tripartite division of Aristotle, based on the difference in the <span class="italic">audience</span> to which the speech is addressed, <span class="italic">i.e.</span> the deliberative speech is addressed to a legislative body, the forensic to a court of law, and the demonstrative to a group which is gathered for entertainment or amusement.</p>
<p>Hermagoras, on the other hand, began his division with <span class="italic">subject matter.</span> All speeches are divided according to the subject matter into two classes: (1) θέσις or general questions, (2) ὑποθέσις or special cases. Special cases are subdivided into λογικά ζητήματα or questions involving reasoning, and νομικὰ ζητήματα or questions involving law. The questions involving reasoning are divided according to the four στάσεις or <span class="italic">constitutiones, coniecturalis, definitiva, generalis, translativa.</span> The <span class="italic">constitutio generalis</span> involved the question of right and wrong and was divided again into four parts: (1) concerning the correctness of future acts (<span class="italic">i.e.</span> deliberative); (2) concerning a person—whether he was good or bad (<span class="italic">i.e.</span> epideictic or demonstrative, covering both laudatory and vituperative speeches); (3) <span class="italic">iuridicialis,</span> dealing with principles of equity and justice as applied to a given law suit; (4) <span class="italic">negotialis,</span> which involved questions of the interpretation of laws. Naturally the classification which brought the kinds of speeches in under the <span class="italic">constitutio generalis</span> did not square with Aristotle’s method of classification, but the error is in Cicero’s source who attempted to combine the two systems, and not in Hermagoras. There was, however, a logical fault in Hermagoras’ classification. The νομικὰ ζητήματα really belong under στάσεις (<span class="italic">constitutiones</span>) and are not co-ordinate with the λογικὰ ζητήματα.</p>
<p>Cicero does not see that similar difficulties arise in the <span class="italic">constitutio coniecturalis,</span> where the examples of present and future time both belong to the <span class="italic">causa deliberativa.</span></p>
