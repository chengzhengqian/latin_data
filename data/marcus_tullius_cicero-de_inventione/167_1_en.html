Since we are here discussing speeches about public issues, we associate friendship with benefits to be derived from it, so that it may seem desirable because of these as well as for its own sake. I say this that I may not perhaps be taken to task by those who think I am speaking of every kind of friendship. As a matter of fact there are some who think that friendship is to be sought solely for advantage, others, for itself alone, and others for itself and for advantage. Which opinion has the best foundation is a matter to be considered at another time. For the present let it be left thus as far as oratorical practice is concerned, that friendship is to be sought <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">168</span><span class="br"></span>for both reasons. In as much as some friendships are related to religious scruples, and some not, and some are old and some new, some arise from a kindness done to us by others, and some from our own services to them, some are more advantageous and some less, an examination of their nature will involve a consideration of the value of causes, the suitableness of times and occasion, moral obligation, religious duties, and length of time.</p>
<p>LVI. Advantage lies either in the body or in things outside the body. By far the largest part of external advantages, however, results in advantage of the body. For example, in the state there are some things that, so to speak, pertain to the body politic, such as fields, harbours, money, a fleet, sailors, soldiers and allies—the means by which states preserve their safety and liberty—and other things contribute something grander and less necessary, such as the great size and surpassing beauty of a city, an extraordinary amount of money and a multitude of friendships and alliances.
