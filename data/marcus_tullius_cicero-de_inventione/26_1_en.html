to dignity, because the best thing to do is that which especially commends the speaker to his audience. It should contain very little brilliance, vivacity, or finish of style, because these give rise to a suspicion of preparation and excessive ingenuity. As a result of this most of all the speech loses conviction and the speaker, authority.</p>
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">26</span><span class="br"></span><p>The following are surely the most obvious faults of <span class="italic">exordia,</span> which are by all means to be avoided: it should not be general, common, interchangeable, tedious, unconnected, out of place, or contrary to the fundamental principles. A <span class="italic">general</span> exordium is one which can be tacked to many cases, so as to seem to suit them all. A <span class="italic">common</span> exordium is one equally applicable to both sides of the case. The <span class="italic">interchangeable</span> can with slight changes be used by the opponent in a speech on the other side. The <span class="italic">tedious</span> exordium is one which is spun out beyond all need with a superabundance of words or ideas. The <span class="italic">unconnected</span> is one which is not derived from the circumstances of the case nor closely knit with the rest of the speech, as a limb to a body. It is <span class="italic">out of place</span> if it produces a result different from what the nature of the case requires: for example, if it makes the audience receptive when the case calls for good-will, or uses an introduction when the situation demands an insinuation. It is contrary to fundamental principles when it achieves none of the purposes for which rules are given about exordia, that is, when it renders the audience neither well-disposed, nor attentive, nor receptive, or produces the opposite result; and nothing surely can be worse than that. This is enough to say about the exordium.</p>
