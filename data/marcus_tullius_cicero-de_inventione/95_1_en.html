For all the following attributes of nature are pertinent for making an inference: Is the person a man or woman, of this city or of that? Who were his ancestors, who are his kin? What is his age, temperament, physical condition? And many suspicions may be suggested by a man’s way of life when the question is asked how and with whom and by whom he was reared and educated, and with whom he lives, what his plan or purpose in life is, and what his home life is like.</p>

The “inexperienced” Greeks were probably misled by the reference to a Roman by his <span class="italic">nomen</span> instead of the <span class="italic">cognomen,</span> which in some cases was the more usual form.
