not supported by proof. Therefore major premise and proof, which the other group count as two parts, seem to them to be one, namely major premise; if this is not proved, it could not be the major premise of the argument. Likewise, what is called by the other group minor premise and proof, seems to them merely minor premise. The result is that an argument treated in the same way seems to one group threefold and to another fivefold. Consequently the subject is not so important for the actual practice of oratory as it is for methods of instruction.</p>

But I think that I should explain why I favour this division so that I may not be thought to have followed it without due cause: and the explanation should be brief so that we may not linger on matters of this sort longer than our plan of instruction requires.</p>

The Peripatetic syllogism had only three parts. The fivefold arrangement must derive from the rhetorical adaptation of syllogistic reasoning, perhaps the work of Hermagoras. The rhetorician used an adaptation of the logical syllogism either in the form of the enthymeme, a syllogism in which the major premise is only probable, or one in which one term is omitted, or the epicheireme, which is the technical term for the fivefold division here presented by Cicero. <span class="italic">Cf.</span> Thiele, <span class="italic">Hermagoras,</span> pp. 131â€“137, and <span class="italic">ad Her.</span> II, xviii, 27.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL386_105_aa').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
