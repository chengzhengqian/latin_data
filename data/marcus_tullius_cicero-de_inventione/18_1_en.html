<p>And then, after considering the nature of the case, when you have found out whether it is simple or complex, and you have seen whether it discusses a written document or involves general reasoning, then you must see what the question in the case is (<span class="italic">quaestio</span>), and the excuse or reason (<span class="italic">ratio</span>), the point for the judge’s decision (<span class="italic">iudicatio</span>) and the foundation or supporting argument (<span class="italic">firmamentum</span>). All of these should develop out of the determination of the issue. The question (<span class="italic">quaestio)</span> is the subject of debate which arises from the conflict of pleas, in this way: “You were not justified in doing it.” “I was justified in doing it.” It is the conflict of pleas, moreover, which determines the issue. From this then comes the subject of debate which we call the question (<span class="italic">quaestio),</span> as follows: “Was he justified in doing it?” The reason or excuse is that which holds the case together: if this were taken away there would be no debate left about the case. For instance, to make my meaning clear, let me dwell on a simple and well-known example: If Orestes be accused of murdering his mother, unless he say, “I was justified; for she had killed my father,” he has no defence. If this excuse were taken away, the whole debate would be taken away, too. Therefore the excuse in this case is that she killed Agamemnon. The point for the judge’s decision (<span class="italic">iudicatio</span>) is that which arises from the denial and assertion of the reason or excuse. Suppose, for example, that the excuse has been set up which we mentioned a little while ago. “For she,” he says,
