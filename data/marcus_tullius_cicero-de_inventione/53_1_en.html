<p>proof of the premise, but on the other hand in another argument the major premise is weak unless the proof be added, then the proof is something separate from the major premise. For what can be added to something and separated from it cannot be the same as that to which it is added and from which it is separated. There is, moreover, a form of argument in which the major premise does not require proof, and one in which it has no validity without proof as we shall show below. Proof is therefore separate from major premise. What we promised will be shown in the following way. There is no point in requiring proof or demonstration of a premise which contains a plain statement which must be granted by <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">63</span><span class="br"></span>everyone. The following is an example: “If I was in Athens on the day on which the murder was committed at Rome, I could not have been present at the murder.” Because this is obviously true there is no point in having it proved. Therefore we should pass immediately to the minor premise, as follows: “But I was at Athens on that day.” If this is not granted, it needs proof, after which the conclusion follows. There is, therefore, a kind of major premise which does not need proof. What, then, is the point of showing that there <span class="italic">is</span> a premise which does need proof, for that can easily be seen by anyone? But if this is so, it follows from this statement and from my previous statement that proof is a thing separate from premise. And if this is so, it is untrue that an argument can have no more than three points.</p>
