as far as words are concerned, to demonstrate that your opponent committed lese-majesty, and then to support the whole argument by a common topic in which you magnify and inveigh against the enormity of the deed itself, its heinousness or at least its guilt. After that the definition of the <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">54</span><span class="br"></span>opposing counsel must be invalidated; this can be done if it is shown to be false. Such an argument will be based on common belief when one considers how and in what connexion people are accustomed to use such a word in ordinary writing or speech. The definition of the opponents may also be attacked if we show that to approve it is dishonourable and inexpedient, and point out what disadvantages will follow if their definition is accepted (this is based on the concepts of honour and advantage which we shall expound in giving the rules for speeches before deliberative bodies) ;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL386_217_a" id="target_note_LCL386_217_a"><sup>a</sup></a> and if we compare our definition with that of our opponents and prove that ours is <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">55</span><span class="br"></span>true, honourable and expedient, and theirs the opposite. Furthermore, we shall search for similar cases of greater or less or of equal seriousness to support our definition.</p>

In a case in which several words have to be defined—for example, when the question is whether it is theft or sacrilege to steal sacred vessels from a private house—one must make use of several definitions and then proceed to treat the case in the manner already laid down. Another common topic attacks the villainy of a man who, attempting to arrogate to himself the control not only of acts but also of words, both does what he pleases and calls his deed by whatever name he pleases.</p>
