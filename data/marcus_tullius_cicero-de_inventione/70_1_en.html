many objects, as follows: “He is seditious who is a bad and useless citizen,” for this does not describe the character of a seditious man any more than of one who is over-ambitious or a pettifogger, or any wicked person; or one which makes a false statement, in this fashion: “Wisdom is knowledge of how to acquire money;” or one which contains some small or insignificant point, like the following: “Folly is boundless greed for fame.” This is folly, to be sure, but is only a partial and not a complete definition.

A discreditable argument is one which because of something dishonourable seems unworthy of the place in which it is delivered or of the speaker or of the time at which it is delivered or of the audience or of the subject under discussion. An offensive argument is one which wounds the sensibilities of the audience; for instance, if anyone speaking before the Roman <span class="italic">equites</span> who desire the privilege of serving on the jury should praise Caepio’s</p>
