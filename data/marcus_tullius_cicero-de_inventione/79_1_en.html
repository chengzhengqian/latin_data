The second employs a division according to time, and shows in what troubles they have been, still are, and are destined to be. The third, in which each separate phase of misfortune is deplored; for example, in lamenting the death of a son, one might mention the delight that his father took in his childhood, his love, his hope for the boy’s future, the comfort he derived from him, the careful training, and whatever in a similar case can be said in bewailing any misfortune. The fourth, in which one recounts shameful, mean, and ignoble acts and what they have suffered or are likely to suffer that is unworthy of their age, race, former fortune, position or preferment. The fifth, in which all the misfortunes are presented to view one by one, so that the auditor may seem to see them, and may be moved to pity by the actual occurrence, as if he <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">108</span><span class="br"></span>were present, and not by words alone. The sixth, in which it is shown that one is in distress contrary to all expectation, and when he looked forward to receiving some benefit, he not only did not gain it, but fell into the greatest distress. The seventh, in which we turn to the audience and ask them when they look at us to think of their children or parents or some one who ought to be dear to them. The eighth, in which something is said to have happened which ought not, or that something did not happen which ought to have happened: for example, “I was not present, I did not see him, I did not hear his last words, I did not catch his last breath.”
