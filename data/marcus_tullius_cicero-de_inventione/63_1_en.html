For in the case of a sign, first it must be shown to be true; and in the second place to be a proper sign of the thing under discussion, as, for example, blood is a sign of murder; in the third place that it indicates that something has been done which ought not to have been done, or that something has been left undone which ought to have been done; and finally that the person knew the law and custom in respect to the matter under discussion.

When something is introduced as a parallel, since this topic is largely treated by showing similarity, it will be proper in refutation to deny that the thing compared is similar to that to which it is compared. This can be done if it is shown that it differs in kind, nature, meaning, importance, time, place, person, or repute;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL386_127_c" id="target_note_LCL386_127_c"><sup>c</sup></a> and in particular if it is shown in what class it is proper to put that which is cited as similar, and in what group to put that which the comparison is intended to illumine.
