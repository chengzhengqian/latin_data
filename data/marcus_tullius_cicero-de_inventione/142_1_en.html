<p>Enough has now been said about the “issues”; now I think we should discuss the controversies which turn upon written documents.</p>
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">116</span><span class="br"></span><p>XL. A controversy turns upon written documents when some doubt arises from the nature of writing. This comes about from ambiguity, from the letter and intent, from conflict of laws, from reasoning by analogy, from definition.</p>
<p>A controversy arises from ambiguity when there is doubt as to what the writer meant, because the written statement has two or more meanings, after this fashion: A father, in making his son his principal heir bequeathed to his wife a hundred pounds of silver plate in the following terms: “Let my heir give to my wife a hundred pounds of silver plate as desired.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL386_285_a" id="target_note_LCL386_285_a"><sup>a</sup></a> After his death the mother asks her son for some magnificent examples of plate with costly chasing. He says that he is obligated to give her only what <span class="italic">he</span> desires.</p>
<p>In the first place it should be shown, if possible, that there is no ambiguity in the statement, because in ordinary conversation everyone is accustomed to use this single word or phrase in the sense in which the speaker will prove that it should be taken. <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">117</span><span class="br"></span>In the second place it must be shown that from what precedes or follows in the document the doubtful point becomes plain. Therefore, if words are to be considered separately by themselves, every word, or at least many words, would seem ambiguous; but it is not right to regard as ambiguous what becomes plain on consideration of the whole context.</p>
