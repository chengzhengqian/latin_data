<p>But if Hermagoras had possessed great skill in dealing with these subjects—a skill acquired by study and training—he would seem to have laid down a false principle about the profession of the orator through confidence in his own knowledge, and to have described not what the art, but what he himself could accomplish. But as a matter of fact the man’s ability is such that one will more readily deny him the power of rhetoric than grant him acquaintance with philosophy. Not that I think the text-book which he published is very faulty, for he seems to have done well enough at arranging topics which he had chosen with ingenuity and care from earlier authors, and to have added something new himself;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL386_19_b" id="target_note_LCL386_19_b"><sup>b</sup></a> but for an orator it is a very slight thing to talk about his art, as he has done; by far the most important thing is to speak in accordance with the principles of his art, which we all see he was wholly incapable of doing.</p>

The parts of it, as most authorities have stated, are Invention, Arrangement, Expression, Memory, Delivery. Invention is the discovery of valid or seemingly valid arguments to render one’s cause plausible. Arrangement is the distribution of arguments thus discovered in the proper order.</p>

Even so Hermagoras was undoubtedly trying to extend the field of rhetoric and was trespassing on territory claimed by philosophers. The first and third questions here propounded were Stoic problems, the others were favourite problems of the Epicureans. <span class="italic">Quaestio</span> translated “general question” is Hermagoras’ θέσις; <span class="italic">causa</span> or “special case” is ὑπόθεσις.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL386_19_aa').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL386_19_b"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL386_19_b" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">b</sup>Ungenerous of Cicero, for Hermagoras was the inventor of the doctrine of “status” which forms the backbone of the <span class="italic">de Inventione.</span></a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL386_19_b').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
