A simple case is one which contains in itself one plain question, such as “Shall we declare war on Corinth or not?” A complex case is made up of several questions; in which several inquiries are made, such as: “Should Carthage be destroyed, or handed back to the Carthaginians, or should a colony be established there?” The case involves comparison when various actions are contrasted and the question is which one is more desirable or which is most desirable to perform, in this fashion: “Should an army be sent to Macedonia against Philip to support our allies, or should it be kept in Italy so that the greatest possible force may oppose Hannibal?”</p>

Of this there are five kinds, which are separate from the “issues.” In one case it seems that there is a variance between the actual words and the intent of the author; in another, that two or more laws disagree; again, that what is written has two or more meanings; again, that from what has been written something is discovered which has not been written; finally, that there is a question about the meaning of a word, <span class="italic">i.e.,</span> on what the meaning depends, as if it were in the definitional issue. Therefore the first class is said to be concerned with the letter and the intent, the second with the conflict of laws, the third with ambiguity, the fourth with reasoning by analogy,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL386_35_a" id="target_note_LCL386_35_a"><sup>a</sup></a>
