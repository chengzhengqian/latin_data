either there is no classification of arguments or there are only forensic arguments, or there are three genera, forensic, epideictic, and deliberative. To say that there is no classification of arguments when he says that there are many and gives rules for them, is madness. How can there be only one genus—the forensic—when deliberative and epideictic are not similar to each other and are far different from the forensic kind and each has its own end to which it may be referred? It follows, therefore, that there are, in all, three genera of arguments. Deliberative and epideictic cannot rightly be regarded as species of any kind of argument. He was wrong, then, in saying that they are species of the qualitative issue.</p>

Wherefore if they cannot rightly be regarded as species of a genus of argument, there will be much less justification for regarding them as sub-heads of a species of argument. But the “issue” is nothing but a sub-head of argument. For the argument is not subsumed under the issue but the issue is subsumed under the argument. But epideictic and deliberative cannot rightly be regarded as species of a genus of argument, because they are themselves the genera of argument; there will be much less justification for regarding them as sub-heads of this species which is here described. In the second place, if the issue, either entire or any part of it, is an answer to an accusation, then that which is not an answer to an accusation cannot be either an issue or a sub-head of an issue. But if what is not an answer to an accusation is neither an issue or a sub-head of an issue, deliberative and epideictic speeches are not an issue or a sub-head of an issue. If, then, the issue, either entire or any part of it, is the answer to an
