rigorous proof, generally in speaking takes the form of a dilemma, or of an enumeration or of a simple <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">45</span><span class="br"></span>inference. A dilemma is a form of argument in which you are refuted, whichever alternative you grant, after this fashion: “If he is a scoundrel, why are you intimate with him? If he is an honest man, why accuse him?” Enumeration is a form of argument in which several possibilities are stated, and when all but one have been disproved, this one is irrefutably demonstrated; the following is an example: “He must have been killed by the defendant either because of his enmity to him, or through fear or hope or to gratify a friend; if none of these statements is true, he cannot have been killed by the defendant. For a crime cannot be committed without a motive. If there was no enmity, and no fear, and no hope of any advantages from his death and his death was of no interest to any friend of the defendant, it therefore follows that the defendant did not kill him.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL386_85_a" id="target_note_LCL386_85_a"><sup>a</sup></a> A simple inference arises from a necessary consequence, as follows: “If you say that I did this at that time, but at that particular time I was overseas, it follows that I not only did not do what you say, but that I was not even in a position to do it.” And it will be necessary to keep a sharp watch that this kind of argument cannot be refuted in any way, so that the proof may not contain in itself only a form of argument and a mere appearance of a necessary conclusion, but rather that the argument may rest on rigorous reasoning.</p>
