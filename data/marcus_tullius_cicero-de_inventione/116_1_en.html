law have now become fixed by custom; among these <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">68</span><span class="br"></span>are covenants, equity and decisions. A covenant is a compact which is regarded as so binding between the contracting parties that it is said to take priority in law.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL386_233_a" id="target_note_LCL386_233_a"><sup>a</sup></a> Equity is what is just and fair to all. A decision is something determined previously by the opinion of some person or persons. Statute law must be learned from the statutes. Using these divisions of the law the speaker must study what seems to develop in each case either from the case itself or from a similar case or one of greater or less importance, and bring out the proper argument by a careful examination of each division of the law.</p>
<p>As for common topics, since, as has been said before,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL386_233_b" id="target_note_LCL386_233_b"><sup>b</sup></a> there are two kinds, one of which contains an amplification of a doubtful statement, the other, of an undisputed fact, one will consider what the case offers, and what can and should be amplified by a common topic. For definite common topics cannot be prescribed to fit all cases; it is likely that in many cases it will be necessary to speak for and against the authority of jurisconsults. Moreover, it is necessary to consider in this issue, and in all, whether the facts of the case themselves do not suggest other common topics than those which we propose.</p>
<p>Now let us consider the division of the qualitative issue which is known as equitable, and its subdivisions.</p>
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">69</span><span class="br"></span><p>XXIII. The term equitable covers cases in which there is a question of the nature of justice and of the principles of reward or punishment. There are two subdivisions, absolute and assumptive. The absolute contains in itself the question of right and wrong, not confusedly and obscurely, as in the legal, but more clearly and obviously.</p>
