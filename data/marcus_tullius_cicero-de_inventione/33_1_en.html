some care so that when the theory of classification is clearly understood, conciseness in dealing with classes may be secured in the partition. For one who divides his speech as follows: “I shall show that through the covetousness, audacity and avarice of my opponents all disasters have come upon the state,” was not aware that in his partition he mentioned a genus and then combined it with a species of that genus. For covetousness or desire certainly is the genus of all appetites, and of this genus avarice is <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">33</span><span class="br"></span>without doubt a species. You should therefore be on your guard lest after mentioning a genus you mention a species of it in the same partition, as if it were -different and dissimilar. But if a genus has several species, after stating it straightforwardly in the first partition, the division into species may be most conveniently made when one comes to explain that particular point in the course of the speech after the partition. It also contributes to conciseness not to say that we shall prove more than is necessary, as is done in the following example: “I shall show that my opponents were able to commit the crime with which we charge them, that they wished to, and that they did commit it;” for it would have been enough to prove that they did commit the crime; nor, when there is no partition in the case, because a single question is being debated (but this is a very rare occurrence), to use in spite of that fact a careful distribution.</p>
<p>There are other rules for the partition not so closely connected with oratorical practice; they are used in philosophy, and from them we have chosen the particular rules which seemed to apply and which we did not find in the other textbooks.</p>
