resentment coupled with one of complaint can be introduced with great effect;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL386_199_a" id="target_note_LCL386_199_a"><sup>a</sup></a> in this it will be pointed out that when his character has been throughout his life utterly foreign to wrongdoing, it is miserable and unworthy treatment to suppose that the motive which often hurries audacious men into guilt could have induced the purest of men to commit a crime. Or the argument may be handled in this way: it is unfair and injurious to every good man that one’s honourable life in the past should not be of the greatest possible help to him at such a time, but that judgement should be given on the basis of a sudden charge which can be made up out of whole cloth rather than on the basis of his past life, which cannot be made up for the occasion nor changed in any way.</p>

Or these acts may be attributed to folly, necessity, persuasion, youth or some trait of character that is not malicious; or they may be shown to be vices of a different kind so that his character, though not perfect in all respects, may seem to have no connexion with such a crime as is now charged against him. But if a speech can do nothing to relieve the shame and baseness of his life, the counsel will have to say that the defendant’s life and character are not under investigation, but only the crime of which he is accused; that, therefore, his past deeds should be left out of the discussion, and only the present case should be debated.</p>
