accusation, deliberative and epideictic speeches cannot be either an issue or a sub-head of an issue. But he himself is of the opinion that the issue is the answer to an accusation. He ought, therefore, to be of the opinion that epideictic and deliberative speeches are not the issue or a sub-head of the issue. And he will be pressed by the same argument whether he defines issue as the first assertion of his cause by the accuser or the first plea of the defendant. For all the same difficulties will attend him.</p>
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">14</span><span class="br"></span><p>Furthermore a conjectural argument cannot at one and the same time and from the same point of view and under the same system of classification be both conjectural and definitive, nor can a definitive argument be at one and the same time and from the same point of view and under the same system of classification both definitive and translative. And, to put it generally, no issue or sub-head of an issue can have its own scope and also include the scope of another issue, because each one is studied directly by itself and in its own nature, and if another is added, the number of issues is doubled but the scope of any one issue is not increased. But a deliberative argument generally includes at one and the same time and from the same point of view and under the same system of classification an issue, or <span class="italic">constitutio,</span> the conjectural, qualitative, definitional, or translative, either any one of these or at times more than one. Therefore it is not itself an issue or a sub-head of an issue. The same thing is wont to occur in the demonstrative (or epideictic) speech. These, then, as we said before, are to be regarded as the genera of oratory and not as sub-heads under any issue.</p>
