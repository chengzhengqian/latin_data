praise some one he should speak of his good luck and not of his virtue; or if he compares one thing with another with the idea that he cannot praise one <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">95</span><span class="br"></span>without blaming the other; or if he praises one without mentioning the other; or if when a definite subject is under discussion, he addresses his speech to a common topic, for instance, if one, when some state is deliberating whether to go to war or not, should devote his speech to praise of peace in general and not prove that this particular war was useless; or if a false reason is given for something, as is illustrated in the following: “Money is good, for it is the thing which does the most to make life happy;” or the reason may be weak, as in these lines from Plautus:</p>
<blockquote><p>
“Castigating a friend even when his offence deserves it is a thankless job, but at times it’s useful and expedient. Now here am I—with a friend I mean to castigate thoroughly, as his offence thoroughly deserves.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL386_145_a" id="target_note_LCL386_145_a"><sup>a</sup></a>
</p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">or the reason may be merely a statement of the same idea in different words, for example: “Avarice is bad, for desire for money has brought great disasters on many;” or the reason may be insufficient, for example: “Friendship is the highest good, for there are many pleasures in friendship.”</p>
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">96</span><span class="br"></span><p>LI. The fourth method of refutation is to counter a strong argument with one equally strong or stronger. This kind will be used particularly in speaking before a deliberative body, when we grant that something said on the other side is fair, but prove that the position we are defending is necessary; or when we acknowledge that the course of action which they defend is advantageous, but prove that ours is honourable.</p>
