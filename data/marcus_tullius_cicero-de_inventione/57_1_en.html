stark madness not to interpret a law with an eye to the safety of the state when that law had been passed for the safety of the state. In view of this, if all laws ought to be related to the advantage of the state, and Epaminondas contributed to the safety of the state, surely he cannot by the same act have promoted the common interest and have failed to obey the laws.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL386_115_a" id="target_note_LCL386_115_a"><sup>a</sup></a></p>
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">70</span><span class="br"></span><p>XXXIX. An argument consists of four parts when we state a premise, either major or minor, without giving the proof. This should be done either when the major premise is self-intelligible or when the minor premise is an obvious statement needing no proof. An argument in four parts with the proof of the major premise omitted is handled in this fashion: “Gentlemen of the jury, you, who have sworn to decide according to the law, ought to obey the laws. But you cannot obey the laws unless you follow what is written in the law. What more certain proof of his intent could the author of the law have left than the statement which he wrote himself with great care and pains? Therefore, if there were no written documents we should be in sad need of them to learn from them the intent of the law-giver; nevertheless we should not permit Epaminondas even if he were not under the jurisdiction of the court to interpret to us the meaning of the law; much less, since we have the law before us, should we suffer him to interpret the intent of the law-maker, not by what is quite plainly written, but by what suits his case. Hence, gentlemen of the jury, if you ought to obey the laws, and you cannot do this unless you follow what is written in the law, why not decide that he acted contrary to law?”</p>
