or have not followed him with sufficient discrimination, I shall, when someone points out my error, readily and gladly change my opinion. For disgrace lies not in imperfect knowledge but in foolish and obstinate continuance in a state of imperfect knowledge; for ignorance is attributed to the infirmity common to the human race, but obstinacy to a man’s own fault. <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">10</span><span class="br"></span>Therefore without affirming anything positively, I shall proceed with an inquiring mind and make each statement with a degree of hesitation, lest in gaining the small point of having written an apparently useful book, I fall short of the chief goal, not to be rash and hasty in giving my approval to any item. This principle I shall of course pursue both now and in all my life as zealously as possible; now, however, that this introduction may not seem to run on too long, I shall state the topics which remain to be elucidated.</p>

And because in the first book the manner of developing argumentations was explained with some care, in the second book I shall present only the invented arguments or ideas involved in each case without any literary adornment,
