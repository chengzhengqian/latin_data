so that in this book one may look for the ideas, but in the former book for the embellishment of the ideas. Therefore the reader should regard the suggestions which follow as applying to confirmation and refutation.</p>
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">12</span><span class="br"></span><p>IV. Every speech whether epideictic, deliberative or forensic must turn on one or more of the “issues” described in the first book.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL386_177_a" id="target_note_LCL386_177_a"><sup>a</sup></a> Although this is true, nevertheless, in spite of there being many rules common to all, there are also other and different rules applicable to each kind of speech. For one object should be attained by, praise, another by censure, another by an expression of opinion and another by accusation or defence. In trials the inquiry is about what is just, in an epideictic speech, about what is honourable, in speeches before deliberative bodies, as I think, about what is honourable and what is advantageous. Other writers, however, have thought that advantage alone should be proposed as an object <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">13</span><span class="br"></span>in urging or opposing a political measure. Those kinds of speeches, then, which have different ends and purposes cannot have the same rules. I am not saying now that the same “issues” do not arise, but that an oration which is aimed at portraying someone’s life or at expressing an opinion on a political subject, arises out of its very purpose and the nature of its subject. Therefore at present I shall concern myself in explaining controversies with the class of speech delivered in courts of law and the rules applying to them; many of these rules can with no difficulty be transferred to other kinds of speeches, too, which involve a similar controversy. Later I shall speak separately of the others.</p>
