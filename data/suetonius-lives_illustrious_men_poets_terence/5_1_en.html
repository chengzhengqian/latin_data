<p>his plays, he left Rome and never returned. Of his death Vulcatius writes in these words:</p>

<span class="line">But when Afer had presented six comedies to the</span><span class="linebreak"></span>

<p>V. Quintus Cosconius writes that he was lost at sea as he was returning from Greece with one hundred and eight plays adapted from Menander; the rest of our authorities declare that he died at Stymphalus in Arcadia, or at Leucadia, in the consulship<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL038_445_9" id="target_note_LCL038_445_9"><sup>9</sup></a> of Gnaeus Cornelius Dolabella and Marcus Fulvius Nobilior, having fallen ill from grief and annoyance at losing his baggage, which he had sent on to the ship, and with it the new plays which he had written.</p>
<p>He is said to have been of moderate height, slender and of dark complexion. He left a daughter, who afterwards became the wife of a Roman knight; also gardens twenty acres<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL038_445_10" id="target_note_LCL038_445_10"><sup>10</sup></a> in extent on the Appian Way, near the villa of Mars. This makes me feel the more surprised that Porcius should write:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">Naught availed him Scipio, naught Laelius, naught</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Furius, the three wealthiest nobles of that time.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Their aid did not even give him a rented house, to</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">provide at least a place where his slave might announce</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">his masterâ€™s death.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
