<p>XI. Through a specious appearance of expediency<span class="marginNote right">(4)
apparent political expediency and duty to humanity.</span> wrong is very
often committed in transactions between state and state, as by our own
country in the destruction of Corinth. A more cruel wrong was perpetrated by
the Athenians in decreeing that the Aeginetans, whose strength lay in their
navy, should have their thumbs cut off. This seemed to be expedient; for
Aegina was too grave a menace, as it was close to the Piraeus. But no
cruelty can be expedient; for cruelty is most abhorrent to human <span class="innerMarginNote left">47</span> nature, whose lead we ought
to follow. They, too, do wrong who would debar foreigners from enjoying the
advantages of their city and would exclude them from its borders, as was
done by Pennus in the time of our fathers, and in recent times by Papius. It
may not be right, of course, for one who is not a citizen to exercise the
rights and privileges of citizenship; and the law on this point was secured
by two of our wisest consuls, Crassus and Scaevola. Still, to debar
foreigners from enjoying the advantages of the city is altogether contrary
to the laws of humanity.</p>

Our own country has many instances to offer throughout her history, and
