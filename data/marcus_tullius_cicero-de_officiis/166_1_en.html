100,000 sesterces over and above what he asked. No one could say that this
was not the act of an honest man; but people do say that it was not the act
of a worldly-wise man, any more than if he had sold for a smaller amount
than he could have commanded. Here, then, is that mischievous
idea—the world accounting some men upright, others wise; and it is
this fact that gives Ennius occasion to say:</p>

he will abstain from doing for his own profit only what the law expressly
forbids. Such a man deserves no great praise nor gratitude.</p>
