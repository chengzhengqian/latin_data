although our school maintains that nothing can be known for certain, yet,
they urge, I make a habit of presenting my opinions on all sorts of subjects
and at this very moment am trying to formulate rules of duty. But I wish
that they had a proper understanding of our position. For we Academicians
are not men whose minds wander in uncertainty and never know what principles
to adopt. For what sort of mental habit, or rather what sort of life would

living? Not so with us; but, as other schools maintain that some things are
certain, others uncertain, we, differing with them, say that some things are
probable, others improbable.</p>

<p>What, then, is to hinder me from accepting what seems to me to be probable,
while rejecting what seems to be improbable, and from shunning the
presumption of dogmatism, while keeping clear of that recklessness of
assertion which is as far as possible removed from true wisdom? And as to
the fact that our school argues against everything, that is only because we
could not get a clear view of what is “probable,” unless a
comparative estimate were made of all the arguments on both sides.</p>
<p>But this subject has been, I think, quite fully set forth in my
