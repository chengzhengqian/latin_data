the knowledge of them through natural goodness of heart and through
advancement in learning. But that duty which those same Stoics call
“right” is perfect and absolute and “satisfies all the
numbers,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL030_283_a" id="target_note_LCL030_283_a"><sup>a</sup></a> as that same school says, and is <span class="innerMarginNote left">15</span> attainable by none except the
