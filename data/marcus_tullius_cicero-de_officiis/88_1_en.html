<p>III. Five principles, accordingly, have been laid<span class="marginNote right">Expediency and Moral Rectitude identical</span> down for the pursuance
of duty: two of them have to do with propriety and moral rectitude; two,
with the external conveniences of lifeâ€”means, wealth, influence; the

completed, and this is the part with which I desire you to be most

expedient that is (apparently) not morally right.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL030_177_a').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
