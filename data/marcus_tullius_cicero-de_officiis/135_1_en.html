<p>I. Cato, who was of about the same years, Marcus,<span class="marginNote right">Preface: Scipio and Cicero.</span> my son, as that Publius Scipio who
first bore the and surname of Africanus, has given us the statement that
Scipio used to say that he was never less idle than when he had nothing to
do and never less lonely than when he was alone. An admirable sentiment, in
truth, and becoming to a great and wise man. It shows that even in his
leisure hours his thoughts were occupied with public business and that he
used to commune with himself when alone; and so not only was he never
unoccupied, but he sometimes had no need for company. The two conditions,
then, that prompt others to idleness—leisure and solitude—only
spurred him on. I wish I could say the same of myself and say it truly. But
if by imitation I cannot attain to such excellence of character, in
aspiration, at all events, I approach it as nearly as I can; for as I am
kept by force of armed treason away from practical politics and from my
practice at the bar, I am now leading a life of leisure. For that reason I
have left the city and, wandering in the country from place to place, I am
often alone.</p>

<p>But I should not compare this leisure of mine with that of Africanus, nor
this solitude with his. For he, to find leisure from his splendid services
to his country, used to take a vacation now and then and to retreat from the
assemblies and the throngs of men into solitude, as into a haven of rest.
