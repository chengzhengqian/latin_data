consider not only whether an action is morally right or morally wrong, but
also, when a choice of two morally right courses is offered, which one is
morally better; and likewise, when a choice of two expedients is offered,
which one is more expedient. Thus the question which Panaetius thought
threefold ought, we find, to be divided into five parts. First, therefore,
we must discuss the moral—and that, under two sub-heads; secondly, in
the same manner, the expedient; and finally, the cases where they must be
weighed against each other.</p>

seems likely to cause injury to life or limb, and of procuring and providing
everything needful for life—food, shelter, and the like. A common
property of all creatures is also the reproductive instinct (the purpose of
which is the propagation of the species) and also a certain amount<span class="marginNote right">Instinct and Reason.</span> of concern for their
offspring. But the most marked difference between man and beast is this: the
beast, just as far as it is moved by the senses and with very little
perception of past or future, adapts itself to that alone which is present
at the moment; while man—because he is endowed with reason, by which
he comprehends the chain of consequences, perceives the causes of things,
understands the relation of cause to effect and of effect to cause, draws
analogies, and connects and associates the present and the
future—easily surveys the course of his whole life and makes the
necessary preparations for its conduct.</p>
