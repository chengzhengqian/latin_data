<p>avoid all arrogance, haughtiness, and pride. For it is as much a sign of
weakness to give way to one’s feelings in success as it is in
adversity. But it is a fine thing to keep an unruffled temper, an unchanging
mien, and the same cast of countenance in every condition of life; this,
history tells us, was characteristic of Socrates and no less of Gaius
Laelius. Philip, king of Macedon, I observe, however surpassed by his son in
achievements and fame, was superior to him in affability and refinement.
Philip, accordingly, was always great; Alexander, often infamously bad.
There seems to be sound advice, therefore, in this word of warning:

Africanus, his pupil and friend, used to say: “As, when horses have
become mettlesome and unmanageable on account of their frequent
participation in battles, their owners put them in the hands of trainers to
make them more tractable; so men, who through prosperity have become restive
and over self-confident, ought to be put into the training-ring, so to
speak, of reason and learning, that they may be brought to comprehend the
frailty of human affairs and the fickleness of fortune.”</p>

friends, and the greater the heed that should be given to their advice.
Under such circumstances also we must beware of lending an ear to sycophants
or allowing them to impose upon us with their flattery. For it is easy in
this way to deceive ourselves, since we thus come to think ourselves duly
entitled to praise; and to this frame of mind a thousand delusions </p></section><notes></notes></section>
