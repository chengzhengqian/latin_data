<p>XII. Let it be set down as an established principle, then, that what is
morally wrong can never be expedientâ€”not even when one secures by
means of it that which one thinks expedient; for the mere act of thinking a
course expedient, when it is morally <span class="innerMarginNote left">50</span> wrong, is demoralizing. But, as I said above, cases<span class="marginNote right">Expediency <span class="italic">vs</span> moral rectitude in
business relations.</span> often arise in which expediency may seem to
clash with moral rectitude; and so we should examine carefully and see
whether their conflict is inevitable or whether they may be reconciled. The
following are problems of this sort: suppose, for example, a time of dearth
and famine at Rhodes, with provisions at fabulous prices; and suppose that
an honest man has imported a large cargo of grain from Alexandria and that
to his certain knowledge also several other importers have set sail from
Alexandria, and that on the voyage he has sighted their vessels laden with
grain and bound for Rhodes; is he to report the fact to the Rhodians or is
he to keep his own counsel and sell his own stock at the highest market
price? I am assuming the case of a virtuous, upright man, and I am raising
the question how a man would think and reason who would not conceal the
facts from the Rhodians if he thought that it was immoral to do so, but who
might be in doubt whether such silence would really be immoral.</p>
