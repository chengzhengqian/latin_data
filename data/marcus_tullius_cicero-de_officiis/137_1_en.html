<p>II. But, my dear Cicero, while the whole field of<span class="marginNote right">Young
Cicero admonished to diligence in his studies</span> philosophy is
fertile and productive and no portion of it barren and waste, still no part
is richer or more fruitful than that which deals with moral duties; for from
these are derived the rules for leading a consistent and moral life. And

honour, and I am inclined to think that no one needs them more than you. For
you will have to fulfil the eager anticipation that you will imitate my

political honours, and the hope that you will, perhaps, rival my name and
fame. You have, besides, incurred a heavy responsibility on account of
Athens and Cratippus: for, since you have gone to them for the purchase, as
it were, of a store of liberal culture, it would be a great discredit to you
to return empty-handed, thereby disgracing the high reputation of the city
and of your master. Therefore, put forth the best mental effort of which you
are capable; work as hard as you can (if learning is work rather than
pleasure); do your very best to succeed; and do not, when I have put all the
necessary means at your disposal, allow it to be said that you have failed
to do your part.</p>
