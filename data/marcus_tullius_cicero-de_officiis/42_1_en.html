storm does come, to withstand it with all the means at his command, and
especially, when the advantages to be expected in case of a successful issue
are greater than the hazards of the struggle.</p>
<p>The dangers attending great affairs of state fall<span class="marginNote right">Patriotism and self-sacrifice.</span> sometimes upon those who
undertake them, sometimes upon the state. In carrying out such enterprises,
some run the risk of losing their lives, others their reputation and the
good-will of their fellow-citizens. It is our duty, then, to be more ready
to endanger our own than the public welfare and to hazard honour and glory
more readily than other advantages.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL030_85_a" id="target_note_LCL030_85_a"><sup>a</sup></a></p>

<p>Many, on the other hand, have been found who were ready to pour out not only
their money but their lives for their country and yet would not consent to
make even the slightest sacrifice of personal glory—even though the
interests of their country demanded it. For example, when Callicratidas, as
Spartan admiral in the Peloponnesian War, had won many signal successes, he
spoiled everything at the end by refusing to listen to the proposal of those
who thought he ought to withdraw his fleet from the Arginusae and not to
risk an engagement with the Athenians. His answer to them was that
“the Spartans could build another fleet, if they lost that one, but
he could not retreat without dishonour to himself.” And yet what he
did dealt only a slight blow to Sparta; there was another which proved
disastrous, when Cleombrotus in fear of criticism recklessly went into
battle against Epaminondas. In consequence of that, the Spartan power
fell.</p>
