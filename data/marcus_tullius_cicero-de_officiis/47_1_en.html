<p>To revert to the original question<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL030_95_a" id="target_note_LCL030_95_a"><sup>a</sup></a>—we must<span class="marginNote right">Greatness of mind in public and in private life.</span>
decide that the most important activities, those most indicative of a great
spirit, are performed by the men who direct the affairs of nations; for such
public activities have the widest scope and touch the lives of the most
people. But even in the life of retirement there are and there have been
many high-souled men who have been engaged in important inquiries or
embarked on most important enterprises and yet kept themselves within the
limits of their own affairs; or, taking a middle course between philosophers
on the one hand and statesmen on the other, they were content with managing
their own property—not increasing it by any and every means nor
debarring their kindred from the enjoyment of it, but rather, if ever there
were need, sharing it with their friends and with the state. Only let it, in
the first place, be honestly acquired, by the use of no dishonest or
fraudulent means; let it, in the second place, increase by wisdom, industry,
and thrift; and, finally, let it be made available for the use of as many as
possible (if only they are worthy) and be at the service of generosity and
beneficence rather than of sensuality and excess.</p>
<p>By observing these rules, one may live in magnificence, dignity, and
independence, and yet in honour, truth and charity toward all.</p>
