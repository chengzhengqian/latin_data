without giving any entertainments he had risen to all the positions looked
upon as the highest within the gift of the state. Cotta could say the same,
and Curio. I, too, may make this boast my own—to a certain

discussed at length in my books on “The Republic.”</p>

is intrinsically wrong; but it may under certain circumstances be necessary
to make them; even then they must be proportioned to our ability and
regulated by the golden mean.</p>
