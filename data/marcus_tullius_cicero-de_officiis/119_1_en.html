wish to obtain a powerful political influence by honourable means to be able
through their social relations with their guests to enjoy popularity and to
exert influence abroad. For an instance of extraordinary hospitality,
Theophrastus writes that at Athens Cimon was hospitable even to the Laciads,
the people of his own deme; for he instructed his bailiffs to that end and

individual citizens. To protect a man in his legal rights [, to assist him
with counsel,] and to serve as many as possible with that sort of knowledge

law. And down to the present unsettled times the foremost men of the state
have kept this profession exclusively in their own hands; but now the
prestige of legal learning has departed along with offices of honour and
positions of dignity; and this is the more deplorable, because it has come
to pass in the lifetime of a man<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL030_239_b" id="target_note_LCL030_239_b"><sup>b</sup></a> who in knowledge
of the law would easily have surpassed all his predecessors, while in honour
he is their peer. Service such as this, then, finds many to appreciate it
and is calculated to bind people closely to us by our good services.</p>
