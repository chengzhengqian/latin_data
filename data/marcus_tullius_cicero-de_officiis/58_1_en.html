that it is each man’s duty to weigh well what are<span class="marginNote right">Let every one sustain his own character.</span> his own peculiar traits
of character, to regulate these properly, and not to wish to try how another
man’s would suit him. For the more peculiarly his own a man’s
character is, the better it fits him.</p>

<p>Everyone, therefore, should make a proper estimate of his own natural ability
and show himself a critical judge of his own merits and defects; in this
respect we should not let actors display more practical wisdom than we have.
They select, not the best plays, but the ones best suited to their talents.
Those who rely most upon the quality of their voice take the Epigoni and the
Medus; those who place more stress upon the action choose the Melanippa and
the Clytaemnestra; Rupilius, whom I remember, always played in the Antiope,
Aesopus rarely in the Ajax. Shall a player have regard to this in choosing
his rôle upon the stage, and a wise man fail to do so in selecting his part
in life?</p>
<p>We shall, therefore, work to the best advantage in that rôle to which we are
best adapted. But if at some time stress of circumstances shall thrust us
aside into some uncongenial part, we must devote to it all possible thought,
practice, and pains, that we may be able to perform it, if not with
propriety, at least with as little impropriety as possible; and we need not
strive so hard to attain to points of excellence that have not been
vouchsafed to us as to correct the faults we have.</p>

which some chance or some circumstance imposes, and a fourth also, which we
assume by our own deliberate choice. Regal powers and military commands,
nobility of birth and political office, wealth and influence, and their
opposites</p>
