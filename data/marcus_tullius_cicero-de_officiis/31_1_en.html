court, one would defend a kinsman and a friend rather than a neighbour. Such
questions as these must, therefore, be taken into consideration in every act
of moral duty [and we must acquire the habit and keep it up], in order to
become good calculators of duty, able by adding and subtracting to strike a
balance correctly and find out just how much is due to each individual.</p>

<p>But as neither physicians nor generals nor orators can achieve any signal
success without experience and practice, no matter how well they may
understand the theory of their profession, so the rules for the discharge of
duty are formulated, it is true, as I am doing now, but a matter of such
importance requires experience also and practice.</p>
<p>This must close our discussion of the ways in which moral goodness, on which
duty depends, is developed from those principles which hold good in human
society.</p>
<span class="innerMarginNote left">61</span>
<p>We must realize, however, that while we have set<span class="marginNote right">C.
Fortitude.</span> down four cardinal virtues from which as sources moral
rectitude and moral duty emanate, that achievement is most glorious in the
eyes of the world which is won with a spirit great, exalted, and superior to
the vicissitudes of earthly life. And so, when we wish to hurl a taunt, the
very first to rise to our lips is, if possible, something like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line indent2">“For ye, young men, show a womanish soul, yon</span><span class="linebreak"></span>

</p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">and this:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line indent2">“Thou son of Salmacis, win spoils that cost
nor</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent3">sweat nor blood.”</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p></blockquote>
