<p>Well, then, the first thing to recommend to a young<span class="marginNote right">(1)
by a military career,</span> man in his quest for glory is that he try
to win it, if he can, in a military career. Among our forefathers many
distinguished themselves as soldiers; for warfare was almost continuous

favourably, if they attach themselves to men who are at once wise and
renowned as well as patriotic counsellors in public affairs. And if they
associate constantly with such men, they inspire in the public the
expectation that they will be like them, seeing that they have themselves
selected them </p></section><notes></notes></section>
