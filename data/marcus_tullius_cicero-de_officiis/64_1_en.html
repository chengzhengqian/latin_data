<p>XXXV. But the propriety to which I refer shows<span class="marginNote right">Propriety
in bodily actions.</span> itself also in every deed, in every word, even
in every movement and attitude of the body. And in outward, visible
propriety there are three elements—beauty, tact, and taste; these
conceptions are difficult to express in words, but it will be enough for my
purpose if they are understood. In these three elements is included also our
concern for the good opinion of those with whom and amongst whom we live.
For these reasons I should like to say a few words about this kind of
propriety also.</p>
<p>First of all, Nature seems to have had a wonderful plan in the construction
of our bodies. Our face and our figure generally, in so far as it has a
comely appearance, she has placed in sight; but the parts of the body that
are given us only to serve the needs of Nature and that would present an
unsightly and unpleasant appearance she has covered up and <span class="innerMarginNote left">127</span> concealed from view.
Man’s modesty has followed<span class="marginNote right">Modesty.</span> this
careful contrivance of Nature’s; all right-minded people keep out of
sight what Nature has hidden and take pains to respond to Nature’s
demands as privately as possible; and in the case of those parts of the body
which only serve Nature’s needs, neither the parts nor the functions
are called by their real names. To perform these functions—if only it
be done in private—is nothing immoral; but to speak of them is
indecent. And so neither public performance of those acts nor vulgar mention
of them is free from indecency.</p>
