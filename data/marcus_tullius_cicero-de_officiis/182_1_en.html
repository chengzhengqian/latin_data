<p>“Suppose that a foolish man has seized hold of a plank from a sinking
ship, shall a wise man wrest it away from him if he can?”</p>
<p>“No,” says Hecaton; “for that would be
unjust.”</p>
<p>“But how about the owner of the ship? Shall he take the plank away
because it belongs to him?”</p>
<p>“Not at all; no more than he would be willing when far out at sea to
throw a passenger overboard on the ground that the ship was his. For until
they reach the place for which the ship is chartered, she belongs to the
passengers, not to the owner.”</p>

<p>“Again; suppose there were two to be saved from the sinking
ship—both of them wise men—and only one small plank, should
both seize it to save themselves? Or should one give place to the
other?”</p>
<p>“Why of course, one should give place to the other, but that other
must be the one whose life is more valuable either for his own sake or for
that of his country.”</p>
<p>“But what if these considerations are of equal weight in
both?”</p>
<p>“Then there will be no contest, but one will give place to the other,
as if the point were decided by lot or at a game of odd and
even.”</p>
<p>“Again, suppose a father were robbing temples or making underground
passages to the treasury, should a son inform the officers of
it?”</p>
<p>“Nay; that were a crime; rather should he defend his father, in case
he were indicted.”</p>
<p>“Well, then, are not the claims of country paramount to all other
duties?”</p>
