<p>Our tyrant deserved his death for having made an exception of the one thing
that was the blackest <span class="innerMarginNote left">83</span> crime
of all. Why do we gather instances of petty crime—legacies criminally
obtained and fraudulent buying and selling? Behold, here you have a man who
was ambitious to be king of the Roman People and master of the whole world;

destruction of law and liberty and thinks their hideous and detestable
suppression glorious. But if anyone agrees that it is not morally right to

<p>What greater advantage one could have, according to the standard of popular
opinion, than to be a king, I do not know; when, however, I begin to bring
