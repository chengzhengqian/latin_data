<p>it is often necessary in deciding a question of duty that these virtues be
weighed against one another.</p>
<span class="innerMarginNote left">153</span>
<p>My view, therefore, is that those duties are closer<span class="marginNote right">Justice <span class="italic">vs.</span> Wisdom.</span> to Nature which
depend upon the social instinct than those which depend upon knowledge; and
this view can be confirmed by the following argument: (1) suppose that a
wise man should be vouchsafed such a life that, with an abundance of
everything pouring in upon him, he might in perfect peace study and ponder
over everything that is worth knowing, still, if the solitude were so
complete that he could never see a human being, he would die. And then, the
foremost of all virtues is wisdom—what the Greeks call σοφία; for by
prudence, which they call φρόνησις, we understand something else, namely,
the practical knowledge of things to be sought for and of things to be
avoided. (2) Again, that wisdom which I have given the foremost place is the
knowledge of things human and divine, which is concerned also with the bonds
of union between gods and men and the relations of man to man. If wisdom is
the most important of the virtues, as it certainly is, it necessarily
follows that that duty which is connected with the social obligation is the
most important duty.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL030_157_aa" id="target_note_LCL030_157_aa"><sup>a</sup></a> And (3) service is better than mere
theoretical knowledge, for the study and knowledge of the universe would
somehow be lame and defective, were no practical results to follow. Such
results, moreover, are best seen in the safeguarding of human interests. It

curious fallacy. If it follows from his premises, (1) some one virtue is
the highest virtue, and (2) the duties derived from the highest virtue
are the highest duties, and if (3) wisdom is the highest virtue, then it
can only follow that the duties derived from wisdom are the highest
duties. But Cicero throws in a fourth premise that the “bonds of
union between gods and men and the relations of man to man” are
derived from wisdom, and therewith side- tracks wisdom
and gives the duties derived from the social instinct the place from
which wisdom has been shunted. Cicero could not refrain from introducing
a bit of theoretical speculation that has no value for his practical
position—it actually prejudices it and confuses the
reader.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL030_157_aa').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
