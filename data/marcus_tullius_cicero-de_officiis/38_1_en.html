will face the facts, we shall find that there have been many instances of
achievement in peace more important and no less renowned than in war.</p>

<p>However highly Themistocles, for example, may<span class="marginNote right">Themistocles <span class="italic">vs</span>. Solon.</span> be
extolled—and deservedly—and however much more illustrious his
name may be than Solon’s, and however much Salamis may be cited as
witness of his most glorious victory—a victory glorified above
Solon’s statesmanship in instituting the Areopagus—yet
Solon’s achievement is not to be accounted less illustrious than his.
For Themistocles’s victory served the state once and only once; while
Solon’s work will be of service for ever. For through his legislation
the laws of the Athenians and the institutions of their fathers are
maintained. And while Themistocles could not readily point to any instance
in which he himself had rendered assistance to the Areopagus, the Areopagus
might with justice assert that Themistocles had received assistance from it;
for the war was directed by the counsels of that senate which Solon had

Lysander had armies so brave and so well disciplined. For my own part, I do
not consider that Marcus Scaurus was inferior to Gaius Marius, when I was a
lad, or Quintus Catulus to Gnaeus Pompey, when I was engaged in public life.

home. So, too, </p></section><notes></notes></section>
