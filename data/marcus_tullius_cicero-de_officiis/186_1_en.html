state, which ought to be the dearest thing in the world to you. Thus there
are many things which in and of themselves seem morally right, but which
under certain circumstances prove to be not morally right: to keep a
promise, to abide by an agreement, to restore a trust may, with a change of
expediency, cease to be morally right.</p>
<p>With this I think I have said enough about those actions which masquerade as
expedient under the guise of prudence, while they are really contrary to
justice.</p>

<p>Since, however, in Book One we derived moral duties from the four sources of
moral rectitude, let us continue the same fourfold division here in pointing
out how hostile to virtue are those courses of conduct which seem to be, but
really are not, expedient. We have discussed wisdom, which cunning seeks to
counterfeit, and likewise justice, which is always expedient. There remain
for our discussion two divisions of moral rectitude, the one of which is
discernible in the greatness and pre-eminence of a superior soul, the other,
in the shaping and regulation of it by temperance and self-control.</p>

Expediency <span class="italic">vs.</span> Fortitude: (1)Ulysses’s
ruse,</span> the tragic poets, at least, have represented him. In Homer,
our most reliable authority, no such suspicion is cast upon him; but the
tragedies charge him with trying to escape a soldier’s service by
feigning madness. The trick was not morally right, but, someone may perhaps
say, “It was expedient for him to keep his throne and live at ease in
Ithaca with parents, wife, and son. Do you think that there is any glory in
facing daily toil and danger that can be compared with a life of such
tranquillity?” </p></section><notes></notes></section>
