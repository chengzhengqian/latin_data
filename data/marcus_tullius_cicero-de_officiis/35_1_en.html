not only avoid the latter, but also beware of ambition for wealth; for there
is nothing so characteristic of narrowness and littleness of soul as the
love of riches; and there is nothing more honourable and noble than to be
indifferent to money, if one does not possess it, and to devote it to
beneficence and liberality, if one does possess it.</p>
<p>As I said before, we must also beware of ambition for glory; for it robs us
of liberty, and in defence of liberty a high-souled man should stake
everything. And one ought not to seek military authority; nay, rather it
ought sometimes to be declined,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL030_71_a" id="target_note_LCL030_71_a"><sup>a</sup></a> sometimes to be
