conducted by those who consider whatever is morally right also expedient and
nothing expedient that is not at the same time morally right, will be more
illuminating than if conducted by those who think that something not
expedient may be morally right and that something not morally right may be
expedient. But our New Academy allows us wide liberty, so that it is within
my right to defend any theory that presents itself to me as most probable.

neighbour’s loss is more contrary to Nature than is death or poverty
or pain or anything else that can affect either our person or our property.
For, in the first place, injustice is fatal to social life and fellowship
between man and man. For, if we are so disposed that each, to gain some
personal profit, will defraud or injure his neighbour, then those bonds of
human society, which are most in accord with Nature’s laws, must of

Suppose, by way of comparison, that each one of our bodily members should
conceive this idea and imagine that it could be strong and well if it should
draw off to itself the health and strength of its neighbouring member, the
whole body would necessarily be enfeebled and die; so, if each one of us
should seize upon the property of his neighbours and take from each whatever
he could appropriate to his own use, the bonds of human society must
inevitably be annihilated. For, without any conflict with Nature’s
laws, it is granted that everybody may prefer to secure for himself rather
than for his neighbour what is essential for the conduct of life; but
Nature’s laws do forbid us to increase </p></section><notes></notes></section>
