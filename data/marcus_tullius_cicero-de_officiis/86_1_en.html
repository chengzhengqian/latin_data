What is better for a man, what more worthy of his nature? Those who seek
after it are called philosophers; and philosophy is nothing else, if one
will translate the word into our idiom, than “the love of
wisdom.” Wisdom, moreover, as the word has been defined by the
philosophers of old, is “the knowledge of things human and divine and
of the causes by which those things are controlled.” And if the man

always studying out something that will tend toward and effectively promote
a good and happy life? Or, if regard is had for strength of character and
virtue, then this is the method by which we can attain to those qualities,
or there is none at all. And to say that there is no “method”
for securing the highest blessings, when none even of the least important
concerns is without its method, is the language of people who talk without
due reflection and who blunder in matters of the utmost importance.
