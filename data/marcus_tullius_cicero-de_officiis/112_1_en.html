you trying to do what you can to lead the Macedonians to expect that you
will be not their king but their steward and purveyor?”</p>
<p>“Steward and purveyor” was well said, because it was degrading
for a prince; better still, when he called the gift of money
“corruption.” For the recipient goes from bad to worse and is

the hatred they incur from those whom they despoil.</p>
