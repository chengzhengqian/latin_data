that, when I have bought, built, kept up, and spent my money upon a place,
you may without my consent enjoy what belongs to me? What else is that but
to rob one man of what belongs to him and to give to <span class="innerMarginNote left">84</span> another what does not belong
to him? And what is the meaning of an abolition of debts, except that you
buy a farm with my money; that you have the farm, and I have not my

<p>XXIV. We must, therefore, take measures that<span class="marginNote right">Economics of
debts.</span> there shall be no indebtedness of a nature to endanger the
public safety. It is a menace that can be averted in many ways; but should a
serious debt be incurred, we are not to allow the rich to lose their
property, while the debtors profit by what is their neighbour’s. For
there is nothing that upholds a government more powerfully than its credit;
and it can have no credit, unless the payment of debts is enforced by law.
Never were measures for the repudiation of debts more strenuously agitated
than in my consulship. Men of every sort and rank attempted with arms and
armies to force the project through. But I opposed them with such energy
that this plague was wholly eradicated from the body politic. Indebtedness
was never greater; debts were never liquidated more easily or more fully;
for the hope of defrauding the creditor was cut off and payment was enforced
by law. But the present victor, though vanquished then, still carried out
his old design, when it was no longer of any personal advantage to him.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL030_261_b" id="target_note_LCL030_261_b"><sup>b</sup></a>
So great was his passion for wrong-doing that the very doing of wrong was a
joy to him for its own sake, even when there was no motive for it.</p>
