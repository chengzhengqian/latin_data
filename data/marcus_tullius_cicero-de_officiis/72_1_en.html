<p>In entering upon any course of action, then,<span class="marginNote right">Three rules
for the duty of propriety.</span> we must hold fast to three principles:
first, that impulse shall obey reason; for there is no better way than this

in their suitable and appropriate places.” By “place of
action,” moreover, they mean <span class="italic">seasonableness of
