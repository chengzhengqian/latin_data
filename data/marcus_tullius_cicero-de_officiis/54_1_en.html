attractions of pleasure, he hides the fact, however much he may be caught in
its toils, and for very shame conceals his appetite.</p>

<p>From this we see that sensual pleasure is quite unworthy of the dignity of
man and that we ought to despise it and cast it from us; but if someone
should be found who sets some value upon sensual gratification, he must keep
strictly within the limits of moderate indulgence. One’s physical
comforts and wants, therefore, should be ordered according to the demands of
health and strength, not according to the calls of pleasure. And if we will
only bear in mind the superiority and dignity of our nature, we shall
realize how wrong it is to abandon ourselves to excess and to live in luxury
and voluptuousness, and how right it is to live in thrift, self-denial,
simplicity, and sobriety.</p>

<p>We must realize also that we are invested by<span class="marginNote right">The
universal and the individual nature of man.</span> Nature with two
characters, as it were: one of these is universal, arising from the fact of
our being all alike endowed with reason and with that superiority which
lifts us above the brute. From this all morality and propriety are derived,
and upon it depends the rational method of ascertaining our duty. The other
character is the one that is<span class="marginNote right">Individual
endowments.</span> individual assigned to individuals in particular. In
the matter of physical endowment there are great differences: some, we see,
excel in speed for the race, others in strength for wrestling; so in point
of personal appearance, some have stateliness, others comeliness. <span class="innerMarginNote left">108</span> Diversities of character are
greater still. Lucius Crassus and Lucius Philippus had a large fund of wit;
Gaius Caesar, Lucius’s son, had a still richer fund and employed it
with more studied purpose. </p></section><notes></notes></section>
