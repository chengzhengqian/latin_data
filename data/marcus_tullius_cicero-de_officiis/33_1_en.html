<p>But the mischief is that from this exaltation and greatness of spirit spring
all too readily self-will and excessive lust for power. For just as Plato
tells us that the whole national character of the Spartans was on fire with
passion for victory, so, in the same way, the more notable a man is for his
greatness of spirit, the more ambitious he is to be the foremost citizen,
or, I should say rather, to be sole ruler. But when one begins to aspire to
pre-eminence, it is difficult to preserve that spirit of fairness which is
absolutely essential to justice. The result is that such men do not allow
themselves to be constrained either by argument or by any public and lawful
authority; but they only too often prove to be bribers and agitators in
public life, seeking to obtain supreme power and to be superiors through
force rather than equals through justice. But the greater the difficulty,
the greater the glory; for no occasion arises that can excuse a man for
being guilty of injustice.</p>

<p>So then, not those who do injury but those who<span class="marginNote right">True
greatness of spirit.</span> prevent it are to be considered brave and
courageous. Moreover, true and philosophic greatness of spirit regards the
moral goodness to which Nature most aspires as consisting in deeds, not in
fame, and prefers to be first in reality rather than in name. And we must
approve this view; for he who depends upon the caprice of the ignorant
rabble cannot be numbered among the great. Then, too, the higher a
manâ€™s ambition, the more easily he is tempted to acts of injustice by
his desire for fame. We are now, to be sure, on very slippery ground; for
scarcely can the man be found who has passed through trials and encountered
dangers and does not then wish for glory as a reward for his
achievements.</p>
