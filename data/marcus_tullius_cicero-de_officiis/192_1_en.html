<p>that is, shall one “choose moral wrong rather than<span class="marginNote right">(2) no evil can be greater than moral wrong;</span> misfortune,”
or is there any evil greater than moral wrong? For if physical deformity
excites a certain amount of aversion, how offensive ought the deformity and
hideousness of a demoralized soul to seem! <span class="innerMarginNote left">106</span> Therefore, those<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL030_385_a" id="target_note_LCL030_385_a"><sup>a</sup></a> who discuss these
problems with more rigour make bold to say that moral wrong is the only
evil, while those<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL030_385_b" id="target_note_LCL030_385_b"><sup>b</sup></a> who treat them with more laxity do not
hesitate to call it the supreme evil. Once more, they quote the
sentiment:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line indent3">“None have I given, none give I ever to the</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent4">faithless.”</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p></blockquote>
<p>It was proper for the poet to say that, because, when he was working out his
Atreus, he had to make the words fit the character. But if they mean to
adopt it as a principle, that a pledge given to the faithless is no pledge,
let them look to it that it be not a mere loophole for perjury that they
seek.</p>

<p>Furthermore, we have laws regulating warfare,<span class="marginNote right">What is
perjury?</span> and fidelity to an oath must often be observed in
dealings with an enemy: for an oath sworn with the clear understanding in
one’s own mind that it should be performed must be kept; but if there
is no such understanding, it does not count as perjury if one does not
perform the vow. For example, suppose that one does not deliver the amount
agreed upon with pirates as the price of one’s life, that would be
accounted no deception—not even if one should fail to deliver the
ransom after having sworn to do so; for a pirate is not included in the
number of lawful enemies, but is the common foe of all the world; and with
him there ought not to be any pledged </p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL030_385_a"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL030_385_a" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">a</sup>The Stoics.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL030_385_a').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL030_385_b"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL030_385_b" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">b</sup>The Peripatetics.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL030_385_b').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
