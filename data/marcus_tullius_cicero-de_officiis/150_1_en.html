<p>dear Cicero, I ask you to assume with me, if you can,<span class="marginNote right">Moral Right the only good or the chief good</span> that nothing is
worth the seeking for its own sake except what is morally right. But if
Cratippus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL030_301_a" id="target_note_LCL030_301_a"><sup>a</sup></a> does not permit this assumption, you will
still grant this at least—that what is morally right is the object
most worth the seeking for its own sake. Either alternative is sufficient
for my purposes; first the one and then the other seems to me the more
probable; and, besides these, there is no other alternative that seems
probable at all.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL030_301_b" id="target_note_LCL030_301_b"><sup>b</sup></a></p>
<span class="innerMarginNote left">34</span>
<p>In the first place, I must undertake the defence<span class="marginNote right">Vindication of Panaetius: nothing can be expedient that is not morally
right.</span> of Panaetius on this point; for he has said, not that
truly expedient could under certain circumstances clash with the morally
right (for he could not have said that conscientiously<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL030_301_c" id="target_note_LCL030_301_c"><sup>c</sup></a>), but only that
what <span class="italic">seemed</span> expedient could do so. For he often bears
witness to the fact that nothing is really expedient that is not at the same
time morally right, and nothing morally right that is not at the same time
expedient; and he says that no greater curse has ever assailed human life
than the doctrine of those who have separated these two conceptions. And so
he introduced an apparent, not a real, conflict between them, not to the end
that we should under certain circumstances give the expedient preference
over the moral, but that, in case they ever should get in each
other’s way, we might decide between them without uncertainty. This
part, therefore, which was passed over by Panaetius, I will carry to
completion without any auxiliaries, but fighting my own battle, as the
saying is. For, of all that has been worked out on this line since the time
of Panaetius, nothing that has come into my hands is at all satisfactory to
me.</p>
