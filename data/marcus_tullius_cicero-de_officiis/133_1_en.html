<section class="div1 language" lang="en"><header><hgroup><h1>Book II</h1></hgroup></header><section class="div2"><p class="noindent">famous saying of old Cato’s: when he was asked what was the most
profitable feature of an estate, he replied: “Raising cattle
successfully.” What next to that? “Raising cattle with fair
success.” And next? “Raising cattle with but slight
success.” And fourth? “Raising crops.” And when his
questioner said, “How about money-lending?” Cato replied:
“How about murder?”</p>
<p>From this as well as from many other incidents we ought to realize that
expediencies have often to be weighed against one another and that it is
proper for us to add this fourth division in the discussion of moral
duty.</p>
<p>Let us now pass on to the remaining problems.</p>
