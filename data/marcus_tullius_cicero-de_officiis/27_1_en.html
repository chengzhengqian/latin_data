connection is reason and speech, which by the processes of teaching and
learning, of communicating, discussing, and reasoning associate men together
and unite them in a sort of natural fraternity. In no other particular are
we farther removed from the nature of beasts; for we admit that they may
have courage (horses and lions, for example); but we do not admit that they
have justice, equity, and goodness; for they are not endowed with reason or
speech.</p>

<p>This, then, is the most comprehensive bond that unites together men as men
and all to all; and under it the common right to all things that Nature has
produced for the common use of man is to be maintained, with the
understanding that, while everything assigned as private property by the
statutes and by civil law shall be so held as prescribed by those same laws,
everything else shall be regarded in the light indicated by the Greek
proverb: “Amongst friends all things in common.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL030_55_a" id="target_note_LCL030_55_a"><sup>a</sup></a>
Furthermore, we find the common property of all men in things of the sort
defined by Ennius; and, though restricted by him to one instance, the
principle may be applied very generally:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line indent2">“Who kindly sets a wand’rer on his way</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">Does e’en as if he lit another’s lamp by
his:</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">No less shines his, when he his friend’s hath
lit.”</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p></blockquote>
<p>In this example he effectively teaches us all to bestow even upon a stranger
what it costs us nothing to give. <span class="innerMarginNote left">52</span> On this principle we have the following maxims:</p>
<p>“Deny no one the water that flows by;” “Let anyone who
will take fire from our fire;” “Honest counsel give to one who
is in doubt;” </p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL030_55_a"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL030_55_a" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">a</sup>κοινὰ τὰ (τῶν) φίλων (Plato,
