Basilus. The more easily to procure validity for it, they made joint-heirs
with themselves two of the most influential men of the day, Marcus Crassus
and Quintus Hortensius. Although these men suspected that the will was a
forgery, still, as they were conscious of no personal guilt in the matter,
they did not spurn the miserable boon procured through the crime of others.
What shall we say, then? Is this excuse competent to acquit them of guilt? I
cannot think so, although I loved the one while he lived, and do not hate
the other now <span class="innerMarginNote left">74</span> that he is
dead. Be that as it may, Basilus had in fact desired that his nephew Marcus
Satrius should bear his name and inherit his property. (I refer to the
Satrius who is the present patron of Picenum and the Sabine
country—and oh, what a shameful stigma it is upon the times!<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL030_345_a" id="target_note_LCL030_345_a"><sup>a</sup></a>)
And therefore it was not right that two of the leading citizens of Rome
should take the estate and Satrius succeed to nothing except his
uncle’s name. For if he does wrong who does not ward off and repel
injury when he can—as I explained in the course of the First
Book—what is to be thought of the man who not only does not try to
prevent wrong, but actually aids and abets it? For my part, I do not believe
that even genuine legacies are moral, if they are sought after by designing
flatteries and by attentions hypocritical rather than sincere.</p>

to appear expedient and another <span class="innerMarginNote left">75</span> morally right. The appearance is deceptive; our standard is
the same for expediency and for <span class="innerMarginNote left">(75)</span> moral rectitude. And the man who does not accept the truth
of this will be capable of any sort of dishonesty, </p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL030_345_a"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL030_345_a" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">a</sup>The shame was that states
