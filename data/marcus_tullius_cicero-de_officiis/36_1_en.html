And, in this matter, neither way of thinking is altogether to be condemned;
but the life of retirement is easier and safer and at the same time less
burdensome or troublesome to others, while the career of those who apply
themselves to statecraft and to conducting great enterprises is more

<p>So perhaps those men of extraordinary genius who have devoted themselves to
learning must be excused for not taking part in public affairs; likewise,
those who from ill-health or for some still more valid reason have retired
from the service of the state and left to others the opportunity and the
glory of its administration. But if those who have no such excuse profess a
scorn for civil and military offices, which most people admire, I think that
this should be set down not to their credit but to their discredit; for in
so far as they care little, as they say, for glory and count it as naught,
it is difficult not to sympathize with their attitude; in reality, however,
they seem to dread the toil and trouble and also, perhaps, the discredit and
humiliation of political failure and defeat. For there are people who in
opposite circumstances do not act consistently: they have the utmost
contempt for pleasure, but in pain they are too sensitive; they are
indifferent to glory, but they are crushed by disgrace; and even in their
inconsistency they show no great consistency.</p>
