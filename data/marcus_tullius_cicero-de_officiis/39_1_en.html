man and a soldier of extraordinary ability, did no greater service to the
state by destroying Numantia than was done at the same time by Publius
Nasica, though not then clothed with official authority, by removing
Tiberius Gracchus. This deed does not, to be sure, belong wholly to the
domain of civil affairs; it partakes of the nature of war also, since it was
effected by violence; but it was, for all that, executed as a political
measure without the help of an army.</p>
<span class="innerMarginNote left">77</span>
<p>The whole truth, however, is in this verse, against<span class="marginNote right">Cicero’s great victory.</span> which, I am told, the malicious
and envious are wont to rail:</p>
<p>“Yield, ye arms, to the toga; to civic praises,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL030_79_a" id="target_note_LCL030_79_a"><sup>a</sup></a> ye
laurels.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL030_79_b" id="target_note_LCL030_79_b"><sup>b</sup></a></p>
<p>Not to mention other instances, did not arms yield to the toga, when I was at
the helm of state? For never was the republic in more serious peril, never
was peace more profound. Thus, as the result of my counsels and my
vigilance, their weapons slipped suddenly from the hands of the most
desperate traitors—dropped to the ground of their own accord! What
achievement in war, then, was ever so great? <span class="innerMarginNote left">78</span> What triumph can be compared with that? For I may
boast to you, my son Marcus; for to you belong the inheritance of that glory
of mine and the duty of imitating my deeds. And it was to me, too, that
Gnaeus Pompey, a hero crowned with the honours of war, paid this tribute in
the hearing of many, when he said that his third triumph would have been
gained in vain, if he were not to have through my services to the state a
place in which to celebrate it.</p>
<p>There are, therefore, instances of civic courage </p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL030_79_a"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL030_79_a" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">a</sup>The praises of Cicero for his
