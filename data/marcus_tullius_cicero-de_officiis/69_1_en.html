learning. Accordingly, if the talk begins to drift off to other channels,
pains should be taken to bring it back again to the matter in
hand—but with due consideration to the company present; for we are
not all interested in the same things at all times or in the same degree. We
must observe, too, how far the conversation is agreeable and, as it had a
reason for its beginning, so there should be a point at which to close it

of speech,</span> for every phase of life, to avoid exhibitions of
passion, that is, mental excitement that is excessive and uncontrolled by
reason; so our conversation ought to be free from such emotions: let there
be no exhibition of anger or inordinate desire, of indolence or
indifference, or anything of the kind. We must also take the greatest care
to show courtesy and consideration toward those with whom we converse.</p>
<p>It may sometimes happen that there is need of<span class="marginNote right">(1) in
reproofs,</span> administering reproof. On such occasions we should,
perhaps, use a more emphatic tone of voice and more forcible and severe
terms and even assume an appearance of being angry. But we shall have
recourse to this sort of reproof, as we do to cautery and amputation, rarely
and reluctantly—never at all, unless it is unavoidable and no other
remedy can be discovered. We may seem angry, but anger should be far from
us; for in anger nothing right or judicious <span class="innerMarginNote left">137</span> can be done. In most cases, we may apply a mild
reproof, so combined, however, with earnestness, that, while severity is
shown, offensive language is avoided. Nay more, we must show clearly that
even that very harshness which goes with our reproof is designed for the
good of the person reproved.</p>
