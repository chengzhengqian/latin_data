<p>“Aye, verily; but it is to our country’s interest to have
citizens who are loyal to their parents.”</p>
<p>“But once more—if the father attempts to make himself king, or
to betray his country, shall the son hold his peace?”</p>
<p>“Nay, verily; he will plead with his father not to do so. If that
accomplishes nothing, he will take him to task; he will even threaten; and
in the end, if things point to the destruction of the state, he will
sacrifice his father to the safety of his country.”</p>

<p>Again, he raises the question: “If a wise man<span class="marginNote right">A
similar debate by Diogenes <span class="italic">vs.</span> Antipater.</span>
should inadvertently accept counterfeit money for good, will he offer it as
genuine in payment of a debt after he discovers his mistake?”
Diogenes says, “Yes”; Antipater, “No,” and I
agree with him.</p>
<p>If a man knowingly offers for sale wine that is spoiling, ought he to tell
his customers? Diogenes thinks that it is not required; Antipater holds that
an honest man would do so. These are like so many points of the law disputed
among the Stoics. “In selling a slave, should his faults be
declared—not those only which the seller is bound by the civil law to
declare or have the slave returned to him, but also the fact that he is
untruthful, or disposed to gamble, or steal, or get drunk?” The one
thinks such facts should be declared, the other does not.</p>

<p>“If a man thinks that he is selling brass, when he is actually selling
gold, should an upright man inform him that his stuff is gold, or go on
buying for one shilling<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL030_367_a" id="target_note_LCL030_367_a"><sup>a</sup></a> what is worth a thousand?”</p>
<p>It is clear enough by this time what my views are on these questions, and
what are the grounds of dispute between the above-named philosophers.</p>
