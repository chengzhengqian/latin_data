called “mental poise”;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL030_91_a" id="target_note_LCL030_91_a"><sup>a</sup></a> for if we are
irritated when people intrude upon us at unseasonable hours or make
unreasonable requests, we shall develop a sour, churlish temper, prejudicial
to ourselves and offensive to others. And yet gentleness of spirit and
forbearance are to be commended only with the understanding that strictness
may be exercised for the good of the state; for without that, the government
cannot be well administered. On the other hand, if punishment or correction
must be administered, it need not be insulting; it ought to have regard to
the welfare of the state, not to the personal satisfaction of the man who
administers the punishment or reproof.</p>

<p>We should take care also that the punishment<span class="marginNote right">(4)
anger.</span> shall not be out of proportion to the offence, and that
some shall not be chastised for the same fault for which others are not even
called to account. In administering punishment it is above all necessary to
allow no trace of anger. For if anyone proceeds in a passion to inflict
punishment, he will never observe that happy mean which lies between excess
and defect. This doctrine of the mean is approved by the
Peripatetics—and wisely approved, if only they did not speak in
praise of anger and tell us that it is a gift bestowed on us by Nature for a
good purpose. But, in reality, anger is in every circumstance to be
eradicated; and it is to be desired that they who administer the government
should be like the laws, which are led to inflict punishment not by wrath
but by justice.</p>
