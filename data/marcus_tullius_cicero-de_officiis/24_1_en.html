<p>The second point for the exercise of caution was<span class="marginNote right">(2)
within our means,</span> that our beneficence should not exceed our
means; for those who wish to be more open-handed than their circumstances
permit are guilty of two faults: first, they do wrong to their next of kin;

their service or bequeathed to them. And second, such generosity too often
engenders a passion for plundering and misappropriating property, in order
to supply the means for making large gifts. We may also observe that a great
many people do many things that seem to be inspired more by a spirit of
ostentation than by heart-felt kindness; for such people are not really
generous but are rather influenced by a sort of ambition to make a show of
being open-handed. Such a pose is nearer akin to hypocrisy than to
generosity or moral goodness.</p>

the worthiness of the object of our benevolence; we should take into
consideration his moral character, his attitude toward us, the intimacy of
his relations to us, and our common social ties, as well as the services he
has hitherto rendered in our interest. It is to be desired that all these
considerations should be combined in the same person; if they are not, then
the more numerous and the more important considerations must have the
greater weight.</p>
