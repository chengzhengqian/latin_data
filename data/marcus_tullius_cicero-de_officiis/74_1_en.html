<p>But flagrant breaches of good breeding, like singing<span class="marginNote right">The
little things that count.</span> in the streets or any other gross
misconduct, are easily apparent and do not call especially for admonition
and instruction. But we must even more carefully avoid those seemingly
trivial faults which pass unnoticed by the many. However slightly out of
tune a harp or flute may be, the fault is still detected by a connoisseur;
so we must be on the watch lest haply something in our life be out of
tune—nay, rather, far greater is the need for painstaking, inasmuch
as harmony of actions is far better and far more important than harmony of
sounds.</p>

correct our faults (1) by observing others,</span> slightest falsity of
tone in a harp, so we, if we wish to be keen and careful observers of moral
faults, shall often draw important conclusions from trifles. We observe
others and from a glance of the eyes, from a contracting or relaxing of the
brows, from an air of sadness, from an outburst of joy, from a laugh, from
speech, from silence, from a raising or lowering of the voice, and the like,
we shall easily judge which of our actions is proper, and which is out of
accord with duty and Nature. And, in the same manner, it is not a bad plan
to judge of the nature of our every action by studying others, that so we
may ourselves avoid anything that is unbecoming in them. For it happens
somehow or other that we detect another’s failings more readily than
we do our own; and so in the school-room those pupils learn most easily to
do better whose faults the masters mimic for the sake of correcting
them.</p>
