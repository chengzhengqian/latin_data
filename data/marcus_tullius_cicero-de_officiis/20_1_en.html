“stranger” <span class="italic">(peregrinus).</span> This is proved
by the usage in the Twelve Tables: “Or a day fixed for trial with a
stranger” <span class="italic">(hostis).</span> And again: “Right
of ownership is inalienable for ever in dealings with a stranger” <span class="italic">(hostis).</span> What can exceed such charity, when he with
whom one is at war is called by so gentle a name? And yet long lapse of time
has given that word a harsher meaning: for it has lost its signification of
“stranger” and has taken on the technical connotation of
“an enemy under arms.”</p>

<p>But when a war is fought out for supremacy and<span class="marginNote right">Justice in
war</span> when glory is the object of war, it must still not fail to
start from the same motives which I said a moment ago were the only
righteous grounds for going to war. But those wars which have glory for
their end must be carried on with less bitterness. For we contend, for
example, with a fellow-citizen in one way, if he is a personal enemy, in
another, if he is a rival: with the rival it is a struggle for office and
position, with the enemy for life and honour. So with the Celtiberians and
the Cimbrians we fought as with deadly enemies, not to determine which
should be supreme, but which should survive; but with the Latins, Sabines,
Samnites, Carthaginians, and Pyrrhus we fought for supremacy. The
Carthaginians violated treaties; Hannibal was cruel; the others were more
merciful. From Pyrrhus we have this famous speech on the exchange of
prisoners:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line indent2">“Gold will I none, nor price shall ye give; for I
ask none;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">Come, let us not be chaff’rers of war, but
warriors embattled.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">Nay; let us venture our lives, and the sword, not gold,
weigh the outcome.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
