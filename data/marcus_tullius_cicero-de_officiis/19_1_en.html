<p>As for war, humane laws touching it are drawn<span class="marginNote right">The
humanity of Rome’s laws of war.</span> up in the fetial code of
the Roman People under all the guarantees of religion; and from this it may
be gathered that no war is just, unless it is entered upon after an official
demand for satisfaction has been submitted or warning has been given and a
formal declaration made. Popilius was general in command of a province. In
his army Cato’s son was serving on his first campaign. When Popilius
decided to disband one of his legions, he discharged also young Cato, who
was serving in that same legion. But when the young man out of love for the
service stayed on in the field, his father wrote to Popilius to say that if
he let him stay in the army, he should swear him into service with a new
oath of allegiance, for in view of the voidance of his former oath he could
not legally fight the foe. So extremely scrupulous was the observance of the
laws in regard to the <span class="innerMarginNote left">37</span>
conduct of war. There is extant, too, a letter of the elder Marcus Cato to
his son Marcus, in which he writes that he has heard that the youth has been
discharged by the consul,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL030_39_a" id="target_note_LCL030_39_a"><sup>a</sup></a> when he was serving in Macedonia in the war
with Perseus. He warns him, therefore, to be careful not to go into battle;
for, he says, the man who is not legally a soldier has no right to be
fighting the foe.</p>
<p>XII. This also I observe—that he who would properly have been called
“a fighting enemy” <span class="italic">(perduellis)</span> was
called “a guest” <span class="italic">(hostis),</span> thus
relieving the ugliness of the fact by a softened expression; for
“enemy” <span class="italic">(hostis)</span> meant to our ancestors
