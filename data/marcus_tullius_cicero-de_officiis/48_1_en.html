<p>in which we find considerateness and self-control, which give, as it were, a
sort of polish to life; it embraces also temperance, complete subjection of
all the passions, and moderation in all things. Under this head is further
included what, in Latin,<span class="marginNote right">Propriety.</span> may be called
<span class="italic">decorum</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL030_97_a" id="target_note_LCL030_97_a"><sup>a</sup></a> (propriety); for in
Greek it is called πρέπον.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL030_97_a" id="target_note_LCL030_97_a"><sup>a</sup></a> Such is its essential nature, <span class="innerMarginNote left">94</span> that it is inseparable from
moral goodness; for what is proper is morally right, and what is morally
right is proper. The nature of the difference between morality and propriety
can be more easily felt than expressed. For whatever propriety may be, it is
manifested only when there is pre-existing moral rectitude. And so, not only
in this division of moral rectitude which we have now to discuss but also in
the three preceding divisions, it is clearly brought out what propriety is.
For to employ reason and speech<span class="marginNote right">Propriety and the

whatever one does, and in everything to discern the truth and to uphold
it—that is proper. To be mistaken, on the other hand, to miss the
truth, to fall into error, to be led astray—that is as improper as to
be deranged and lose one’s mind. And all things just are proper; all
things unjust, like all things immoral, are improper.</p>
<p>The relation of propriety to fortitude is similar. What is done in a manly
and courageous spirit seems becoming to a man and proper; what is done in a
contrary fashion is at once immoral and improper.</p>
<span class="innerMarginNote left">95</span>
<p>This propriety, therefore, of which I am speaking belongs to each division of
moral rectitude; and its relation to the cardinal virtues is so close, that
it is perfectly self-evident and does not require any abstruse process of
reasoning to see it.
