<p>This argument, at all events, has no more weight<span class="marginNote right">(l) An
oath is a convenant with Justice and Good Faith;</span> against
Regulus’s conduct than it has against the keeping of any other oath.
But in taking an oath it is our duty to consider not what one may have to
fear in case of violation but wherein its obligation lies: an oath is an
assurance backed by religious sanctity; and a solemn promise given, as
before God as one’s witness, is to be sacredly kept. For the question
no longer concerns the wrath of the gods (for there is no such thing) but
the obligations of justice and good faith. For, as Ennius says so
admirably:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line indent2">“Gracious Good Faith, on wings upborne;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent3">thou oath in Jupiter’s great name!”</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">Whoever, therefore, violates his oath violates Good Faith;
and, as we find it stated in Cato’s speech, our forefathers chose
that she should dwell upon the Capitol “neighbour to Jupiter Supreme
and Best.” <span class="innerMarginNote left">105</span>
“But,” objection was further made, “even if Jupiter had
been angry, he could not have inflicted greater injury upon Regulus than
Regulus brought upon himself.”</p>
<p>Quite true, if there is no evil except pain. But<span class="marginNote right">What is
evil?</span> philosophers<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL030_383_a" id="target_note_LCL030_383_a"><sup>a</sup></a> of the highest
authority assure us that pain is not only not the supreme evil but no evil
at all. And pray do not disparage Regulus, as no unimportant
witness—nay, I am rather inclined to think he was the very best
witness—to the truth of their doctrine. For what more competent
witness do we ask for than one of the foremost citizens of Rome, who
voluntarily faced torture for the sake of being true to his moral duty?</p>
<p>Again, they say, “Of evils choose the least”—</p>
