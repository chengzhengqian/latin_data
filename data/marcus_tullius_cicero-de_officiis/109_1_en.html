<p>But while there are occasions of many kinds that call for eloquence, and
while many young men in our republic have obtained distinction by their
speeches in the courts, in the popular assemblies, and in the senate, yet it
is the speeches before our courts that excite the highest admiration.</p>
<p>The classification of forensic speeches also is a<span class="marginNote right">Prosecution <span class="italic">vs</span>. defence.</span> twofold one:
they are divided into arguments for the prosecution and arguments for the
defence. And while the side of the defence is more honourable, still that of
the prosecution also has very often established a reputation. I spoke of
Crassus a moment ago; Marcus Antonius, when a youth, had the same success. A
prosecution brought the eloquence of Publius Sulpicius into favourable
notice, when he brought an action against Gaius Norbanus, a seditious <span class="innerMarginNote left">50</span> and dangerous citizen. But
this should not be done oftenâ€”never, in fact, except in the interest
of the state (as in the cases of those above mentioned) or to avenge wrongs
(as the two Luculli, for example, did) or for the protection of our
provincials (as I did in the defence of the Sicilians, or Julius in the
prosecution of Albucius in behalf of the Sardinians). The activity of Lucius
Fufius in the impeachment of Manius Aquilius is likewise famous. This sort
of work, then, may be done once in a lifetime, or at all events not often.
But if it shall be required of anyone to conduct more frequent prosecutions,
let him do it as a service to his country; for it is no disgrace to be often
employed in the prosecution of her </p></section><notes></notes></section>
