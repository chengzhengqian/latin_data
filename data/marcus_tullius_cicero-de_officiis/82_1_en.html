<p>So much must suffice for this topic. For, in its essence, it has been made so
clear, that in determining a question of duty it is not difficult to see
which duty is to be preferred to any other. Moreover, even in the social
relations themselves there are gradations of duty so well defined that it
can easily be seen which duty takes precedence of any other: our first duty
is to the immortal gods; our second, to country; our third, to parents; and
so on, in a descending scale, to the rest.</p>

<p>From this brief discussion, then, it can be understood that people are often
in doubt not only whether an action is morally right or wrong, but also,
when a choice is offered between two moral actions, which one is morally
better. This point, as I remarked above, has been overlooked by Panaetius.
But let us now pass on to what remains.</p>
