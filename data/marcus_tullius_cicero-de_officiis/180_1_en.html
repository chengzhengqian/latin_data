Pyrrhus; and his action was commended by the senate. And yet, if the mere
show of expediency and the popular conception of it are all we want, this

what Aristides was to Athens, or for our senate, who never divorced
expediency from honour—to contend against the enemy with the sword or

proposal. Shame upon our government! The pirates’ sense of honour is
higher than the senate’s. “But,” someone will say,
“the revenues were increased, and therefore it was expedient.”
