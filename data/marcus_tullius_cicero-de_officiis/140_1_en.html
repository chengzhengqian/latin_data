<p>But if Panaetius were the sort of man to say that virtue is worth cultivating
only because it is productive of advantage, as do certain philosophers who
measure the desirableness of things by the standard of pleasure or of
absence of pain, he might argue that expediency sometimes clashes with moral
rectitude. But since he is a man who judges that the morally right is the
only good, and that those things which come in conflict with it have only
the appearance of expediency and cannot make life any better by their
presence nor any worse by their absence, it follows that he ought not to
have raised a question involving the weighing of what seems expedient
against <span class="innerMarginNote left">13</span> what is morally
right. Furthermore, when the Stoics speak of the supreme good as
“living conformably to Nature,” they mean, as I take it,
something like this: that we are always to be in accord with virtue, and
from all other things that may be in harmony with Nature to choose only such
as are not incompatible with virtue. This being so, some people are of the
opinion that it was not right to introduce this counterbalancing of right
and expediency and that no practical instruction should have been given on
this question at all.</p>
<p>And yet moral goodness, in the true and proper sense of the term, is the
exclusive possession of the wise and can never be separated from virtue; but
those who have not perfect wisdom cannot possibly have perfect moral
goodness, but only a semblance <span class="innerMarginNote left">14</span> of it. And indeed these duties under discussion in<span class="marginNote right">The “absolute” and “the
