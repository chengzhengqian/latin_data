<p>Those, then, whose office it is to look after the interests of the state will
refrain from that form of liberality which robs one man to enrich another.
Above all, they will use their best endeavours that<span class="marginNote right">Administration of the courts in equity</span> everyone shall be
protected in the possession of his own property by the fair administration
of the law and the courts, that the poorer classes shall not be oppressed
because of their helplessness, and that envy shall not stand in the way of
the rich, to prevent them from keeping or recovering possession of what
justly belongs to them; they must strive, too, by whatever means they can,
in peace or in war, to advance the state in power, in territory, and in
revenues.</p>
<p>Such service calls for great men; it was commonly rendered in the days of our
ancestors; if men will perform duties such as these, they will win
popularity and glory for themselves and at the same time render eminent
service to the state.</p>

<p>Now, in this list of rules touching expediency,<span class="marginNote right">Sanitation.</span> Antipater of Tyre, a Stoic philosopher who recently
died at Athens, claims that two points were overlooked by
Panaetiusâ€”the care of health and of property. I presume that the
eminent philosopher overlooked these two items because they present no
difficulty. At all events they are expedient. Although they are a matter of
course, I will still say a few words on the subject. Individual health is
preserved by studying ones own constitution, by observing what is good or
bad for one, by constant self-control in supplying physical wants and
comforts (but only to the extent necessary to self-preservation), by
forgoing sensual pleasures, and finally, by the professional skill of those
to whose science these matters belong.</p>
