enough for the man who aspired to be the foremost citizen of the state,
unless with the income from it he could maintain an army. Fine
establishments and the comforts of life in elegance and abundance also

<p>The great majority of people, however, when they fall a prey to ambition for

underfoot all laws of gods and men. But the trouble about this matter is
that it is in the greatest souls and in the most brilliant geniuses that we
usually find ambitions for civil and military authority, for power, and for
glory, springing up; and therefore we must be the more heedful not to go
