with popular conceptions we must employ familiar words in their common
acceptation; and this was the practice of Panaetius likewise. But let us
return to the subject.</p>

<p>The third, then, of the three conditions I named<span class="marginNote right">(3)
through esteem and admiration.</span> as essential to glory is that we
be accounted worthy of the esteem and admiration of our fellow-men. While
people admire in general everything that is great or better than they
expect, they admire in particular the good qualities that they find
unexpectedly in individuals. And so they reverence and extol with the
highest praises those men in whom they see certain pre-eminent and
extraordinary talents; and they look down with contempt upon those who they
think have no ability, no spirit, no energy. For they do not despise all
those of whom they think ill. For some men they consider unscrupulous,
slanderous, fraudulent, and dangerous; they do not despise them, it may be;
but they do think ill of them. And therefore, as I said before, those are
despised who are “of no use to themselves or their
neighbours,” as the saying is, who are idle, lazy, and
indifferent.</p>
<span class="innerMarginNote left">37</span>
<p>On the other hand, those are regarded with admiration who are thought to
excel others in ability and to be free from all dishonour and also from
those vices which others do not easily resist. For sensual pleasure, a most
seductive mistress, turns the hearts of the greater part of humanity away
from virtue; and when the fiery trial of affliction draws near, most people
are terrified beyond measure.</p>
