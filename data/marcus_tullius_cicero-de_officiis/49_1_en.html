certain element of propriety perceptible in every act of moral rectitude;
and this can be separated from virtue theoretically better than it can be
practically. As comeliness and beauty of person are inseparable from the
notion of health, so this propriety of which we are speaking, while in fact
completely blended with virtue, is mentally and theoretically
distinguishable from it.</p>

<p>The classification of propriety, moreover, is twofold:<span class="marginNote right">Propriety defined.</span> (1) we assume a general sort of propriety,
which is found in moral goodness as a whole; then (2) there is another
propriety, subordinate to this, which belongs to the several divisions of
moral goodness. The former is usually defined somewhat as follows:
“Propriety is that which harmonizes with man’s superiority in
those respects in which his nature differs from that of the rest of the
animal creation.” And they so define the special type of propriety
which is subordinate to the general notion, that they represent it to be
that propriety which harmonizes with Nature, in the sense that it manifestly
embraces temperance and self-control, together with a certain deportment
such as becomes a gentleman.</p>

<p>XXVIII. That this is the common acceptation of<span class="marginNote right">Poetic
propriety.</span> propriety we may infer from that propriety which poets
aim to secure. Concerning that, I have occasion to say more in another
connection. Now, we say that the poets observe propriety, when every word or
action is in accord with each individual character. For example, if Aeacus
or Minos said:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line indent2">“Let them hate, if only they fear,”</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">or:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line indent2">“The father is himself his children’s
tomb,”</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p></blockquote>
