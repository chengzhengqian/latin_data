<p class="noindent">When, on the other hand, we wish to pay a compliment, we
somehow or other praise in more eloquent strain the brave and noble work of
some great soul. Hence there is an open field for orators on the subjects of
Marathon, Salamis, Plataea, Thermopylae, and Leuctra, and hence our own
Cocles, the Decii, Gnaeus and Publius Scipio, Marcus Marcellus, and
countless others, and, above all, the Roman People as a nation are
celebrated for greatness of spirit. Their passion for military glory,
moreover, is shown in the fact that we see their statues usually in
soldier’s garb.</p>

<p>XIX. But if the exaltation of spirit seen in times<span class="marginNote right">Fortitude in the light of justice.</span> of danger and toil is devoid
of justice and fights for selfish ends instead of for the common good, it is
a vice; for not only has it no element of virtue, but its nature is
barbarous and revolting to all our finer feelings. The Stoics, therefore,
correctly define courage as “that virtue which champions the cause of
right.” Accordingly, no one has attained to true glory who has gained
a reputation for courage by treachery and cunning; for nothing that lacks
justice can be morally right.</p>

<p>This, then, is a fine saying of Plato’s: “Not only must all
knowledge that is divorced from justice be called cunning rather than
wisdom,” he says, “but even the courage that is prompt to face
danger, if it is inspired not by public spirit, but by its own selfish
purposes, should have the name of effrontery rather than of courage.”
And so we demand that men who are courageous and high-souled shall at the
same time be good and straightforward, lovers of truth, and foes to
deception; for these qualities are the centre and soul of justice.</p>
