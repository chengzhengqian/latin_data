<p><span class="innerMarginNote left">23</span>But this principle is
established not by Nature’s<span class="marginNote right">(2) of
nations,</span> laws alone (that is, by the common rules of equity), but
also by the statutes of particular communities, in accordance with which in
individual states the public interests are maintained. In all these it is
with one accord ordained that no man shall be allowed for the sake of his
own advantage to injure his neighbour. For it is to this that the laws have
regard; this is their intent, that the bonds of union between citizens
should not be impaired; and any attempt to destroy these bonds is repressed
by the penalty of death, exile, imprisonment, or fine.</p>

<p>Again, this principle follows much more effectually<span class="marginNote right">(3)
of gods and men.</span> directly from the Reason which is in Nature,
which is the law of gods and men. If anyone will hearken to that voice (and
all will hearken to it who wish to live in accord with Nature’s
laws), he will never be guilty of coveting anything that is his
neighbour’s or of appropriating to himself what he has taken <span class="innerMarginNote left">24</span> from his neighbour. Then,
too, loftiness and greatness of spirit, and courtesy, justice, and
generosity are much more in harmony with Nature than are selfish pleasure,
riches, and life itself; but it requires a great and lofty spirit to despise
these latter and count them as naught, when one weighs them over against the
common weal. [But for anyone to rob his neighbour for his own profit is more
contrary to Nature than death, pain, and the like.]</p>
<span class="innerMarginNote left">25</span>
<p>In like manner it is more in accord with Nature to emulate the great Hercules
and undergo the greatest toil and trouble for the sake of aiding or saving
the world, if possible, than to live in seclusion, </p></section><notes></notes></section>
