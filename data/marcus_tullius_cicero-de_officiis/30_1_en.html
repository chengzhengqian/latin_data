dear are children, relatives, friends; but one native land embraces all our
loves; and who that is true would hesitate to give his life for her, if by
his death he could render her a service? So much the more execrable are
those monsters who have torn their fatherland to pieces with every form of
outrage and who are<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL030_61_a" id="target_note_LCL030_61_a"><sup>a</sup></a> and have been<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL030_61_b" id="target_note_LCL030_61_b"><sup>b</sup></a> engaged in

can or cannot procure without our help. In this way we shall find that the
claims of social relationship, in its various degrees, are not identical
with the dictates of circumstances; for there are obligations that are due
to one individual rather than to another: for example, one would sooner
assist a neighbour in gathering his harvest than either </p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL030_61_a"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL030_61_a" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">a</sup>Antony and his
