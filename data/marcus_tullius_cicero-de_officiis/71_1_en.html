house, not the house to its owner. And, as in everything else a man must have
regard not for himself alone but for others also, so in the home of a
distinguished man, in which numerous guests must be entertained and crowds
of every sort of people received, care must be taken to have it spacious.
But if it is not frequented by visitors, if it has an air of lonesomeness, a
spacious palace often becomes a discredit to its owner. This is sure to be
the case if at some other time, when it had a different owner, it used to be
thronged. For it is unpleasant, when passers-by remark:
<q>
<span class="line indent3">“O good old house, alas! how different</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent3">The owner who now owneth thee!”</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</q></p>
<p>And in these times that may be said of many a house!<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL030_143_a" id="target_note_LCL030_143_a"><sup>a</sup></a></p>

<p>One must be careful, too, not to go beyond proper bounds in expense and
display, especially if one is building for oneself. For much mischief is
done in this way, if only in the example set. For many people imitate
zealously the foibles of the great, particularly in this direction: for
example, who copies the virtues of Lucius Lucullus, excellent man that he
was? But how many there are who have copied the magnificence of his villas!
Some limit should surely be set to this tendency and it should be reduced at
least to a standard of moderation; and by that same standard of moderation
the comforts and wants of life generally should be regulated.</p>
<p>But enough on this part of my theme.</p>
