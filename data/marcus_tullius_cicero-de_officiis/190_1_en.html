inflicted upon Regulus than Regulus brought upon himself? Religious scruple,
therefore, had no such preponderance as to outweigh so great
expediency.”</p>
<p>“Or was he afraid that his act would be morally<span class="marginNote right">(2) “Of two evils choose the less,”</span> wrong? As to
that, first of all, the proverb says, ‘Of evils choose the
least.’ Did that moral wrong, then, really involve as great an evil
as did that awful torture? And secondly, there are the lines of Accius:</p>
<p><span class="italic">Thyestes.</span> ‘Hast thou broke thy
faith?’</p>
<p><span class="italic">Atreus.</span> ‘None have I giv’n; none give I
ever to the faithless.’</p>
<p>Although this sentiment is put into the mouth of a wicked king, still it is
illuminating in its correctness.”</p>

<p>Their third argument is this: just as we maintain<span class="marginNote right">(3)
oaths extorted by constraint not binding,</span> that some things seem
expedient but are not, so they maintain, some things seem morally right but
are not. “For example,” they contend, “in this very
case it seems morally right for Regulus to have returned to torture for the
sake of being true to his oath. But it proves not to be morally right,
because what an enemy extorted by force ought not to have been
binding.”</p>
<p>As their concluding argument, they add: whatever<span class="marginNote right">(4)
exceptional expediency makes right.</span> is highly expedient may prove
to be morally right, even if it did not seem so in advance.</p>
<p>These are in substance the arguments raised against the conduct of Regulus.
Let us consider them each in turn.</p>

not wont to be angry or hurtful.”</p>
