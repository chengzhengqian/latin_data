<p>How much better was the conduct of Quintus Maximus! Of him Ennius says:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line indent2">“One man—and he alone—restored our
state by delaying.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">Not in the least did fame with him take precedence of
safety;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">Therefore now does his glory shine bright, and it grows

<p>This sort of offence<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL030_87_a" id="target_note_LCL030_87_a"><sup>a</sup></a> must be avoided no less in political life.

<p>XXV. Those who propose to take charge of the<span class="marginNote right">Public
administration must be free from</span> affairs of government should not
fail to remember two of Plato’s rules: first, to keep the good of the
people so clearly in view that regardless of their own interests they will
make their every action conform to that; second, to care for the welfare of
the whole body politic and not in serving the interests of some<span class="marginNote right">(1) partisanship</span> one party to betray the rest. For
the administration of the government, like the office of a trustee, must be
conducted for the benefit of those entrusted to one’s care, not of
those to whom it is entrusted. Now, those who care for the interests of a
part of the citizens and neglect another part, introduce into the civil
service a dangerous element—dissension and party strife. The result
is that some are found to be loyal supporters of the democratic, others of
the aristocratic party, and few of the nation as a whole.</p>

<p>As a result of this party spirit bitter strife arose at Athens,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL030_87_b" id="target_note_LCL030_87_b"><sup>b</sup></a>
