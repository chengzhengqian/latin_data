<p>But, perhaps, someone may say: “Well, then, suppose a wise man were
starving to death, might he not take the bread of some perfectly useless
member of society?” [Not at all; for my life is not more precious to
me than that temper of soul which would keep me from doing wrong to anybody
for my own advantage.] “Or again; supposing a righteous man were in a
position to rob the cruel and inhuman tyrant Phalaris of clothing, might he
not do it to keep himself from freezing to death?”</p>

<p>These cases are very easy to decide. For, if merely for one’s own
benefit one were to take something away from a man, though he were a
perfectly worthless fellow, it would be an act of meanness and contrary to
Nature’s law. But suppose one would be<span class="marginNote right">The
interests of society must decide about exceptions.</span> able, by
remaining alive, to render signal service to the state and to human
society—if from that motive one should take something from another,
it would not be a matter for censure. But, if such is not the case, each one
must bear his own burden of distress rather than rob a neighbour of his
rights. We are not to say, therefore, that sickness or want or any evil of
that sort is more repugnant to Nature than to covet and to appropriate what
is one’s neighbour’s; but we do maintain that disregard of the
common interests <span class="innerMarginNote left">31</span> is
repugnant to Nature; for it is unjust. And therefore Nature’s law
itself, which protects and conserves human interests, will surely determine
that a man who is wise, good, and brave, should in emergency have the
necessaries of life transferred to him from a person who is idle and
worthless; for the good man’s death would be a heavy loss to the
common weal; only let him beware that self-esteem and self-love do not find
in such a transfer of possessions </p></section><notes></notes></section>
