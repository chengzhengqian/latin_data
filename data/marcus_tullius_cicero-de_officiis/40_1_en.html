<p>XXIII. That moral goodness which we look for in<span class="marginNote right">(2)
Physical courage.</span> a lofty, high-minded spirit is secured, of
course, by moral, not by physical, strength. And yet the body must be
trained and so disciplined that it can obey the dictates of judgment and
reason in attending to business and in enduring toil. But that moral
goodness which is our theme depends wholly upon the thought and attention
given to it by the mind. And, in this way, the men who in a civil capacity
direct the affairs of the nation render no less important service than they
who conduct its wars: by their statesmanship oftentimes wars are either
averted or terminated; sometimes also they are declared. Upon Marcus
Cato’s counsel, for example, the Third Punic War was undertaken, and
in its conduct his influence <span class="innerMarginNote left">80</span> was dominant, even after he was dead. And so diplomacy in the
friendly settlement of controversies is more desirable than courage in
settling them on the battlefield; but we must be careful not to take that
course merely for the sake of avoiding war rather than for the sake of
public expediency. War, however, should be undertaken in such a way as to
make it evident that it has no other object than to secure peace.</p>
<p>But it takes a brave and resolute spirit not to be disconcerted in times of
difficulty or ruffled and thrown off one’s feet, as the saying is,
but to keep one’s presence of mind and one’s self-possession
and not to swerve from the path of reason.</p>
