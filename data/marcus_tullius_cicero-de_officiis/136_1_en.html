business, not prompted by any desire for repose. For now that the senate has
been abolished and the courts have been closed, what is there, in keeping
with my self-respect, that I can do either in the senate <span class="innerMarginNote left">3</span> chamber or in the forum? So,
although I once lived amid throngs of people and in the greatest publicity,
I am now shunning the sight of the miscreants with whom the world abounds
and withdrawing from the public eye as far as I may, and I am often alone.
But I have learned from philosophers that among evils one ought not only to
choose the least, but also to extract even from these any element of good
that they may contain. For that reason, I am turning my leisure to
account—though it is not such repose as the man should be entitled to
who once brought the state repose from civil strife—and I am not
letting this solitude, which necessity and not my will imposes on me, find
me idle.</p>

<p>And yet, in my judgment, Africanus earned the higher praise. For no literary
monuments of his genius have been published, we have no work produced in his
leisure hours, no product of his solitude. From this fact we may safely
infer that, because of the activity of his mind and the study of those
problems to which he used to direct his thought, he was never unoccupied,
never lonely. But I have not strength of mind enough by means of silent
meditation to forget my solitude; and so I have turned all my attention and
endeavour to this kind of literary work. I have, accordingly, written more
in this short time since the downfall of the republic than I did in the
course of many years, while the republic stood.</p>
