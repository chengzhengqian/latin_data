whoever he may be, just because he is a fellow-man, then it follows, in
accordance with that same Nature, that there are interests that all men have
in common. And, if this is true, we are all subject to one and the same law
of Nature; and, if this also is true, we are certainly forbidden by
Nature’s law to wrong our neighbour. Now the first assumption is
true; <span class="innerMarginNote left">28</span> therefore the
conclusion is likewise true. For that is an absurd position which is taken
by some people, who say that they will not rob a parent or a brother for
their own gain, but that their relation to the rest of their fellow-citizens
is quite another thing. Such people contend in essence that they are bound
to their fellow-citizens by no mutual obligations, social ties, or common
interests. This attitude demolishes the whole structure of civil
society.</p>
<p>Others again who say that regard should be had<span class="marginNote right">Better
endure any loss than wrong a fellow man for gain.</span> for the rights
of fellow-citizens, but not of foreigners, would destroy the universal
brotherhood of mankind; and, when this is annihilated, kindness, generosity,
goodness, and justice must utterly perish; and those who work all this
destruction must be considered as wickedly rebelling against the immortal
gods. For they uproot the fellowship which the gods have established between
human beings, and the closest bond of this fellowship is the conviction that
it is more repugnant to Nature for man to rob a fellow-man for his own gain
than to endure all possible loss, whether to his property or to his person .
. . or even to his very soul—so far as these losses are not concerned
with justice;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL030_295_a" id="target_note_LCL030_295_a"><sup>a</sup></a> for this virtue is the sovereign mistress and
