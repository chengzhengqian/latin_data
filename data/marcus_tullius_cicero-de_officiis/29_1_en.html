Then follow between these, in turn, marriages and connections by marriage,
and from these again a new stock of relations; and from this propagation and
after-growth states have their beginnings. The bonds of common blood hold

congenial character are joined in intimate friendship; for really, if we
discover in another that moral goodness on which I dwell so much, it
attracts us and makes us friends to the one in whose character <span class="innerMarginNote left">56</span> it seems to dwell. And while
every virtue attracts us and makes us love those who seem to possess it,
still justice and generosity do so most of all. Nothing, moreover, is more
conducive to love and intimacy than compatibility of character in good men;
for when two people have the same ideals and the same tastes, it is a
natural consequence that each loves the other as himself; and the result is,
as Pythagoras requires of ideal friendship, that several are united in

between whom they are interchanged are united by the ties of an enduring
intimacy.</p>

us with our country. Parents </p></section><notes></notes></section>
