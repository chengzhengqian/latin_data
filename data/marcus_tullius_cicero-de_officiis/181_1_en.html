shame be expedient for any government? For government ought to be founded
upon fair fame and the loyalty of allies.</p>
<p>On this point I often disagreed even with my<span class="marginNote right">(3) Cato and
the publicans,</span> friend Cato; it seemed to me that he was too
rigorous in his watchful care over the claims of the treasury and the
revenues; he refused everything that the farmers of the revenue asked for
and much that the allies desired; whereas, as I insisted, it was our duty to
be generous to the allies and to treat the publicans as we were accustomed
individually to treat our tenants—and all the more, because harmony
between the orders was essential to the welfare of the republic.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL030_363_a" id="target_note_LCL030_363_a"><sup>a</sup></a>
Curio, too, was wrong, when he<span class="marginNote right">4) Curio and the

were just, but never failed to add, “Let expediency prevail.”
He ought rather to have proved that the claims were not just, because they
were not expedient for the republic, than to have admitted that they were
just, when, as he maintained, they were not expedient.</p>

<p>XXIII. The sixth book of Hecaton’s “Moral<span class="marginNote right">Hecaton debates the question of expediency <span class="italic">vs.</span>

following: “Is it consistent with a good man’s duty to let his
slaves go hungry when provisions are at famine prices?”</p>
<p>Hecaton gives the argument on both sides of the question; but still in the
end it is by the standard of expediency, as he conceives it, rather than by
one of human feeling, that he decides the question of duty.</p>
<p>Then he raises this question: supposing a man had to throw part of his cargo
overboard in a storm, should he prefer to sacrifice a high-priced horse or a

the revenue, were the moneyed men of the times, and belonged to the
equestrian order. They purchased from the senate the farming of the revenues
and then sublet their contract to the collectors. Sometimes they found that
they had agreed to pay too high a rate and petitioned the senate to release
them from their contract or reduce their obligations, as on this occasion
(<span class="sc">b.c.</span> 61). The opposition of Cato and others strained
the relations between the senate, who had control of the business, and the
equestrian order, driving many of the equites over to Caesar’s side.
Complete harmony between the senate and the knights, as Cicero says, was the
only thing that could have saved Rome from the popular party and
Caesar.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL030_363_a').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
