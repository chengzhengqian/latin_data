and is the strongest support not only of security but also of influence and

hair singed off with a glowing coal. In what state of mind do we fancy
Alexander of Pherae lived? We read in history that he dearly loved his wife
Thebe; and yet, whenever he went from the banquet-hall to her in her
chamber, he used to order a barbarian—one, too, tattooed like a
Thracian, as the records state—to go before him with a drawn sword;
and he used to send ahead some of his bodyguard to pry into the
lady’s caskets and to search and see whether some weapon were not
concealed in her wardrobe. Unhappy man! To think a barbarian, a branded
slave, more faithful than his own wife! Nor was he mistaken. For he was
murdered by her own hand, because she suspected him of infidelity.</p>
