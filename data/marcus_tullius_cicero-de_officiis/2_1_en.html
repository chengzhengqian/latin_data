of the Latin language more complete. But I would by no means have you think
that this is said boastfully. For there are many to whom I yield precedence
in knowledge of philosophy; but if I lay claim to the orator’s
peculiar ability to speak with propriety, clearness, elegance, I think my
claim is in a measure justified, for I have spent my life in that
profession.</p>

<p>And therefore, my dear Cicero, I cordially recommend<span class="marginNote right">Philosophy and oratory.</span> you to read carefully not only my
orations but also these<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL030_5_a" id="target_note_LCL030_5_a"><sup>a</sup></a> books of mine on philosophy, which are now
about as extensive. For while the orations exhibit a more vigorous style,
yet the unimpassioned, restrained style of my philosophical productions is
also worth cultivating. Moreover, for the same man to succeed in both
departments, both in the forensic style and in that of calm philosophic
discussion has not, I observe, been the good fortune of any one of the
Greeks so far, unless, perhaps, Demetrius of Phalerum can be reckoned in
that number—a clever reasoner, indeed, and, though rather a
spiritless orator, he is yet charming, so that you can recognize in him the
disciple of Theophrastus. But let others judge how much I have accomplished
in each pursuit; I have at least attempted both.</p>

<p>I believe, of course, that if Plato had been willing to devote himself to
forensic oratory, he could have spoken with the greatest eloquence and
power; and that if Demosthenes had continued the studies he pursued with
Plato and had wished to expound his views, he could have done so with
elegance and brilliancy. I feel the same way about Aristotle and Isocrates,
each of whom, engrossed in his own profession, undervalued that of the
other.</p>
