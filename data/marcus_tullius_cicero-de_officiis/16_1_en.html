would usually demand. For we may well be guided by those fundamental
principles of justice which I laid down at the outset: first, that no harm
be done to anyone; second, that the common interests be conserved. When
these are modified under changed circumstances, moral duty also undergoes a
change, <span class="innerMarginNote left">32</span> and it does not
always remain the same. For a given promise or agreement may turn out in
such a way<span class="marginNote right">Non-fulfilment of promises.</span> that its
performance will prove detrimental either to the one to whom the promise has
been made or to the one who has made it. If, for example, Neptune, in the
drama, had not carried out his promise to Theseus, Theseus would not have
lost his son Hippolytus; for, as the story runs, of the three wishes<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL030_33_a" id="target_note_LCL030_33_a"><sup>a</sup></a>
that Neptune had promised to grant him the third was this: in a fit of anger
he prayed for the death of Hippolytus, and the granting of this prayer
plunged him into unspeakable grief. Promises are, therefore, not to be kept,
if the keeping of them is to prove harmful to those to whom you have made
them; and, if the fulfilment of a promise should do more harm to you than
good to him to whom you have made it, it is no violation of moral duty to
give the greater good precedence over the lesser good. For example, if you
have made an appointment with anyone to appear as his advocate in court, and
if in the meantime your son should fall dangerously ill, it would be no
breach of your moral duty to fail in what you agreed to do; nay, rather, he
to whom your promise was given would have a false conception of duty, if he
should complain that he had been deserted in his time of need. Further than
this, who fails to see that those promises are not binding which are
extorted by intimidation or which we make when </p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL030_33_a"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL030_33_a" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">a</sup>The three wishes were: (1)
