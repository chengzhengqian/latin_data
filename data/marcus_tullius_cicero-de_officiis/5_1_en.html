and it is these special duties that I propose to treat at length in the
following books.</p>
<span class="innerMarginNote left">8</span>
<p>And yet there is still another classification of duties: we distinguish
between “mean”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL030_11_aa" id="target_note_LCL030_11_aa"><sup>a</sup></a> duty, so-called,
and “absolute” duty. Absolute duty we may, I presume, call
“right,” for the Greeks call it κατόρθωμα, while the ordinary
duty they call καθῆκον. And the meaning of those terms they fix thus:
whatever is right they define as “absolute” duty, but
“mean” duty, they say, is duty for the performance of which an
adequate reason may be rendered.</p>
<span class="innerMarginNote left">9</span>
<p>The consideration necessary to determine conduct<span class="marginNote right">The
threefold classification of Panaetius.</span> is, therefore, as
Panaetius thinks, a threefold one: first, people question whether the
contemplated act is morally right or morally wrong; and in such deliberation
their minds are often led to widely divergent conclusions. And then they
examine and consider the question whether the action contemplated is or is
not conducive to comfort and happiness in life, to the command of means and
wealth, to influence, and to power, by which they may be able to help
themselves and their friends; this whole matter turns upon a question of
expediency. The third type of question arises when that which seems to be
expedient seems to conflict with that which is morally right; for when
expediency seems to be pulling one way, while moral right seems to be
calling back in the opposite direction, the result is that the mind is
distracted in its inquiry and brings to it the irresolution that is born of
deliberation.</p>

terms are difficult because he has to invent them to translate Greek that is
perfectly simple: <span class="italic">rectum</span> is ‘right,’
i.e. perfect, absolute. Its opposite is <span class="italic">medium,</span>
‘mean,’ i.e. intermediate, falling short of the
‘absolute’ and occupying a middle ground; common; ordinary.
<span class="italic">honestum</span> is ‘morally right’; as a
noun, ‘moral goodness’ (= <span class="italic">honestas);</span>
its opposite is <span class="italic">turpe,</span> ‘morally wrong.’
<span class="italic">honestas</span> is ‘moral
rectitude,’—‘moral goodness’;
‘morality’; its opposite <span class="italic">turpitudo,</span>
‘moral wrong,’ ‘immorality.’ <span class="italic">honestus,</span> on the other hand, is always
‘honourable’; and <span class="italic">honores</span> are
always ‘offices of honour.’</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL030_11_aa').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
