<p>X. Many cases oftentimes arise to perplex our<span class="marginNote right">Conflicts
between: (1) apparent Expediency and Justice,</span> minds with a
specious appearance of expediency: the question raised in these cases is not
whether moral rectitude is to be sacrificed to some considerable advantage
(for that would of course be wrong), but whether the apparent advantage can
be secured without moral wrong. When Brutus deposed his colleague Collatinus
from the consular office, his treatment of him might have been thought
unjust; for Collatinus had been his associate, and had helped him with word

the Tarquins and every reminder of the monarchy should be obliterated, then
the course that was expedient—namely, to serve the country’s
interests—was so pre-eminently right, that it was even
Collatinus’s own duty to acquiesce in its justice. And so expediency
gained the day because of its moral rightness; for without moral rectitude
there could have been no possible expediency.</p>
