<p>Injustice often arises also through chicanery, that<span class="marginNote right">Chicanery.</span> is, through an over-subtle and even fraudulent
construction of the law. This it is that gave rise to the now familiar saw,
“More law, less justice.” Through such interpretation also a
great deal of wrong is committed in transactions between state and state;

spirit, but to make some concession rather than claim some accession. When
each party had agreed to this, there was a considerable strip of territory
left between them. And so he set the boundary of each city as each had
severally agreed; and the tract in between he awarded to the Roman People.
