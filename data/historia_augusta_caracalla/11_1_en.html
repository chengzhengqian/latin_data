There is also the story that Papinian refused to compose a speech in which, to improve the murderer’s case, the brother was to be attacked; and that in his refusal he had declared that to accuse an innocent man who had been murdered was a second act of murder. All of which does not accord with facts; for the prefect of the guard may not compose speeches, and, besides, it is well established that Papinian was killed for being one of Geta’s supporters. It is further related that Papinian, when, seized by the soldiers, he was being haled to the Palace to be put to death, foretold the future, saying that whoever should succeed to his position would be an utter fool did he not take vengeance for this brutal attack on the prefecture. And this actually came to pass; for, as we have previously related,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL140_23_1" id="target_note_LCL140_23_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Macrinus murdered Antoninus; then, after he had been acclaimed emperor in the camp, together with his son, he gave the latter, who was called Diadumenianus, the name Antoninus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL140_23_2" id="target_note_LCL140_23_2"><sup>2</sup></a> for the reason that an Antoninus was earnestly desired by the praetorian guard.</p>

He was borne to the grave with a public funeral. He left a son, who afterward received, like his father, the name Antoninus—Marcus Antoninus Elagabalus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL140_23_4" id="target_note_LCL140_23_4"><sup>4</sup></a>; for such a hold had the name of the Antonines that it could not be removed from the thoughts of the people, because it had taken root in the hearts of all, even as had the name of Augustus.</p>
