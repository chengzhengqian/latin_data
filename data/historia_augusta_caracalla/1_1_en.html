<p>I. The two sons left by Septimius Severus, Geta and Bassianus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL140_3_1" id="target_note_LCL140_3_1"><sup>1</sup></a> both received the surname Antoninus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL140_3_2" id="target_note_LCL140_3_2"><sup>2</sup></a> one from the army, the other from his father, but Geta was declared a public enemy,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL140_3_3" id="target_note_LCL140_3_3"><sup>3</sup></a> while Bassianus got the empire. The account of this emperor’s ancestors I deem it needless to repeat, for all this has been fully told in the <span class="italic">Life of Severus</span>.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL140_3_4" id="target_note_LCL140_3_4"><sup>4</sup></a> He himself in his boyhood was winsome and clever, respectful to his parents and courteous to his parents’ friends, beloved by the people, popular with the senate, and well able to further his own interests in winning affection. Never did he seem backward in letters or slow in deeds of kindness, never niggardly in largess or tardy in forgiving—at least while under his parents. For example, if ever he saw condemned criminals pitted against wild beasts, he wept or turned away his eyes, and this was more than pleasing to the people.
