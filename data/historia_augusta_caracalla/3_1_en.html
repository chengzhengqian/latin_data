so he had his brother slain in the Palace,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL140_7_1" id="target_note_LCL140_7_1"><sup>1</sup></a> giving orders to burn his body at once. He also said in the Camp<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL140_7_2" id="target_note_LCL140_7_2"><sup>2</sup></a> that his brother had made preparations to poison him and had shown disrespect to their mother. To those who had killed his brother he rendered thanks publicly, and indeed he even gave them a bonus for being so loyal to him. Nevertheless, some of the soldiers at Alba,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL140_7_3a" id="target_note_LCL140_7_3a"><sup>3</sup></a> received the news of Geta’s death with anger, and all declared they had sworn allegiance to both the sons of Severus and ought to maintain it to both.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL140_7_4" id="target_note_LCL140_7_4"><sup>4</sup></a> They then closed the gates of the camp, and the Emperor was not admitted for a long time, and then not until he had quieted their anger, not only by bitter words about Geta and by bringing charges against him, but also by enormous sums of money, by means of which, as usual, the soldiers were placated.

He stationed this in a double line in the midst of the benches and so made a speech, in which, with a view to accusing his brother and excusing himself, he complained in a confused and incoherent manner about his brother’s treachery. The senate received his speech with little favour, when he said that although he had granted his brother every indulgence and had in fact saved him from a conspiracy, yet Geta had formed a most dangerous plot against him and had made no return for his brotherly affection.</p>
