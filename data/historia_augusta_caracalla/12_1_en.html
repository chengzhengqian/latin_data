<p>His mode of life was evil and he was more brutal even than his cruel father. He was gluttonous in his use of food and addicted to wine, hated by his household and detested in every camp save that of the praetorian guard; and between him and his brother there was no resemblance whatever.</p>
<p>Among the public works which he left at Rome was the notable Bath named after himself,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL140_25_1" id="target_note_LCL140_25_1"><sup>1</sup></a> the <span class="italic">cella soliaris</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL140_25_2" id="target_note_LCL140_25_2"><sup>2</sup></a> of which, so the architects declare, cannot be reproduced in the way in which it was built by him. For it is said that the whole vaulting rested on gratings of bronze or copper, placed underneath it, but such is its size, that those who are versed in mechanics declare that it could not have been built in this way. And he left a portico, too, named after his father<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL140_25_3" id="target_note_LCL140_25_3"><sup>3</sup></a> and intended to contain a record of his achievements, both his triumphs and his wars.

Hence at this present day, too, the hooded cloaks of this kind, affected especially by the Roman plebs, are called Antonine. He also constructed a new street<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL140_25_5" id="target_note_LCL140_25_5"><sup>5</sup></a> at the side of his bath (that is to say, the Antonine Bath), one more beautiful than which it were hard to find among all the streets of Rome. He brought the cult of Isis to Rome and built magnificent temples to this goddess everywhere, celebrating her rites with even greater reverence than they had ever been celebrated before. In all this, however, it is a source of wonder to me how it can be
