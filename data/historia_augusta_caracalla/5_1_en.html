<p>IV. Next, in the Emperor’s own presence, Papinian was struck with an axe by some soldiers and so slain. Whereupon the Emperor said to the slayer, “You should have used a sword in carrying out my command.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL140_11_1" id="target_note_LCL140_11_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Patruinus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL140_11_2" id="target_note_LCL140_11_2"><sup>2</sup></a> too, was slain by his order, and that in front of the Temple of the Deified Pius,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL140_11_3" id="target_note_LCL140_11_3"><sup>3</sup></a> and his body as well as Papinian’s were dragged about through the streets without any regard for decency. Also Papinian’s son was killed, who was a quaestor and only three days before had given a lavish spectacle. During this same time there were slain men without number, all of whom had favoured the cause of Geta,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL140_11_4" id="target_note_LCL140_11_4"><sup>4</sup></a> and even the freedmen were slain who had managed Geta’s affairs. Then there was a slaughtering in all manner of places. Even in the public baths there was slaughter, and some too were killed while dining, among them Sammonicus Serenus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL140_11_5a" id="target_note_LCL140_11_5a"><sup>5</sup></a> many of whose books dealing with learned subjects are still in circulation. Cilo, moreover, twice prefect and consul, incurred the utmost danger merely because he had counselled harmony between the brothers. For not until after the city-soldiers<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL140_11_6" id="target_note_LCL140_11_6"><sup>6</sup></a> had seized Cilo, tearing off his senator’s robe and pulling off his boots, did Antoninus check their violence. After this he committed many further murders in the city, causing many persons far and wide to be seized by soldiers and killed, as though he were punishing a rebellion.
