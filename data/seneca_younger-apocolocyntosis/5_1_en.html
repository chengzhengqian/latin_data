<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">As age by age the pretty thread runs down the golden days.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">World without end they spin away, the happy fleeces pull;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">What joy they take to fill their hands with that delightful wool!</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">With speed the task performs itself: no toil the spinners know:</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Down drops the soft and silken thread as round the spindles go;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Fewer than these are Tithon’s years, not Nestor’s life<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL015_445_1" id="target_note_LCL015_445_1"><sup>1</sup></a> so long.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Phoebus is present: glad he is to sing a merry song;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Now helps the work, now full of joy upon the harp doth play;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">The Sisters listen to the song that charms their toil away.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">They praise their brother’s harp and song, and still the spindles run,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Till with good work beyond our span the busy hands have spun.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Then Phoebus says, “O sister Fates! I pray take none away,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">But suffer this one life to be longer than mortal day.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Like me in face and lovely grace, my peer in voice and song,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL015_445_2" id="target_note_LCL015_445_2"><sup>2</sup></a></span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">He’ll bid the laws at length speak out that have been dumb so long,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Will give unto the weary world years prosperous and bright.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Like as the daystar from on high scatters the stars of night,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
