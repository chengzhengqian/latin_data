it be Claudius’ funeral? It was certainly the most gorgeous spectacle, got up regardless of expense, clear it was that a god was being borne to the grave: blaring of trumpeters, roaring of horn-players, an immense brass band of all sorts, so great a crowd, so great a concerted din that even Claudius could hear it. Joy and rejoicing on every side, the Roman people walking about like free men. Agatho<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL015_471_1" id="target_note_LCL015_471_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and a few pettifoggers were weeping for grief, and for once in a way they meant it. The Barristers were crawling out of their dark corners, pale and thin, with hardly a breath in their bodies, as though just coming to life again. One of them when he saw the pettifoggers putting their heads together, and lamenting their sad lot, up comes he and says: “Did not I tell you the Saturnalia could not last for ever?”</p>
<p>When Claudius saw his own funeral train, he understood that he was dead. For they were chanting his dirge in anapaests, with much mopping and mouthing:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">“Pour forth your laments, your sorrow declare,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Let the sounds of grief rise loud in the square:</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">For he that is dead had a wit most keen,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Was bravest of all that on earth have been.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Racehorses are nothing to his swift feet:</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
