<p>One day when this dish had been brought and placed upon the table, and we were ready and awaiting the meal, Taurus ordered a slave-boy to pour some oil into the pot. The slave was a boy of Attic birth, at most eight years old, overflowing with the merry wit characteristic of his race and his time of life. He brought an empty Samian flask, from oversight, as he said, supposing there was oil in it, turned it up and, as he usually did, passed it with his hand over all parts of the pot; but no oil came out. The boy, in anger, looked savagely at the flask, shook it violently, and again turned it over the pot; and when we were all quietly and furtively laughing at his actions, he said in Greek, and excellent Attic Greek at that: “Don’t laugh; there’s oil in it; but don’t you know how cold it was this morning; it’s congealed.” “You rascal,” said Taurus with a laugh, “run and fetch some oil.”</p>
<p>But when the boy had gone out to buy oil, Taurus, not at all put out by the delay, said: “The pot needs oil, and, as I see, is intolerably hot; let us withhold our hands and meanwhile, since the slave has just told us that oil is in the habit of congealing, let us consider why oil congeals often and readily, but wine rarely.” And he looked at me and bade me give my opinion. Then I replied that I inferred that wine congealed less quickly because it had in it certain seeds of heat and was naturally more fiery, and that was why Homer called<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL212_231_1" id="target_note_LCL212_231_1"><sup>1</sup></a> it αἴθοψ,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL212_231_2b" id="target_note_LCL212_231_2b"><sup>2</sup></a> and not, as some supposed, on account of its colour.</p>
