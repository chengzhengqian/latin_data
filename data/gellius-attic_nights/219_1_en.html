because of a quick surrender, a victory was won which was “dustless,” as the saying is,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_397_1" id="target_note_LCL195_397_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and bloodless. For such an easy victory they believed that the leaves sacred to Venus were appropriate, on the ground that it was a triumph, not of Mars, but as it were of Venus. And Marcus Crassus, when he returned after ending the Servile war and entered the city in an ovation, disdainfully rejected the myrtle crown and used his influence to have a decree passed by the senate, that he should be crowned with laurel, not with myrtle.</p>
<p>Marcus Cato charges Marcus Fulvius Nobilior<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_397_2" id="target_note_LCL195_397_2"><sup>2</sup></a> with having awarded crowns to his soldiers for the most trifling reasons possible, for the sake of popularity. On that subject I give you Cato’s own words:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_397_3" id="target_note_LCL195_397_3"><sup>3</sup></a> “Now to begin with, who ever saw anyone presented with a crown, when a town had not been taken or an enemy’s camp burned?” But Fulvius, against whom Cato brought that charge, had bestowed crowns on his soldiers for industry in building a rampart or in digging a well.</p>
<p>I must not pass over a point relating to ovations, about which I learn that the ancient writers disagreed.
For some of them have stated that the man who celebrated an ovation was accustomed to enter the city on horseback: but Masurius Sabinus says<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_397_4" id="target_note_LCL195_397_4"><sup>4</sup></a> that they entered on foot, followed, not by their soldiers, but by the senate in a body.</p>
