<p>But our grammarian, with open mouth as if in a dream, said: “Just now I have no time to spare. When I have leisure, come to see me and learn what Virgil, Plautus, Sallust and Ennius meant by that word.”</p>
<p>So saying that fool made off; but in case anyone should wish to investigate, not only the origin of this word, but also its variety of meaning, in order that lie may take into consideration this Plautine use also, I have quoted the following lines from the <span class="italic">Asinaria</span>:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_73_1" id="target_note_LCL200_73_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line indent1">He’ll join with me and hatch the biggest jubilee,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent1">Stuff d with most joy, for son and father too.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent1">For life they both shall be in debt (<span class="italic">obnoxii</span>) to</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">both of us,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent1">By our services fast bound.</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p>Now, in the definition which that grammarian gave, he seems in a word of such manifold content to have noted only one of its uses—a use, it is true, which agrees with that of Caecilius in these verses of the <span class="italic">Chrysium</span>:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_73_2" id="target_note_LCL200_73_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line indent1">Although I come to you attracted by your pay,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent1">Don’t think that I for that am subject to your</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">
will (<span class="italic">tibi . . . obnoxium</span>);</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent1">If you speak ill of me, you’ll hear a like reply.</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
