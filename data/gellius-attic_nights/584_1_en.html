<p>That Metellus Numidicus borrowed a new form of expression from Greek usage.</p>
<p><span class="sc">In</span> Quintus Metellus Numidicus, in the third book of his <span class="italic">Accusation of Valerius Messala</span>, I have made note of a novel expression. The words of his speech are as follows:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL212_97_1" id="target_note_LCL212_97_1"><sup>1</sup></a> “When he knew that he had incurred so grave an accusation, and that our allies had come to the senate in tears, to make complaint that they had been exacted enormous sums of money (<span class="italic">pecunias maximas exactos esse</span>).” He says “that they had been exacted enormous sums of money,” instead of “that enormous sums of money had been exacted from them.”</p>
<p>This seemed to me an imitation of a Greek idiom; for the Greeks say: εἰσεπράξατό με ἀργύριον, meaning “he exacted me money.” But if this can be said, so too can “one is exacted money,” and Caecilius seems to have used that form of expression in his <span class="italic">Supposititious Aeschinus</span>:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL212_97_2" id="target_note_LCL212_97_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line indent4">Yet I the customs-fee exacted am.</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">That is to say, “yet the customs-fee is exacted from me.”</p>

<h3>That the early writers used <span class="italic">passis velis</span> and <span class="italic">passis manibus</span>, not from the verb <span class="italic">patior</span>, to which the participle belongs, but from <span class="italic">pando</span>, to which it does not belong.</h3>
<p><span class="sc">From</span> the verb <span class="italic">pando</span> the ancients made <span class="italic">passum</span>, not <span class="italic">pansum</span>, and with the preposition <span class="italic">ex</span> they formed
