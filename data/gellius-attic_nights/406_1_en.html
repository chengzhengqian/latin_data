<p>The names of ships which I recalled at the time are these: merchant-ships, cargo-carriers, skiffs, warships, cavalry-transports, cutters, fast cruisers, or, as the Greeks call them, κέλητες, barques, smacks, sailing-skiffs,
light galleys, which the Greeks call’ ἱστιοκόποι or ἐπακτρίδες, scouting-boats, galliots, tenders, flat-boats, <span class="italic">vetutiae moediae,</span> yachts, pinnaces, long-galliots, scullers’ boats, caupuls,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_287_1" id="target_note_LCL200_287_1"><sup>1</sup></a> arks, fair-weather craft, pinks, lighters, spy-boats.</p>

<p>That Asinius Pollio showed ignorance in criticizing Sallust because he used <span class="italic">transgressus</span> (crossing) for <span class="italic">transfretatio</span> (crossing the sea) and <span class="italic">transgressi</span> (those who had crossed) for <span class="italic">qui transfretaverant</span> (those who had crossed the sea).</p>
