<p>A quotation from an early decree of the senate, which provided that sacrifice should be made with full-grown victims because the spears of Mars had moved in the sanctuary; also an explanation of the meaning of <span class="italic">hostiae succidaneae</span> and likewise of <span class="italic">porca praecidanea</span>; and further, that Ateius Capito called certain holidays <span class="italic">praecidaneae.</span></p>
<p><span class="sc">Not</span> only was an earthquake regularly reported, and expiatory offerings made on that account, but I also find it mentioned in early records, that report was made to the senate when the spears of Mars<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_331_1" id="target_note_LCL195_331_1"><sup>1</sup></a> had moved in the sanctuary in the Regia.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_331_2a" id="target_note_LCL195_331_2a"><sup>2</sup></a> Because of such an occurrence, a decree of the senate was passed in the consulship of Marcus Antonius and Aulus Postumius,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_331_3" id="target_note_LCL195_331_3"><sup>3</sup></a> of which this is a copy: “Whereas Gaius Julius, son of Lucius, the pontifex, has reported that the spears of Mars have moved in the sanctuary in the Regia, the senate has therefore decreed with reference to that matter, that Marcus Antonius the consul should make expiation to Jupiter and Mars with full-grown victims, and with unweaned victims to such of the other gods as he thought proper. They decided that it should be regarded as sufficient for him to have sacrificed with these. If there should be any need of additional victims, the additional offerings should be made with red victims.”</p>
<p>Inasmuch as the senate called some victims <span class="italic">succidaneae,</span> it is often inquired what that word means.
