<p>That for what we commonly call <span class="italic">vivaria</span> the earlier writers did not use that term; and what Publius Scipio used for this word in his speech to the people, and afterwards Marcus Varro in his work <span class="italic">On Farming</span>.</p>
<p><span class="sc">In</span> the third book of his treatise <span class="italic">On Farming</span>.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_177_1" id="target_note_LCL195_177_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Marcus Varro says that the name <span class="italic">leporaria</span> is given to certain enclosures, now called <span class="italic">vivaria</span>, in which wild animals are kept alive and fed. I have appended Varro’s own words: “There are three means of keeping animals on the farm—bird houses, <span class="italic">leporaria</span> (warrens), and fish-ponds. I am now using the term <span class="italic">ornithones</span> of all kinds of birds that are ordinarily kept within the walls of the farmhouse. <span class="italic">Leporaria</span> I wish you to understand, not in the sense in which our remote ancestors used the word, of places in which only hares are kept, but of all enclosures which are connected with a farmhouse and contain live animals that are fed.” Farther on in the same book Varro writes:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_177_2" id="target_note_LCL195_177_2"><sup>2</sup></a> “When you bought the farm at Tusculum from Marcus Piso, there were many wild boars in the <span class="italic">leporarium</span>.”</p>
<p>But the word <span class="italic">vivaria</span>, which the common people now use—the Greek παρὰδέισοι<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_177_3" id="target_note_LCL195_177_3"><sup>3</sup></a> and Varro’s <span class="italic">leporaria</span>—I
do not recall meeting anywhere in the older literature. But as to the word <span class="italic">roboraria</span>, which we find in the writings of Scipio, who used the purest diction of any man of his time, I have heard several learned men at Rome assert that this means what we call <span class="italic">vivaria</span> and that the name came from the “oaken” planks of which the enclosures were made, a kind of enclosure which we see in many places in Italy. This is the passage
