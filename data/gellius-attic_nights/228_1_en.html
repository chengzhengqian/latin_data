<p>Accordingly, when they had given the names <span class="italic">Iovis</span> and <span class="italic">Diovis</span> from <span class="italic">iuvare</span> (help), they applied a name of the contrary meaning to that god who had, not the power to help, but the force to do harm—for
some gods they worshipped in order to gain their favour, others they propitiated in order to avert their hostility; and they called him <span class="italic">Vediovis,</span> thus taking away and denying his power to give help. For the particle <span class="italic">ve</span> which appears in different forms in different words, now being spelled with these two letters and now with an <span class="italic">a</span> inserted between the two, has two meanings which also differ from each other. For <span class="italic">ve,</span> like very many other particles, has the effect either of weakening or of strengthening the force of a word; and it therefore happens that some words to which that particle is prefixed are ambiguous<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_415_1" id="target_note_LCL195_415_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and may be used with either force, such as <span class="italic">vescus</span> (small), <span class="italic">vemens</span> (mighty), and <span class="italic">vegrandis</span> (very small),<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_415_2" id="target_note_LCL195_415_2"><sup>2</sup></a> a point which I have discussed elsewhere<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_415_3" id="target_note_LCL195_415_3"><sup>3</sup></a> in greater detail. But <span class="italic">vesanus</span> and <span class="italic">vecordes</span> are used with only one of the meanings of <span class="italic">ve,</span> namely, the privative or negative force, which the Greeks call κατὰ στέρησιν.</p>
<p>It is for this reason that the statue of the god Vediovis, which is in the temple of which I spoke above, holds arrows, which, as everyone knows, are devised to inflict harm. For that reason it has often been said that that god is Apollo; and a she-goat is sacrificed to him in the customary fashion,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_415_4a" id="target_note_LCL195_415_4a"><sup>4</sup></a>

or, in an active sense, “make small” (Lucr. i. 326); Walde derives it from <span class="italic">vescor</span> in the sense of “eating away, corroding” (Lucr. i. 326) and from <span class="italic">ve-escus</span> in the sense of “small.”
