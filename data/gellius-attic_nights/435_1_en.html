thieves of every kind, nor yet too lax leniency. For they permitted<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_345_1" id="target_note_LCL200_345_1"><sup>1</sup></a> a thief who was caught in the act to be put to death, only if it was night when he committed the theft, or if in the daytime he defended himself with a weapon when taken. But other thieves taken in the act, if they were freemen, the decemvirs ordered to be scourged and handed over<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_345_2" id="target_note_LCL200_345_2"><sup>2</sup></a> to the one from whom the theft had been made, provided they had committed the theft in daylight and had not defended themselves with a weapon. Slaves taken in the act were to be scourged and hurled from the rock,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_345_3" id="target_note_LCL200_345_3"><sup>3</sup></a> but they decided that boys under age should be flogged at the discretion of the praetor and the damage which they had done made good.

<p>But to-day we have departed from that law of the decemvirs; for if anyone wishes to try a case of manifest theft by process of law, action is brought for four times the value. But “manifest theft,” says Masurius,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_345_5" id="target_note_LCL200_345_5"><sup>5</sup></a> “is one which is detected while it is being committed. The act is completed when the stolen object is carried to its destination.” When stolen goods are found in possession of the thief (<span class="italic">concepti</span>) or in that of another (<span class="italic">oblati</span>), the penalty is threefold.</p>
<p>But one who wishes to learn what <span class="italic">oblatum</span> means, and <span class="italic">conceptum</span>, and many other particulars of the same kind taken from the admirable customs of our forefathers, and both useful and agreeable to know, will consult the book of Sabinus entitled <span class="italic">On Thefts</span>.
