He says that the physicians who use music as a remedy declare that the veins of men, or rather their arteries, are set in motion according to the number seven,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_273_1" id="target_note_LCL195_273_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and this treatment they call τὴν διὰ τεσσάρων συμφωνίαν,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_273_2" id="target_note_LCL195_273_2"><sup>2</sup></a> because it results from the harmony of four tones. He also believes that the periods of danger in diseases have greater violence on the days which are made up of the number seven, and that those days in particular seem to be, as the physicians call them, κρισίμοι or “critical”; namely, the first, second and third hebdomad. And Varro does not fail to mention a fact which adds to the power and influence of the number seven, namely, that those who resolve to die of starvation do not meet their end until the seventh day.</p>
<p>These remarks of Varro about the number seven show painstaking investigation. But he has also brought together in the same place others which are rather trifling: for example, that there are seven wonderful works in the world, that the sages of old were seven, that the usual number of rounds in the races in the circus is seven, and that seven champions were chosen to attack Thebes. Then he adds in that book the further information that he has entered upon the twelfth hebdomad of his age, and that up to that day he has completed seventy hebdomads of books,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_273_3" id="target_note_LCL195_273_3"><sup>3</sup></a> of which a considerable number were destroyed when his library was plundered, at the time of his proscription.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_273_4a" id="target_note_LCL195_273_4a"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
