and drank flat and spoiled wine: “This Roman knight,” said he, “eats <span class="italic">apluda</span> and drinks <span class="italic">flocces.</span>” All who were present looked at one another, at first somewhat seriously, with a disturbed and inquiring aspect, wondering what in the world the two words meant; then presently they all burst into a laugh, as if he had said something in Etruscan or Gallic. Now that man had read that the farmers of ancient days called the chaff of grain <span class="italic">apluda</span>, and that the word was used by Plautus in the comedy entitled <span class="italic">Astraba</span>,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_317_1" id="target_note_LCL200_317_1"><sup>1</sup></a> if that play be the work of Plautus. He had also heard that <span class="italic">flocces</span> in the early language meant the lees of wine pressed from the skins of grapes, corresponding to the dregs of oil from olives. This he had read in the <span class="italic">Polumeni</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_317_2" id="target_note_LCL200_317_2"><sup>2</sup></a> of Caecilius,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_317_3" id="target_note_LCL200_317_3"><sup>3</sup></a> and he had saved up those two words as ornaments for his speeches.</p>

How long, pray, shall this <span class="italic">bovinator</span> delay me?” And he bawled it out three or four times in a loud voice: “He is a <span class="italic">bovinator.</span>” A murmur began to arise from many of those who were present, as if in wonder at this monster of a word. But he, waving his arms and gesticulating, cried: “What, haven’t you read Lucilius, who calls a shuffler <span class="italic">bovinator</span>?” And, in fact, this verse occurs in Lucilius’ eleventh book:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_317_4" id="target_note_LCL200_317_4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line indent1">If trifling shuffler (<span class="italic">bovinator</span>) with abusive tongue.</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
