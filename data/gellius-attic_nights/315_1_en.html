in the thirty-fourth book of his Digests and the second of his <span class="italic">Miscellanies,</span> says:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_105_1" id="target_note_LCL200_105_1"><sup>1</sup></a> “In a treaty which was made between the Roman people and the Carthaginians
the provision is found, that the Carthaginians
should pay each year to the Roman people a certain weight of <span class="italic">argenti puri puti</span>, and the meaning of <span class="italic">puri puti</span> was asked. I replied,” he says, “that <span class="italic">putus</span> meant ‘very pure,’ just as we say <span class="italic">novicius</span> for <span class="italic">novus</span> (new) and <span class="italic">propicius</span> for <span class="italic">proprius</span> (proper), when we wish to augment and amplify the meaning of <span class="italic">novus</span> and <span class="italic">proprius</span>.”</p>
<p>Upon reading this, I was surprised that Alfenus should think that the relation of <span class="italic">purus</span> and <span class="italic">putus</span> was the same as that of <span class="italic">novicius</span> and novus; for if the word were <span class="italic">puricius</span>, then it would indeed appear to be formed like <span class="italic">novicius</span>. It was also surprising that he thought that <span class="italic">novicius</span> was used to imply amplification,
since in fact <span class="italic">novicius</span> does not mean “more new,” but is merely a derivative and variant of <span class="italic">novus</span>. Accordingly, I agree with those who think that <span class="italic">putus</span> is derived from <span class="italic">puto</span> and therefore pronounce
the word with the first syllable short, not long as Alfenus seems to have thought it, since he wrote that <span class="italic">putus</span> came from <span class="italic">purus</span>. Moreover, the earlier writers used <span class="italic">putare</span> of removing and pruning away from anything whatever was superfluous and unnecessary, or even injurious and foreign, leaving only what seemed useful and without blemish. For that was the meaning of <span class="italic">putare</span>, “to prune,” as applied to trees and vines, and so too as used of accounts.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_105_2" id="target_note_LCL200_105_2"><sup>2</sup></a> The verb <span class="italic">puto</span> itself also, which we use for the purpose of stating our opinion, certainly means nothing else than that in an obscure and difficult matter we do our best, by cutting away and lopping
