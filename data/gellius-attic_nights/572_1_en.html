<p>Suetonius Tranquillus writes<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL212_73_1" id="target_note_LCL212_73_1"><sup>1</sup></a> that this same Bassus was put in charge of the eastern provinces by Mark Antony, and that when the Parthians invaded Syria he routed them in three battles;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL212_73_2" id="target_note_LCL212_73_2"><sup>2</sup></a> that he was the first of all to celebrate a triumph over the Parthians, and was honoured when he died with a public funeral.</p>

<p>That the verb <span class="italic">profligo</span> is used by many improperly and ignorantly.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Just</span> as many other words, through the ignorance and stupidity of those who speak badly what they do not understand, are diverted and turned aside from their proper and usual meaning, so too has the signification of the verb <span class="italic">profligo</span> been changed and perverted. For while it is taken over and derived from <span class="italic">adfligo</span>, in the sense of “bring to ruin and destruction,” and while all who have been careful in their diction have always used the word to express “waste” and “destroy,” calling things that were cast down and destroyed <span class="italic">res profligatae</span>, I now hear that buildings, temples, and many other things that are almost complete and finished are said to be <span class="italic">in profligate</span> and the things themselves <span class="italic">profligata.</span> Therefore that was a very witty reply, as Sulpicius Apollinaris has recorded in one of his <span class="italic">Letters</span>, which a praetor, a man not without learning, made to a simpleton among a crowd of advocates.
