<p>That neither <span class="italic">testamentum</span>, as Servius Sulpicius thought, nor <span class="italic">sacellum</span>, as Gaius Trebatus believed, is a compound, but the former is an extended form of <span class="italic">testatio</span>, the latter a diminutive of <span class="italic">sacrum</span>.</p>
<p>I <span class="sc">do</span> not understand what reason led Servius Sulpicius the jurist, the most learned man of his time, to write in the second book of his work <span class="italic">On the Annulling of Sacred Rites</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_123_1" id="target_note_LCL200_123_1"><sup>1</sup></a> that <span class="italic">testamentum</span> is a compound
word; for he declared that it was made up of <span class="italic">mentis contestatio</span>, or “an attesting of the mind.” What then are we to say about <span class="italic">calciamentum</span> (shoe), <span class="italic">paludamentum</span> (cloak), <span class="italic">pavimentum</span> (pavement), <span class="italic">vestimentum</span>
(clothing), and thousands of other words that have been extended by a suffix of that kind? Are we to call all these also compounds? As a matter of fact, Servius, or whoever it was who first made the statement, was evidently misled by a notion of the presence of <span class="italic">mens</span> in <span class="italic">testamentum,</span> an idea that is to be sure false, but neither inappropriate nor unattractive, just as indeed Gaius Trebatius too was misled into a similar attractive combination. For he says in the second book of his work <span class="italic">On Religions:</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_123_2" id="target_note_LCL200_123_2"><sup>2</sup></a> “A <span class="italic">sacellum,</span> or ‘shrine,’ is a small place consecrated to a god and containing an altar.” Then he adds these words: “<span class="italic">Sacellum,</span> I think, is made up of the two words <span class="italic">sacer</span> and <span class="italic">cella</span>, as if it were <span class="italic">sacra cella</span>, or ‘a sacred chamber.’” This indeed is what Trebatius wrote, but who does not know both that <span class="italic">sacellum</span> is not a compound, and that it is not made up of <span class="italic">sacer</span> and <span class="italic">cella</span>, but is the diminutive of <span class="italic">sacrum?</span></p>
