for the most part used <span class="italic">superesse</span> in the sense of “to overflow, be superfluous, or exceed the required amount.” Thus Marcus Varro, in the satire entitled “<span class="italic">You know not what evening may bring</span>”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_99_1" id="target_note_LCL195_99_1"><sup>1</sup></a> uses <span class="italic">superfuisse</span> in the sense of having exceeded the amount proper for the occasion. These are his words: “Not everything should be read at a dinner party, but preferably such works as are at the same time improving and diverting, so that this feature of the entertainment also may seem not to have been neglected, rather than overdone.”</p>
<p>I remember happening to be present in the court of a praetor who was a man of learning, and that on that occasion an advocate of some repute pleaded in such fashion that he wandered from the subject and did not touch upon the point at issue. Thereupon the praetor said to the man whose case was before him: “You have no counsel.” And when the pleader protested, saying “I am present (<span class="italic">supersum</span>) for the honourable gentleman,” the praetor wittily retorted: “You surely present too much, but you do not represent your client.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_99_2" id="target_note_LCL195_99_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Marcus Cicero, too, in his book entitled <span class="italic">On Reducing
the Civil Law to a System</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_99_3" id="target_note_LCL195_99_3"><sup>3</sup></a> wrote these words: “Indeed Quintus Aelius Tubero did not fall short of his predecessors in knowledge of the law, in learning he even outstripped them.” In this passage <span class="italic">superfuit</span>
seems to mean “he went beyond, surpassed and excelled his predecessors in his learning, which, however, was excessive and overabundant”;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_99_4" id="target_note_LCL195_99_4"><sup>4</sup></a> for Tubero was thoroughly versed in Stoic dialectics.
