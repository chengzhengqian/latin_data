books of the priests of the Roman people, as well as in many early books of prayers. In these we find: “Lua,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_481_1a" id="target_note_LCL200_481_1a"><sup>1</sup></a> of Saturn; Salacia, of Neptune; Hora, of Quirinus;
the Virites of Quirinus; Maia of Vulcan; Heries of Juno; Moles of Mars, and Nerio of Mars.” Of these I hear most people pronounce the one which I have put last with a long initial syllable, as the Greeks pronounce Νηρεΐδες (“Nereids”). But those who have spoken correctly made the first syllable short and lengthened the third. For the nominative case of the word, as it is written in the books of early writers, is <span class="italic">Nerio</span>, although Marcus Varro, in his <span class="italic">Menippean Satire</span> entitled Σκιομαχία, or “Battle of the Shadows,” uses in the vocative <span class="italic">Nerienes</span>, not <span class="italic">Nerio</span>, in the following verses:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_481_2" id="target_note_LCL200_481_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line indent1">Thee, Anna and Peranna, Panda Cela, Pales,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent1">Nerienes and Minerva, Fortune and likewise Ceres.</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">From which it necessarily follows that the nominative case is the same. But <span class="italic">Nerio</span> was declined by our forefathers like <span class="italic">Anio</span>;for, as they said <span class="italic">Aniēnem</span> with the third syllable long, so they did <span class="italic">Neriēiem</span>. Furthermore, that word, whether it be <span class="italic">Nerio</span> or <span class="italic">Nerienes,</span> is Sabine and signifies valour and courage. Hence among the Claudii, who we are told sprang from the Sabines, whoever was of eminent and surpassing courage was called <span class="italic">Nero.</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_481_3" id="target_note_LCL200_481_3"><sup>3</sup></a> But the Sabines

Gellius is apparently right in his explanation
of Nerio in §§ 7–10, while later myths made her the wife of Mars. Lua (cf. <span class="italic">luo,</span> “purify”), according to Livy xlv. 33. 2, was a goddess to whom, in company with Mars and Minerva, the captured arms of an enemy were devoted when they were burned by the victors. Salacia (cf. <span class="italic">sal</span>, “salt one”) was a sea-goddess. Hora, according to Nonius, p. 120, was a goddess of youth. Ovid, <span class="italic">Met</span>. xiv. 830–851,
say’s that it was the name given to Hersilia, the wife of Romulus, after her deification.
