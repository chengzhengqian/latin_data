<p>It seemed to many that there was an error in the last word. For they thought that <span class="italic">futuram</span> should be written instead of <span class="italic">futurum</span>, and they were sure that the book ought to be corrected, lest like the adulterer in the comedy of Plautus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_37_1" id="target_note_LCL195_37_1"><sup>1</sup></a>—for so they jested about the error which they thought they had found—this solecism in an oration of Cicero’s should be “caught in the act.”</p>
<p>There chanced to be present there a friend of mine, who had become an expert from wide reading and to whom almost all the older literature had been the object of study, meditation and wakeful nights. He, on examining the book, declared that there was no mistake in writing or grammar in that word, but that Cicero had written correctly and in accordance with early usage. “For <span class="italic">futurum</span> is not,” said he, “to be taken with <span class="italic">rem</span>, as hasty and careless readers think, nor is it used as a participle. It is an infinitive, the kind of word which the Greeks call ἀπαρέμφατος or ‘indeterminate,’ affected neither by number nor gender, but altogether free and independent, such a word as Gaius Gracchus used in the speech entitled <span class="italic">On Publius Popilius, delivered in the places of assembly</span>,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_37_2a" id="target_note_LCL195_37_2a"><sup>2</sup></a> in which we read: ‘I suppose that my enemies will say this.’ He said <span class="italic">dicturum</span>, not <span class="italic">dicturos</span>; and is it not clear that <span class="italic">dicturum</span> in Gracchus is used according to the same principle
