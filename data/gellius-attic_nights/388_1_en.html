Dialis, except for a sacred rite; if a person in fetters enter his house, he must be loosed, the bonds must be drawn up through the <span class="italic">impluvium</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_251_1" id="target_note_LCL200_251_1"><sup>1</sup></a> to the roof and from there let down into the street. He has no knot in his head-dress, girdle, or any other part of his dress; if anyone is being taken to be flogged and falls at his feet as a suppliant, it is unlawful for the man to be flogged on that day.
