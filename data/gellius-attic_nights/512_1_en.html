of countenance by the rhythmical accumulation of several words. Cicero says:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_499_1" id="target_note_LCL200_499_1"><sup>1</sup></a> ‘Finally, your whole countenance, which is, so to speak, the silent voice of the mind, this it was that incited men to crime, this deceived, tricked, cheated those to whom it was not familiar.’ Well then,” continued Favorinus, “is the use of <span class="italic">praeda</span> and <span class="italic">manubiae</span> in the same writer similar to this? Truly, not at all! For by the addition of <span class="italic">manubiae</span> the sentence does not become more ornate, more forcible, or more euphonius; but <span class="italic">manubiae</span> means one thing, as we learn from the books on antiquities and on the early Latin, <span class="italic">praeda</span> quite another. For <span class="italic">praeda</span> is used of the actual objects making up the booty, but <span class="italic">manubiae</span> designates the money collected by the quaestor from the sale of the booty.

<p>“Therefore this inscription which you see, <span class="italic">ex manubiis</span>, does not designate the objects and the mass of booty itself, for none of these was taken from the enemy by Trajan, but it declares that these statues were made and procured ‘from the <span class="italic">manubiae</span>,’ that is, with the money derived from the sale of the booty. For <span class="italic">manubiae</span> means, as I have already said, not booty, but money collected from the sale of the booty by a quaestor of the Roman people. But when I said ‘by the quaestor,’ one ought now to understand that the praefect of the treasury is meant. For the charge of the treasury has been transferred from the quaestors to praefects.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_499_2" id="target_note_LCL200_499_2"><sup>2</sup></a> However, it is possible to find instances in which
