<span class="line indent1">And that my wife makes me by looks and acts:</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent1">If I kept still, I should betray myself</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent1">No less. And she has all that you would wish</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent1">She had not, save the dowry that she brought.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent1">Let him who’s wise a lesson take from me,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent1">Who, like a free man captive to the foe,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent1">Am slave, though town and citadel are safe.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent1">What! wish her safe who steals whate’er I prize?</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent1">While longing for her death, a living corpse am I.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent1">She says I’ve secret converse with our maid—</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent1">That’s what she said, and so belaboured me</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent1">With tears, with prayers, with importunities,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent1">That I did sell the wench. Now, I suppose,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent1">She blabs like this to neighbours and to friends:</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent1">“Which one of you, when in the bloom of youth,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent1">Could from her husband win what I from mine</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent1">Have gained, who’ve robbed him of his concubine.” </span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent1">Thus they, while I, poor wretch, am torn to</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">shreds.</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p>Now, not to mention the charm of subject matter and diction, which is by no means the same in the two books, I notice this general fact—that some of Menander’s lines, brilliant, apt and witty, Caecilius has not attempted to reproduce, even where he might have done so; but he has passed them by as if they were of no value, and has dragged in some other farcical stuff; and what Menander took from actual life, simple, realistic and delightful, this for some reason or other Caecilius has missed. For example, that same old husband, talking with another old man, a neighbour of his, and cursing the arrogance of his rich wife, says:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_197_1" id="target_note_LCL195_197_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
