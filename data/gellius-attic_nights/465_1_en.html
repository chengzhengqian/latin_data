encircles all lands on every side?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_405_1" id="target_note_LCL200_405_1"><sup>1</sup></a> For that which is ‘on this side’ of a thing, is outside of that thing; but how can that be said to be’ within’ which is without? But if the ocean were only on one side of the world, then the land in that part might be said to be ‘this side the ocean,’ or ‘before the ocean.’ But since the ocean surrounds all lands completely and everywhere, nothing is on this side of it, but, all lands being walled in by the embrace of its waters, everything which is included within its shore is in its midst, just as in truth the sun moves, not on this side of the heavens, but within and in them.”</p>
<p>At the time, what Sulpicius Apollinaris said seemed to be learned and acute. But later, in a volume of <span class="italic">Letters to Servius Sulpicius</span> by Marcus Tullius, I found “within moderation” (<span class="italic">intra modum</span>) used in the same sense that those give to “within the Kalends” who mean to say “this side of the Kalends.” These are the words of Cicero, which I quote:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_405_2" id="target_note_LCL200_405_2"><sup>2</sup></a> “But yet since I have avoided the displeasure of Caesar, who would perhaps think that I did not regard the present government as constitutional if I kept silence altogether, I shall do this<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_405_3" id="target_note_LCL200_405_3"><sup>3</sup></a> moderately, or even less than moderately (<span class="italic">intra modum</span>), so as to consult both his wishes and my own desires.” He first said “I shall do this moderately,” that is, to a fair and temperate degree; then, as if this expression did not please him and he wished to correct it, he added “or even within moderation,” thus indicating that he would do it to a less extent than might be considered moderate; that is, not up to the very limit, but somewhat short of, or “on this side of” the limit.</p>
