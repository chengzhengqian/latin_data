<p class="noindent">And in his seventh book:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_205_1" id="target_note_LCL200_205_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line indent1">Who loves you, and who to your youth and charms</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">(<span class="italic">facie</span>),</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent1">Plays courtier, promising to be your friend.</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">However, there are not a few who read <span class="italic">facii</span> in both these passages of Lucilius. But Gaius Caesar, in the second book of his treatise <span class="italic">On Analogy,</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_205_2" id="target_note_LCL200_205_2"><sup>2</sup></a> thinks that we should use <span class="italic">die</span> and <span class="italic">specie</span> as genitive forms.</p>
<p>I have also found <span class="italic">die</span> in the genitive case in a manuscript of Sallust’s <span class="italic">Jugurtha</span> of the utmost trustworthiness
and of venerable age. These were the words:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_205_3" id="target_note_LCL200_205_3"><sup>3</sup></a> “when scarcely a tenth part of the day (<span class="italic">die</span>) was left.” For I do not think we ought to accept such a quibble as the assertion that <span class="italic">die</span> is used for <span class="italic">ex die.</span></p>

<p>On the kind of debate which the Greeks call ἄπορος.</p>
<p><span class="sc">With</span> the rhetorician Antonius Julianus I had withdrawn to Naples during the season of the summer
holidays, wishing to escape the heat of Home. And there was there at the time a young man of the richer class studying with tutors in both languages, and trying to gain a command of Latin eloquence in order to plead at the bar in Rome; and he begged Julianus to hear one of his declamations. Julianus went to hear him and I went along with him. The young fellow entered the room, made some preliminary
remarks in a more arrogant and presumptuous
style than became his years, and then asked that subjects for debate be given him.</p>
