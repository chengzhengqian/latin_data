If he does not satisfy the judgment, or unless someone in the presence of the magistrate, intervenes as a surety, let the creditor take him home and fasten him in stocks or in fetters. Let him fasten him with not less than fifteen pounds weight, or if he wish, with more.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL212_425_1" id="target_note_LCL212_425_1"><sup>1</sup></a> If the prisoner wishes, he may live at his own expense.
