final observation could not be completed, but that men could not see them because of their remarkable brilliance or altitude. “For,” said he, “some stars are visible from certain lands and are known to the men of those lands; but those same stars are not visible from every other land and are wholly unknown to other men. And granting,” said he, “both that only these stars ought to be observed, and that too from one part of the earth, what possible end was there to such observation, and what periods of time seemed sufficient for understanding what the conjunction or the orbits or the transits of the stars foretold? For if an observation was made in the beginning in such a manner that it was calculated under what aspect, arrangement and position of the stars anyone was born, and if thereafter his fortune from the beginning of his life, his character, his disposition, the circumstances of his affairs and activities, and finally also the end of his life were noted, and all these things as they had actually happened were committed to writing, and long afterwards, when the same stars were in the same aspect and position, it was supposed that those same things would happen to others who had been born at that same time;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL212_9_1a" id="target_note_LCL212_9_1a"><sup>1</sup></a> if the first observations were made in that way,” said he, “and from such observations a kind of science was formed, it can by no means be a success.
