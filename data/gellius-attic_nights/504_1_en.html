seem to have derived this word from the Greeks, who call the sinews and ligaments of the limbs νεῦρα, whence we also in Latin call them <span class="italic">nervi</span>. Therefore <span class="italic">Nerio</span> designates the strength and power of Mars and a certain majesty of the War-god.</p>
<p>Plautus, however, in the <span class="italic">Truculentus</span> says<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_483_1" id="target_note_LCL200_483_1"><sup>1</sup></a> that Nerio is the wife of Mars, and puts the statement into the mouth of a soldier, in the following line:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line indent1">Mars, coming home, greets his wife Nerio.</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p>About this line I once heard a man of some repute say that Plautus, with too great an eye to comic effect, attributed this strange and false idea, of thinking that Nerio was the wife of Mars, to an ignorant and rude soldier. But whoever will read the third book of the <span class="italic">Annals</span> of Gnaeus Gellius will find that this passage shows learning, rather than a comic spirit; for there it is written that Hersilia, when she pleaded before Titus Tatius and begged for peace, prayed in these words:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_483_2" id="target_note_LCL200_483_2"><sup>2</sup></a> “Neria of Mars, I beseech thee, give us peace; I beseech thee that it be permitted us to enjoy lasting and happy marriages, since it was by thy lord’s advice that in like manner they carried off us maidens,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_483_3" id="target_note_LCL200_483_3"><sup>3</sup></a> that from us they might raise up children for themselves and their people, and descendants for their country.” She says “by thy lord’s advice,” of course meaning her husband, Mars;
and from this it is plain that Plautus made use of no poetic fiction, but that there was also a tradition according to which Nerio was said by some to be the wife of Mars. But it must be noticed besides that Gellius writes <span class="italic">Neria</span> with an <span class="italic">a</span>, not <span class="italic">Nerio</span> nor <span class="italic">Nerienes.</span> In addition to Plautus too, and Gellius, Licinius
