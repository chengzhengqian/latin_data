<p class="noindent">although he might have said <span class="italic">ebrio</span>, and used <span class="italic">acinum</span> in the neuter gender, as was more usual, nevertheless
through love of the melody of that Homeric hiatus he said <span class="italic">ebria</span>, because it blended with the following
<span class="italic">a</span>. But those who think that Catullus wrote <span class="italic">ebriosa</span> or <span class="italic">ebrioso</span>—for that incorrect reading is also found—have unquestionably happened upon editions copied from corrupt texts.</p>

<p>Why it is that the phrases <span class="italic">quoad vivet</span> and <span class="italic">quoad morietur</span> indicate the very same time, although based upon opposite things.</p>
<p><span class="sc">When</span> the expressions <span class="italic">quoad vivet</span>, or “so long as he shall live,” and <span class="italic">quoad morietur</span>, or “until he shall die,” are used, two opposite things really seem to be said, but the two expressions indicate one and the same time. Also when we say “as long as the senate shall be in session,” and “until the senate shall adjourn,” although “be in session” and “adjourn” 
are opposites, yet one and the same idea is expressed by both phrases. For when two periods of time are opposed to each other and yet are so connected that the end of one coincides with the beginning of the other, it makes no difference whether the exact point of their meeting is designated
by the end of the first period or the beginning of the second.</p>
