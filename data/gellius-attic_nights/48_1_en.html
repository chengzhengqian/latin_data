attack began. The Argives and their allies rushed forward eagerly and in a rage, but the Lacedaemonians advanced slowly to the music of many flute-players
stationed at regular intervals; this not for any religious reason, but in order that they might make the attack while marching together rhythmically, and that their ranks might not be broken, which commonly happens to great armies when they advance to the attack.”</p>
<p>Tradition has it that the Cretans also commonly entered battle with the lyre playing before them and regulating their step. Futhermore, Alyattes, king of the land of Lydia, a man of barbaric manners and luxury, when he made war on the Milesians, as Herodotus tells us in his <span class="italic">History</span>,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_55_1" id="target_note_LCL195_55_1"><sup>1</sup></a> had in his army and his battle-array orchestras of pipe-and
lyre-players, and even female flute-players, such as are the delight of wanton banqueters. Homer, however, says<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_55_2" id="target_note_LCL195_55_2"><sup>2</sup></a> that the Achaeans entered battle, relying, not on the music of lyres and pipes, but on silent harmony and unanimity of spirit:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line indent1">In silence came the Achaeans, breathing rage,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent1">Resolved in mind on one another’s aid.</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p>What then is the meaning of that soul-stirring shout of the Roman soldiers which, as the annalists have told us, was regularly raised when charging the foe?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_55_3" id="target_note_LCL195_55_3"><sup>3</sup></a> Was that done contrary to so generally accepted a rule of old-time discipline? Or are a quiet advance and silence needful when an army is marching against an enemy that is far off and visible from a distance, but when they have almost come to blows, then must the foe, already at close quarters, be driven back by a violent assault and terrified by shouting?</p>
