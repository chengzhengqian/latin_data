fine is that of one sheep. The “supreme” fine is of that number which we have mentioned, beyond which it is not lawful to impose a fine for a period of successive days;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_301_1" id="target_note_LCL200_301_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and for that reason it is called “supreme,” that is, greatest and heaviest.</p>
<p>When therefore even now, according to ancient usage, either the “smallest” or the “supreme” fine is pronounced by Roman magistrates, it is regularly
observed that <span class="italic">oves</span> (“sheep”) be given the masculine gender; and Marcus Varro has thus recorded the words of the law by which the smallest fine was pronounced:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_301_2" id="target_note_LCL200_301_2"><sup>2</sup></a> “Against Marcus Terentius, since, though summoned, he has neither appeared nor been excused, I pronounce a fine of one sheep (<span class="italic">unum ovem</span>)”; and they declared that the fine did not appear to be legal unless that gender was used.
Furthermore, Marcus Varro, in the twenty-first book of his <span class="italic">Human Antiquities</span>, also says<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_301_3" id="target_note_LCL200_301_3"><sup>3</sup></a> that the word for fine (<span class="italic">multa</span>) is itself not Latin, but Sabine, and he remarks that it endured even to within his own memory in the speech of the Samnites, who are sprung from the Sabines. But the upstart herd of grammarians have asserted that this word, like some others, is used on the principle of opposites.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_301_4" id="target_note_LCL200_301_4"><sup>4</sup></a> Furthermore, since it is a usage and custom in language for us to say even now, as the greater number of the early men did, <span class="italic">multam dixit</span> and <span class="italic">multa dicta est,</span> I have thought it not out of place to note that Marcus Cato spoke otherwise.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_301_5" id="target_note_LCL200_301_5"><sup>5</sup></a> For in the fourth book of his <span class="italic">Origins</span> are these words: “Our commander, if anyone has gone to battle out of order, imposes (<span class="italic">facit</span>) a fine upon him.” But it may seem that Cato changed the word with an eye to propriety, since the fine was imposed in camp
