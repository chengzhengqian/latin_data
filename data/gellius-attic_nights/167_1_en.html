<p>Furthermore, besides what I have read in books about human gestation, I also heard of the following case, which occurred in Rome: A woman of good and honourable character, of undoubted chastity, gave birth to a child in the eleventh month after her husband’s death, and because of the reckoning of the time the accusation was made that she had conceived after the death of her husband, since the decemvirs had written<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_293_1" id="target_note_LCL195_293_1"><sup>1</sup></a> that a child is born in ten months and not in the eleventh month. The deified Hadrian, however, having heard the case, decided that birth might also occur in the eleventh month, and I myself have read the actual decree with regard to the matter. In that decree Hadrian declares that he makes his decision after looking up the views of the ancient philosophers and physicians.</p>
<p>This very day I chanced to read these words in a satire of Marcus Varro’s entitled <span class="italic">The Will</span>:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_293_2" id="target_note_LCL195_293_2"><sup>2</sup></a> “If one or more sons shall be born to me in ten months, let them be disinherited, if they are asses in music;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_293_3" id="target_note_LCL195_293_3"><sup>3</sup></a> but if one be born to me in the eleventh month, according to Aristotle,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_293_4" id="target_note_LCL195_293_4"><sup>4</sup></a> let Attius have the same rights under my will as Tettius.” Just as it used commonly to be said of things that did not differ from each other, “let Attius be as Tettius,” so Varro means by this old proverb that children born in ten months and in eleven are to have the same and equal rights.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_293_5" id="target_note_LCL195_293_5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>But if it is a fact that gestation cannot be prolonged beyond the tenth month, it is pertinent to ask why Homer wrote that Neptune said to a girl whom he had just violated:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_293_6" id="target_note_LCL195_293_6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
