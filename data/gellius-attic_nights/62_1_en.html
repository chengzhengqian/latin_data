by rule. For the word <span class="italic">mille</span> does not stand for the Greek χιλιοι, “thousand,” but for χιλιάς, “a thousand”; and just as they say one χιλιός, or two χιλιάδες, so we say one thousand and two thousands according to a definite and regular rule. Therefore these common expressions are correct and good usage, “There is a thousand of denarii in the chest,” and “There is a thousand of horsemen in the army.” Furthermore Lucilius, in addition to the example cited above, makes this point still clearer in another place also: for in his fifteenth book he says:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_83_1" id="target_note_LCL195_83_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line indent2">This horse no jolting fine Campanian steed,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">Though he has passed him by one thousand, aye</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">And twain, of paces, can in a longer course</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">Compete with, but he will in fact appear</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">To run the other way.</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">So too in the ninth book:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_83_2" id="target_note_LCL195_83_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line indent2">With sesterces a thousand you can gain</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">A hundred thousand.</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">Lucilius wrote <span class="italic">milli passum</span> instead of <span class="italic">mille passibus</span> and <span class="italic">uno milli nummum</span> for <span class="italic">unis mille nummis,</span> thus showing clearly that <span class="italic">mille</span> is a noun, used in the singular number, that its plural is <span class="italic">milia,</span> and that it also forms an ablative case. Nor ought we to expect the rest of the cases; for there are many other words which are declined only in single cases, and even some which are not declined at all. Therefore we can no longer doubt that Cicero, in the speech which he wrote <span class="italic">In Defence of Milo,</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_83_3" id="target_note_LCL195_83_3"><sup>3</sup></a> used these words: “Before the estate of Clodius, where fully a thousand of able-
