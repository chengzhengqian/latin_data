<p>We should be inclined to doubt whether the epitaph of Plautus was really by his own hand, if it had not been quoted by Marcus Varro in the first book of his work <span class="italic">On Poets</span>:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_109_4" id="target_note_LCL195_109_4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
