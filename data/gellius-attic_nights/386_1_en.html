part of the men.” Marcus Cato, in his speech <span class="italic">On the property of Florius</span> has written as follows:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_247_1" id="target_note_LCL200_247_1"><sup>1</sup></a> “There she acted like a harlot, she went from the banquet straight to the couch and with a part of them (<span class="italic">cum partim illorum</span>) she often conducted herself in the same manner.” The less educated, however, read <span class="italic">cum parti,</span> as if <span class="italic">partim</span> were declined as a noun, not used as an adverb.</p>
<p>But Quintus Claudius, in the twenty-first book of his <span class="italic">Annals</span>, has used this figure in a somewhat less usual manner; he says: “For with the part of the forces (<span class="italic">cum partim copiis</span>) of young men that was pleasing to him.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_247_2" id="target_note_LCL200_247_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Also in the twenty-third book of the <span class="italic">Annals</span> of Claudius are these words:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_247_3" id="target_note_LCL200_247_3"><sup>3</sup></a> “But that I therefore acted thus, but whether to say that it happened from the negligence of a part of the magistrates (<span class="italic">neglegentia partim magistratum</span>), from avarice, or from the calamity of the Roman people, I know not.”</p>

<p>In what connection Cato said <span class="italic">iniuria mihi factum itur.</span></p>
<p>I <span class="sc">hear</span> the phrase <span class="italic">illi iniuriam factum iri,</span> or “injury will be done to him,” I hear <span class="italic">contumeliam dictum iri,</span> or “insult will be offered,” commonly so used everywhere, and I notice that this form of expression is a general one; I therefore refrain from citing examples. But <span class="italic">coniumelia illi</span> or <span class="italic">iniuria factum itur,</span> “injury or insult is going to be offered him,” is somewhat less common, and therefore I shall give an example of that.
