<p>Why the bowels are loosened by sudden terror; also why fire provokes urine.</p>
<p><span class="sc">There</span> is a work of Aristotle, entitled <span class="italic">Physical Questions</span>, which is most delightful, and filled with choice knowledge of all kinds. In this book he inquires<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL212_361_1" id="target_note_LCL212_361_1"><sup>1</sup></a> why it happens that those who are seized with sudden fear of some great catastrophe commonly suffer at once from looseness of the bowels.
