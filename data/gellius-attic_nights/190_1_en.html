<p>On the proper meaning of <span class="italic">religiosus</span>; and what changes the meaning of that word has undergone; and remarks of Nigidius Figulus on that subject, drawn from his <span class="italic">Commentaries.</span></p>
<p><span class="sc">Nigidius Figulus</span>, in my opinion the most learned of men next to Marcus Varro, in the eleventh book of his <span class="italic">Grammatical Commentaries</span>, quotes<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_339_1" id="target_note_LCL195_339_1"><sup>1</sup></a> a truly remarkable line from an early poet:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_339_2" id="target_note_LCL195_339_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line indent1">Best it is to be religious, lest one superstitious be;</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">but he does not name the author of the poem. And in the same connection Nigidius adds: “The suffix <span class="italic">osus</span> in words of this kind, such as <span class="italic">vinosus, mulierosus, religiosus,</span> always indicates an excessive amount of the quality in question. Therefore <span class="italic">religiosus</span> is applied to one who has involved himself in an extreme and superstitious devotion, which was regarded as a fault.”</p>
<p>But in addition to what Nigidius says, by another shift in meaning <span class="italic">religiosus</span> began to be used of an upright and conscientious man, who regulates his conduct by definite laws and limits. Similarly too the following terms, which have the same origin, appear to have acquired different meanings; namely, <span class="italic">religiosus dies</span> and <span class="italic">religiosa delubra</span>. For those days are called <span class="italic">religiosi</span> which are of ill-fame and are hampered by an evil omen, so that on them one must refrain from offering sacrifice or beginning any new business whatever; they are, namely, the days that the ignorant multitude falsely and improperly call <span class="italic">nefasti.</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_339_3" id="target_note_LCL195_339_3"><sup>3</sup></a> Thus Marcus Cicero, in the ninth
