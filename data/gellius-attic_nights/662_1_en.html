<p class="noindent">The meaning of the verses is that a man cannot fare well every day, but fares well on one day and ill on another. Since it is true,” he says, “that in human affairs things are in turn, now good, now bad, how much more fortunate is this fever which has an interval of two days,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL212_253_1" id="target_note_LCL212_253_1"><sup>1</sup></a> since it has only one stepmother, but two mothers!”</p>

<p>How many and what varieties of meaning the particle <span class="italic">quin</span> has, and that it is often obscure in the earlier literature.</p>
<p><span class="sc">The</span> particle <span class="italic">quin</span>, which the grammarians call a conjunction, seems to connect sentences in various ways and with divers meanings. For it seems to have one meaning when we say, as if chiding or questioning or exhorting, <span class="italic">quin venis</span>? “Why don’t you come?” <span class="italic">quin legis</span>? “Why don’t you read?” or <span class="italic">quin fugis</span>? “Why don’t you flee?”; but it has a different meaning when we affirm, for example, that “there is no doubt but that (<span class="italic">quin</span>) Marcus Tullius is the most eloquent of all men,” and still a third, when we add something which seems contradictory to a former statement: “Isocrates did not plead causes, not but that he thought it useful and honourable so to do.” In the last of these sentences the meaning is not very different from that which is found in the third book of Marcus Cato’s <span class="italic">Origins</span>:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL212_253_2" id="target_note_LCL212_253_2"><sup>2</sup></a> “these I describe last, not but that they are good and valiant peoples.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL212_253_3" id="target_note_LCL212_253_3"><sup>3</sup></a> Also in the second book of the <span class="italic">Origins</span> Marcus Cato has used this particle in a very similar manner:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL212_253_4" id="target_note_LCL212_253_4"><sup>4</sup></a> “He did not consider it enough to have slandered him privately, without openly defaming his character.”</p>
