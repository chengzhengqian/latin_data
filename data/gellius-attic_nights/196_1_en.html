vegetable, according to the common use of the word. But those who have studied the poems of Empedocles with greater care and knowledge say that here κυάμους refers to the testicles, and that after the Pythagorean manner they were called in a covert and symbolic way κύαμοι, because they are the cause of pregnancy and furnish the power for human generation:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_351_1" id="target_note_LCL195_351_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and that therefore Empedocles in that verse desired to keep men, not from eating beans, but from excess in venery.</p>
<p>Plutarch too, a man of weight in scientific matters, in the first book of his work <span class="italic">On Homer</span> wrote that Aristotle<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_351_2" id="target_note_LCL195_351_2"><sup>2</sup></a> gave the same account of the Pythagoreans: namely, that except for a few parts of the flesh they did not abstain from eating animals. Since the statement is contrary to the general belief, I have appended Plutarch’s own words:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_351_3" id="target_note_LCL195_351_3"><sup>3</sup></a> “Aristotle says that the Pythagoreans abstained from the matrix, the heart, the ἀκαλήφη and some other such things, but used all other animal food.” Now the ἀκαλήφη is a marine creature which is called the sea-nettle. But Plutarch in his <span class="italic">Table Talk</span> says<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_351_4" id="target_note_LCL195_351_4"><sup>4</sup></a> that the Pythagoreans also abstained from mullets.</p>
<p>But as to Pythagoras himself, while it is well known that he declared that he had come into the world as Euphorbus, what Cleanthes<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_351_5" id="target_note_LCL195_351_5"><sup>5</sup></a> and Dicaearchus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_351_6" id="target_note_LCL195_351_6"><sup>6</sup></a> have recorded is less familiar—that he was afterwards Pyrrhus Pyranthius, then Aethalides, and then a beautiful courtesan, whose name was Alco.</p>
