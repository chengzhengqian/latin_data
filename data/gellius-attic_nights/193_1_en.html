<p>The order observed in calling upon senators for their opinions; and the altercation in the senate between Gaius Caesar, when consul, and Marcus Cato, who tried to use up the whole day in talk.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Before</span> the passage of the law which is now observed in the proceedings of the senate, the order in calling for opinions varied. Sometimes the man was first called upon whom the censors had first enrolled in the senate, sometimes the consuls elect; some of the consuls, influenced by friendship or some personal relationship, used to call first upon anyone they pleased, as a compliment, contrary to the regular order. However, when the usual order was not followed, the rule was observed of not calling first upon any but a man of consular rank. It is said that Gaius Caesar, when he was consul with Marcus Bibulus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_345_1" id="target_note_LCL195_345_1"><sup>1</sup></a> called upon only four senators out of order. The first of these was Marcus Crassus, but after Caesar had betrothed his daughter to Gnaeus Pompeius, he began to call upon Pompeius first.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_345_2" id="target_note_LCL195_345_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Caesar gave the senate his reason for this procedure, according to the testimony of Tullius Tiro, Ciceroâ€™s freedman, who writes<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_345_3" id="target_note_LCL195_345_3"><sup>3</sup></a> that he had the information from his patron. Ateius Capito has made the same statement in his work <span class="italic">On Senatorial Conduct.</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_345_4" id="target_note_LCL195_345_4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
