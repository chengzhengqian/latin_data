words of Cicero’s, my mind is possessed with the sight and sound of blows, cries and lamentation. For example, the words which he speaks about Gaius Verres, which I have quoted so far as my memory went, which was all that I could do at present:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_223_1" id="target_note_LCL200_223_1"><sup>1</sup></a> “The man himself came into the forum, blazing with wickedness and frenzy.
