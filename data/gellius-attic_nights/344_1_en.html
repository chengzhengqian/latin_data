strolling about in that famous port, which Quintus Ennius called <span class="italic">praepes</span>, or “propitious,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_163_1" id="target_note_LCL200_163_1"><sup>1</sup></a> using an epithet that is somewhat far-fetched, but altogether apt. There I saw some bundles of books exposed for sale, and I at once eagerly hurried to them. Now, all those books were in Greek, filled with marvellous tales, things unheard of, incredible; but the writers were ancient and of no mean authority: Aristeas of Proconnesus, Isigonus of Nicaea, Ctesias and Onesicritus, Philostephanus and Hegesias.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_163_2" id="target_note_LCL200_163_2"><sup>2</sup></a> The volumes themselves, however, were filthy from long neglect, in bad condition and unsightly. Nevertheless,
I drew near and asked their price; then, attracted by their extraordinary and unexpected cheapness, I bought a large number of them for a small sum, and ran through all of them hastily in the course of the next two nights. As I read, I culled from them, and noted down, some things that were remarkable and for the most part unmentioned by our native writers; these I have inserted here and there in these notes, so that whoever shall read them may not be found to be wholly ignorant and ἀνήκοος, or “uninstructed,” when hearing tales of that kind.</p>
<p>Those books, then, contained matter of the following
