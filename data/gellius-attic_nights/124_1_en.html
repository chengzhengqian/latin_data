pouring their family and fortune into an abyss of dinners and banquets, Lucius Sulla in his dictatorship proposed a law to the people, which provided that on the Kalends, Ides and Nones, on days of games, and on certain regular festivals, it should be proper and lawful to spend three hundred sesterces on a dinner, but on all other days no more than thirty.</p>
<p>Besides these laws we find also an Aemilian law,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_207_1" id="target_note_LCL195_207_1"><sup>1</sup></a> setting a limit not on the expense of dinners, but on the kind and quantity of food.</p>
<p>Then the law of Antius,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_207_2" id="target_note_LCL195_207_2"><sup>2</sup></a> besides curtailing outlay, contained the additional provision, that no magistrate or magistrate elect should dine out anywhere, except at the house of stipulated persons.</p>
<p>Lastly, the Julian law came before the people during the principate of Caesar Augustus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_207_3" id="target_note_LCL195_207_3"><sup>3</sup></a> by which on working days two hundred sesterces is the limit, on the Kalends, Ides and Nones and some other holidays, three hundred, but at weddings and the banquets following them, a thousand.</p>
<p>Ateius Capito says<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_207_4" id="target_note_LCL195_207_4"><sup>4</sup></a> that there is still another edict—but whether of the deified Augustus or of Tiberius Caesar I do not exactly remember—by which the outlay for dinners on various festal days was increased from three hundred sesterces to two thousand, to the end that the rising tide of luxury might be restrained at least within those limits.</p>
