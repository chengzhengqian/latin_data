but <span class="italic">cōnficit</span>. Consult the rules of grammar and they will censure your usage; refer the matter to your ears and they will approve. Ask why it is so; they will say that it pleases them. And language ought to gratify the pleasure of the ear.”</p>
<p>In these words of which Cicero spoke it is clear that the principle is one of euphony, but what are we to say of the preposition <span class="italic">pro</span>? For although it is often shortened or lengthened, yet it does not conform to this rule of Marcus Tullius. For it is not always lengthened when it is followed by the first letter of the word <span class="italic">fecit</span>, which Cicero says has the effect of lengthening the prepositions <span class="italic">in</span> and <span class="italic">con</span>. For we pronounce <span class="italic">prŏficisci, prŏfugere, prŏfundere, prŏfanum</span> and <span class="italic">prŏfestum</span> with the first vowel short, but <span class="italic">prōferre, prōfligare</span> and <span class="italic">prōficere</span> with that syllable long. Why is it then that this letter, which, according to Cicero’s observation, has the effect of lengthening, does not have the same effect by reason of rule or of euphony in all words of the same kind,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_169_1" id="target_note_LCL195_169_1"><sup>1</sup></a> but lengthens the vowel in one word and shortens it in another.</p>
<p>Nor, as a matter of fact, is the particle <span class="italic">con</span> lengthened only when followed by that letter which Cicero mentioned: for both Cato and Sallust say “<span class="italic">faenoribus copertus est.</span>”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_169_2" id="target_note_LCL195_169_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Moreover <span class="italic">cōligatus</span> and <span class="italic">cōnexus</span> are pronounced long.</p>
<p>But after all, in these cases which I have cited one can see that this particle is lengthened because the letter <span class="italic">n</span> is dropped; for the loss of a letter is compensated by the lengthening of the syllable. This principle is observed also in the word <span class="italic">cōgo</span>; and it is no contradiction that we pronounce <span class="italic">cŏegi</span>
