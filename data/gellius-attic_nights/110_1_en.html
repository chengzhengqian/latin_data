from Scipio’s fifth oration <span class="italic">Against Claudius Asellus</span>:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_179_1" id="target_note_LCL195_179_1"><sup>1</sup></a> “When he had seen the highly-cultivated fields and well-kept farmhouses, he ordered them to set up a measuring rod on the highest spot in that district; and from there to build a straight road, in some places through the midst of vineyards, in others through the <span class="italic">roborarium</span> and the fish-pond, in still others through the farm buildings.”</p>
