<p class="noindent">But now I asked you whether you know the reason for this name.” And he, without a moment’s hesitation, but with the greatest possible assurance, said: “Sheep are called <span class="italic">bidentes</span>, because they have only two teeth.” “Where on earth, pray,” said I, “have you seen a sheep that by nature had only two teeth? For that is a portent and ought to be met with expiatory offerings.” Then he, greatly disturbed and angry with me, cried: “Ask rather such questions as ought to be put to a grammarian; for one inquires of shepherds about the teeth of sheep.” I laughed at the wit of the blockhead and left him.</p>
