while they thought that such crimes ought to be punished, they yet believed that punishments of that kind were too severe; for they have allowed the laws which prescribed such excessive penalties to die out from disuse and old age. Just so they considered it also an inhuman provision, that if a man has been summoned to court, and being disabled through illness or years is too weak to walk, ‘a covered waggon he need not spread’;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL212_411_1" id="target_note_LCL212_411_1"><sup>1</sup></a> but the man is carried out and placed upon a beast of burden and conveyed from his home to the praetor<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL212_411_2" id="target_note_LCL212_411_2"><sup>2</sup></a> in the comitium, as if he were a living corpse. For why should one who is a prey to illness, and unable to appear, be haled into court at the demand of his adversary, clinging to a draught animal? But as for my statement that some laws were excessively lenient, do not you yourself think that law too lax, which reads as follows with regard to the penalty for an injury:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL212_411_3" id="target_note_LCL212_411_3"><sup>3</sup></a> ‘If anyone has inflicted an injury upon another, let him be fined twenty-five asses’? For who will be found so poor that twenty-five asses would keep him from inflicting an injury if he desired to? And therefore your friend Labeo also, in the work which he wrote <span class="italic">On the Twelve Tables</span>,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL212_411_4" id="target_note_LCL212_411_4"><sup>4</sup></a> expressing his disapproval of that law, says:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL212_411_5" id="target_note_LCL212_411_5"><sup>5</sup></a> ‘One Lucius Veratius was an exceedingly wicked man and of cruel brutality. He used to amuse himself by striking free men in the face with his open hand. A slave followed him with a purse full of asses; as often as he had buffeted anyone, he ordered twenty-five asses to be counted out at once, according to the provision of the <span class="italic">Twelve Tables</span>’
