may express as follows: A “vein” is a receptacle, or ἀγγεῖον, as the physicians call it, for blood mingled and combined with vital breath, in which the blood predominates and the breath is less. An “artery” is a receptacle for the vital breath mingled and combined with blood, in which there is more breath and less blood. Σφυγμός (pulsation) is the natural and involuntary expansion and contraction in the heart and in the artery. But the ancient Greek physicians defined it thus: “An involuntary dilation or contraction of the pulse and of the heart.”</p>

<p>Words from the poems of Furius of Antium which were ignorantly criticised by Caesellius Vindex; a quotation of the very verses which include the words in question.</p>
<p> <span class="sc">Icertainly</span> do not agree with Caesellius Vindex, the grammarian, though in my opinion he is by no means without learning. But yet this was a hasty and ignorant statement of his, that the ancient poet Furius of Antium had degraded the Latin language by forming words of a kind which to me did not seem inconsistent with a poet’s license nor to be vulgar or unpleasant to speak and utter, as are some others which have been harshly and tastelessly fashioned by distinguished poets.</p>
<p>The expressions of Furius which Caesellius censures are these: that he uses <span class="italic">lutescere</span> of earth which has turned into mud, <span class="italic">noctescere</span> of darkness that has arisen like that of night, <span class="italic">virescere</span> of recovering former strength, describes the wind curling the blue sea and making it shine by <span class="italic">purpurat</span>, and uses <span class="italic">opulescere</span> for becoming rich.</p>
