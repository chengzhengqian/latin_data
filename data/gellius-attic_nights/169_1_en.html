sometimes takes place more quickly, yet it occurs not much more quickly, and when later, not much later.</p>
<p>I recall that this question was carefully and thoroughly investigated at Rome, an inquiry demanded by a suit at law of no small moment at the time, whether, namely, a child that had been born alive in the eighth month but had died immediately, satisfied the conditions of the ins <span class="italic">trium liberorum,</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_297_1" id="target_note_LCL195_297_1"><sup>1</sup></a> since it seemed to some that the untimely period of the eighth month made it an abortion and not a birth.</p>
<p>But since I have told what I have learned about a birth after a year in Homer and about the eleventh month, I think I ought not to omit what I read in the seventh book of the <span class="italic">Natural History</span> of Plinius Secundus. But because that story might seem to be beyond belief, I have quoted Pliny’s own words:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_297_2" id="target_note_LCL195_297_2"><sup>2</sup></a> “Masurius makes the statement<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_297_3" id="target_note_LCL195_297_3"><sup>3</sup></a> that the praetor Lucius Papirius, when an heir in the second degree<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_297_4" id="target_note_LCL195_297_4"><sup>4</sup></a> brought suit for the possession of an inheritance, decided against him, although the mother<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_297_5" id="target_note_LCL195_297_5"><sup>5</sup></a> said that she had been pregnant for thirteen months; and the reason for his decision was that it seemed to him that no definite period of gestation had been fixed by law.” In the same book of Plinius Secundus are these words:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_297_6" id="target_note_LCL195_297_6"><sup>6</sup></a> “Yawning during childbirth is fatal, just as to sneeze after coition produces abortion.”</p>
