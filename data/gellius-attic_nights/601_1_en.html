<h3><span class="ac">I</span></h3>
<p>A saying of Musonius, the Greek philosopher, which is of practical value and worth hearing and bearing in mind; and a remark of equal value made by Marcus Cato many years before to the knights at Numantia.</p>
<p><span class="sc">When</span> I was still young and a schoolboy, I heard that this Greek sentiment which I have subjoined was uttered by the philosopher Musonius, and since it is a true and brilliant saying, expressed briefly and roundly, I very willingly committed it to memory:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL212_131_1" id="target_note_LCL212_131_1"><sup>1</sup></a> “If you accomplish anything noble with toil, the toil passes, but the noble deed endures. If you do anything shameful with pleasure, the pleasure passes, but the shame endures.”</p>
<p>Later, I read that same sentiment in the speech of Marcus Cato which he delivered <span class="italic">At Numantia to the Knights.</span> Although it is expressed somewhat loosely and diffusely compared with the Greek which I have given, yet, since it is prior in time and more ancient, it ought to seem worthy of greater respect. The words in the speech are as follows:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL212_131_2" id="target_note_LCL212_131_2"><sup>2</sup></a> “Bear in mind, that if through toil you accomplish a good deed, that toil will quickly pass from you, the good deed will not leave you so long as you live; but if through pleasure you do anything dishonourable, the pleasure will quickly pass away, that dishonourable act will remain with you for ever.”</p>
