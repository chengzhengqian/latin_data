flight, since Nigidius said that the <span class="italic">praepetes</span> were contrasted with the <span class="italic">inferae.</span></p>
<p>In my youth in Rome, when I was still in attendance
on the grammarians, I gave special attention to Sulpicius Apollinaris. Once when there was a discussion
about augural law and mention had been made of <span class="italic">praepetes aves,</span> I heard him say to Erucius Clarus, the city prefect, that in his opinion <span class="italic">praepetes</span> was equivalent to Homer’s τανυπτέρυγες, or “wide-winged,” 
since the augurs had special regard to those birds whose flight was broad and wide because of their great wings. And then he quoted these verses of Homer:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_111_1" id="target_note_LCL200_111_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p>On Acca Larentia and Gaia Taracia; and on the origin of the priesthood of the Arval Brethren.</p>
<p><span class="sc">The</span> names of Acca Larentia and Gaia Taracia, or Fufetia as she is sometimes called, are frequent in the early annals. To the former of these after her death, but to Taracia while she still lived, the Roman people paid distinguished honours. And that Taracia, at any rate, was a Vestal virgin is proved by the Horatian law which was laid before the people with regard to her. By this law very many honours are bestowed upon her and among them the right of giving testimony is granted her, and that privilege is given to no other woman in the State. The word <span class="italic">testabilis</span> is used in the Horatian law itself, and its opposite occurs in the <span class="italic">Twelve Tables</span>:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_111_2" id="target_note_LCL200_111_2"><sup>2</sup></a> “Let him be
