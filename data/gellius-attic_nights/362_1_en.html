called “Manlian;” for at a later time, when he was consul in a war against the Latins, Manlius caused his own son to be beheaded, because he had been sent by his father on a scouting expedition with orders not to fight,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_199_1" id="target_note_LCL200_199_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and disregarding the command, had killed one of the enemy who had challenged him.</p>

<p>That Quadrigarius also, with correct Latinity, used <span class="italic">facies</span> as a genitive; and some other observations on the inflection
of similar words.</p>
<p><span class="sc">The</span> expression that I quoted above from Quintus Claudius,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_199_2" id="target_note_LCL200_199_2"><sup>2</sup></a> “On account of his great size and savage aspect (<span class="italic">facies</span>),” I have inquired into by examining several old manuscripts, and have found it to be as I wrote it. For it was in that way, as a rule, that the early writers declined the word—<span class="italic">facies facies—</span>whereas
the rule of grammar now requires <span class="italic">faciei</span> as the genitive. But I did find some corrupt manuscripts
in which <span class="italic">faciei</span> was written, with erasure of the former reading.</p>
<p>I remember too having found both <span class="italic">facies</span> and <span class="italic">facii</span> written in the same manuscript of Claudius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_199_3" id="target_note_LCL200_199_3"><sup>3</sup></a> in the library at Tibur. But <span class="italic">facies</span> was written in the text and <span class="italic">facii</span>, with double <span class="italic">i,</span> in the margin opposite; nor did I regard that as inconsistent with a certain early usage; for from the nominative <span class="italic">dies</span> they used both <span class="italic">dies</span> and <span class="italic">dii</span> as the genitive, and from <span class="italic">fames,</span> both <span class="italic">famis</span> and <span class="italic">fami</span>.</p>
