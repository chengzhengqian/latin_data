evidence on this subject Marcus Tullius, citing these words from the speech entitled <span class="italic">In Defence of Gaius Rabirius</span>:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_369_1" id="target_note_LCL200_369_1"><sup>1</sup></a> “Lictor, bind his hands.” This is what Valgius says.</p>
<p>Now, I for my part agree with him; but Tullius Tiro, the freedman of Marcus Cicero, wrote<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_369_2" id="target_note_LCL200_369_2"><sup>2</sup></a> that the <span class="italic">Victor</span> got his name from <span class="italic">limus</span> or <span class="italic">licium</span>. “For,” says he, “those men who were in attendance upon the magistrates were girt across with a kind of girdle called <span class="italic">limus.</span>”</p>
<p>But if there is anyone who thinks that what Tiro said is more probable, because the first syllable<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_369_3" id="target_note_LCL200_369_3"><sup>3</sup></a> in <span class="italic">lictor</span> is long like that of <span class="italic">licium</span>, but in the word <span class="italic">ligo</span> is short, that has nothing to do with the case. For in <span class="italic">lictor</span> from <span class="italic">ligando, lector</span> from <span class="italic">legendo, vitor</span> from <span class="italic">viendo, tutor</span> from <span class="italic">tuendo</span>, and <span class="italic">structor</span> from <span class="italic">struendo,</span> the vowels, which were originally short, are lengthened.</p>
<h3><span class="ac">IV</span></h3>
<p>Lines taken from the seventh book of the <span class="italic">Annals</span> of Ennius, in which the courteous bearing of an inferior towards a friend of higher rank is described and defined.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Quintus Ennius</span> in the seventh book of his <span class="italic">Annals</span> describes and defines very vividly and skilfully in his sketch of Geminus Servilius, a man of rank, the tact, courtesy, modesty, fidelity, restraint and propriety in speech, knowledge of ancient history and of customs old and new, scrupulousness in keeping and guarding a secret; in short, the various remedies and methods of relief and solace for guarding against the annoyances
