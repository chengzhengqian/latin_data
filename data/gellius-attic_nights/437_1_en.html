wrote <span class="italic">On Dividing Spoils among the Soldiers</span>, complains in strong and choice language about unpunished thievery and lawlessness. I have quoted his words, since they pleased me greatly:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_349_1" id="target_note_LCL200_349_1"><sup>1</sup></a> “Those who commit private theft pass their lives in confinement and fetters; plunderers of the public, in purple and gold.”</p>
<p>But I think I ought not to pass over the highly ethical and strict definition of theft made by the wisest men, lest anyone should consider him only a thief who privately purloins anything or secretly carries it off. The words are those of Sabinus in his second book <span class="italic">On Civil Law</span>:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_349_2" id="target_note_LCL200_349_2"><sup>2</sup></a> “He is guilty of theft who has touched anything belonging to another, when he has reason to know that he does so against the owner’s will.” Also in another chapter:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_349_3" id="target_note_LCL200_349_3"><sup>3</sup></a> “He who silently carries off another’s property for the sake of gain is guilty of theft, whether he knows to whom the object belongs or not.”</p>
<p>Thus has Sabinus written, in the book which I just now mentioned, about handling things for the purpose of stealing them. But we ought to remember, according to what I have written above, that a theft may be committed even without touching anything, when the mind alone and the thoughts desire that a theft be committed. Therefore Sabinus says<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_349_4" id="target_note_LCL200_349_4"><sup>4</sup></a> that he has no doubt that a master should be convicted of theft who has ordered a slave of his to steal something.</p>
