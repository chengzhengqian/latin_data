they never produce more than one cub. His words in that book are as follows:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_429_1" id="target_note_LCL200_429_1"><sup>1</sup></a> “But the lioness, although a strong and most courageous animal, gives birth once only in her lifetime to one cub; for in giving birth she discharges her womb with the whelp.” Homer, however, says that lions (for so he calls the females also, using the masculine or “common” (epicene) gender, as the grammarians call it) produce and rear many whelps. The verses in which he plainly says this are these:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_429_2" id="target_note_LCL200_429_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line indent2">He stood, like to a lion before its young,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">Beset by hunters in a gloomy wood</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">And leading them away.</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">In another passage also he indicates the same thing:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_429_3" id="target_note_LCL200_429_3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line indent2">With many a groan, like lion of strong beard,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">From which a hunter stole away its young</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">Amid dense woods.</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p>Since this disagreement and difference between the most famous of poets and the most eminent of historians troubled me, I thought best to consult that very thorough treatise which the philosopher Aristotle wrote <span class="italic">On Animals.</span> And what I find that he has written there upon this subject I shall include in these notes, in Aristotle’s own language.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_429_4a" id="target_note_LCL200_429_4a"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

Aristotle tells us that the lioness gives birth to young every year, usually two, at most six, sometimes only one. The current idea that the womb is discharged with the young is absurd; it arose from the fact that lions are rare and that the inventor of the story did not know the real reason, which is that their habitat is of limited extent. The lionesses in Syria give birth five times producing at first five cubs, then one less at each successive birth.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL200_429_4a').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
