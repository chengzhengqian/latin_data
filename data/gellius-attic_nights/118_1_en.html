Upon my word, the armour of Diomedes and of Glaucus were not more different in value.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_195_1a" id="target_note_LCL195_195_1a"><sup>1</sup></a> Our reading had reached the passage where the aged husband was complaining of his rich and ugly wife, because he had been forced to sell his maid-servant, a girl skilled at her work and very good looking, since his wife suspected her of being his mistress. I shall say nothing of the great difference; but I have had the lines of both poets copied and submitted to others for their decision. This is Menander:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_195_2" id="target_note_LCL195_195_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<span class="line indent1">May also be my tyrant. From the face</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent1">Dame Nature gave her, she’s an ass ’mong apes,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent1">As says the adage. I would silent be</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent1">About that night, the first of many woes.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent1">Alas that I took Crobyle to wife,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent1">With sixteen talents and a foot of nose.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent1">Then too can one her haughtiness endure?</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent1">By Zeus Olympius and Athena, no!</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent1">She has dismissed a maid who did her work</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent1">More quickly than the word was given her,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent1">More quickly far than one will bring her back!</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">But Caecilius renders it thus:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_195_3" id="target_note_LCL195_195_3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
