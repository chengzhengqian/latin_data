he, “if we have not observed that something is lacking, the sentence seems to read ‘girt with staff and scant shift,’ which,” says he, “is utterly absurd; for since the <span class="italic">lituus</span> is a short wand, curved at its thicker end, such as the augurs use, how on earth can one be looked upon as ’ girt with a <span class="italic">lituus</span>? ’”</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, it was Hyginus himself who failed to notice that this expression, like very many others, contains an ellipsis. For example, when we say “Marcus Cicero, a man of great eloquence” and “Quintus Roscius, an actor of consummate grace,” neither of these phrases is full and complete, but to the hearer they seem full and complete. As Vergil wrote in another place:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_401_1" id="target_note_LCL195_401_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line indent4">Victorious Butes of huge bulk,</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">that is, having huge bulk, and also in another passage:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_401_2" id="target_note_LCL195_401_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<blockquote><p><span class="line indent1">A house of gore and cruel feasts, dark, huge</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent3">within,</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">so then it would seem that the phrase in question ought to be interpreted as “Picus was with the Quirinal staff,” just as we say “the statue was with a large head,” and in fact <span class="italic">est, erat</span> and <span class="italic">fuit</span> are often omitted, with elegant effect and without any loss of meaning.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_401_4" id="target_note_LCL195_401_4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>And since mention has been made of the <span class="italic">lituus,</span> I must not pass over a question which obviously may be asked, whether the augurs’ <span class="italic">lituus</span> is called after the trumpet of the same name, or whether the
