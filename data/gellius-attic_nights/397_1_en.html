<p>Capito, however, in the same definition divided<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_269_1" id="target_note_LCL200_269_1"><sup>1</sup></a> the <span class="italic">plebes</span>,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_269_2" id="target_note_LCL200_269_2"><sup>2</sup></a> or “commons,” from the <span class="italic">populus,</span> or “people,” since in the term “people” are embraced every part of the state and all its orders, but “commons” is properly applied to that part in which the patrician families of the citizens are not included. Therefore, according to Capito, a <span class="italic">plebisscitum</span> is a law which the commons, and not the people, adopt.</p>
<p>But the head itself, the origin, and as it were the fount of this whole process of law is the rogatio, whether the appeal (<span class="italic">rogatio</span>) is to the people or to the commons, on a matter relating to all or to individuals. For all the words under discussion are understood and included in the fundamental principle and name of <span class="italic">rogatio</span>; for unless the people or commons be appealed to (<span class="italic">rogetur</span>), no decree of the people or commons can be passed.</p>
<p>But although all this is true, yet in the old records we observe that no great distinction is made among the words in question. For the common term <span class="italic">lex</span> is used both of decrees of the commons and of “privileges,” and all are called by the indiscriminate and inexact name <span class="italic">rogatio.</span></p>
<p>Even Sallust, who is most observant of propriety in the use of words, has yielded to custom and applied the term “law” to the “privilege” which was passed with reference to the return of Gnaeus Pompeius. The passage, from the second book of his <span class="italic">Histories</span>, reads as follows:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_269_3" id="target_note_LCL200_269_3"><sup>3</sup></a> “For when Sulla, as consul, proposed a law (<span class="italic">legem</span>) touching his return, the tribune of the commons, Gaius Herennius, had vetoed it by previous arrangement.”</p>
