one who envies and of one who is envied, <span class="italic">suspiciosus</span> of one who suspects and of one who is suspected, <span class="italic">ambitiosus</span> of one who courts favour and of one who is courted, <span class="italic">gratiosus</span> also of one who gives, and of one who receives, thanks, <span class="italic">laboriosus</span> of one who toils and of one who causes toil—as many other words of this kind are used in both ways, so <span class="italic">infestus</span> too has a double meaning. For he is called <span class="italic">infestus</span> who inflicts injury on anyone, and on the other hand he who is threatened with injury from another source is also said to be <span class="italic">infestus</span>.</p>
<p>But the meaning which I gave first surely needs no illustration, so many are there who use <span class="italic">infestus</span> in the sense of hostile and adverse; but that second meaning
is less familiar and more obscure. For who of the common run would readily call a man <span class="italic">infestus</span> to whom another is hostile? However, not only did many of the earlier writers speak in that way, but Marcus Tullius also gave the word that meaning in the speech which he wrote <span class="italic">In Defence of Gnaeus Plancius</span>, saying:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_189_1" id="target_note_LCL200_189_1"><sup>1</sup></a> “I were grieved, gentlemen of the jury, and keenly distressed, if this man’s safety should be more endangered (<span class="italic">infestior</span>) for the very reason that he had protected my life and safety by his own kindliness,
protection and watchfulness.” Accordingly, I inquired into the origin and meaning of the word and found this statement in the writings of Nigidius:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_189_2" id="target_note_LCL200_189_2"><sup>2</sup></a> <span class="italic">“Infestus</span> is derived from <span class="italic">festinare</span>,” says he, “for one who threatens anyone, and is in haste to attack him, and hurries eagerly to crush him; or on the other hand one whose peril and ruin are being hastened—both
of these are called <span class="italic">infestus</span> from the urgent imminence of the injury which one is either about to inflict on someone, or to suffer.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_189_3" id="target_note_LCL200_189_3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
