<p>The meaning and origin of the particle <span class="italic">saltem.</span></p>
<p><span class="sc">We</span> were inquiring what the original meaning of the particle <span class="italic">saltem</span> (at least) was, and what was the derivation of the word; for it seems to have been so formed from the first that it does not appear, like some aids to expression, to have been adopted inconsiderately and irregularly.
