<p>That Carneades the Academic purged his stomach with hellebore when about to write against the dogmas of Zeno the Stoic; and of the nature and curative powers of white and black hellebore.</p>
<p><span class="sc">When</span> Carneades, the Academic philosopher, was about to write against the books of the Stoic Zeno, he cleansed the upper part of his body with white hellebore, in order that none of the corrupt humours of his stomach might rise to the abode of his mind and weaken the power and vigour of his intellect; with such care and such preparation did this man of surpassing talent set about’ refuting what Zeno had written. When I had read of this in Grecian history, I inquired what was meant by the term “white hellebore.”</p>
<p>Then I learned that there are two kinds of hellebore distinguished by a difference in colour, white and black; but that those colours are distinguished neither in the seed of the hellebore nor in its plant, but in the root; further, that with white hellebore the stomach and upper belly<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL212_259_1" id="target_note_LCL212_259_1"><sup>1</sup></a> are purged by vomiting; by the black the so-called lower belly is loosened,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL212_259_2" id="target_note_LCL212_259_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and the effect of both is to remove the noxious humours in which the causes of diseases are situated. But that there is danger lest, when every avenue of the body is opened, along with the causes of disease the juices on which the principle of life depends should also pass away, and the man should perish from exhaustion because of the destruction of the entire foundation of natural nourishment.</p>
