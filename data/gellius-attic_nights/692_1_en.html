<p>When at last we had found him reading amid loud applause—and he was reading the seventh book of the <span class="italic">Annals</span> of Ennius—we first heard him wrongly recite the following lines:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL212_313_1" id="target_note_LCL212_313_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line indent1">Then with great force on rush the four-footed</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">horse (<span class="italic">equus</span>)</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent1">And elephants,</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">and without adding many more verses, he departed amid the praises and applause of the whole company.</p>
<p>Then Julianus, as he came out of the theatre, said: “What think you of this reader and his four-footed
horse? For surely he read it thus:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line indent1">Denique vi magna quadrupes equus atque</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">elephanti</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent1">Proiciunt sese.</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">Do you think that, if he had had a master and instructor worth a penny, he would have said
<span class="italic">quadrupes equus</span> and not <span class="italic">quadrupes eques?</span> For no one who has given any attention to ancient literature doubts that Ennius left it written in that way.” When several of those who were present declared that they had read <span class="italic">quadrupes equus</span>, each with his own teacher, and wondered what was the meaning of <span class="italic">quadrupes eques,</span> Julianus rejoined: “I could wish, my worthy young friends, that you had read Quintus Ennius as accurately as did Publius Vergilius, who, imitating this verse of his in <span class="italic">The Georgics,</span> used <span class="italic">eques</span> for <span class="italic">equus</span> in these lines:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL212_313_2" id="target_note_LCL212_313_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
