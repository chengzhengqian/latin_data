entertaining fables he put into men’s minds and hearts ideas that were wholesome and carefully considered, while at the same time he enticed their attention. For example, this fable of his<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_225_1" id="target_note_LCL195_225_1"><sup>1</sup></a> about the little nest of a birdlet with delightful humour warns us that in the case of things which one can do, hope and confidence should never be placed in another, but in one’s own self. “There is a little bird,” he says, “it is called the lark. It lives in the grainfields, and generally builds its nest at such a time that the harvest is at hand exactly when the young birds are ready to be fledged. Such a lark chanced to have built her nest in a field which had been sown rather early in the year; therefore when the grain was turning yellow, the fledglings were still unable to fly. Accordingly, when the mother went off in search of food for her young, she warned them to notice whether anything unusual was said or done there, and to tell it to her on her return. A little later the owner of that grainfield calls his young son and says: ‘Do you not see that this is ripe and already calls for hands? To-morrow then, as soon as it is light, see that you go to our friends and ask them to come and exchange work with us, and help us with this harvest.’ So saying, he at once went away. And when the lark returned, the chicks, frightened and trembling, twittered about their mother and implored her to make haste and at once carry them off to some other place; ‘for,’ said they, ‘the master has sent to ask his friends to come at daybreak and reap.’ The mother bids them be easy in mind.’ For if the master,’ said she, ‘has turned the harvesting over to his friends, the field will not be reaped to-morrow, and I need not take you away
