<p>Marcus Varro’s words, in the fifth book of his <span class="italic">Disciplinae,</span>
are as follows:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_215_1" id="target_note_LCL200_215_1"><sup>1</sup></a> “It is one thing to be made praetor <span class="italic">quarto</span>, and another <span class="italic">quartum</span>; for <span class="italic">quarto</span> refers to order and indicates that three were elected before him;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_215_2" id="target_note_LCL200_215_2"><sup>2</sup></a> <span class="italic">quartum</span> refers to time and indicates that he had been made praetor three times before. Accordingly
Ennius was right when he wrote:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_215_3" id="target_note_LCL200_215_3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p>What Varro briefly and somewhat obscurely hinted at concerning Pompey, Tullius Tiro, Cicero’s freedman,
wrote at greater length in one of his letters, substantially as follows:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_215_5" id="target_note_LCL200_215_5"><sup>5</sup></a> “When Pompey was preparing
