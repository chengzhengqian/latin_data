Cicero’s use of the word in the second book<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_101_1" id="target_note_LCL195_101_1"><sup>1</sup></a> of the Republic also deserves attention. This is the passage in question: “I should not object, Laelius, if I did not think that these friends wished, and if I myself did not desire, that you should take some part in this discussion of ours, especially since you yourself said yesterday that you would give us even more than enough (<span class="italic">te superfuturum</span>). But that indeed is impossible: we all ask you not to give us less than enough (<span class="italic">ne desis</span>).”</p>
<p>Now Julius Paulus, the most learned man within my recollection, used to say with keenness and understanding that <span class="italic">superesse</span> and its Greek equivalent had more than one meaning: for he declared that the Greeks used περισσόν both ways, either of what was superfluous and unnecessary or of what was too abundant, overflowing and excessive; that in the same way our earlier writers also employed <span class="italic">superesse</span> sometimes of what was superfluous, idle and not wholly necessary, a sense which we have just cited from Varro, and sometimes, as in Cicero, of that which indeed surpassed other things in copiousness and plentifulness, yet was immoderate and too extensive, and gushed forth more abundantly than was sufficient. Therefore one who says superesse se with reference to a man whom he is defending tries to convey none of these meanings, but uses superesse in a sense that is unknown and not in use. And he will not be able to appeal even to the authority of Virgil, who in his <span class="italic">Georgics</span> wrote as follows:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_101_2" id="target_note_LCL195_101_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line indent1">I will be first to bear, so but my life still last</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">(<span class="italic">supersit</span>),</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent1">Home to my native land . . .</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
