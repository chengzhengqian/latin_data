<p>That Phaedo the Socratic was a slave; and that several others also were of that condition.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Phaedo</span> of Elis belonged to that famous Socratic band and was on terms of close intimacy with Socrates and Plato. His name was given by Plato to that inspired dialogue of his on the immortality of the soul. This Phaedo, though a slave, was of noble person and intellect,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_171_2" id="target_note_LCL195_171_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and according to some writers, in his boyhood was driven to prostitution by his master, who was a pander. We are told that Cebes the Socratic, at Socrates’ earnest request, bought Phaedo and gave him the opportunity of studying philosophy. And he afterwards became a distinguished philosopher, whose very tasteful discourses on Socrates are in circulation.</p>
<p>There were not a few other slaves too who afterwards became famous philosophers, among them that Menippus whose works Marcus Varro emulated<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_171_3" id="target_note_LCL195_171_3"><sup>3</sup></a> in those satires which others call “Cynic,” but he himself, “Menippean.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_171_4" id="target_note_LCL195_171_4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

Gellius thought that <span class="italic">coegi</span> was an irregular form because <span class="italic">oē</span> did not contract, as <span class="italic">oi</span> did in <span class="italic">cogo;</span> but contraction of unlike vowels did not take place when the second was long; cf. <span class="italic">coāctus.</span> Cicero’s rule is correct, because a vowel is naturally long before <span class="italic">ns</span> and <span class="italic">nf.</span> The case of <span class="italic">pro</span> is quite different. The <span class="italic">ō</span> in <span class="italic">cōpertus</span> is due to contraction from <span class="italic">co-opertus.
