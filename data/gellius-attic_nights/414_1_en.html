<p>That the word <span class="italic">elegantia</span> in earlier days was not used of a more refined nature, but of excessive fastidiousness in dress and mode of life, and was a term of reproach.</p>
<p><span class="sc">It</span> was not customary to call a man <span class="italic">elegans</span>, or “elegant,” by way of praise, but up to the time of Marcus Cato that word as a rule was a reproach, not a compliment. And this we may observe both in some other writers, and also in the work of Cato entitled <span class="italic">Carmen de Moribus</span>. In this book is the following passage:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_303_1" id="target_note_LCL200_303_1"><sup>1</sup></a> “They thought that avarice included all the vices; whoever was considered extravagant, ambitious, elegant, vicious or good-for-nothing

<p>Later, the “elegant” man ceased indeed to be reproached, but he was deemed worthy of no commendation, unless his elegance was very moderate. Thus Marcus Tullius commended Lucius Crassus and Quintus Scaevola, not for mere elegance, but for elegance combined with great frugality. “Crassus,” he says,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_303_3" id="target_note_LCL200_303_3"><sup>3</sup></a> “was the most frugal of elegant men; Scaevola the most elegant of the frugal.”</p>
<p>Besides this, in the same work of Cato, I recall also these scattered and cursory remarks:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_303_4" id="target_note_LCL200_303_4"><sup>4</sup></a> “It was
