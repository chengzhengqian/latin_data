were called ‘wise men’ are thought to have defined <span class="italic">penus</span> with sufficient accuracy. For I hear that Quintus Scaevola used the following words to explain <span class="italic">penus</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_315_1" id="target_note_LCL195_315_1"><sup>1</sup></a>: <span class="italic">‘Penus,’</span> said he, ‘is what is to be eaten or drunk, which is prepared for the use of the father of the family himself, or the mother of the family, or the children of the father, or the household which he has about him or his children and which is not engaged in work<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_315_2" id="target_note_LCL195_315_2"><sup>2</sup></a> . . . as<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_315_3" id="target_note_LCL195_315_3"><sup>3</sup></a> Mucius says ought to be regarded as <span class="italic">penus.</span> For articles which are prepared for eating and drinking day by day, for luncheon or dinner, are not <span class="italic">penus;</span> but rather the articles of that kind which are collected and stored up for use during a long period are called <span class="italic">penus,</span> because they are not ready at hand, but are kept in the innermost part of the house.’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_315_4a" id="target_note_LCL195_315_4a"><sup>4</sup></a> This information,” said Favorinus, “although I had devoted myself to philosophy, I yet did not neglect to acquire; since for Roman citizens speaking Latin it is no less disgraceful not to designate a thing by its proper word than it is to call a man out of his own name.”</p>
<p>Thus Favorinus used to lead ordinary conversations of this kind from insignificant and trivial topics to those which were better worth hearing and knowing, topics not lugged in irrelevantly, nor by way of display, but springing from and suggested by the conversations themselves.</p>
<p>Besides what Favorinus said, I think this too ought to be added to our consideration of <span class="italic">penus,</span>
