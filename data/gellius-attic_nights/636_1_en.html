for not having been born ugly”; so that by the very fact of speaking thus he might reproach his accusers and wittily show that they were doing an absurd thing in making Caelius’ handsome person an accusation against him, just as if the person with which he was born depended upon his own volition.</p>

<p>Certain words from the first book of the <span class="italic">Annals</span> of Quintus Claudius, noted in a hasty reading.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Whenever</span> I read the book of an early writer, I tried afterwards, for the purpose of quickening my memory, to recall and review any passages in the book which were worthy of note, in the way either of praise or censure; and I found it an exceedingly helpful exercise for ensuring my recollection of elegant words and phrases, whenever need of them should arise. For example, in the first book of the <span class="italic">Annals</span> of Quintus Claudius, which I had read on the preceding two days, I noted these passages:</p>

<p>“While these things were going on,” he says,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL212_201_2" id="target_note_LCL212_201_2"><sup>2</sup></a> “the Latins, their spirits raised because of their easy victory, form a plan.” <span class="italic">Subnixo animo</span> is, significant and carefully chosen expression with the force of “raised and elevated in spirit”; and it indicates loftiness and confidence of spirit, since we are, as it were, raised and lifted up by that upon which we depend.</p>
