Herodotus in his <span class="italic">Histories</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_405_1" id="target_note_LCL195_405_1"><sup>1</sup></a> is the chronicler of that event, and the words which he says the son of Croesus first spoke are: “Man, do not kill Croesus.”</p>
<p>But also an athlete of Samos—his name was Echeklous—although he had previously been speechless,
is said to have begun to speak for a similar reason. For when in a sacred contest the casting of lots between the Samians and their opponents was not being done fairly, and he had noticed that a lot with a false name was being slipped in, he suddenly shouted in a loud voice to the man who was doing it that he saw what he was up to. And he too was freed from the check upon his speech and for all the remaining time of his life spoke without stammering
or lack of clearness.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_405_2a" id="target_note_LCL195_405_2a"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p><span class="sc">Among</span> fallacious arguments the one which the Greeks call ἀντιστρέφον seems to be by far the most fallacious. Such arguments some of our own philosophers
have rather appropriately termed <span class="italic">reciproca,</span> or “convertible.” The fallacy arises from the fact that the argument that is presented may be turned in the opposite direction and used against the one who has offered it, and is equally strong for both sides of the question. An example is the well-known argument which Protagoras, the keenest of all sophists, is said to have used against his pupil Euathlus.</p>
