feelings of his are wonderfully vivid and clear, but in Caecilius they are all dull and without any grace and dignity of expression. Afterwards, when the same slave by questioning has found out what has happened, in Menander he utters this lament:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_201_1" id="target_note_LCL195_201_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line indent1">Alas! thrice wretched he who weds, though</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">poor,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent1">And children gets. How foolish is the man</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent1">Who keeps no watch o’er his necessities,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent1">And if he luckless be in life’s routine,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent1">Can’t use his wealth as cloak, but buffeted</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent1">By ev’ry storm, lives helpless and in grief.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent1">All wretchedness he shares, of blessings none,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent1">Thus sorrowing for one I’d all men warn.</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">Let us consider whether Caecilius was sufficiently inspired to approach the sincerity and realism of these words. These are the lines of Caecilius, in which he gives some mangled fragments from Menander, patching them with the language of tragic bombast:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_201_2" id="target_note_LCL195_201_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line indent1">Unfortunate in truth the man, who poor,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent1">Yet children gets, to share his poverty.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent1">His fortune and his state at once are clear;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent1">The ill fame of the rich their set conceals.</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p>Accordingly, as I said above, when I read these passages of Caecilius by themselves, they seem by no means lacking in grace and spirit, but when I compare and match them with the Greek version, I feel that Caecilius should not have followed a guide with whom he could not keep pace.</p>
