Gracchus, although he was a bitter personal enemy of Publius Scipio Africanus because of numerous disagreements on political questions, publicly made oath that he had not been reconciled with Publius Africanus nor become his friend, and then read a decree which he had written out.</p>
<p>That decree ran as follows: “Whereas Lucius Cornelius Scipio Asiaticus, during the celebration of a triumph, cast the leaders of the enemy into prison, it seems contrary to the dignity of our country that the Roman people’s commander should be consigned to the same place to which he had committed the leaders of the enemy; therefore I forbid my colleague to take violent measures towards Lucius Scipio Asiaticus.”</p>
<p>But Valerius Antias, contradicting this record of the decrees and the testimony of the ancient annals, has said<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_81_1" id="target_note_LCL200_81_1"><sup>1</sup></a> that it was after the death of Africanus that Tiberius Gracchus interposed that veto in behalf of Scipio Asiaticus; also that Scipio was not fined, but that being convicted of embezzlement of the money taken from Antiochus and refusing to give bail, was just being taken to prison when he was saved by this veto of Gracchus.</p>

<p>I <span class="sc">have</span> found it noted in a certain commentary that the following lines were first read and published by Virgil in this form:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_81_2" id="target_note_LCL200_81_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
