<p>A discussion of the jurist Sextus Caecilius and the philosopher Favorinus about the laws of the <span class="italic">Twelve Tables.</span></p>
<p><span class="sc">Sextus Caecilius</span> was famed for his knowledge, experience and authority in the science of jurisprudence and in understanding and interpreting the laws of the Roman people. It happened that as we were waiting to pay our respects to Caesar,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL212_407_1" id="target_note_LCL212_407_1"><sup>1</sup></a> the philosopher Favorinus met and accosted Caecilius in the Palatine square<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL212_407_2" id="target_note_LCL212_407_2"><sup>2</sup></a> in my presence and that of several others. In the conversation which they carried on at the time mention was made of the laws of the decemvirs, which the board of ten appointed by the people for that purpose wrote and inscribed upon twelve tablets.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL212_407_3" id="target_note_LCL212_407_3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>When Sextus Caecilius, who had examined and studied the laws of many cities, said that they were drawn up in the most choice and concise terms, Favorinus rejoined: “It may be as you say in the greater part of those laws; for I read your twelve tables with as eager interest as I did the twelve books of Plato <span class="italic">On the Laws.</span> But some of them seem to me to be either very obscure or very cruel, or on the other hand too mild and lenient, or by no means to be taken exactly as they are written.”</p>
