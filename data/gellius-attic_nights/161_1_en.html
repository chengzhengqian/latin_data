five hundred sesterces out of a thousand that were owing him, we must say that he has received a half sestertium,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_281_1" id="target_note_LCL195_281_1"><sup>1</sup></a> not a halved one. But if a silver bowl,” he says, “which I own in common with another person, has been divided into two parts, I ought to speak of it as ‘halved,’ not as ‘a half’: but my share of the silver of which the bowl is made is a ‘half,’ not ‘halved.’” Thus Varro discusses and analyzes very acutely the difference between <span class="italic">dimidium</span> and <span class="italic">dimidiatum,</span> and he declares that Quintus Ennius spoke, in his <span class="italic">Annals,</span> with understanding in the line:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_281_2" id="target_note_LCL195_281_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line indent3">As if one brought a halved cup of wine,</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">and similarly the part that is missing from the cup should be spoken of as “half,” not “halved.”</p>
<p>Now the point of all this argument, which Varro sets forth acutely, it is true, but somewhat obscurely, is this: <span class="italic">dimidiatum</span> is equivalent to <span class="italic">dismediatum,</span> and means “divided into two parts,” and therefore <span class="italic">dimidiatum</span> cannot properly be used except of the thing itself that is divided; <span class="italic">dimidium,</span> however, is not that which is itself divided, but is one of the parts of what has been divided. Accordingly, when we wish to say that we have read the half part of a book or heard the half part of a play, if we say <span class="italic">dimidiam fabulam or dimidium librum,</span> we make a mistake; for in that case you are using <span class="italic">dimidium</span> of the whole thing which has been halved and divided. Therefore Lucilius, following this same rule, says:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_281_3" id="target_note_LCL195_281_3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
