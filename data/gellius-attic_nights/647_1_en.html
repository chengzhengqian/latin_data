<h3>That what Verrius Flaccus wrote about <span class="italic">servus recepticius,</span> in his second book <span class="italic">On the Obscurities of Marcus Cato,</span> is false.</h3>
<p><span class="sc">Marcus Cato,</span> when recommending the Voconian law,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL212_223_1" id="target_note_LCL212_223_1"><sup>1</sup></a> spoke as follows:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL212_223_2" id="target_note_LCL212_223_2"><sup>2</sup></a> “In the beginning the woman brought you a great dowry; then she holds back a large sum of money, which she does not entrust to the control of her husband, but lends it to her husband.

<p>But with the indulgence and pardon of those, if such there be, who are influenced by the authority of Verrius Flaccus, this must be said. That <span class="italic">recepticius servus</span> in the case of which Cato is speaking is something very different from what Verrius wrote.
