they call φρέαρ, and <span class="italic">lepus,</span> which they call λαγωός. But as to this, far from disparaging Aelius’ ability, I commend his diligence; for it is good fortune that brings success, endeavour that deserves praise.”</p>
<p>This is what Varro wrote in the first part of his book, with great skill in the explanation of words, with wide knowledge of the usage of both languages, and marked kindliness towards Aelius himself. But in the latter part of the same book he says that <span class="italic">fur</span> is so called because the early Romans used <span class="italic">furvus</span> for <span class="italic">ater</span> (“black”), and thieves steal most easily in the night, which is black. Is it not clear that Varro made the same mistake about <span class="italic">fur</span> that Aelius did about <span class="italic">lepus.</span> For what the Greeks now call κλέπτης, or “thief,” in the earlier Greek language was called φώρ. Hence, owing to the similarity in sound, he who in Greek is φώρ, in Latin is <span class="italic">fur.</span> But whether that fact escaped Varro’s memory at the time, or on the other hand he thought that <span class="italic">fur</span> was more appropriately and consistently named from <span class="italic">furvus,</span> that is, “black,” as to that question it is not for me to pass judgment on a man of such surpassing learning.</p>
