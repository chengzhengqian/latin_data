Lyceum,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_135_1" id="target_note_LCL200_135_1"><sup>1</sup></a> we were furnished with sport and amusement
by a certain man, of the kind that lays claim to a reputation for eloquence by a superficial and ill-regulated use of language, without having learned any of the usages and principles of the Latin tongue. For while Catullus in one of his poems had used the word <span class="italic">deprecor</span> rather cleverly, that fellow, unable to appreciate this, declared that the following verses which I have quoted were very flat, although in the judgment of all men they are most charming:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_135_2" id="target_note_LCL200_135_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line indent1">My Lesbia constantly speaks ill of me</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent1">And ceases not. By Jove! she cares for me!</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent1">How do I know? ’Tis just the same with me;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent1">I rail at, but by Jove! I worship, her.</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p>Our good man thought that <span class="italic">deprecor</span> in this passage was used in the sense that is commonly given the word by the vulgar; that is, “I pray earnestly,” “I beseech,” “I entreat,” where the preposition <span class="italic">de</span> is used intensively and emphatically. And if that were so, the verses would indeed be flat. But as a matter of fact the sense is exactly the opposite; for the preposition <span class="italic">de</span>, since it has a double force, contains two meanings in one and the same word. For <span class="italic">deprecor</span> is used by Catullus in the sense of “denounce, execrate, drive away,” or “avert by prayers”; but it also has the opposite meaning, when Cicero <span class="italic">In Defence of Publius Sulla</span> speaks as follows:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_135_3" id="target_note_LCL200_135_3"><sup>3</sup></a> “How many men’s lives did he beg off (<span class="italic">est deprecatus</span>) from Sulla.” Similarly in his speech <span class="italic">Against the Agrarian Law</span> Cicero says:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_135_4" id="target_note_LCL200_135_4"><sup>4</sup></a> “If I do any
