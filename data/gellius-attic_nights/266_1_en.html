Then one of the soldiers who were on trial before him asked in the usual way on what day and in what place he bade them give bail for their appearance. Then Scipio, stretching forth his hand towards the very citadel of the town which he was besieging, said: “Appear the day after to-morrow in yonder place.” And so it happened; on the third day, the day on which he had ordered them to appear, the town was captured, and on that same day he held court in the citadel of the place.</p>

<p>Of a disgraceful blunder of Caesellius Vindex, which we find in his work entitled <span class="italic">Archaic Terms.</span></p>
<p><span class="sc">In</span> those highly celebrated notes of Caesellius Vindex <span class="italic">On Archaic Terms</span> we find a shameful oversight, although in fact the man is seldom caught napping. This error has escaped the notice of many, in spite of their diligent search for opportunities to find fault with Caesellius, even through misrepresentation. Now, Caesellius wrote that Quintus Ennius, in the thirteenth book of his <span class="italic">Annals,</span> used <span class="italic">cor</span> in the masculine gender.</p>
<p>I add Caesellius’ own words: “Ennius used <span class="italic">cor,</span> like many other words, in the masculine gender; for in <span class="italic">Annals</span> xiii. he wrote <span class="italic">quem cor.</span>” He then quoted two verses of Ennius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_7_1" id="target_note_LCL200_7_1"><sup>1</sup></a>:</p>
