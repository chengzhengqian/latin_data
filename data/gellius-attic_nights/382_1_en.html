<p>The derivation and meaning of the word <span class="italic">mature</span>, and that it is generally used improperly; and also that the genitive of <span class="italic">praecox</span> is <span class="italic">praecocis</span> and not <span class="italic">praecoquis</span>.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Mature</span> in present usage signifies “hastily” and “quickly,” contrary to the true force of the word; for <span class="italic">mature</span> means quite a different thing. Therefore Publius Nigidius, a man eminent in the pursuit of all the liberal arts, says:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_239_1" id="target_note_LCL200_239_1"><sup>1</sup></a> “<span class="italic">Mature</span> means neither ‘too soon’ nor ‘too late,’ but something between the two and intermediate.”</p>
<p>Publius Nigidius has spoken well and properly. For of grain and fruits those are called <span class="italic">matura</span>, or “mature,” which are neither unripe and hard, nor falling and decayed, but full-grown and ripened in their proper time.

<p>That limitation of the word, and of the action itself, which was made by Nigidius was very elegantly expressed by the deified Augustus with two Greek words; for we are told that he used to say in conversation, and write in his letters, σπεῦδε βραδέως, that is, “make haste slowly,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_239_2" id="target_note_LCL200_239_2"><sup>2</sup></a> by which he recommended that to accomplish a result we should use at once the promptness of energy and the delay of carefulness, and it is from these two opposite qualities that <span class="italic">maturitas</span> springs.
