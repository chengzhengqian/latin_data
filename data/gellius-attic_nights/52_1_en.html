except that the first to be appointed was chosen by Numa. There is, however, a Papian law,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_63_1" id="target_note_LCL195_63_1"><sup>1</sup></a> which provides that twenty maidens be selected from the people at the discretion of the chief pontiff, that a choice by lot be made from that number in the assembly,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_63_2" id="target_note_LCL195_63_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and that the girl whose lot is drawn be “taken” by the chief pontiff and become Vesta’s. But that allotment in accordance with the Papian law is usually unnecessary at present. For if any man of respectable birth goes to the chief pontiff and offers his daughter for the priesthood, provided consideration may be given to her candidacy without violating any religious requirement, the senate grants him exemption from the Papian law.</p>
<p>Now the Vestal is said to be “taken,” it appears, because she is grasped by the hand of the chief pontiff and led away from the parent under whose control she is, as if she had been taken in war. In the first book of Fabius Pictor’s <span class="italic">History</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_63_3" id="target_note_LCL195_63_3"><sup>3</sup></a> the formula is given which the chief pontiff should use in choosing a Vestal. It is this: “I take thee, Amata, as one who has fulfilled all the legal requirements, to be priestess of Vesta, to perform the rites which it is lawful for a Vestal to perform for the Roman people, the Quirites.”</p>
<p>Now, many think that the term “taken” ought to be used only of a Vestal. But, as a matter of fact, the flamens of Jupiter also, as well as the augurs, were said to be “taken.” Lucius Sulla, in the second book of his <span class="italic">Autobiography,</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_63_4" id="target_note_LCL195_63_4"><sup>4</sup></a> wrote as follows: “Publius Cornelius, the first to receive the surname Sulla, was taken to be flamen of Jupiter.” Marcus
