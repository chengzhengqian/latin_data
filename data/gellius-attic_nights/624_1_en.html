Φαινεράτωρ, meaning ‘to appear at one’s best,’ since that class of men present an appearance of kindliness and pretend to be accommodating to poor men who are in need of money”; and he declared that this was stated by Hypsicrates, a grammarian whose books on <span class="italic">Words Borrowed from the Greeks</span> are very well known. But whether Cloatius himself or some other blockhead gave vent to this nonsense, nothing can be more silly. For <span class="italic">faenerator,</span> as Marcus Varro wrote in the third book of his <span class="italic">Latin Diction,</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL212_177_1" id="target_note_LCL212_177_1"><sup>1</sup></a> “is so called from <span class="italic">faenus,</span> or ‘interest,’ but <span class="italic">faenus,</span>” he says, “is derived from <span class="italic">fetus,</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL212_177_2a" id="target_note_LCL212_177_2a"><sup>2</sup></a> or ‘offspring,’ and from a birth, as it were, from money, producing and giving increase.” Therefore he says that Marcus Cato<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL212_177_3" id="target_note_LCL212_177_3"><sup>3</sup></a> and others of his time pronounced <span class="italic">fenerator</span> without the letter a, just as <span class="italic">fetus</span> itself and <span class="italic">fecunditas</span> were pronounced.</p>
