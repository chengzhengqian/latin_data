<p>“Similarly then,” he says, “with regard also to the wording of the law; if you divide and separate these two words <span class="italic">subruptum</span> and <span class="italic">erit</span>, so that you understand <span class="italic">subruptum erit</span> as you would <span class="italic">certamen erit</span>, that is, ‘there will be a contest,’ or <span class="italic">sacrificium erit</span> (there will be a sacrifice), then the law will seem to have reference to an act completed in future time; but if you understand the two words to be united and mingled, so that <span class="italic">subruptum erit</span> is not two words, but one, and is a single form of the passive inflection, then that word indicates past time no less than future.”</p>
