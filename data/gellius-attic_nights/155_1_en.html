the Greeks call πλειάδες; and it is likewise the number of those stars which some call ‘wandering,’ but Publius Nigidius ‘wanderers.’”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_269_1" id="target_note_LCL195_269_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Varro also says that there are seven circles in the heavens, perpendicular to its axis. The two smallest of these, which touch the ends of the axis, he says are called πόλοι, or “poles”; but that because of their small diameter they cannot be represented on what is termed an armillary sphere.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_269_2" id="target_note_LCL195_269_2"><sup>2</sup></a> And the zodiac itself is not uninfluenced by the number seven; for the summer solstice occurs in the seventh sign from the winter solstice, and the winter solstice in the seventh after the summer, and one equinox in the seventh sign after the other.

In this case he says that one should not only take note of the fact that the moon finishes its journey in four times seven, that is eight and twenty, days, but also that this number seven, if, beginning with one and going on until it reaches itself, it includes the sum of all the numbers through which it has passed and then adds itself, makes the number eight and twenty, which is the number of days of the revolution of the moon.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_269_5" id="target_note_LCL195_269_5"><sup>5</sup></a> He says that the influence of that number
