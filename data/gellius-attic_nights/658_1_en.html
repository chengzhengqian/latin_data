the rushing of lurid and spiral volumes of flame into the waters of the sea, like so many fiery serpents; but our poet, attempting to render ῥόον καπνοῦ αἴθωνα, ‘a lurid stream of smoke,’ has clumsily and diffusely piled up the words <span class="italic">atram nubem turbine piceo et favilla fumantem,</span> ‘a dusky cloud smoking with eddies black and glowing ash,’ and what Pindar called κρουνοί, or ‘founts,’ he has harshly and inaccurately rendered by ‘balls of flame.’ Likewise when he says <span class="italic">sidera lambit,</span> ‘it licks the stars,’ this also,” he says, “is a useless and foolish elaboration. And this too is inexplicable and almost incomprehensible, when he speaks of a ‘black cloud smoking with eddies black and glowing ash.’ For things which glow,” said Favorinus, “do not usually smoke nor are they black; unless <span class="italic">candenti</span> (‘glowing’) is used vulgarly and inaccurately for hot ashes, instead of those which are fiery and gleaming. For <span class="italic">candens,</span> of course, is connected with candor, or ‘whiteness,’ not with <span class="italic">color</span> (‘heat’). But when he says <span class="italic">saxa et scopulos eructari et erigi,</span> ‘that rocks and crags are spewed forth and whirled skyward,’ and that these same crags at once <span class="italic">liquefieri et gemere atque glomerari ad auras,</span> ‘are molten and groan and are whirled to heaven,’ this,” he said, “is what Pindar never wrote and what was never spoken by anyone; and it is the most monstrous of all monstrous descriptions.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL212_245_1" id="target_note_LCL212_245_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
