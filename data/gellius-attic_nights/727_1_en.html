But lest you should condemn us, that is, the Latin race, as lacking in Aphrodite’s charm, just as if we were barbarous and ignorant, allow me, I pray, to cover my head with my cloak (as they say Socrates did when making somewhat indelicate remarks), and hear and learn that our forefathers also were lovers and devoted to Venus before those poets whom you have named.”</p>
<p>Then lying upon his back with veiled head, he chanted in exceedingly sweet tones some verses of Valerius Aedituus, an early poet, and also of Porcius Licinus and Quintus Catulus; and I think that nothing can be found neater, more graceful, more polished and more terse than those verses, either in Greek or in Latin:</p>

<span class="line indent1">What shall I ask of you? Words fail my lips,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent1">A sudden sweat o’erflows my ardent<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL212_383_3" id="target_note_LCL212_383_3"><sup>3</sup></a> breast;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent1">Thus fond and silent, I refrain and die.</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">And he also added other verses of the same poet, no less sweet than the former ones:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL212_383_4" id="target_note_LCL212_383_4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
