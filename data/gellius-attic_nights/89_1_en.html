in which there is already some notion of compulsion by another; for a man who is carried is not his own master. But <span class="italic">vexare,</span> which is derived from <span class="italic">vehere,</span> unquestionably implies greater force and impulse. For <span class="italic">vexare</span> is properly used of one who is seized and carried away, and dragged about hither and yon; just as <span class="italic">taxare</span> denotes more forcible and repeated action than <span class="italic">tangere,</span> from which it is undoubtedly derived; and <span class="italic">iactare</span> a much fuller and more vigorous action than iacere, from which it comes; and <span class="italic">quassare</span> something severer and more violent than <span class="italic">quatere.</span> Therefore, merely because <span class="italic">vexare</span> is commonly used of the annoyance of smoke or wind or dust is no reason why the original force and meaning of the word should be lost; and that meaning was preserved by the earlier writers who, as became them, spoke correctly and clearly.</p>
<p>Marcus Cato, in the speech which he wrote On the <span class="italic">Achaeans,</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_137_1" id="target_note_LCL195_137_1"><sup>1</sup></a> has these words: “And when Hannibal was rending and harrying (<span class="italic">vexaret</span>) the land of Italy.” That is to say, Cato used <span class="italic">vexare</span> of the effect on Italy of Hannibal’s conduct, at a time when no species of disaster, cruelty or savagery could be imagined which Italy did not suffer from his hands. Marcus Tullius, in his fourth <span class="italic">Oration against Verres,</span> wrote: “This<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_137_2" id="target_note_LCL195_137_2"><sup>2</sup></a> was so pillaged and ravaged by that wretch, that it did not seem to have been laid waste (<span class="italic">vexata</span>) by an enemy who in the heat of war still felt some religious scruple and some respect for customary law, but by barbarous pirates.”</p>
<p>But concerning <span class="italic">inlaudatus</span> it seems possible to give two answers. One is of this kind: There is absolutely no one who is of so perverted a character
