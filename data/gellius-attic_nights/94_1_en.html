marry a woman of ill repute, infamous and criminal, or to speak in defence of a Catiline, a Tubulus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_147_1a" id="target_note_LCL195_147_1a"><sup>1</sup></a> or a Publius Clodius, of course he ought not to be obeyed, since by the addition of a certain degree of evil these acts cease to be inherently neutral and indifferent. Hence the premise of those who say that “the commands of a father are either honourable or base” is incomplete, and it cannot be considered what the Greeks call “a sound and regular disjunctive proposition.” For that disjunctive premise lacks the third member, “or are neither honourable nor base.” If this be added, the conclusion cannot be drawn that a father’s command must never be obeyed.</p>

<p>The unfairness of Plutarch’s criticism of Epicurus’ knowledge of the syllogism.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Plutarch</span>, in the second book of his essay On <span class="italic">Homer,</span><sup>2</sup> asserts that Epicurus made use of an incomplete, perverted and faulty syllogism, and he quotes Epicurus’ own words:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_147_3" id="target_note_LCL195_147_3"><sup>3</sup></a> “Death is nothing to us, for what is dissolved is without perception, and what is without perception is nothing to us.” “Now Epicurus,” says Plutarch, “omitted what he ought to have stated as his major premise, that death is a dissolution of body and soul, and then, to prove something else, he goes on to use the very premise that he had omitted, as if it had been stated and conceded. But this syllogism,” says Plutarch, “cannot advance, unless that premise be first presented.”</p>
