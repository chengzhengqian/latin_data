Then the Athenians themselves added to this collection with considerable diligence and care; but later Xerxes, when he got possession of Athens and burned the entire city except the citadel,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_139_2" id="target_note_LCL200_139_2"><sup>2</sup></a> removed that whole collection of books and carried them off to Persia. Finally, a long time afterwards, king Seleucus, who was surnamed Nicanor, had all those books taken back to Athens.</p>
