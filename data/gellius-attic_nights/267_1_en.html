<p class="noindent">The speaker is Antiochus, king of Asia. He is surprised and indignant that Hannibal, the Carthaginian, discourages his desire to make war on the people of Rome.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_9_1" id="target_note_LCL200_9_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Now, Caesellius understands the lines to mean that Antiochus says: “Hannibal dissuades me from making war. In so doing, what kind of heart does he think I have, and how foolish does he believe me to be, when he gives me such advice?”</p>
<p>So Caesellius; but Ennius’ meaning was quite different. For there are three verses, not two, which belong to this utterance of the poet’s, and Caesellius overlooked the third verse:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line indent1">Through valour war’s great advocate and friend.</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">The meaning and arrangement of these three verses I believe to be this: “Hannibal, that boldest and most valiant of men, who I believed (for that is the meaning of <span class="italic">cor meum credidit,</span> exactly as if he had said “who I, foolish man, believed”) would strongly advise war, discourages and dissuades me from making war.” Caesellius, however, somewhat carelessly misled as to the connection of the words, assumed that Ennius said <span class="italic">quem cor</span>, reading <span class="italic">quem</span> with an acute accent,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_9_2" id="target_note_LCL200_9_2"><sup>2</sup></a> as if it belonged with <span class="italic">cor</span> and not with <span class="italic">Hannibal</span>. But I am well aware that one might, if anyone should have so little understanding, defend Caesellius’ masculine <span class="italic">cor</span> by maintaining that the third verse should be read apart from the others, as if Antiochus had exclaimed in broken and abrupt language “a mighty adviser!” But those who would argue thus do not deserve a reply.</p>
