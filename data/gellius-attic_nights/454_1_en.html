<p>On the Enigma.</p>
<p><span class="sc">The</span> kind of composition which the Greeks call “enigmas,” some of our early writers called <span class="italic">scirpi,</span> or “rushes.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_383_1" id="target_note_LCL200_383_1"><sup>1</sup></a> An example is the enigma composed of three iambic trimeters which I recently found—very

<span class="line indent1">Or both of these, who would not give his place,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent1">As I once heard it said, to Jove himself.</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
