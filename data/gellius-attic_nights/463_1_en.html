question is the one which you raise, namely, whether the decision may lawfully be rendered also on the Kalends. But undoubtedly the word itself is of such origin and such a nature that when the expression
‘within the Kalends’ is used, no other day ought to be meant than the Kalends alone. For those three words <span class="italic">intra, citra, ultra</span> (within, this side, beyond), by which definite boundaries of places are indicated, among the early writers were expressed by monosyllables, <span class="italic">in, cis, uls</span>. Then, since these particles had a somewhat obscure utterance because of their brief and slight sound, the same syllable was added to all three words, and what was formerly <span class="italic">cis Tiberim</span> (on this side of the Tiber) and <span class="italic">uls Tiberim</span> (beyond the Tiber) began to be called <span class="italic">citra Tiberim</span> and <span class="italic">ultra Tiberim</span>; and <span class="italic">in</span> also became <span class="italic">intra</span> by the addition of the same syllable.’ Therefore all these expressions are, so to speak, related, being united by common terminations: <span class="italic">intra oppidum, ultra oppidum, citra oppidum</span>, of which <span class="italic">intra</span>, as I have said, is equivalent to <span class="italic">in</span>; for one who says <span class="italic">intra oppidum, intra cubiculum, intra ferias</span> means nothing else than <span class="italic">in oppido</span> (in the town), <span class="italic">in cubiculo</span> (in the room), <span class="italic">in feriis</span> (during the festival).</p>

Therefore, according to the meaning of the word itself, one who is ordered to give judgment ‘within the Kalends,’ unless he do so on the Kalends, acts contrary to the order contained in the phrase; for if he does so earlier, he renders a decision not ‘within’ but ‘before the Kalends.’ But somehow or other the utterly absurd interpretation has been generally adopted,
