<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">iniice</span> is to be written and pronounced as I have indicated above, unless anyone is so ignorant as to lengthen the preposition <span class="italic">in</span> in this word too for the sake of the metre.</p>
<p>We ask then for what reason the letter <span class="italic">o</span> in <span class="italic">obicibus</span> is lengthened, since this word is derived from the verb <span class="italic">obiicio</span>, and is not at all analogous to <span class="italic">motus,</span> which is from <span class="italic">moveo</span> and is pronounced with a long <span class="italic">o</span>. I myself recall that Sulpicius Apollinaris, a man eminent for his knowledge of literature, pronounced <span class="italic">obices</span> and <span class="italic">obicibus</span> with a short <span class="italic">o</span>, and that in Virgil too he read in the same way the lines:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_367_1" id="target_note_LCL195_367_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line indent1">And by what force the oceans fathomless</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent1">Rise, bursting all their bounds (<span class="italic">obicibus</span>);</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">but, as I have indicated, he gave the letter <span class="italic">i</span>, which in that word also should be doubled, a somewhat fuller and longer sound.</p>
<p>It is consistent therefore that <span class="italic">subices</span> also, which is formed exactly like <span class="italic">obices</span>, should be pronounced with the letter <span class="italic">u</span> short. Ennius, in his tragedy which is entitled <span class="italic">Achilles</span>, uses <span class="italic">subices</span> for the upper air which is directly below the heavens, in these lines:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_367_2" id="target_note_LCL195_367_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line indent1">By lofty, humid regions (<span class="italic">subices</span>) of the gods I</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">swear,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent1">Whence comes the storm with savage roaring</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">wind;</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">yet, in spite of what I have said, you may hear almost everyone read <span class="italic">subices</span> with a long <span class="italic">u</span>. But Marcus Cato uses that very verb with another prefix in the speech which he delivered <span class="italic">On his Consulship</span>:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_367_3" id="target_note_LCL195_367_3"><sup>3</sup></a> â€œSo the wind bears them to the beginning of the
