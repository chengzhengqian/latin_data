For in the second book of Publius Nigidius’ treatise <span class="italic">On Wind</span> are these words:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_193_1" id="target_note_LCL195_193_1"><sup>1</sup></a> “Both the ἐτησίαι and the annual south winds follow the sun.” We ought therefore to inquire into the meaning of “follow the sun.”</p>
<h3><span class="ac">XXIII</span></h3>
<p>A discussion and comparison of passages taken from the comedy of Menander and that of Caecilius, entitled <span class="italic">Plocium</span>.</p>
<p>I <span class="sc">often</span> read comedies which our poets have adapted and translated from the Greeks—Menander or Posidippus, Apollodorus or Alexis, and also some other comic writers. And while I am reading them, they do not seem at all bad; on the contrary, they appear to be written with a wit and charm which you would say absolutely could not be surpassed. But if you compare and place beside them the Greek originals from which they came, and if you match individual passages, reading them together alternately with care and attention, the Latin versions at once begin to appear exceedingly commonplace and mean; so dimmed are they by the wit and brilliance of the Greek comedies, which they were unable to rival.</p>
<p>Only recently I had an experience of this kind. I was reading the <span class="italic">Plocium</span> or <span class="italic">Necklace</span> of Caecilius, much to the delight of myself and those who were present. The fancy took us to read also the <span class="italic">Plocium</span> of Menander, from which Caecilius had translated the said comedy. But after we took Menander in hand, good Heavens! how dull and lifeless, and how different from Menander did Caecilius appear!
