<p>Also in the speech which he wrote <span class="italic">In Defence of Publius Sestius</span> Cicero says “within Mount Taurus” in such a way as to mean, not “on Mount Taurus,” but “as far as the mountain and including the mountain itself.” These are Cicero’s own words in the speech which I have mentioned:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_407_1" id="target_note_LCL200_407_1"><sup>1</sup></a> “Our forbears, having overcome Antiochus the Great after a mighty struggle on land and sea, ordered him to confine his realm ‘within Mount Taurus.’ Asia, which they had taken from him, they gave to Attalus, to be his kingdom.” Cicero says: “They ordered him to confine his realm within Mount Taurus,” which is not the same as when we say “within the room,” unless “within the mountain” may appear to mean what is within the regions which are separated by the interposition of Mount Taurus.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_407_2" id="target_note_LCL200_407_2"><sup>2</sup></a> For just as one who is “within a room” is not in the walls of the room, but is within the walls by which the room is enclosed, which walls themselves are yet equally in the room, just so one who rules “within Mount Taurus,” not only rules on Mount Taurus but also in those regions which are bounded by Mount Taurus.</p>
<p>According therefore to the analogy of the words of Marcus Tullius may not one who is bidden to make a decision “within the Kalends” lawfully make it before the Kalends and on the Kalends themselves? And this results, not from a sort of privilege conceded to ignorant usage, but from an accurate regard for reason, since all time which is embraced by the day of the Kalends is correctly said to be “within the Kalends.”</p>
