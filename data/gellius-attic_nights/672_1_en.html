<p>The times after the founding of Rome and before the second war with Carthage at which distinguished Greeks and Romans flourished.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL212_273_1" id="target_note_LCL212_273_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>I <span class="sc">wished</span> to have a kind of survey of ancient times, and also of the famous men who were born in those days, lest I might in conversation chance to make some careless remark about the date and life of celebrated men, as that ignorant sophist did who lately, in a public lecture, said that Carneades the philosopher<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL212_273_2a" id="target_note_LCL212_273_2a"><sup>2</sup></a> was presented with a sum of money by king Alexander, son of Philip, and that Panaetius the Stoic was intimate with the elder Africanus.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL212_273_3" id="target_note_LCL212_273_3"><sup>3</sup></a> In order, I say, to guard against such errors in dates and periods of time, I made notes from the books known as <span class="italic">Chronicles</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL212_273_4" id="target_note_LCL212_273_4"><sup>4</sup></a> of the times when those Greeks and Romans flourished who were famous and conspicuous either for talent or for political power, between the founding of Rome and the second Punic war.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL212_273_5" id="target_note_LCL212_273_5"><sup>5</sup></a> And these excerpts of mine, made in various and sundry places, I have now put hastily together. For it was not my endeavour with keen and subtle care to compile a catalogue of the eminent men of both nations who lived at the same time, but merely to strew these <span class="italic">Nights</span> of mine

Note, i. p. xxiv) that, besides the<span class="italic"> Chronica</span> of Cornelius Nepos, Gellius made use of Varronian sources, which used a different chronology. According to the source which he followed, Gellius’ dates aro reckoned from 751 (Nepos) or 753 <span class="sc">b.c.</span> (Varro) as the date of the founding of Rome. He does not, however, confuse these epochs in speaking of the same event. In my notes the Varronian chronology is followed, except as otherwise indicated;
