and Fannius and other sumptuary laws? Yet all these have been wiped out and buried by the wealth of the State, as if by the waves of a swelling sea. But why did that law appear to you inhumane which in my opinion is the most humane of all; that law, namely, which provides that a beast be furnished for a sick or aged man who is called into court? The words of that law, ‘if he summon him to court,’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL212_417_1" id="target_note_LCL212_417_1"><sup>1</sup></a> are as follows:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL212_417_2" id="target_note_LCL212_417_2"><sup>2</sup></a> ‘If disease or age be a hindrance, let the summoner provide a beast; if he does not wish, he need not spread a covered waggon.’ Do you by any chance suppose that <span class="italic">morbus</span> (disease) here means a dangerous sickness with a high fever and ague, and that <span class="italic">iumentum</span> (beast) means only one animal, capable of carrying someone on his back; and is it for that reason that you think it was inhumane for a man lying sick-a-bed at his home to be placed upon a beast and hurried off to court?
