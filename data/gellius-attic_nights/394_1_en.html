Now Mausolus, as Marcus Tullius tells us,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_263_1" id="target_note_LCL200_263_1"><sup>1</sup></a> was king of the land of Caria; according to some Greek historians he was governor of a province, the official whom the Greeks term a satrap. When this Mausolus had met his end amid the lamentations and in the arms of his wife,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_263_2" id="target_note_LCL200_263_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and had been buried with a magnificent funeral, Artemisia, inflamed with grief and with longing for her spouse, mingled his bones and ashes with spices, ground them into the form of a powder, put them in water, and drank them; and she is said to have given many other proofs of the violence of her passion. For perpetuating the memory of her husband, she also erected, with great expenditure of labour, that highly celebrated tomb,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_263_3a" id="target_note_LCL200_263_3a"><sup>3</sup></a> which has been deemed worthy of being numbered among the seven wonders of the world.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_263_4" id="target_note_LCL200_263_4"><sup>4</sup></a> When Artemisia dedicated this monument, consecrated to the deified shades of Mausolus, she instituted an <span class="italic">agon</span>, that is to say, a contest in celebrating his praises, offering magnificent prizes of money and other valuables. Three men distinguished for their eminent talent and eloquence are said to have come to contend in this eulogy, Theopompus, Theodectes<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_263_5" id="target_note_LCL200_263_5"><sup>5</sup></a> and Naucrates; some have even written that Isocrates himself entered the lists with them. But Theopompus was adjudged the victor in that contest. He was a pupil of Isocrates.</p>
