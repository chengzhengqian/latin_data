own kind, have the same meaning that is indicated by the words from which they are derived. But I should prefer to seem not to understand the meaning of “act the laugher” or “imitate the laugher” rather than charge Scaurus himself with lack of knowledge. But Scaurus ought rather, in censuring the commentaries of Caesellius, to have taken him to task for what he left unsaid; namely, whether <span class="italic">ludibundus, ridibundus</span> and <span class="italic">errabundus</span> differ at all from <span class="italic">ludens, ridens</span> and <span class="italic">errans</span>, and to what extent, and so with other words of the same kind; whether they differ only in some slight degree from their primitives, and what is the general force of the suffix which is added to words of that kind. For in examining a phenomenon of that nature that were a more pertinent inquiry, just as in <span class="italic">vinulentus, lutulentus</span> and <span class="italic">turbulentus</span> it is usual to ask whether that suffix is superfluous and without meaning, παραγωγή, as the Greeks say,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_335_1" id="target_note_LCL200_335_1"><sup>1</sup></a> or whether the suffix has some special force of its own.</p>
<p>However, in noting this criticism of Scaurus it occurred to me that Sisenna, in the fourth book of his <span class="italic">Histories</span>, used a word of the same form. He says:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_335_2" id="target_note_LCL200_335_2"><sup>2</sup></a> “He came to the town, laying waste the fields (<span class="italic">populabundus</span>),” which of course means “while he was laying waste the fields,” not, as Sisenna says of similar words, “when he played the part of, or imitated, one laying waste.”</p>
<p>But when I was inquiring about the signification and origin of such forms as <span class="italic">populabundus, errabundus, laetabundus, ludibundus,</span> and many other words of that kind, our friend Apollinaris—very appositely by Heaven!—remarked
that it seemed to him that the final syllable of such words indicated force and abundance, and as it were, an excess of the quality belonging to
