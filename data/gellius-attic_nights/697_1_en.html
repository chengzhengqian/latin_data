had said it, would it not have seemed worthy of remembrance?”</p>
<p>But a little later Domitius sent Favorinus the book which he had promised—I think it was one by Verrius Flaccus—in which the following was written with regard to questions of that kind:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL212_323_1" id="target_note_LCL212_323_1"><sup>1</sup></a> that <span class="italic">senatus</span> (senate) was used both of a place and of persons; <span class="italic">civitas</span> (state) of a situation and a town, also of the rights of a community, and of a body of men; further that <span class="italic">tribus</span> (tribes) and <span class="italic">decuriae</span> (decuries) designated places, privileges and persons, and that <span class="italic">contio</span> had three meanings: the place and tribunal from which speaking was done, as Marcus Tullius in his speech, <span class="italic">In Reply to the Address of Quintus Metellus</span>, says:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL212_323_2" id="target_note_LCL212_323_2"><sup>2</sup></a> “I mounted the tribunal (<span class="italic">contionem</span>); the people assembled.” It also signifies an assembly of the people gathered together, since the same Marcus Tullius says in his <span class="italic">Orator</span>:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL212_323_3" id="target_note_LCL212_323_3"><sup>3</sup></a> “I have often heard audiences (<span class="italic">contiones</span>) cry out, when words ended in a proper rhythm; for the ears expect the thought to be expressed in harmonious words.’’ It likewise designated the speech itself which was made to the people.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL212_323_4" id="target_note_LCL212_323_4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>Examples of these uses were not given in that book. But afterwards I found and showed to Favorinus at his request instances of all these meanings in Cicero, as I remarked above, and in the most elegant of the early writers; but that which he especially desired, an example of <span class="italic">contio</span> used for words and of a speech, I pointed out in the title of a book by Cicero, which he had called <span class="italic">In Reply to the Address of Quintus Metellus</span>; for there <span class="italic">Contionem</span>
