<p>The names of certain weapons, darts and swords, and also of boats and ships, which are found in the books of the early writers.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Once</span> upon a time, when I was riding in a carriage, to keep my mind from being dull and unoccupied and a prey to worthless trifles, it chanced to occur to me to try to recall the names of weapons, darts and swords which are found in the early histories, and also the various kinds of boats and their names. Those, then, of the former that came to mind at the time are the following: spear, pike, fire-pike, half-pike, iron bolt, Gallic spear, lance, hunting-darts, javelins, long bolts, barbed-javelins, German spears, thronged-javelin,
Gallic bolt, broadswords, poisoned arrows,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_285_1" id="target_note_LCL200_285_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Illyrian hunting-spears, cimeters, darts, swords, daggers, broadswords, double-edged swords, smallswords, poniards, cleavers.</p>
<p>Of the <span class="italic">lingula</span>, or “little tongue,” since it is less common, I think I ought to say that the ancients applied that term to an oblong small-sword, made in the form of a tongue; it is mentioned by Naevius in his tragedy <span class="italic">Hesione</span>. I quote the line:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_285_2" id="target_note_LCL200_285_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line indent1">Pray let me seem to please you with my tongue,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent1">But with my little tongue (<span class="italic">lingula</span>).</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="italic">rumpia</span> too is a kind of weapon of the Thracian people, and the word occurs in the fourteenth book of the <span class="italic">Annals</span> of Quintus Ennius.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_285_3" id="target_note_LCL200_285_3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
