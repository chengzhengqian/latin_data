<p>The meaning of the phrase <span class="italic">cx iure manum consertum.</span></p>
<p><span class="italic">Ex iure manum consertum,</span> or “lay on hands according to law,” is a phrase taken from ancient cases at law, and commonly used to-day when a case is tried before the praetor and claims are made. I asked a Roman grammarian, a man of wide reputation and great name, what the meaning of these words was. But he, looking scornfully at me, said: “Either you are making a mistake, youngster, or you are jesting; for I teach grammar and do not give legal advice. If you want to know anything connected with Virgil, Plautus or Ennius, you may ask me.”</p>
<p>“It is a question from Ennius then, master,” said I, “that I am asking. For it was Ennius who used those words.” And when the grammarian said in great surprise that the words were unsuited to poetry and that they were not to be found anywhere in the poems of Ennius, I quoted from memory the following lines from the eighth book of the <span class="italic">Annals;</span> for it chanced that I remembered them because of their particularly striking character:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL212_447_3" id="target_note_LCL212_447_3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
