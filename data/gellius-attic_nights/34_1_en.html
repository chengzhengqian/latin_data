preserve the truth of the proposition. Now the comparison of a debt of gratitude with a pecuniary debt demands the use of the word ‘debt’ in both instances. For a debt of money and a debt of gratitude will seem to be properly compared, if we may say that both money and gratitude are owed; but let us consider what happens in the owing or paying of money, and on the other hand in the owing and paying of a debt of gratitude, if we retain the word ‘debt’ in both instances. Now Cicero,” continued Julianus, “having said that a debt of money was a different thing from a debt of gratitude, in giving his reason for that statement applies the word ‘owe’ to money, but in the case of gratitude substitutes ‘has’ (<span class="italic">i.e</span>. ‘feels’) for ‘owes’; for this is what he says: ‘But in the case of a debt of gratitude, he who returns it has it; and he who has it returns it by the mere fact of having it.’ But that word ‘has’ does not exactly fit the proposed comparison. For it is the owing, and not the having, of gratitude that is compared with money, and therefore it would have been more consistent to say: ‘He who owes pays by the mere fact of owing.’ But it would be absurd and quite too forced if a debt of gratitude that was not yet paid should be said to be paid by the mere fact that it was owed. Therefore,” said Julianus, “Cicero made a change and substituted a similar word for one which he had dropped, in order to seem to have kept the idea of a comparison of debts, and at the same time retained the careful balance of his period.” Thus it was that Julianus elucidated and criticized passages in the earlier literature, which a select group of young men read under his guidance.</p>
