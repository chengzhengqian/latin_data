preferred to say <span class="italic">mortalibus</span> rather than <span class="italic">hominibus?</span> And do you think that he would have described a multitude in the same way if he said <span class="italic">cum multis hominibus</span> and not <span class="italic">cum multis mortalibus?</span> For my part,’ continued Fronto, “unless my regard and veneration for this writer, and for all early Latin, blinds my judgment, I think that it is far, far fuller, richer and more comprehensive in describing almost the whole population of the city to have said <span class="italic">mortales</span> rather than <span class="italic">homines.</span> For the expression’ many men’ may be confined and limited to even a moderate number, but’ many mortals’ somehow in some indefinable manner includes almost all the people in the city, of every rank, age and sex; so you see Quadrigarius, wishing to describe the crowd as vast and mixed, as in fact it was, said that. Metellus came into the Capitol’ with many mortals, speaking with more force than if he had said’ with many men.’”</p>
<p>When we, as was fitting, had expressed, not only approval, but admiration of all this that we had heard from Fronto, he said: “Take care, however, not to think that <span class="italic">mortales multi</span> is to be used always and everywhere in place of <span class="italic">multi homines,</span> lest that Greek proverb, τὸ ἐπὶ τῇ φακῇ μύρον, or ‘myrrh on lentils,’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_509_1" id="target_note_LCL200_509_1"><sup>1</sup></a> which is found in one of Varro’s <span class="italic">Satires,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_509_2" id="target_note_LCL200_509_2"><sup>2</sup></a></span>
be applied to you.” This judgment of Fronto’s, though relating to trifling and unimportant words, I thought I ought not to pass by, lest the somewhat subtle distinction between words of this kind should escape and elude us.</p>
