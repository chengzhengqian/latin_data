<p>When trying, in the phrase ξυνετοὶ γάρ εἰσιν, to express the word ξυνετοί by a single Latin term, I found nothing better than what is written by Marcus Cato in the sixth book of his <span class="italic">Origins:</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL212_437_1" id="target_note_LCL212_437_1"><sup>1</sup></a> “Therefore I think the information is more comprehensible (<span class="italic">cognobilior)</span>.”</p>

<p>It is asked and discussed whether it it is more correct to say <span class="italic">habeo curam vestri,</span> or <span class="italic">vestrum.</span></p>
<p>I <span class="sc">asked</span> Sulpicius Apollinaris, when I was studying with him at Rome in my youth, on what principle people said <span class="italic">habeo curam. vestri,</span> or “I have care for you,” and <span class="italic">misereor vestri,</span> or “I pity you,” and what he thought the nominative case of <span class="italic">vestri</span> was in such connections. Thereupon he answered me as follows: “You ask something of me about which I too have long been in a state of uncertainty. For it seems to me that one ought to say, not <span class="italic">vestri,</span> but <span class="italic">vestrum,</span> just as the Greeks say ἐπιμελοῦμαι ὑμῶν and κήδομαι ὑμῶν, where ὑμῶν is translated by <span class="italic">vestrum</span> more fittingly than by <span class="italic">vestri,</span> having <span class="italic">vos</span> for the naming case, or the ‘direct’ case, as you called it. Yet in not a few places,” said he, “I find <span class="italic">nostri</span> and <span class="italic">vestri,</span> not <span class="italic">nostrum</span> or <span class="italic">vestrum.</span> Thus Lucius Sulla says, in the second book of his <span class="italic">Autobiography:</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL212_437_2" id="target_note_LCL212_437_2"><sup>2</sup></a> “But if it is possible that even now you think of me (<span class="italic">nostri</span>), and believe me worthy to be your fellow citizen rather than your enemy, and to fight for you rather than against you, this will surely be due to my services and those of my forefathers.” Also Terence in the <span class="italic">Phormio:</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL212_437_3" id="target_note_LCL212_437_3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
