his friend the consul, who was hearing cases from the tribunal—and I at the time was in attendance on him—he asked, I say, what that inscription <span class="italic">manubiae</span> seemed to us really to mean. Then one of those who were with him, a man of a great and wide-spread reputation for his devotion to learned pursuits, said: “<span class="italic">Ex manubiis</span> is the same as <span class="italic">ex praeda</span>; for <span class="italic">manubiae</span> is the term for booty which is taken <span class="italic">manu</span>, that is ‘by hand.’” Then Favorinus rejoined: “Although my principal and almost my entire attention has been given to the literature and arts of Greece, I am nevertheless not so inattentive to the Latin language, to which I devote occasional or desultory study, as to be unaware of this common interpretation of <span class="italic">manubiae</span>, which makes it a synonym of <span class="italic">praeda</span>. But I raise the question, whether Marcus Tullius, a man most careful in his diction, in the speech which he delivered against Rullus on the first of January <span class="italic">On the Agrarian Law</span>, joined <span class="italic">manubiae</span> and <span class="italic">praeda</span> by an idle and inelegant repetition, if it be true that these two words have the same meaning and do not differ in any respect at all.” And then, such was Favorinus’ marvellous and almost miraculous memory, he at once added Cicero’s own words.
