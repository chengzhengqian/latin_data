was readily agreed and accepted, that in accordance with the usage of the Roman people the place next after parents should be held by wards entrusted to our honour and protection; that second to them came clients, who also had committed themselves to our honour and guardianship; that then in the third place were guests; and finally relations by blood and by marriage.</p>
<p>Of this custom and practice there are numerous proofs and illustrations in the ancient records, of which, because it is now at hand, I will cite only this one at present, relating to clients and kindred. Marcus Cato in the speech which he delivered before the censors <span class="italic">Against Lentulus</span> wrote thus:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_419_1" id="target_note_LCL195_419_1"><sup>1</sup></a> “Our forefathers regarded it as a more sacred obligation to defend their wards than not to deceive a client. One testifies in a client’s behalf against one’s relatives; testimony against a client is given by no one. A father held the first position of honour; next after him a patron.”</p>
<p>Masurius Sabinus, however, in the third book of his <span class="italic">Civil Law</span> assigns a higher place to a guest than to a client. The passage from that book is this:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_419_2" id="target_note_LCL195_419_2"><sup>2</sup></a> “In the matter of obligations our forefathers observed
the following order: first to a ward, then to a guest, then to a client, next to a blood relation, finally to a relation by marriage. Other things being equal, women were given preference to men, but a ward who was under age took precedence of one who was a grown woman. Also those who were appointed by will to be guardians of the sons of a man against whom they had appeared in court, appeared for the ward in the same case.”</p>
<p>Very clear and strong testimony on this subject
