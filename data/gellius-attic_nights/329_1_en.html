in rejecting common words, thought that the first man had been guilty of a barbarism, maintaining that he ought to have lengthened the <span class="italic">e</span>, rather than shortened it. For he asserted that <span class="italic">quiescit</span> ought to be pronounced like <span class="italic">calescit, nitescit, stupescit</span> and many other words of that kind. He also added the statement that <span class="italic">quies</span> (quiet) is pronounced with the <span class="italic">e</span> long, not short.
