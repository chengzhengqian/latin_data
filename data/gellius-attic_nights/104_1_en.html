an error, and says that the cause of the error is the phrase <span class="italic">quem tibi longaevo</span>. “<span class="italic">Longaevo</span>,” he says, “does not mean ‘when old,’ for that is contrary to historical truth, but rather ‘admitted into a life that is now long and unending, and made immortal.’ For Anchises, who says this to his son, knew that after Aeneas had ended his life among men he would be immortal and a local deity, and enjoy a long and everlasting existence.” Thus Apollinaris, ingeniously enough. But yet a “long life” is one thing, and an “unending life” another, and the-gods are not called “of great age,” but “immortal.”</p>

<p>Marcus Cicero’s observations on the nature of certain prepositions; to which is added a discussion of the particular matter which Cicero had observed.</p>
<p><span class="sc">After</span> careful observation Marcus Tullius noted that the prepositions <span class="italic">in</span> and <span class="italic">con</span>, when prefixed to nouns and verbs, are lengthened and prolonged when they are followed by the initial letters of <span class="italic">sapiens</span> and <span class="italic">felix</span>; but that in all other instances they are pronounced short.</p>
<p>Cicero’s words are:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_167_1" id="target_note_LCL195_167_1"><sup>1</sup></a> “Indeed, what can be more elegant than this, which does not come about from a natural law, but in accordance with a kind of usage? We pronounce the first vowel in <span class="italic">indoctus</span> short, in <span class="italic">insanus</span> long; in <span class="italic">immanis</span> short, in <span class="italic">infelix</span> long; in brief, in compound words in which the first letters are those which begin <span class="italic">sapiens</span> and <span class="italic">felix</span> the prefix is pronounced long, in all others short; thus we have <span class="italic">cŏnposuit</span> but <span class="italic">cōnsuevit, cŏncrepuit</span>
