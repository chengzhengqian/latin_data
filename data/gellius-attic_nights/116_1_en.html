<p>This is what Favorinus recounted to us at his own table at the time I mentioned, with extreme elegance of diction and in a delightful and graceful style throughout. But as to his statement that the wind which blows from the land of Gaul is called <span class="italic">circius</span>, Marcus Cato in his <span class="italic">Origins</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_191_4" id="target_note_LCL195_191_4"><sup>4</sup></a> calls that wind, not <span class="italic">circius</span>, but <span class="italic">cercius</span>. For writing about the Spaniards who dwell on this side the Ebro, he set down these words: “But in this district are the finest iron and silver mines, also a great mountain of pure salt; the more you take from it, the more it grows. The <span class="italic">cercius</span> wind, when you speak, fills your mouth; it overturns an armed man or a loaded wagon.”</p>
<p>In saying above that the ἐτησίαι blow from one or another quarter of the heavens, although following the opinion of many, I rather think I spoke hastily.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_191_5" id="target_note_LCL195_191_5"><sup>5</sup></a>
