across,’ and this word itself refers to walking and stepping with the feet.” Therefore Pollio thought that the verb <span class="italic">transgredi</span> did not apply to those who fly or creep or sail, but only to those who walk and measure the way with their feet. Hence they say that in no good writer can <span class="italic">transgressus</span> be found applied to ships, or as the equivalent of <span class="italic">transfreiatio</span>.</p>
<p>But, since <span class="italic">cursus,</span> or “running,” is often correctly used of ships, I ask why it is that ships may not be said to make a <span class="italic">transgressus,</span> especially since the small extent of the narrow strait which flows between Spain and the Afric land is most elegantly described by the word <span class="italic">transgressio,</span> as being a distance of only a few steps. But as to those who ask for authority and assert that <span class="italic">ingredi</span> or <span class="italic">transgredi</span> has not been used of sailing, I should like them to tell me how much difference they think there is between <span class="italic">ingredi,</span> or “march,” and <span class="italic">ambulare,</span> or “walk.” Yet Cato in his book <span class="italic">On Farming</span> says:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_289_1" id="target_note_LCL200_289_1"><sup>1</sup></a> “farm should be chosen in a situation where there is a large town near by and the sea, or a river where ships pass (<span class="italic">ambulant</span>).” Moreover Lucretius, by the use of this same expression, bears testimony that such figures are intentional and are regarded as ornaments of diction. For in his fourth book he speaks of a shout as “marching” (<span class="italic">gradientem</span>) through the windpipe and jaws, which is much bolder than the Sallustian expression about the ships. The lines of Lucretius are as follows:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_289_2" id="target_note_LCL200_289_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line indent1">The voice besides doth often scrape the throat;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>

<span class="line indent3">windpipe rough.</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
