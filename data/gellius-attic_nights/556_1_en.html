that <span class="italic">vir egregi</span> was the proper form of the vocative case, the other <span class="italic">vir egregie.</span></p>
<p>The argument of the one who thought that we should say <span class="italic">egregi</span> was of this sort: “Whatever nouns or words,” said he, “end in the nominative singular in the syllable <span class="italic">us</span> preceded by <span class="italic">i</span>, in the vocative case terminate in the letter <span class="italic">i</span>, as <span class="italic">Caelius Caeli, modius modi, terlius terti, Accius Acci, Titius Titi</span>, and the like; so then <span class="italic">egregius</span>, since it ends in the syllable us in the nominative and the letter <span class="italic">i</span> precedes that syllable, must in the vocative singular have <span class="italic">i</span> for the final letter, and therefore it is correct to say <span class="italic">egregi</span>, not <span class="italic">egregie.</span> For <span class="italic">divus</span> and <span class="italic">rivus</span> and <span class="italic">clivus</span> do not end in the syllable <span class="italic">us</span>, but in that which ought to be written with two <span class="italic">u’s</span>, and in order to indicate that sound a new letter was devised, which was called the <span class="italic">digamma.</span>”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL212_41_1a" id="target_note_LCL212_41_1a"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>When the other heard this, he said: <span class="italic">O egregie grammatice</span>, or if you prefer, <span class="italic">egregissime</span>, tell me, I pray you, what is the vocative case of <span class="italic">inscius, impius, sobrius, ebrius, proprius, propitius, anxius</span>, and <span class="italic">contrarius</span>, which end in the syllable us and have the letter <span class="italic">i</span> before the final syllable? For shame and modesty prevent me from pronouncing them according to your rule.” Now the other, overcome by the accumulation of so many words against him, remained silent for a time; but then he nevertheless rallied, and upheld and defended that same rule which he

The Romans used the character to represent the sound of <span class="italic">f</span>, at first with the addition of the aspirate <span class="italic">h</span> (as in <span class="italic">fhefhaked, C.I.L.</span> i<sup>2</sup> 3 and xiv. 4123) and afterwards alone. Since V was used both for the vowel u and the semi-vowel <span class="italic">v</span>, the emperor Claudius introduced an inverted digamma (Ⅎ), to represent the latter sound; see Suet. <span class="italic">Claud</span>, xii. 3 and (<span class="italic">e.g.</span>) <span class="italic">C.I.L.</span> vi. 919. The writing of F for V, to which Gellius seems to refer, was apparently confined to a few grammarians; see Cassiodorus, vii. 148. 8 K and Priscian, ii. 11. 5 K.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL212_41_1a').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
