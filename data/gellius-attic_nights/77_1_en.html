troops withdraw from camp into the towns? Have we not then also a truce? Again, if a truce is to be denned as only lasting for a few days, what are we to say of the fact, recorded by Quadrigarius in the first book of his <span class="italic">Annals,</span> that Gaius Pontius the Samnite asked the Roman dictator for a truce of six hours?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_113_1" id="target_note_LCL195_113_1"><sup>1</sup></a> The definition “a holiday in war,” too, is rather happy than clear or precise.</p>
