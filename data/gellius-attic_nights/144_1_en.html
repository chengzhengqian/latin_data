characteristic of Plautus; and although these had already been listed under the names of other poets, he claimed them for Plautus: for example, one that I was recently reading, called <span class="italic">The Boeotian Woman</span>. For although it is not among those one and twenty and is attributed to Aquilius, still Varro had not the least doubt that it was Plautine, nor will any other habitual reader of Plautus doubt it, even if he knows only the following verses from that play, which, since they are, to speak in the manner of that famous poet, most Plautine, I recall and have noted down. There a hungry parasite speaks as follows:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_247_1" id="target_note_LCL195_247_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line indent1">The gods confound the man who first found out</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent1">How to distinguish hours! Confound him, too,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent1">Who in this place set up a sun-dial</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent1">To cut and hack my days so wretchedly</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent1">Into small portions! When I was a boy,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent1">My belly was my only sun-dial, one more sure,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent1">Truer, and more exact than any of them.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent1">This dial told me when ’twas proper time</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent1">To go to dinner, when I had aught to eat;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent1">But nowadays, why even when I have,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent1">I can’t fall to unless the sun gives leave.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent1">The town’s so full of these confounded dials</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent1">The greatest part of the inhabitants,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent1">Shrunk up with hunger, crawl along the streets.</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p>My master Favorinus too, when I was reading the <span class="italic">Nervularia</span> of Plautus, and he had heard this line of the comedy:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_247_2" id="target_note_LCL195_247_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line indent1">Old, wheezing, physicky, mere foundered hags</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent1">With dry, parched, painted hides, shrivell’d and</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">shrunk,</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
