<p>The positive assertion of Julius Hyginus that he had read a manuscript of Virgil from the poet’s own household, in which there was written <span class="italic">et ora tristia temptantum sensus torquebit amaror</span> and not the usual reading, <span class="italic">sensu torquebit amaro.</span></p>
<p><span class="sc">Nearly</span> everyone reads these lines from the Georgics of Virgil<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_95_1" id="target_note_LCL195_95_1"><sup>1</sup></a> in this way:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line indent2">At sapor indicium faciet manifestus et ora</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">Tristia temptantum sensu torquebit amaro.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_95_2" id="target_note_LCL195_95_2"><sup>2</sup></a></span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p>Hyginus, however, on my word no obscure grammarian, in the <span class="italic">Commentaries</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_95_3" id="target_note_LCL195_95_3"><sup>3</sup></a> which he wrote on Virgil, declares and insists that it was not this that Virgil left, but what he himself found in a copy which had come from the home and family of the poet:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line indent18">et ora</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">Tristia temptantum sensus torquebit amaror,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_95_4" id="target_note_LCL195_95_4"><sup>4</sup></a></span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">and this reading has commended itself, not to Hyginus alone, but also to some other learned men, because it seems absurd to say “the taste will distort with its bitter sensation.” “Since,” they say, “taste itself is a sensation, it cannot have another sensation in itself, but it is exactly as if one should say, ‘the sensation will distort with a bitter sensation.’” Moreover, when I had read Hyginus’ note to Favorinus, and the strangeness and harshness of the phrase “sensu torquebit amaro” at once had displeased him,
