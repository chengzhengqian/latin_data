greatest are those of the consuls, praetors and censors. Yet the auspices of all these are not the same or of equal rank, for the reason that the censors are not colleagues of the consuls or praetors,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_453_1" id="target_note_LCL200_453_1"><sup>1</sup></a> while the praetors are colleagues of the consuls.
