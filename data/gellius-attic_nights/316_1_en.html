Therefore in the treaty with Carthage silver was called <span class="italic">putum</span>, as having been thoroughly purified and refined, as free from all foreign matter, and as spotless and whitened by the removal from it of all impurities.</p>
<p>But the expression <span class="italic">purum putum</span> occurs, not only in the treaty with Carthage, but also in many other early writings, including the tragedy of Quintus Ennius entitled <span class="italic">Alexander</span>,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_107_1" id="target_note_LCL200_107_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and the satire of Marcus Varro called Δὶς Παῖδες οἱ Γέροντες,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_107_2" id="target_note_LCL200_107_2"><sup>2</sup></a> or <span class="italic">Old Men are Children for a Second Time.</span></p>
