<p>The words of Homer which I mentioned above are these:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_75_1" id="target_note_LCL195_75_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line indent1">When from his. breast his mighty voice went forth</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">and:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_75_2" id="target_note_LCL195_75_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line indent1">What a word has passed the barrier of your teeth.</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">I have added also a passage from Marcus Tullius, in which he expresses his strong and just hatred of silly and unmeaning volubility. He says:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_75_3" id="target_note_LCL195_75_3"><sup>3</sup></a> “Provided this fact be recognized, that neither should one commend the dumbness of a man who knows a subject, but is unable to give it expression in speech, nor the ignorance of one who lacks knowledge of his subject, but abounds in words; yet if one must choose one or the other alternative, I for my part would prefer tongue-tied knowledge to ignorant loquacity.” Also in the first book of the <span class="italic">De Oratore</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_75_4" id="target_note_LCL195_75_4"><sup>4</sup></a> he wrote as follows: “For what is so insane as the empty sound of words, however well-chosen and elegant, if there be no foundation of sense or sagacity?” But Marcus Cato in particular is a relentless assailant of this fault. For in the speech entitled <span class="italic">If Caelius, tribune of the commons, should have summoned him,</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_75_5" id="target_note_LCL195_75_5"><sup>5</sup></a> he says: “That man is never silent who is afflicted with the disease of talking, as one in a lethargy is afflicted with that of drinking and sleeping. For if you should not come together when he calls an assembly, so eager is he to talk that he would hire someone to listen. And so you hear him, but you do not listen, just as if he were a quack. For a quack’s words are heard, but no one trusts himself
