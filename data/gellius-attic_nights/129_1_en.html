is the colour green expressed by more terms in your language, and Virgil, when he wished to indicate the green colour of a horse, could perfectly well have called the horse <span class="italic">caerulus</span> rather than <span class="italic">glaucus</span>, but he preferred to use a familiar Greek word, rather than one which was unusual in Latin.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_217_1" id="target_note_LCL195_217_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Moreover, our earlier writers used <span class="italic">caesia</span> as the equivalent of the Greek γλαυκῶπις, as Nigidius says,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_217_2" id="target_note_LCL195_217_2"><sup>2</sup></a> from the colour of the sky, as if it were originally <span class="italic">caelia</span>.”</p>
<p>After Fronto had said this, Favorinus, enchanted with his exhaustive knowledge of the subject and his elegant diction, said: “Were it not for you, and perhaps for you alone, the Greek language would surely have come out far ahead; but you, my dear Fronto, exemplify Homer’s line:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_217_3" id="target_note_LCL195_217_3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line indent1">Thou would’st either have won or made the</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">result indecisive.</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">But not only have I listened with pleasure to all your learned remarks, but in particular in describing the diversity of the colour <span class="italic">flavus</span> you have made me understand these beautiful lines from the fourteenth book of Ennius’ <span class="italic">Annals</span>,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_217_4" id="target_note_LCL195_217_4"><sup>4</sup></a> which before I did not in the least comprehend:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line indent1">The calm sea’s golden marble now they skim;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent1">Ploughed by the thronging craft, the green seas</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">foam;</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">for ‘the green seas’ did not seem to correspond with ‘golden marble.’ But since, as you have said, <span class="italic">flavus</span> is a colour containing an admixture of green and white, Ennius with the utmost elegance called the foam of the green sea ‘golden marble.’”</p>
