of <span class="italic">par arcae,</span> that is ‘like a strong-box;’ for just as all valuables are put away in a strong-box and preserved and kept under its protection, just so a man who is close and content to spend little keeps all his property guarded and hidden away, as in a strong-box. For that reason he is called <span class="italic">parcus,</span> as if it were <span class="italic">par arcus.</span>”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_305_1" id="target_note_LCL195_305_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Then Favorinus, on hearing these words, said: “That fellow Gavius Bassus has made up and contrived an origin for that word in an unnatural, altogether laboured and repellent manner, rather than explained it. For if it is permissible to draw on one’s imagination, why would it not seem more reasonable to believe that a man is called <span class="italic">parcus</span> for the reason that he forbids and prevents the spending of money, as if he were <span class="italic">pecuniarcus.</span> Why not rather,” he continued, “adopt an explanation which is simpler and nearer the truth? For <span class="italic">parcus</span> is derived neither from <span class="italic">arca</span> nor from <span class="italic">arceo,</span> but from <span class="italic">parum and parvum.</span>”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_305_2" id="target_note_LCL195_305_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
