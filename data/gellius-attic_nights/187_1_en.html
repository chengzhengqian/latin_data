Also in the comedy of Plautus which is entitled <span class="italic">Epidicus</span> I hear that inquiry is made about that same word, which occurs in these verses:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_333_1" id="target_note_LCL195_333_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line indent1">Should I the victim of your folly be</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent1">And let you sacrifice my back to it,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent1">As substitute for yours?</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p>Now it is said that the victims were called <span class="italic">succidaneae</span>—which
is equivalent to <span class="italic">succaedaneae,</span> the diphthong <span class="italic">ae</span>, according to the custom in compound words, being changed to <span class="italic">i</span>—because if the expiation was not effected by the first victims, other victims were brought and killed after them; and since these, after the first had already been offered, were substituted for the sake of making atonement and were “slain in succession to” the others, they were called <span class="italic">succidaneae,</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_333_2" id="target_note_LCL195_333_2"><sup>2</sup></a> the letter <span class="italic">i</span>, of course, being pronounced long; for I hear that some barbarously shorten that letter in this word.</p>
<p>Moreover, it is on the same linguistic principle that <span class="italic">praecidanea</span> is applied to those victims which are offered on the day before the regular sacrifices. Also the sow is called <span class="italic">praecidanea</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_333_3" id="target_note_LCL195_333_3"><sup>3</sup></a> which it was usual to offer up to Ceres before the harvesting of the new crops, for the sake of expiation in case any had failed to purify a defiled household, or had performed that rite in an improper manner.</p>
<p>But that a sow and certain victims are called <span class="italic">praecidaneae,</span> as I have said, is a matter of common knowledge; that some festivals are called <span class="italic">praecidaneae</span> is a fact I think that is not known to the general public. Therefore I have quoted a passage from the fifth book of the treatise which Ateius Capito compiled <span class="italic">On Pontifical Law</span>:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_333_4" id="target_note_LCL195_333_4"><sup>4</sup></a> “Tiberius
