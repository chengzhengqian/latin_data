the <span class="italic">inlaudabilis</span>, namely, one who is worthy neither of mention nor remembrance, and is never to be named; as, for example, in days gone by the common council of Asia decreed that no one should ever mention the name of the man who had burned the temple of Diana at Ephesus.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_141_1" id="target_note_LCL195_141_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>There remains the third criticism, his use of the expression “a tunic rough with gold.” But <span class="italic">squalentem</span>
signifies a quantity or thick layer of gold, laid on so as to resemble scales. For <span class="italic">squalere</span> is used of the thick, rough scales (<span class="italic">squamae</span>) which are to be seen on the skins of fish or snakes. This is made clear both by others and indeed by this same poet in several passages; thus:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_141_2" id="target_note_LCL195_141_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line indent1">A skin his covering was, plumed with brazen</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">scales (<span class="italic">squamis</span>)</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent1">And clasped with gold,</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">and again:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_141_3" id="target_note_LCL195_141_3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line indent1">And now has he his flashing breastplate donned,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent1">Bristling with brazen scales (<span class="italic">squamis</span>).</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">Accius too in the <span class="italic">Pelopidae</span> writes thus:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_141_4" id="target_note_LCL195_141_4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line indent1">This serpent’s scales (<span class="italic">squamae</span>) rough gold and</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">purple wrought.</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">Thus we see that <span class="italic">squalere</span> was applied to whatever was overloaded and excessively crowded with anything, in order that its strange appearance might strike terror into those who looked upon it. So too on neglected and scaly bodies the deep layer of dirt was called <span class="italic">squalor</span>, and by long and continued use in that sense the entire word has become so corrupted, that finally <span class="italic">squalor</span> has come to be used of nothing but filth.</p>
