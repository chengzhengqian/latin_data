to have been formulated for use in that ceremony by Quintus Mucius,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_439_1" id="target_note_LCL195_439_1"><sup>1</sup></a> when he was pontifex maximus. But no one may be adopted by <span class="italic">adrogatio</span> who is not yet ready to assume the gown of manhood. The name <span class="italic">adrogatio</span> is due to the fact that this kind of transfer to another’s family is accomplished through a <span class="italic">rogatio</span> or “request,” put to the people.</p>

of freedmen should by process of adoption usurp the privileges of the freeborn. “Furthermore,” says he, “if that ancient law be maintained, even a slave may be surrendered by his master for adoption through the agency of a praetor.” And he declares that several authorities<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_439_3" id="target_note_LCL195_439_3"><sup>3</sup></a> on ancient law have written that this can be done.</p>
