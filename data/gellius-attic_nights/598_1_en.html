<p>Whether the word <span class="italic">petorritum</span>, applied to a vehicle, is Greek or Gallic.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Those</span> who approach the study of letters late in life, after they are worn out and exhausted by some other occupation, particularly if they are garrulous and of only moderate keenness, make themselves exceedingly ridiculous and silly by displaying their would-be knowledge. To this class that man surely belongs, who lately talked fine-spun nonsense about <span class="italic">petorrita</span>, or “four-wheeled wagons.” For when the question was asked, what form of vehicle the <span class="italic">petorritum</span> was, and from what language the word came, he falsely described a form of vehicle very unlike the real one; he also declared that the name was Greek and interpreted it as meaning “flying wheels,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL212_125_1" id="target_note_LCL212_125_1"><sup>1</sup></a> maintaining that <span class="italic">petorritum</span> was formed by the change of a single letter from <span class="italic">petorrotum</span>, and that this form was actually used by Valerius Probus.</p>
<p>When I had got together many copies of the <span class="italic">Commentaries</span> of Probus, I did not find that spelling in them, and I do not believe that Probus used it anywhere else. For <span class="italic">petorritum</span> is not a hybrid word derived in part from the Greek, but the entire word belongs to the people across the Alps; for it is a Gallic word. It is found in the fourteenth book of Marcus Varro’s <span class="italic">Divine Antiquities</span>, where Varro, speaking of <span class="italic">petorritum</span>, says<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL212_125_2" id="target_note_LCL212_125_2"><sup>2</sup></a> that it is a Gallic term.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL212_125_3" id="target_note_LCL212_125_3"><sup>3</sup></a> He also says that <span class="italic">lancea</span>, or “lance,” is not a Latin, but a Spanish word.</p>
