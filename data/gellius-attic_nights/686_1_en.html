In the third place this was asked, in what words the fallacy of the following catches consisted and how they could be made out and explained: “What you have not lost, that you have. You have not lost horns; therefore you have horns.” Also another catch: “What I am, that you are not. I am a man; therefore you are not a man.” Then it was inquired what was the solution of this sophistry: “When I lie and admit that I lie, do I lie or speak the truth?” Afterwards this question was put, why the patricians are in the habit of entertaining one another on the Megalensia,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL212_301_2" id="target_note_LCL212_301_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and the plebeians on the Cerealia.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL212_301_3" id="target_note_LCL212_301_3"><sup>3</sup></a> Next came this question: “What one of the early poets used the verb <span class="italic">verant</span>, in the sense of’ they speak the truth’?” The sixth question was, what kind of plant the “asphodel” was, which Hesiod mentioned in the following lines:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL212_301_4" id="target_note_LCL212_301_4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

He had shared his father’s property with his brother Perses; but Perses went to law and through the partiality of the judges got possession of the whole inheritance. He soon wasted it, and Hesiod, through his thrift, was able to come to his help. Hence the expression became proverbial. Cicero, on seeing a bust of his brother Quintus, who was of short stature, said: “Half of my brother is greater than the whole.” (Macrob. <span class="italic">Sat.</span> ii. 3. 4.)</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL212_301_5a').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
