in sandals, nor by Jove! is this less criminal in you than it was in one whom Marcus Tullius once reproved for such attire.”</p>
<p>This, and some other things to the same purport, Castricius said in my hearing with true Roman austerity. But several of those who had heard him asked why he had said <span class="italic">soleatos</span>, or “in sandals,” of those who wore <span class="italic">gallicae</span>, or “Gallic slippers,” and not <span class="italic">soleae</span>. But Castricius certainly spoke purely and properly; for in general all kinds of foot-gear which cover only the bottom of the soles, leaving the rest almost bare, and are bound on by slender thongs, are called <span class="italic">soleae</span>, or sometimes by the Greek word <span class="italic">crepidulae.</span> But <span class="italic">gallicae</span>, I think, is a new word, which came into use not long before the time of Marcus Cicero. In fact, he himself uses it in his second <span class="italic">Oration against Antony</span>:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_479_1" id="target_note_LCL200_479_1"><sup>1</sup></a> “You ran about,” says he, “in slippers (<span class="italic">gallicis</span>) and cloak.” Nor do I find this word with that meaning in any other writer—a writer of high authority, that is; but, as I have said, they called that kind of shoe <span class="italic">crepidae</span> and <span class="italic">crepidulae</span>, shortening the first syllable of the Greek word κρηπῖδες, and the makers of such shoes they termed <span class="italic">crepidarii</span>. Sempronius Asellio in the fourteenth book of his <span class="italic">Histories</span> says:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_479_2" id="target_note_LCL200_479_2"><sup>2</sup></a> “He asked for a cobbler’s knife from a maker of slippers (<span class="italic">crepidarius sutor</span>),”</p>
