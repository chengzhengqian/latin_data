<p class="noindent">First of all, they said that Probus thought that in Homer the maiden Nausicaa, playing among her girl companions in solitary places, was consistently and properly compared with Diana hunting on the mountain heights among the rural goddesses; but that Virgil had made a comparison that was by no means suitable, since Dido, walking with dignified dress and gait in the midst of a city, and surrounded by the Tyrian chiefs, “pressing on the work of her rising kingdom,” as he himself says,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_181_1" id="target_note_LCL200_181_1"><sup>1</sup></a> can have no points of similarity corresponding with the sports and hunts of Diana. Then secondly, that Homer mentions plainly and directly Diana’s interest and pleasure in the chase, while Virgil, not having said a word about the goddess’ hunting, merely pictures her as carrying a quiver on her shoulder, as if it were a burden or a pack. And they said that Probus was particularly surprised at this feature of Virgil’s version, that while Homer’s Leto rejoices with a joy that is unaffected, deep, and springing from the very depths of her heart and soul—for the words γέγηθε δέ τε φρένα Λητώ, or “Leto rejoiced in heart,” mean nothing else—Virgil, on the other hand, in his attempt to imitate this, has depicted a joy that is passive, mild, slow, and as it were floating on the surface of the heart; for Probus said that he did not know what else the word <span class="italic">pertemptant</span> could mean<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_181_2" id="target_note_LCL200_181_2"><sup>2</sup></a>
