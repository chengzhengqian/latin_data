<p>The reason why the ancient Greeks and Romans wore a ring on the next to the little finger of the left hand.</p>
<p>I <span class="sc">have</span> heard that the ancient Greeks wore a ring on the finger of the left hand which is next to the little finger. They say, too, that the Roman men commonly wore their rings in that way. Apion in his <span class="italic">Egyptian History</span> says<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_237_2" id="target_note_LCL200_237_2"><sup>2</sup></a> that the reason for this practice is, that upon cutting into and opening human bodies, a custom in Egypt which the Greeks call ἀνατομαί, or “dissection,” it was found that a very fine nerve proceeded from that finger alone of which we have spoken, and made its way to the human heart; that it therefore seemed quite reasonable that this finger in particular should be honoured with such an ornament, since it seems to be joined, and as it were united, with that supreme organ, the heart.</p>
