<p>But why the particle <span class="italic">re</span> has this special force in this one word alone, I for my part am still inquiring. For I have never yet found that <span class="italic">rescivi</span> or <span class="italic">rescire</span> was used by those who were careful in their diction, otherwise than of things which were purposely concealed, or happened contrary to anticipation and expectation; although <span class="italic">scire</span> itself is used of everything alike, whether favourable or unfavourable, unexpected or expected. Thus Naevius in the <span class="italic">Triphallus</span> wrote:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_175_1" id="target_note_LCL195_175_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line indent1">If ever I discover (<span class="italic">rescivero</span>) that my son</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent1">Has borrowed money for a love affair,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent1">Straightway I’ll put you where you’ll spit no</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">more.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_175_2" id="target_note_LCL195_175_2"><sup>2</sup></a></span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">Claudius Quadrigarius in the first book of his <span class="italic">Annals</span> says:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_175_3" id="target_note_LCL195_175_3"><sup>3</sup></a> “When the Lucanians discovered (<span class="italic">resciverunt</span>) that they had been deceived and tricked.” And again in the same book Quadrigarius uses that word of something sad and unexpected:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_175_4" id="target_note_LCL195_175_4"><sup>4</sup></a> “When this became known to the relatives (<span class="italic">rescierunt propinqui</span>)
of the hostages, who, as I have pointed out above, had been delivered to Pontius, their parents and relatives rushed into the street with hair in disarray.” Marcus Cato writes in the fourth book of the <span class="italic">Origins</span>:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_175_5" id="target_note_LCL195_175_5"><sup>5</sup></a> “Then next day the dictator orders the master of the horse to be summoned: ‘I will send you, if you wish, with the cavalry.’ ‘It is too late,’ said the master of the horse, ‘they have found it out already (<span class="italic">rescivere</span>).’”</p>
