the indications and sensation of conception.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_5_1" id="target_note_LCL200_5_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Afterwards, in the tenth month, she gave birth to that Publius Scipio who conquered Hannibal and the Carthaginians in Africa in the second Punic war.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_5_2" id="target_note_LCL200_5_2"><sup>2</sup></a> But it was far more because of his exploits than because of that prodigy that he too<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_5_3" id="target_note_LCL200_5_3"><sup>3</sup></a> was believed to be a man of godlike excellence.</p>
<p>This too I venture to relate, which the same writers that I mentioned before have put on record: This Scipio Africanus used often to go to the Capitolium
in the latter part of the night, before the break of day, give orders that the shrine of Jupiter be opened,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_5_4" id="target_note_LCL200_5_4"><sup>4</sup></a> and remain there a long time alone, apparently consulting Jupiter about matters of state; and the guardians of the temple were often amazed that on his coming to the Capitolium alone at such an hour the dogs,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_5_5" id="target_note_LCL200_5_5"><sup>5</sup></a> that flew at all other intruders, neither barked at him nor molested him.</p>
<p>These popular beliefs about Scipio seemed to be confirmed and attested by many remarkable actions and sayings of his. Of these the following is a single example: He was engaged in the siege of a town<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_5_6" id="target_note_LCL200_5_6"><sup>6</sup></a> in Spain, which was strongly fortified and defended, protected by its position, and also well provisioned; and there was no prospect of taking it. One day he sat holding court in his camp, at a point from which there was a distant view of the town.
