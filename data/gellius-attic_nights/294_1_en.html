Ulysses, the elegant and restrained in Menelaus, the middle and moderate in Nestor.</p>
<p>This threefold variety is also to be observed in the three philosophers whom the Athenians sent as envoys to the senate at Rome, to persuade the senators to remit the fine which they had imposed upon the Athenians because of the sack of Oropos;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_63_1a" id="target_note_LCL200_63_1a"><sup>1</sup></a> and the fine amounted to nearly five hundred talents. The philosophers in question were Carneades of the Academy, Diogenes the Stoic, and Critolaus the Peripatetic. When they were admitted to the House, they made use of Gaius Acilius, one of the senators, as interpreter; but beforehand each one of them separately, for the purpose of exhibiting his eloquence, lectured to a large company. Rutilius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_63_2" id="target_note_LCL200_63_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and Polybius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_63_3" id="target_note_LCL200_63_3"><sup>3</sup></a> declare that all three aroused admiration for their oratory, each in his own style. “Carneades,” they say, “spoke with a vehemence that carried you away, Critolaus with art and polish, Diogenes with restraint and sobriety.”</p>
<p>Each of these styles, as I have said, is more brilliant when it is chastely and moderately adorned; when it is rouged and bepowdered, it becomes mere jugglery.</p>
