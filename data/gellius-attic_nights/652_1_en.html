<p>“It is indeed,” says Taurus, “as you say. For it is well known that wine, when we drink it, warms the body. But oil is equally calorific and has no less power of warming the body. Besides, if those things which are warmer are frozen with greater difficulty, it follows that those which are colder freeze more readily. But vinegar is the most cooling of all things and yet it never freezes. Is the reason then for the quicker freezing of oil to be found in its lightness? For those things seem to congeal more readily which are lighter and smoother.”</p>
<p>Taurus says besides that it is also worth inquiring why the waters of rivers and streams freeze, while all the sea is incapable of freezing. “Although Herodotus,” said he, “the writer of history, contrary to the opinion of almost all who have investigated these matters, writes<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL212_233_1" id="target_note_LCL212_233_1"><sup>1</sup></a> that the Bosphoric sea, which is called Cimmerian,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL212_233_2a" id="target_note_LCL212_233_2a"><sup>2</sup></a> and all that part of the sea which is termed Scythian,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL212_233_3" id="target_note_LCL212_233_3"><sup>3</sup></a> is bound fast by the cold and brought to a standstill.”</p>
<p>While Taurus was thus speaking, the boy had returned, the pot had cooled off, and the time had come to eat and hold our peace.</p>
