had gathered to pass judgment on Scipio, left the tribune, accompanied Scipio to the Capitol, and then escorted him to his home with the joy and expressions
of gratitude suited to a festal occasion. The very speech is in circulation which is believed to have been delivered that day by Scipio,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_371_1" id="target_note_LCL195_371_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and those who deny its authenticity at least admit that these words which I have quoted were spoken by Scipio.</p>
<p>There is also another celebrated act of his. Certain
Petilii, tribunes of the commons, influenced they say by Marcus Cato, Scipio’s personal enemy, and instigated to appear against him, insisted most vigorously
in the senate<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_371_2" id="target_note_LCL195_371_2"><sup>2</sup></a> on his rendering an account of the money of Antiochus and of the booty taken in that war; for he had been deputy to his brother Lucius Scipio Asiaticus, the commander in that campaign.
