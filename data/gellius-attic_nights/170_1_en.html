<p>The statement of men of the highest authority that Plato bought three books of Philolaus the Pythagorean, and that Aristotle purchased a few books of the philosopher Speusippus, at prices beyond belief.</p>
<p><span class="sc">The</span> story goes that the philosopher Plato was a man of very slender means, but that nevertheless he bought three books of Philolaus the Pythagorean for ten thousand denarii.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_299_1a" id="target_note_LCL195_299_1a"><sup>1</sup></a> That sum, according to some writers, was given him by his friend Dion of Syracuse.</p>
<p>Aristotle too, according to report, bought a very few books of the philosopher Speusippus, after the latter’s death, for three Attic talents, a sum equivalent in our money to seventy-two thousand sesterces.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_299_1a" id="target_note_LCL195_299_1a"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>The bitter satirist Timon wrote a highly abusive work, which he entitled Σίλλος.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_299_2" id="target_note_LCL195_299_2"><sup>2</sup></a> In that book he addresses the philosopher Plato in opprobrious terms, alleging that he had bought a treatise on the Pythagorean philosophy at an extravagant figure, and that from it he had compiled that celebrated dialogue the <span class="italic">Timaeus.</span> Here are Timon’s lines on the subject:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_299_3" id="target_note_LCL195_299_3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line indent1">Thou, Plato, since for learning thou didst yearn,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent1">A tiny book for a vast sum did’st buy,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
