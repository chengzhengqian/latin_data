<h3><span class="ac">I</span></h3>
<p>Whether one ought to say <span class="italic">tertium consul</span> or <span class="italic">tertio</span>; and how Gnaeus Pompeius, when he would inscribe his honours on the theatre which he was about to dedicate, by Cicero’s advice evaded the difficulty as to the form of that word.</p>
<p>I <span class="sc">sent</span> a letter from Athens to a friend of mine in Rome. In it I said that I had now written him for the third time (<span class="italic">tertium</span>). In his reply he asked me to give my reason for having written <span class="italic">tertium</span> and not <span class="italic">tertio</span>. He added that he hoped I would at the same time inform him what I thought about the question whether one should say <span class="italic">tertium consul</span>, meaning “consul
for the third time,” and <span class="italic">quartum,</span> or <span class="italic">tertio</span> and <span class="italic">quarto</span>; since he had heard a learned man at Rome say <span class="italic">tertio</span> and <span class="italic">quarto consul,</span> not <span class="italic">tertium</span> and <span class="italic">quartum</span>; also, that Coelius had so written<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_213_1" id="target_note_LCL200_213_1"><sup>1</sup></a> at the beginning of his third book and that Quintus Claudius in his eleventh book said<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_213_2" id="target_note_LCL200_213_2"><sup>2</sup></a> that Marius was chosen consul for the seventh time, using <span class="italic">septimo</span>.</p>
<p>In reply to these questions, to decide both matters about which he had written to me, I contented myself with quoting Marcus Varro, a more learned man in my opinion than Coelius and Claudius together. For Varro has made it quite plain what ought to be said, and I did not wish, when at a distance, to enter into a dispute with a man who had the name of being learned.</p>
