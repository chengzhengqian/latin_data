<p>Whether <span class="italic">affatim</span>, like <span class="italic">admodum</span>, should be pronounced with an acute accent on the first syllable: with some painstaking observations on the accents of other words.</p>
<p><span class="sc">The</span> poet Annianus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_39_1" id="target_note_LCL200_39_1"><sup>1</sup></a> in addition to his charming personality, was highly skilled in ancient literature and literary criticism, and conversed with remarkable grace and learning. He pronounced <span class="italic">affatim</span>, as he did <span class="italic">admodum,</span> with an acute accent<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_39_2" id="target_note_LCL200_39_2"><sup>2</sup></a> on the first, and not on the medial, syllable; and he believed that the ancients so pronounced the word. He adds that in his hearing the grammarian Probus thus read the following lines of the <span class="italic">Cistellaria</span> of Plautus:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_39_3" id="target_note_LCL200_39_3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line indent1">Canst do a valiant deed?—Enough (<span class="italic">áffatim</span>)</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">
there be</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent1">Who can. I’ve no desire to be called brave,</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">and he said that the reason for that accent was that <span class="italic">affatim</span> was not two parts of speech, but was made up of two parts that had united to form a single word; just as also in the word which we call <span class="italic">exadversum</span> he thought that the second syllable should have the acute accent, because the word was one part of speech, and not two. Accordingly, he maintained that the two following verses of Terence<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_39_4" id="target_note_LCL200_39_4"><sup>4</sup></a> ought to be read thus:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line indent1">Over against (<span class="italic">exádversum</span>) the school to which she</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">went</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent1">A barber had his shop.</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
