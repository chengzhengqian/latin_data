<p>What Marcus Cicero thought and wrote about the prefix in the verbs <span class="italic">aufugio</span> and <span class="italic">aufero</span>; and whether this same</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line indent1">preposition is to be seen in the verb <span class="italic">autumo.</span></span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p>I <span class="sc">read</span> a book of Marcus Cicero’s entitled <span class="italic">The Orator.</span> In that book when Cicero had said that the verbs <span class="italic">aufugio</span> and <span class="italic">aufero</span> were indeed formed of the preposition <span class="italic">ab</span> and the verbs <span class="italic">fugio</span> and <span class="italic">fero</span>, but that the preposition, in order that the word might be smoother in pronunciation and sound, was changed and altered into the syllable <span class="italic">au</span>,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL212_67_1" id="target_note_LCL212_67_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and <span class="italic">aufugio</span> and <span class="italic">aufero</span> began to be used for <span class="italic">abfugio</span> and <span class="italic">abfero</span>; when he had said this, I say, he afterwards in the same work wrote as follows of the same particle:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL212_67_2" id="target_note_LCL212_67_2"><sup>2</sup></a> “This preposition,” he says, “will be found in no other verb save these two only.”</p>
<p>But I have found in the <span class="italic">Commentary</span> of Nigidius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL212_67_3" id="target_note_LCL212_67_3"><sup>3</sup></a> that the verb <span class="italic">autumo</span> is formed from the preposition <span class="italic">ab</span> and the verb <span class="italic">aestumo</span> (estimate) and that <span class="italic">autumo</span> is a contracted form of <span class="italic">abaestumo</span>, signifying <span class="italic">totum aestumo</span>, on the analogy of <span class="italic">abnumero.</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL212_67_4a" id="target_note_LCL212_67_4a"><sup>4</sup></a> But, be it said with great respect for Publius Nigidius, a most learned man, this seems to be rather bold and clever than true. For <span class="italic">autumo</span> does not only mean “I think,” but also “I say,” “I am of the opinion,” and “I consider,” with which verbs that preposition has no connection either in the composition of the
