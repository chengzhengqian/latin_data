<p>The meaning of the word <span class="italic">siticines</span> in a speech of Marcus Cato’s.</p>
<p><span class="sc">The</span> word <span class="italic">siticines</span> is found in a speech of Marcus Cato entitled <span class="italic">Let not a Former Official retain his power, when his Successor arrives.</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL212_429_1" id="target_note_LCL212_429_1"><sup>1</sup></a> He speaks of <span class="italic">siticines, liticines</span> and <span class="italic">tubicines.</span> But Caesellius Vindex, in his <span class="italic">Notes on Early Words,</span> declares that he knows that <span class="italic">liticines</span> played upon the <span class="italic">lituus,</span> or “clarion,” and <span class="italic">tibicines</span> on the <span class="italic">tuba,</span> or “trumpet,” but, being a man of conscientious honesty, he says that he does not know what instrument the <span class="italic">siticines</span> used. But I have found in the <span class="italic">Miscellanies</span> of Ateius Capito<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL212_429_2" id="target_note_LCL212_429_2"><sup>2</sup></a> that those were called <span class="italic">siticines</span> who played in the presence of those who were “laid away” (<span class="italic">sitos</span>), that is, who were dead and buried; and that they had a special kind of trumpet on which they played, differing from those of the other trumpeters.</p>

<p>Why the poet Lucius Accius in his <span class="italic">Pragmatica</span> said that <span class="italic">sicinnistae</span> was a “nebulous word.”</p>
<p><span class="sc">Those</span> whom the vulgar call <span class="italic">sicinistae,</span> persons who speak more accurately have called <span class="italic">sicinnistae</span> with a double <span class="italic">n.</span> For the <span class="italic">sicinnium</span> was an ancient form of dance. Moreover, those who now stand and sing formerly danced as they sang. Lucius Accius used this word in his <span class="italic">Pragmatica,</span> and says that <span class="italic">sicinnistae</span> are so called by a “nebulous” (<span class="italic">nebuloso</span>) term, using the word “nebulous,” I suppose, because the reason for the term <span class="italic">sicinnium</span> was obscure.</p>
