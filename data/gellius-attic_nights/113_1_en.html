since there was no general agreement as to their designations, positions or number.</p>
<p>Then Favorinus ran on as follows: “It is well known,” said he, “that there are four quarters and regions of the heavens—east, west, south and north. East and west are movable and variable points1; south and north are permanently fixed and unalterable. For the sun does not always rise in exactly the same place, but its rising is called either <span class="italic">equinoctial</span> when it runs the course which is called ἰσημερινός (with equal days and nights), or <span class="italic">solsticial</span>, which is equivalent to θεριναὶ τροπαί (summer turnings), or <span class="italic">brumal</span>, which is the same as χειμεριναὶ τροπαί, or ‘winter turnings.’ So too the sun does not always set in the same place; for in the same way its setting is called <span class="italic">equinoctial, solstitial</span>, or <span class="italic">brumal</span>. Therefore the wind which blows from the sun’s spring, or <span class="italic">equinoctial</span>, rising is called <span class="italic">eurus</span>, a word derived, as your etymologists say, from the Greek which means ‘that which flows from the east.’ This wind is called by the Greeks by still another name, ἀφηλιώτης, or ‘in the direction of the sun’; and by the Roman sailors, <span class="italic">subsolanus</span> (lying beneath the sun). But the wind that comes from the summer and solstitial point of rising<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_185_2" id="target_note_LCL195_185_2"><sup>2</sup></a> is called in Latin <span class="italic">aquilo</span>, in Greek βορέας, and some say it was for that reason that Homer called<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_185_3" id="target_note_LCL195_185_3"><sup>3</sup></a> it αἰθρηγενέτης, or ‘ether-born’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_185_4" id="target_note_LCL195_185_4"><sup>4</sup></a>; but <span class="italic">boreas</span>, they think, is so named ἀπὸ τῆς βοῆς,‘from the loud shout,’ since its blast is violent and noisy. To the third wind, which blows from the point of the winter rising—the Romans call it <span class="italic">volturnus</span>—many of the Greeks give a compound name, εὐρόνοτος, because it is between <span class="italic">eurus</span> and <span class="italic">notus</span>.
