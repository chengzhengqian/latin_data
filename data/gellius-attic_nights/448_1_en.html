of life, which the friend of a man who is his superior in rank and fortune ought to have. Those verses in my opinion are no less worthy of frequent, attentive perusal than the rules of the philosophers about duties. Besides this, there is such a venerable flavour of antiquity in these verses, such a sweetness, so unmixed and so removed from all affectation, that in my opinion they ought to be observed, remembered and cherished as old and sacred laws of friendship. Therefore I thought them worthy of quotation, in case there should be anyone who desired to see them at once:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_371_1" id="target_note_LCL200_371_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">So saying, on a friend he called, with whom</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">He oft times gladly shared both board and speech</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">And courteously informed of his affairs,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">On coming wearied from the sacred House</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Or Forum broad, where he all day had toiled,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Directing great affairs with wisdom; one with whom</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">He freely spoke of matters great and small,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Confiding to him thoughts approved or not,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">If he so wished, and found him trustworthy;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">With whom he took much pleasure openly</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Or privily; a man to whom no thought</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Suggested heedlessness or ill intent,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">A cultured, loyal and a winsome man,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Contented, happy, learned, eloquent,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Speaking but little and that fittingly,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Obliging, knowing well all ancient lore,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">All customs old and new, the laws of man</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">And of the gods, who with due prudence told</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">What he had heard, or kept it to himself:</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Him â€™mid the strife Servilius thus accosts.</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
