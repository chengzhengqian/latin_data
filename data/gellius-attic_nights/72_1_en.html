<p class="noindent">For in this place Virgil seems to have used that word somewhat irregularly in giving <span class="italic">supersit</span> the sense of “be present for a longer or more extended period,” but on the contrary his use of the word in the following line is more nearly the accepted one:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_103_1" id="target_note_LCL195_103_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line indent12">They cut him tender grass,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent1">Give corn and much fresh water, that his strength</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent1">Be more than equal to (<span class="italic">superesse</span>) the pleasing toil.</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">for here <span class="italic">superesse</span> means to be more than equal to the task and not to be crushed by it.</p>
<p>I also used to raise the question whether the ancients used <span class="italic">superesse</span> in the sense of “to be left and be lacking for the completion of an act.” For to express that idea Sallust says, not <span class="italic">superesse,</span> but <span class="italic">superare.</span> These are his words in the <span class="italic">Jugurtha:</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_103_2" id="target_note_LCL195_103_2"><sup>2</sup></a> “This man was in the habit of exercising a command independently of the king, and of attending to all business which had been left undone (<span class="italic">superaverant</span>) by Jugurtha when he was weary or engaged in more important affairs.” But we find in the third book of Ennius’ <span class="italic">Annals:</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_103_3" id="target_note_LCL195_103_3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line indent1">Then he declares one task’s left over (<span class="italic">super esse</span>)</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">for him,</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">that is, is left and remains undone; but there <span class="italic">superesse</span> must be divided and read as if it were not one part of speech, but two, as in fact it is. Cicero, however, in his second <span class="italic">Oration against Antony</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_103_4" id="target_note_LCL195_103_4"><sup>4</sup></a> expresses “what is left” by <span class="italic">restore,</span> not by <span class="italic">superesse.</span></p>
<p>Besides these uses we find <span class="italic">superesse</span> with the meaning “survive.” For it is so employed in the book of letters of Marcus Cicero to Lucius Plancus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL195_103_5" id="target_note_LCL195_103_5"><sup>5</sup></a> as
