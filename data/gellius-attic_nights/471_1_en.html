all things must be included within the decrees of fate; unless perhaps he has followed Homer’s saying:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line indent2">Lest, spite of fate, you enter Hades’ home.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_417_1" id="target_note_LCL200_417_1"><sup>1</sup></a></span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">But there is no doubt that Cicero referred to a violent and sudden death, which may properly seem to happen contrary to nature.</p>
<p>But why he has put just that kind of death outside the decrees of fate it is not the part of this work to investigate, nor is this the time. The point, however, must not be passed by, that Virgil too had that same opinion about fate which Cicero had, when in his fourth book he said of Elissa, who inflicted a violent death upon herself:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_417_2" id="target_note_LCL200_417_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line indent2">For since she perished not by fate’s decree,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">Nor earned her death;</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">just as if, in making an end of life, those deaths which are violent do not seem to come by fate’s decree. Cicero, however, seems to have followed the words of Demosthenes, a man gifted with equal wisdom and eloquence, which express about the same idea concerning nature and fate. For Demosthenes in that splendid oration entitled <span class="italic">On the Crown</span> wrote as follows<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL200_417_3" id="target_note_LCL200_417_3"><sup>3</sup></a>: “He who thinks that he was born only for his parents, awaits the death appointed, by fate, the natural death; but he who thinks that he was born also for his country, will be ready to die that he may not see his country enslaved.” What Cicero seems to have called “fate” and “nature,” Demosthenes long lefore termed “fate” and “the natural death.” For “a natural death” is one which comes in the course of fate and nature, as it were, and is caused by no force from without.</p>
