<p>feeble and far-fetched jokes. For example, when they called for Palumbus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL038_42_67" id="target_note_LCL038_42_67"><sup>67</sup></a> he promised that they should have him, “if he could be caught.” The following, however, was both exceedingly timely and salutary; when he had granted the wooden sword<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL038_42_68" id="target_note_LCL038_42_68"><sup>68</sup></a> to an <span class="italic">essedarius</span>,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL038_42_69" id="target_note_LCL038_42_69"><sup>69</sup></a> for whose discharge four sons begged, and the act was received with loud and general applause, he at once circulated a note, pointing out to the people how greatly they ought to desire children, since they saw that they brought favour and protection even to a gladiator. He gave representations in the Campus Martius of the storming and sacking of a town in the manner of real warfare, as well as of the surrender of the kings of the Britons, and presided clad in a general’s cloak. Even when he was on the point of letting out the water from Lake Fucinus he gave a sham sea-fight first. But when the combatants cried out: “Hail, emperor, they who are about to die salute thee,” he replied, “Or not,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL038_42_70" id="target_note_LCL038_42_70"><sup>70</sup></a> and after that all of them refused to fight, maintaining that they had been pardoned. Upon this he hesitated for some time about destroying them all with fire and sword, but at last leaping from his throne and running along the edge of the lake with his ridiculous tottering gait,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL038_43_71" id="target_note_LCL038_43_71"><sup>71</sup></a> he induced them to fight, partly by threats and partly by promises. At this performance a Sicilian and a Rhodian fleet engaged, each numbering twelve triremes, and the signal was sounded on a horn by a silver Triton, which was raised from the middle of the lake by a mechanical device.</p>
