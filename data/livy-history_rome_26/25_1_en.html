the enemy is an old and familiar story. I proceed to <span class="marginNote right"><span class="sc">b.c.</span> 211</span>proof of anger and hatred that are unspeakable. Hannibal with immense forces of infantry and cavalry besieged and partly captured their camp: by such danger they were not moved at all to give up the siege. Setting out across the Volturnus he ravaged the territory of Cales with fire: by such a disaster to allies they were in no wise called away. He ordered his hostile standards to be carried to the city of Rome itself: that impending storm also they scorned. Crossing the Anio<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL367_51_1" id="target_note_LCL367_51_1"><sup>1</sup></a> he pitched camp three miles from the city, finally came close to the very walls and gates, showed that unless they should leave Capua he would take Rome away from them: they did not leave Capua. Wild beasts, though excited by blind impulse and fury, can be diverted to bring help to their young, if one goes towards their lairs and their whelps. As for the Romans, the siege of Rome, their wives and children, whose wailing could almost be heard from here, their altars and hearths, the shrines of their gods, the desecrated and profaned tombs of their ancestors did not divert them from Capua. Such is their ardour in demanding punishment, such their thirst to drink our blood. And perhaps not without reason; we too should have done the same, had the chance been given us. Therefore since the immortal gods have made a contrary decision, inasmuch as I ought under no circumstances to refuse death, I, while free and my own master, can escape tortures and insults which the enemy is preparing, by a death which is not only honourable, but also gentle. I shall not see Appius Claudius and Quintus Fulvius, emboldened by their insolent victory, nor shall I be dragged in chains
