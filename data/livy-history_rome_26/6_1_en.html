Neither the <span class="marginNote right"><span class="sc">b.c.</span> 211</span>spirit of his own men nor that of the enemy had been under his control: every man’s own temperament, he said, produces boldness or consternation. Twice he was accused and a fine required;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL367_13_1" id="target_note_LCL367_13_1"><sup>1</sup></a> at the third hearing witnesses were furnished, and he was not only loaded with every kind of reproach, but also many swore that the beginning of flight and panic was made by the praetor; that the soldiers, deserted by him, in the belief that the general’s fear was not unfounded, had retreated.
