<h3><span class="ac">Summary of Book XXVI</span></h3>
<p>Hannibal pitched his camp on the bank of the Anio at the third milestone from the city of Rome. In person with two thousand horsemen he rode up even to the Porta Capena,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL367_199_1" id="target_note_LCL367_199_1"><sup>1</sup></a> to examine the lie of the city. And when for three days the entire army on each side had gone out into battle-line, a storm broke off the combat; for when they had returned to camp, at once there was a clear sky. Capua was taken by Quintus Fulvius and Appius Claudius, the consuls. The leading men of the Capuans took their own lives by poison. When the senators of Capua had been bound to stakes, to be beheaded, Quintus Fulvius, the consul, on receiving a letter from the senate in which he was bidden to spare them, put the letter in his bosom before reading it and ordered that the law be complied with, and carried out the penalty. When at the comitia in the presence of the people the question was raised, to whom should the command of the Spanish provinces be entrusted, and no one was willing to undertake it, Publius Scipio, son of that Publius who had fallen in Spain, declared that he would go; and having been sent by vote of the people and by general agreement, he stormed New Carthage, being twenty-four years old and seeming to have sprung from a divine race, because he was himself daily on the Capitol, from the time he had assumed the toga, and because in his motherâ€™s chamber a serpent used often to be seen. In addition this book contains events in Sicily and the establishment of friendship with the Aetolians and the war waged against the Acarnanians and Philip, King of Macedonia.</p>
