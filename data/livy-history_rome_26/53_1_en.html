Flaccus said that he had no personal quarrel with the Capuans; his enmity was national, and would be as long as he knew they were so disposed toward the Roman people.

He was keeping them shut up inside the walls for the reason that, if any escaped in some way, they roamed like wild beasts over the country and mangled and slew all that met them. Some had deserted, he said, to Hannibal, others had gone to set Rome on fire. In the half-burned Forum the consul would find traces of the crime of the Capuans.

Surrounded by this multitude, while at the same time the Sicilians came out to meet him and followed him into Rome, he bore the appearance of a man grieving for the destruction of two very famous cities, and bringing into the city the vanquished in war to be the accusers of men of the greatest eminence. Nevertheless it was in regard to the state and the provinces that the two consuls first introduced business into the senate.</p>
