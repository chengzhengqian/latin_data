<p>“. . . Now the immortal gods, who are protectors of <span class="marginNote right"><span class="sc">b.c.</span> 210</span>the Roman empire, who inspired all the centuries of the people to order that the command be bestowed upon me, by auguries, auspices and even visions in the night are likewise forecasting only joy and success. My own mind as well, heretofore my greatest soothsayer, foresees that Spain is ours, that soon all the Carthaginians, banished from here, will cover seas and lands with their disgraceful flight. What the mind of itself divines undeluded reasoning also suggests. Harassed by them their allies through embassies are begging for our help. Three generals, unable to agree,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL367_163_1" id="target_note_LCL367_163_1"><sup>1</sup></a> so that they have almost proved disloyal to each other, have dispersed their army in three parts in widely scattered regions. The same fortune which lately crushed us is assailing them. For they are being deserted by their allies, as formerly were we by the Celtiberians,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL367_163_2" id="target_note_LCL367_163_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and also they have separated their armies, which was the cause of destruction for my father and uncle. Neither will internal strife permit them to unite, nor will they be able singly to resist us. Only do you, soldiers, look with favour upon the name of the Scipios, upon the scion of your generals, growing again, as it were, from stems that have been cut down. Come now, veterans, lead a new army and a new commander across the Ebro, lead them over into lands often traversed by you with many deeds of bravery. Just as now you note in me a resemblance to my father and uncle in face and countenance and recognize the lines of the figure, so I will soon take pains to reproduce for you an image of their minds, of their loyalty and courage, so that each man shall say that there has come back to life, or has been born again, his general Scipio.”</p>
