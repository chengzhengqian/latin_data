<p>XXVIII. There Laevinus explained how matters <span class="marginNote right"><span class="sc">b.c.</span> 210</span>stood with Macedonia and Greece, the Aetolians, Acarnanians and Locrians,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL367_109_1" id="target_note_LCL367_109_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and what had been his own achievements there by land and sea; that when Philip was on the point of invading Aetolia, he had driven him back into Macedonia, retiring into the very heart of his kingdom; and that the legion could be withdrawn from that country; that the fleet was enough to keep the king away from Italy. So much did the consul report in regard to himself and the province, his late command. Then they both brought up the question of the provinces. The senate decreed that Italy and the war with Hannibal should be the province of one consul, that the other should have the fleet which Titus Otacilius had commanded and Sicily as his province, with Lucius Cincius, the praetor.

The two city legions of the previous year were to be sent into Etruria; the two which Sulpicius had commanded as consul, into Gaul. Gaul and its legions were to be under the command of the man appointed by the consul whose province was Italy. Gaius Calpurnius was sent into Etruria after his praetorship, with his command extended for a year. And Capua was assigned as his province to Quintus Fulvius, his command also being extended for a year.
