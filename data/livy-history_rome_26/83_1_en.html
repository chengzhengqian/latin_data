situation of (New) Carthage is as follows:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL367_167_1" id="target_note_LCL367_167_1"><sup>1</sup></a> there is <span class="marginNote right"><span class="sc">b.c.</span> 210</span>an arm of the sea about half-way down the coast of Spain, a bay that mainly faces the southwest wind<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL367_167_2" id="target_note_LCL367_167_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and makes inland about two miles and a half, with a breadth of little more than a mile and one-fifth. At the mouth of this bay a small island facing the harbour on the seaward side makes it safe from all winds except the southwest. From the innermost part of the bay a peninsula runs out, the very hill on which the city was built, skirted by sea on the east<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL367_167_3" id="target_note_LCL367_167_3"><sup>3</sup></a> and the south.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL367_167_4" id="target_note_LCL367_167_4"><sup>4</sup></a> On the west<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL367_167_4" id="target_note_LCL367_167_4"><sup>4</sup></a> a lagoon hems the city in, extending somewhat to the north<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL367_167_4" id="target_note_LCL367_167_4"><sup>4</sup></a> also; it is of varying depth according as the sea is coming in or going out.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL367_167_5" id="target_note_LCL367_167_5"><sup>5</sup></a> With the mainland a ridge about two hundred and fifty paces wide connects the city. Although fortification on this side would have involved so little labour, the Roman commander did not throw up an earthwork, whether as proudly displaying his confidence to the enemy, or that, as he repeatedly approached the walls of the city, retirement might be open to him.</p>
<p>XLIII. Having completed such other works of fortification as were necessary, he drew up the ships also in the harbour, as though to display a blockade from the sea as well. And making the round of the fleet he reminded the commanders of the vessels to keep a close watch at night, saying that a blockaded enemy at first makes every attempt wherever possible.
