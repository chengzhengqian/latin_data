And as they fled in all directions, some were sunk in open water, others were quickly rowed to the shore and presently fell a prey to the men of Thurii<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL367_151_1" id="target_note_LCL367_151_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and Metapontum. Of the transports, which were following with the supplies, very few fell into the power of the enemy.
