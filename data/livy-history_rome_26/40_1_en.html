that he in whose name, though absent, a thanksgiving <span class="marginNote right"><span class="sc">b.c.</span> 211</span>for successes gained under his command had been decreed and honour rendered to the gods, should be denied a triumph when present, or on the other hand that he whom they had ordered to turn over his army to a successor—a vote which was not taken except when a war still remained in the province—should triumph just as though the war were finished, and in spite of the absence of the army to witness his triumph as deserved or undeserved. Thereupon they adopted a compromise, that he should enter the city in an ovation.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL367_81_1" id="target_note_LCL367_81_1"><sup>1</sup></a> The tribune of the plebs on the authority of the senate brought before the people the proposal that Marcus Marcellus should have full military power on the day on which he entered the city in an ovation. On the day before his entry into the city he triumphed on the Alban Mount.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL367_81_2" id="target_note_LCL367_81_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Then in his ovation he caused a great amount of booty to be carried before him into the city. Together with a representation of captured Syracuse<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL367_81_3" id="target_note_LCL367_81_3"><sup>3</sup></a> were carried catapults and <span class="italic">ballistae</span> and all the other engines of war, and the adornments of a long peace and of royal wealth, a quantity of silverware and bronzeware, other furnishings and costly fabrics, and many notable statues, with which Syracuse had been adorned more highly than most cities of Greece. As a sign of triumph over Carthaginians as well, eight elephants were in the procession. And not the least spectacle, in advance of the general and wearing golden wreaths, were Sosis<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL367_81_4" id="target_note_LCL367_81_4"><sup>4</sup></a> of Syracuse and Moericus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL367_81_5" id="target_note_LCL367_81_5"><sup>5</sup></a> the Spaniard.
