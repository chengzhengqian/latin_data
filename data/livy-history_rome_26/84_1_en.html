He then returned to the camp to explain to <span class="marginNote right"><span class="sc">b.c.</span> 210</span>the soldiers the reason for his plan, in having elected to begin the campaign with the siege of a city, and in order that by encouraging them he might inspire the hope of its capture, called an assembly, and spoke as follows: “If any man believes that you have been brought here to besiege a single city, he has justly reckoned your labour, soldiers, rather than the profit. For it is true that you are to attack the walls of a single city, but in that single city you will have taken the whole of Spain. Here are the hostages of all the important kings and peoples; and once they are in your power, they will immediately surrender all that is now subject to the Carthaginians. Here is all the money of the enemy, without which, inasmuch as they maintain mercenary armies, they are incapable of waging war, while it will be of the greatest service to us in winning the support of the barbarians. Here are their artillery, their arms, all their war material, which will equip you and at the same time will strip the enemy. Furthermore we shall gain possession of a city very beautiful and very rich, likewise most convenient in its remarkable harbour, from which by land and sea everything which the needs of war demand may be supplied. We shall not only have these great advantages ourselves, but shall deprive the enemy of things much more important. This is their citadel, this is their granary, their treasury, their arsenal, this their storehouse for everything. To this port lies the direct course from Africa; this is the one roadstead between the Pyrenees and Gades; from this Africa menaces the whole of Spain. . . .”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL367_169_1a" id="target_note_LCL367_169_1a"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
