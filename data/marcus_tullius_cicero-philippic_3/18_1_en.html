For if Antonius had been able to crush the city or to lay hold of Gaul, it would have meant death for all the best men and slavery for the rest, immediate in the first case, a little later in the second.</p>

<p>[14] Therefore, Members of the Senate, by the immortal gods, seize this proffered opportunity and at long last remember that you are leaders of the most august council in the world! Give a signal to the Roman people that your wisdom will not fail the Republic, since they declare that their courage will not be wanting. You do not need me to advise you. No man is so dull as not to realize that if we doze over this point in time, we shall have to endure a despotism not only cruel and arrogant but also ignominious and disgraceful. You know Antonius’ insolence, you know his friends, you <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">35</span><span class="br"></span>know his whole household. To be slaves to libertines, bullies, foul profligates, gamblers, and drunkards, that is the ultimate in misery joined with the ultimate in dishonor. If—may the gods avert the omen!—the final episode in the history of the Republic has arrived, let us behave like champion gladiators: they meet death honorably; let us, who stand foremost in the world and all its nations, see to it that we fall with dignity rather than serve with ignominy. Nothing is more abominable than disgrace, nothing is uglier <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">36</span><span class="br"></span>than servitude. We were born for honor and freedom: let us either retain them or die with dignity. Too long we have kept our feelings hidden. Now they are in the open. All are making plain on one side or the other what they feel and wish for. There are traitors: too many, given the precious worth of the Republic, but quite few compared with the multitude of loyal-minded citizens; the immortal gods have given the Republic incredible power and good fortune </p></section><notes></notes></section>
