Moreover, your decision that a senate cannot be held in safety without a guard also implies that Antonius’ crime and audacity is at large even within the walls.</p>

<p>[6] Accordingly, <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">14</span><span class="br"></span>I shall embrace it all in my proposal, as I believe will not be disagreeable to you: to provide that authority be given by us to the eminent commanders, hope of rewards held out to the very brave soldiers, and Antonius judged, not in word but in fact, to be not only not a consul but a public enemy. For if he <span class="italic">is</span> a consul, the legions that deserted a consul have deserved to be beaten to death, Caesar is a criminal and Brutus a villain for having raised armies against a consul by private initiative. If, on the contrary, unprecedented honors are to be devised for the soldiers in recognition of their divine and unforgettable service, if it is beyond our power to recompense their commanders, who cannot but consider Antonius a public enemy, when those who attack him in arms are judged saviors of the Republic?</p>
<p>But how insolent he is in his edicts, what ill-breeding, <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">15</span><span class="br"></span>what ignorance! First, he heaped abuse on Caesar, taken straight from the recollection of his own vicious, debauched past. Yet is there anyone more pure and modest than this young man, is there a more conspicuous example of old-time morality in our younger generation? And what fouler person is there than he the traducer? He taunts Gaius Caesar’s son with humble birth, though even his natural father would have been elected consul had he lived.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL189_191_11" id="target_note_LCL189_191_11"><sup>11</sup></a> “A mother from Aricia”:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL189_191_12" id="target_note_LCL189_191_12"><sup>12</sup></a> you would think he was saying </p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL189_191_11"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL189_191_11" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">11</sup>Octavian’s natural father C.
