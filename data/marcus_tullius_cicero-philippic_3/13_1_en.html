<p>So, Tribunes of the Plebs, you do very well to put up for <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">25</span><span class="br"></span>discussion the matter of a guard for the consuls and the senate, and your action deserves the warmest thanks and gratitude of us all. For amid so much unscrupulous self-seeking how can we not be in fear and danger? As for that ruined and desperate individual, what harsher verdict upon himself does he expect than that of his friends? A special intimate of his, and a friend of mine, Lucius Lentulus, and Publius Naso, who is devoid of all selfish ambition, declared that Antonius’ lottery was null and void.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL189_203_32a" id="target_note_LCL189_203_32a"><sup>32</sup></a> Lucius Philippus, a gentleman wholly worthy of his father, grandfather, and ancestors, did likewise; the same view was taken by Gaius Turranius, a man of stainless integrity and probity; Spurius Oppius did the same. Even my friend Marcus Piso, an exemplary man and citizen, and the equally upright Marcus Vehilius, who out of consideration for their friendship with Antonius went further in his direction than perhaps they would have wished to do, declared that they would defer to the authority of the senate. What shall I say of Lucius Cinna, whose outstanding <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">26</span><span class="br"></span>integrity, proved in many affairs of great consequence, makes his highly praised and honorable action on this occasion less surprising? He would have nothing to do with a province; and Gaius Cestius refused one in a similarly disinterested and resolute spirit. Who then are the others who find delight in the providentially guided lots? Titus

The remaining names only would then refer to recipi- ents, and their number agrees with the number of provinces still available for allotment at the time.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL189_203_32a').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
