And when diverted from this headlong career by the initiative <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">31</span><span class="br"></span>and forces of Caesar, the consensus of the veterans, and the valor of the legions, undismayed even by the change of fortune, he lessens none of his audacity nor does he desist from his mad, furious plunge. He is leading his truncated army into Gaul; he waits for his brother Lucius—no one more like himself could he find—coming with a single legion, and that a wavering one.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL189_209_37a" id="target_note_LCL189_209_37a"><sup>37</sup></a> As for that myrmillo<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL189_209_38" id="target_note_LCL189_209_38"><sup>38</sup></a> turned general, what havoc he has made wherever he set his foot! He empties barns, slaughters herds of cattle and other animals, whatever comes his way. The soldiers feast; and he himself, in imitation of his brother, drowns himself in wine. Fields are laid waste, farmhouses ransacked, mothers of families, unmarried girls, and boys of free birth torn away and handed over to the soldiery.
