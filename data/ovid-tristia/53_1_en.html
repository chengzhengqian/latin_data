Nor did Liberty allow me to touch her halls, the first that were opened to learned books.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL151_107_1" id="target_note_LCL151_107_1"><sup>1</sup></a> The fate of our unfortunate sire overflows upon his offspring, and we suffer at our birth the exile which he has borne. Perhaps sometime both to us and to him Caesar conquered by long years will be less severe. O gods, or rather (for it is not meet that I should pray to a throng), Caesar, mightiest of gods, hearken to my prayer! In the meanwhile, since a public resting-place is closed to me, may it be granted me to lie hidden in some private spot. You too, hands of the people, receive, if you may, our verses dismayed by the shame of their rejection.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">II. Better Death than Exile</span></h3>
<p>So then â€™twas fated for me to visit even Scythia, the land that lies beneath the Lycaonian pole; neither you, ye learned throng of Pierians, nor you, O son of Leto, have aided your own priest. It avails me not that without real guilt I wrote playful verse, that my Muse was merrier than my life, but many are the perils by land and sea that I have undergone, and now the Pontus shrivelled with constant frost possesses me. I, who once shunned affairs, who was born for a care-free life of ease, who was soft and incapable of toil, am now suffering extremes; no harbourless sea, no far journeys by land have been able to destroy me. And my spirit has proved equal to misfortune; for my body, borrowing strength from that spirit, has endured things scarce endurable.</p>
