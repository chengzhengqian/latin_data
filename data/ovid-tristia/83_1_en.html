<p>Already wild Germany, like the whole world, may have yielded on bended knee to the Caesars;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL151_166_1" id="target_note_LCL151_166_1"><sup>1</sup></a> mayhap the lofty Palatium is decked with garlands and incense is crackling in the fire, colouring the light of day, while from the white victim’s throat smitten by the axe’s stroke the red blood is pattering upon the ground, the gifts promised to the temples of the friendly gods are being made ready for offering by both Caesars<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL151_166_2" id="target_note_LCL151_166_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and by the youths<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL151_166_3" id="target_note_LCL151_166_3"><sup>3</sup></a> who are growing up under Caesar’s name to give that house eternal sway over the world; with her good daughters<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL151_167_4" id="target_note_LCL151_167_4"><sup>4</sup></a> Livia for the safety of her son is perchance offering gifts, as she will often do, to the deserving gods, and in her company the matrons also and those who without stain in eternal virginity keep watch over the heart of purity; the loyal plebs is rejoicing, and with the loyal plebs the senate and the knights among whom but recently I had a humble part: but I driven so far away miss the common rejoicing and nothing but a slight rumour penetrates so far.</p>

So then all the people will be able to view the triumph, reading the names of captured towns and the titles of leaders, beholding the kings with chains upon their captive throats marching before the garlanded horses, seeing some countenances turned to earth as becomes captives, others grim and forgetful of their lot. Some of the people will inquire the causes, the objects, the names, and others will answer though they know all too little.</p>
