She knows also what mistake led me astray at the time of my ruin,—that there is fault in my deed, but no crime. Doubtless for this very reason is she fair to me now because she injured me before, when she was indicted with me for a joint crime. Well could I wish, since they were destined to work me harm, that I had ne’er set hand to the holy service of the Pierian ones. But now, what am I to do?
