submits to servitude. Time causes the grape to swell on the spreading clusters until the berries scarce hold the juice within; time develops the seed into white ears of grain and takes heed that fruits be not sour. Time thins the ploughshare as it renews the soil, it wears away hard flint and adamant; it gradually softens even fierce anger, it lessens grief and relieves sorrowing hearts. All things then can be weakened by the passing of silent-footed time save my woes. Since I have been bereft of my native land, twice has the threshing-floor been smoothed for the grain, twice has the grape burst apart beneath the pressure of naked feet. And yet the long time has not given me fortitude; my mind has the sense of a woe still fresh.</p>

Assuredly even aged bullocks often shun the yoke, and the well-broken horse often fights the bit. My present woe is harsher even than of old, for though still like itself, it has grown and increased with time. Nor were my evils so well known to me as now they are; now that I know them better, they weigh the more heavily. It is something also to apply to them strength still fresh and not to have been worn out beforehand by the ills of time. Stronger is the fresh wrestler on the yellow sands than one whose arms are wearied by slow waiting. Unwounded in shining armour the gladiator is better than the one whose weapons are stained red with his own blood. The new-built ship bears well the headlong blast, even a little squall breaks up the old one. I too can scarcely bear (though I bore them bravely once) woes that have been multiplied by the lapse of time. </p></section><notes></notes></section>
