no more lightly than he<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL151_223_1" id="target_note_LCL151_223_1"><sup>1</sup></a> whom Jupiter, for his overweening utterance, drove back from Thebes with his lightning. Yet when thou didst hear that a poet had been smitten by the bolt, remembering thy mother, thou mightest have felt sympathy and gazing upon the bards about thine altar thou mightest have said, “Some worshipper of mine is missing.”</p>

Bring aid to me, kind Liber! So may a second<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL151_223_2" id="target_note_LCL151_223_2"><sup>2</sup></a> vine weigh down the elm and the grape-clusters be filled with prisoned wine, so may the Bacchae and the young vigour of the Satyrs attend thee and may their frenzied cries keep not silent thy name; so may the bones of axe-bearing Lycurgus be heavily weighed down, nor may the wicked shade of Pentheus ever be free of punishment, so may the crown of thy spouse<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL151_223_3" id="target_note_LCL151_223_3"><sup>3</sup></a> bright in the sky glitter for ever, surpassing the stars close at hand—hither come and lighten my misfortunes, fairest of gods, remembering that I am one of thine own. Gods deal with gods; do thou, O Bacchus, seek to sway Caesar’s power divine by thine own. Do ye, too, O poets who share in my pursuit, loyal throng, take each of you unmixed wine and make this same petition. And let someone of you, uttering Naso’s name, raise a bumper of wine to his lips, and in thought of me, when he has gazed around upon all, let him say, “Where is Naso, who was but now a part of our company?”—and this only if I have earned your approval by my sincerity, if no book was ever injured by verdict of mine, if in deserved reverence for the writings of men of old I yet consider not inferior those most recent. As then I pray ye may compose under Apollo’s favour: keep—for this is lawful—my name among you.</p>
