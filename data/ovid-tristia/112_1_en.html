<h3><span class="sc">IV. The Poet’s Letter greets a True Friend</span></h3>
<p>From the Euxine shore have I come, a letter of Naso’s, wearied by the sea, wearied by the road. Weeping he said to me, “Do thou, who art allowed, look on Rome. Alas! how much better is thy lot than mine!” Weeping too he wrote me, and the gem with which I was sealed, he lifted first, not to his lips, but to his tear-drenched cheeks.</p>

Whoever seeks to learn the cause of his sorrow is asking that the sun be shown to him; he sees not the leaves in the wood, the soft grass in the open meadow, or the water in the full stream; he will wonder why Priam grieves at the ravishing of Hector, why Philoctetes groans after the snake has struck. Would that the gods might bring to pass such lot for him<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL151_225_1" id="target_note_LCL151_225_1"><sup>1</sup></a> that he had no cause of sorrow to lament! Yet spite of all he bears, as he ought, with patience his bitter misfortunes, nor, like an unbroken horse, does he refuse the bit. He hopes that not forever will the god’s wrath endure, aware that in his fault there is no crime. Often he recalls how great is the god’s mercy, of which he is wont to count himself also as an example; for that he retains his father’s wealth, the name of citizen—in fine his very life he holds as a gift of the god.</p>

But thee—O, if thou believest me in anything, dearer than all to him—thee he holds constantly in his whole heart. Thee he calls his Menoetiades,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL151_224_2" id="target_note_LCL151_224_2"><sup>2</sup></a> thee his Orestes’ comrade,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL151_224_3" id="target_note_LCL151_224_3"><sup>3</sup></a> thee his Aegides,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL151_224_4" id="target_note_LCL151_224_4"><sup>4</sup></a> or his Euryalus. He longs not more for his country and the many things with his country whose absence he feels, than for thy face and eyes, O thou who art sweeter than the honey stored in the wax by the Attic bee. </p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL151_225_1"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL151_225_1" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">1</sup>Ovid.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL151_225_1').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
