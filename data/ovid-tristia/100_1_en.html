The poets of that time I fondly reverenced: all bards I thought so many present gods. Ofttimes Macer, already advanced in years, read to me of the birds he loved, of noxious snakes and healing plants. Ofttimes Propertius would declaim his flaming verse by right of the comradeship that joined him to me. Ponticus famed in epic, Bassus also, famed in iambics, were pleasant members of that friendly circle. And Horace of the many rhythms<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL151_201_2" id="target_note_LCL151_201_2"><sup>2</sup></a> held in thrall our ears while he attuned his fine-wrought songs to the Ausonian lyre.

Even when I was setting forth into exile I burned certain verse<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL151_201_5" id="target_note_LCL151_201_5"><sup>5</sup></a> that would have found favour, for I was angry with my calling and with my songs.</p>
