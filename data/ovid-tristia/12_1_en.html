love. At last I said, “Why hasten? ’Tis Scythia whither I am going, ’tis Rome that I must leave. Both are good reasons for delay. My wife lives and I live, but she is being denied me forever and my home and the sweet inmates of that faithful home, and the comrades I have loved with a brother’s love, O hearts knit to me with Theseus’ faith!
