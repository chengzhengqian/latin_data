<h3><span class="sc">XI. Epilogue</span></h3>
<p>Every letter that you have read in my whole book was formed by me during the troubled days of my journey. Either the Adriatic saw me writing these words in the midst of his waters, while I shivered in cold December, or when I had passed in my course the Isthmus with its two seas and had taken the second ship of my journey into exile, my writing of verses amid the wild roar of the sea brought wonder, I think, to the Aegean Cyclades.

Often my perilous tossing was caused by the storm-bringing Kids, often the constellation of Sterope made the sea to threaten, or the day was darkened by the guardian<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL151_53_3" id="target_note_LCL151_53_3"><sup>3</sup></a> of the Arcadian bear, or Auster had drawn from the Hyades an autumnal flood.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL151_53_4a" id="target_note_LCL151_53_4a"><sup>4</sup></a> Often part of the sea was within our ship; nevertheless, with shaking hand I continued to spin my verses such as they were.
