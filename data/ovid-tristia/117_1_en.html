common between the wretched and the fortunate that regard is wont to be rendered to both. We make way both for the blind and for those whom the praetexta<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL151_235_1" id="target_note_LCL151_235_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and the imperious rods<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL151_235_2a" id="target_note_LCL151_235_2a"><sup>2</sup></a> with their cries make reverend. If you have no consideration for me, you ought to show consideration for my fate; in my case there is no room for anger. Choose the very least of my woes; it will be greater than what you imagine. As many as are the reeds which hide the wet ditches, as many as are the bees which flowery Hybla guards, as many as are the ants that are wont to carry by tiny paths to underground stores the grain they find, so crowded is the throng of woes about me; believe me, my complaint is short of the truth. Whoever is not content with these, let him pour sands upon the shore, grain ears into the field, or water into the sea. Wherefore restrain your unseasonable anger and abandon not my bark in the midst of the sea.</p>

<p>The letter which you are reading has come to you from that land where the broad Hister adds his waters to the sea. If you are blessed with life and the sweetness of safety, bright is still one spot in my life. Doubtless you are asking, as ever, dearest one, how I fare, though this you can know even if I speak not. I am wretched—this is the brief sum of my woes—and so will all be who live subject to Caesar’s wrath.</p>
