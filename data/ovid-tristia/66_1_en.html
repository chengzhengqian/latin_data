Neither climate nor water suit me, nor land nor air—ah me! a constant weakness possesses my frame. Whether the contagion of a sick mind affects my limbs or the cause of my ills is this region, since I reached the Pontus, I am harassed by sleeplessness, scarce does the lean flesh cover my bones, food pleases not my lips; and such a hue is in autumn, when the first chill has smitten them, shows on the leaves that young winter has marred, o’erspreads my body; no strength brings relief, and I never lack cause for plaintive pain. I am no better in mind than in body; both alike are sick and I suffer double hurt. Clinging and standing like a visible body before my eyes is the figure of my fate that I must scan; and when I behold the country, the ways, the dress, the language of the people, when I remember what I am and what I was, I have so great a love of death that I complain of Caesar’s wrath, because he avenges not his wrongs with the sword. But since he has once exercised his hatred mildly, let him lighten my exile still further by changing its place.</p>
