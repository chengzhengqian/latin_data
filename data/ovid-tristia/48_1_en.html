Thus the writings which in my youth all thoughtless I supposed would harm me not, have harmed me now that I am old. Late and overfull is the vengeance for that early book, distant is the penalty from the time of the sin.</p>

Yet think not all my work trivial; oft have I set grand sails upon my bark. Six books of <span class="italic">Fasti</span> and as many more have I written, each containing its own month. This work did I recently compose, Caesar, under thy name, dedicated to thee,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL151_97_1" id="target_note_LCL151_97_1"><sup>1</sup></a> but my fate has broken it off. I have also given to the kings of tragedy their royal sceptre and speech suited to the buskin’s dignity.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL151_97_2" id="target_note_LCL151_97_2"><sup>2</sup></a> I sang also, though my attempt lacked the final touch, of bodies changed into new forms.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL151_97_3" id="target_note_LCL151_97_3"><sup>3</sup></a> Would that thou mightest recall thy temper awhile from wrath and bid a few lines of this be read to thee when thou art at leisure, the few lines<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL151_97_4" id="target_note_LCL151_97_4"><sup>4</sup></a> in which after beginning with the earliest origin of the world I have brought the work to thy times, Caesar! Thou wilt see how much heart thou hast thyself given me, with what warmth I sing of thee and thine. I have never injured anybody with a mordant poem, my verse contains charges against nobody. Ingenuous I have shunned wit steeped in gall—not letter of mine is dipped in poisoned jest. Amid all the myriads of our people, many as are my writings, I am the only one whom my own Calliope has injured. No citizen then, I feel sure, rejoices in my woes, but many grieve. Nor can I believe that anyone has mocked my fall, if any indulgence has been granted to my open heart.
