Nothing is so strong, though it be bound with adamant, as to withstand by greater might the swift thunderbolt of Jupiter; nothing is so lofty or reaches so far above perils that it is not beneath a god and subject to him. For although by fault I drew upon me a part of my ills, yet more ruin has befallen me because of the wrath of a divine power.

<p>If I may and you allow it, I will keep silent your name and deed, consigning your acts to Letheâ€™s waters, and my opinion will be overcome by tears that are overdue, if only you make it clear that you have repented, if only through self-condemnation you show yourself eager to erase from your life, if but you can, that period of Tisiphone. But if not, if your heart still burns with hate for me, unhappy rage shall don perforce its arms. Though I be banished, as I have been, to the edge of the world, to where you are shall my wrath stretch forth its hands.

In fine if I should have no opportunity for vengeance, the daughters of Pieria will give me strength and their own weapons. What though I dwell so far removed on the Scythian shores with the constellations that are ever dry close
