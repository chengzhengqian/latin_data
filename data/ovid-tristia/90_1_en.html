God realizes, and so life was not taken from me nor my wealth stripped away to become the property of another. Perchance this very exile, if only I live, he will sometimes bring to an end when time shall soften his wrath. Now I am begging him to order me to another place, if my prayer lacks not respect and modesty. A milder place of exile, a little nearer home, I pray—a place farther from the fierce enemy; and such is Augustus’s mercy that if one should ask this of him in my behalf, it may be he would grant it.</p>
