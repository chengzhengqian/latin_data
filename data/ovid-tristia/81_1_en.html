<p><sup>49</sup> ’Tis right then for me to revere the goddesses who lighten my misfortunes, who came from Helicon to share my anxious flight, who now by sea, now by land, deigned to follow my route on ship or afoot. May they at least, I pray, be propitious to me! For the rest of the gods take sides with mighty Caesar, heaping upon me as many ills as the sands of the shore, the fishes of the sea, or the eggs of the fish. Sooner will you count the flowers of spring, the grain-ears of summer, the fruits of autumn, or the snowflakes in time of cold than the ills which I suffered driven all over the world seeking in wretchedness the shores to the left<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL151_163_1a" id="target_note_LCL151_163_1a"><sup>1</sup></a> of the Euxine. Yet no lighter since my coming is the lot of my misfortunes; to this place also fate has followed my path. Here also I recognize the threads of my nativity, threads twisted for me from a black fleece. To say naught of ambushes or of dangers to my life—true they are, yet too heavy for belief in truth—how pitiable a thing is living among Bessi and Getae for him who was ever on the people’s lips! How pitiable to guard life by gate and wall, and scarce to be safeguarded by the strength of one’s own position! The rough contests of military service I shunned even as a youth and touched arms only with a hand intending to play; but now that I am growing old I fit a sword to my side, a shield to my left arm, and I place a helmet upon my gray head. For when the guard from the lookout has given the signal of a raid, forthwith I don my armour with shaking hands.
