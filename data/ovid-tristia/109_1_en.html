world thou rulest (so mayst thou dwell on earth and heaven long for thee, so mayst thou be late in passing to thy promised stars) spare me, I beseech thee, and take but the least part from thy lightning’s stroke; sufficient will be the penalty that remains. Thine anger is indeed moderate, for thou hast granted me life, I lack neither the right nor the name of citizen, nor has my fortune been granted to others, and I am not called “exile” by the terms of thy decree. All these things I feared because I saw that I had deserved them, but thy wrath is lighter than my sin. “Relegated”<sup>1</sup> didst thou bid me come to view the fields by the Pontus, cleaving the Scythian sea in a fleeing bark. By thy command I have come to the formless shores of the Euxine water—this land lies beneath the frigid pole—nor am I so much tortured by a climate never free from cold and a soil ever shrivelled by white frost, by the fact that the barbarian tongue knows not a Latin voice and Greek is mastered by the sound of Getic, as that I am surrounded and hard pressed on every side by war close at hand and that a low wall scarce gives me safety from the foe. Yet peace there is at times, confidence in peace never: so does this place now suffer, now fear attack. If I may but exchange this place for another, let even Zanclaean Charybdis swallow me, sending me by her waters to the Styx, or let me be resigned to burn in the flames of scorching Aetna or hurled into the deep sea of the Leucadian god.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL151_219_2" id="target_note_LCL151_219_2"><sup>2</sup></a> What I seek is punishment, for I do not reject suffering, but I beg that I may suffer in greater safety!</p>
