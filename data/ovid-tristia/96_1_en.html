of Sarmatia. Battered ships are drawn into the hollow docks lest to no purpose they go to pieces in the waters’ midst. Lest the steed that has won many palms should fall, dishonouring his victories, lazily now he crops the meadow grass. When the soldier after years of service is no longer useful, he lays the arms he has borne before the good old Lares. In this way, since slow old age is lessening my strength, ’twere time for me also to be presented with the wooden sword.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL151_193_1" id="target_note_LCL151_193_1"><sup>1</sup></a> ’Twere time for me to breathe no foreign air nor slake my parching thirst with Getic water, but now at my leisure to withdraw into the gardens I once had, now once again to enjoy the sight of men and of the city.</p>

Did I then in my madness force him into rage against me who is more gracious than anything the wide world possesses? Has his very mercy been overcome by my sins, and yet has my error not denied me life, a life which I must pass far from my country, beneath the pole of Boreas in the land to the left of the Euxine sea?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL151_193_3" id="target_note_LCL151_193_3"><sup>3</sup></a> If this had been told me by Delphi or Dodona herself,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL151_193_4" id="target_note_LCL151_193_4"><sup>4</sup></a> both places would have seemed to me unworthy of belief.</p>
