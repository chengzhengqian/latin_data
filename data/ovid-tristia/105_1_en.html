ever jest? But I have paid the penalty, for in the lands of the Scythian Hister he who played with quiver-bearing Love is an exile. For the future I have diverted my elegies to bashful poems and bidden them remember their name. Yet if someone of you asks why I sing so many grievous things—many grievous things have I borne. This verse I compose not by inspiration, not by art; the theme is filled with inspiration by its own evils. And how small a portion of my lot appears in my verse? Happy he who can count his sufferings! As many as the twigs of the forest, as many as the grains of Tiber’s yellow sands, as many tender grass-blades as the field of Mars possesses, so many ills have I endured for which there is no cure, no relief save in whiling away my time in devotion to the Pierians.</p>

“What limit, Naso, to your mournful song?” you say. The same that shall be the limit to this state of mine. For my complaining that state serves me from a full spring, nor are these words mine; they belong to my fate. But should you restore to me my country and my dear wife, my face would be gay, and I should be what I once was. Should unconquerable Caesar’s wrath be milder to me, forthwith will I offer you verse filled with joy. Yet no writings of mine shall again wanton as once they wantoned; let them have rioted with my jests but once! I will compose something which he will himself approve, if only a part of my punishment be removed and I escape the barbarian world and the stern Getae. Meanwhile what should be the theme of my verse except sorrow? Such is the pipe whose notes befit this funeral of mine.</p>
