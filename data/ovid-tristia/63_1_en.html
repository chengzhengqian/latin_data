Nothing then will I say except that I have sinned, but by that sin sought no reward; folly is the proper name for my crime, if you wish to give the true title to the deed. If this is untrue, then this land is a suburb of Rome and you should seek a more distant place for my exile.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL151_127_1" id="target_note_LCL151_127_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

Say that I live, but in such wise that I would not live; that my misfortunes have not been lightened by the lapse of so long a time, that nevertheless I am returning to the Muses despite their injury, forcing words to fit alternating measures.
