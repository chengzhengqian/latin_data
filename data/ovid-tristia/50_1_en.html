<p>“Though sent to this city I come in fear, an exile’s book. Stretch forth a kindly hand to me in my weariness, friendly reader, and fear not that I may perchance bring shame upon you; not a line on this paper teaches love. Such is my master’s fate that the wretched man ought not to conceal it with any jests. Even that work<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL151_101_1" id="target_note_LCL151_101_1"><sup>1</sup></a> which once was his ill-starred amusement in the green of youth, too late, alas! he condemns and hates. Examine what I bring: you will see nothing here except sadness, and the verse befits its own state. If the lame couplets halt in alternate verses, ’tis due to the metre’s nature<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL151_100_2" id="target_note_LCL151_100_2"><sup>2</sup></a> or to the length of the journey; if I am not golden with oil of cedar nor smoothed with the pumice, ’tis because I blushed to be better dressed than my master; if the letters are spotted and blurred with erasures, ’tis because the poet with tears has injured his own work. If any expressions perchance shall seem not Latin, the land wherein he wrote was a barbarian land. Tell me, readers, if it is not a trouble, whither I ought to go, what abode I, a book from foreign lands, should seek in the city.”</p>
