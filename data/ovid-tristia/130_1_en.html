husband’s testimony. That none may think it rashly given, stand thou firm; preserve me and thy loyal devotion alike. For thy goodness, whilst I stood secure, remained free from accusation’s taint, at best uncriticized,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL151_261_1" id="target_note_LCL151_261_1"><sup>1</sup></a> but now by my fall a space has been cleared for thee; here let thy virtue build a structure clear to see. ’Tis easy to be good when that which forbids it has been removed and a wife has nothing opposing her duty. When the god thunders, not to avoid the cloud—that is loyalty indeed, that is wedded love. Rare indeed is the virtue not piloted by Fortune, which remains on steady feet when Fortune flees. Yet whenever virtue is herself her own coveted reward and remains upright in adversity, though you count all time, she is passed over in silence by no age and is given homage wherever the world’s highway extends. Seest thou how Penelope’s faith is praised in the long reaches of time and how her name never dies? How Admetus’ wife<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL151_261_2" id="target_note_LCL151_261_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and Hector’s<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL151_261_3" id="target_note_LCL151_261_3"><sup>3</sup></a> are sung, and the daughter of Iphis,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL151_261_4" id="target_note_LCL151_261_4"><sup>4</sup></a> who dared to mount the lighted pyre? How the wife of the hero<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL151_261_5" id="target_note_LCL151_261_5"><sup>5</sup></a> of Phylacos lives, whose husband touched with his swift foot the soil of Ilium? I need not thy death, but thy love, thy faith; not by hard ways hast thou to seek for fame. Nor believe that I am reminding thee because thou art not acting: I am but giving sails to a ship that is already using the oars. He who reminds thee to do what thou art already doing, by so reminding praises thy acts and by his very exhortation approves them.</p>
