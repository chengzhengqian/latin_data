The foe with his bows and with arrows dipped in poison fiercely circles the walls upon his panting steed, and as the sheep which has not found shelter in the fold is carried and dragged through field, through forest by the ravening wolf, so ’tis with him whom the barbarian finds not yet sheltered within the hedge of the gates, but in the fields: that man either follows into captivity and submits to the bonds cast about his throat or he dies by an envenomed missile. This is the place in which, a new colonist in an abode of anxiety, I lie secluded—alas! too long is the period of my fate!</p>

But there is none to whom I may read my verses, none whose ears can comprehend Latin words. I write for myself—what else can I do?—and I read to myself, and my writing is secure in its own criticism. Yet have I often said, “For whom this careful toil?

And since of the many not many survive, see thou readest them with indulgence, whoever thou mayst be! Thou too take in good part verse that is not better than my lot, O Rome forbidden to me!</p>
