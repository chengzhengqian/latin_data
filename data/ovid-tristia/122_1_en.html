May the gods and Caesar ever grant thee their friendship! Prayer of mine could not be fuller than this. These things, if thou wouldst permit, my toil would place in eloquent books in a bright light to be seen of all: even now, though my Muse has been constrained to silence, she scarce refrains from naming thee against thy will. As a hound that has scented the trail of a timorous hind, straining in vain, is held in check by the unyielding leash, as upon the door of the barrier as yet unlocked the eager steed frets now with his hoof, now with his very brow, so my Thalia, fettered and confined by the law thou hast imposed, longs to course o’er the glory of thy forbidden name. Yet that thou mayst not be injured by the homage of a grateful friend, I will obey thy commands, fear not. But I would not obey, if thou didst not think me grateful; this, which thy word does not forbid, I shall be—grateful; and so long as I behold the light of life—and may the time be short!—that life shall be a slave to thy service.</p>
