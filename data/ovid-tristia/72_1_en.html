Thou art more cruel than harsh Busiris, more cruel than he<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL151_145_1" id="target_note_LCL151_145_1"><sup>1</sup></a> who heated the artifical bull over a slow fire and gave the bull, they say, to the Sicilian lord<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL151_145_2" id="target_note_LCL151_145_2"><sup>2</sup></a> commending his work of art with the words: “In this gift, O King, there is profit, greater than appears, for not the appearance alone of my work is worthy of praise. Seest thou on the right that the bull’s flank may be opened? Through this thou must thrust whomsoever thou wouldst destroy.

That thou mayst sate thy thirst in my bood and carry as much joy as thou wilt in thy greedy heart, I have endured so many woes by land in my flight, so many by sea, that I think even thou canst feel pain at the hearing of them. Truly, Ulysses was fortunate, compared with me, for Neptune’s wrath was less than Jove’s has been. So then, whoever thou art, do not open again the charges against me, remove thy hard hands from my dangerous wound, and that forgetfulness may lessen the ill repute of my fault, permit a scar to cover my deed; </p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL151_145_1"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL151_145_1" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">1</sup>Perillus.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL151_145_1').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL151_145_2"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL151_145_2" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">2</sup>Phalaris.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL151_145_2').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
