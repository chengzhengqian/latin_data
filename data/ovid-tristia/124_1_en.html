these who are believed to derive their descent from the Greek city<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL151_249_1" id="target_note_LCL151_249_1"><sup>1</sup></a> wear Persian trousers instead of the dress of their fathers. They hold intercourse in the tongue they share; I must make myself understood by gestures. Here it is I that am a barbarian, understood by nobody; the Getae laugh stupidly at Latin words, and in my presence they often talk maliciously about me in perfect security, perchance reproaching me with my exile. Naturally they think that I am poking fun at them<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL151_249_2" id="target_note_LCL151_249_2"><sup>2</sup></a> whenever I have nodded no or yes to their speech. And besides unjustly the hard sword dispenses justice, for wounds are often given in the midst of the market-place.</p>

Ah! cruel Lachesis,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL151_249_3" id="target_note_LCL151_249_3"><sup>3</sup></a> when my star is so ill-fated, not to have granted my life a shorter thread! That I am separated from the sight of my country and of you, my friends, that I must lament my abode among these Scythian tribes—each is a heavy penalty. Yet I deserved exile from the city; I did not perchance deserve to be in such a place. What am I saying? Madman that I am! Even my very life I deserved to lose by offending the divine will of Caesar.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">XI. To his Wife</span></h3>
<p>Someone by way of insult has said that thou art “an exile’s wife”—of this thy letter complains. I was hurt, not so much that my fate is spoken of with malice—for I am now used to bear my wretchedness with fortitude—as that I am the cause of shame to thee to whom I would wish it least of all, and to think that thou must have blushed for my misfortunes.</p>
