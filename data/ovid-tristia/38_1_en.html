strange man. Since certain women stroll in them, intent on meeting a lover there, why does any portico stand open? What place more dignified than the temples?

As she worships in the neighbouring temple of Juno, the thought will come upon her that many rivals have caused this goddess wrath. When she has looked on Pallas, she will ask why the virgin brought up Erichthonius, the child of sin.
