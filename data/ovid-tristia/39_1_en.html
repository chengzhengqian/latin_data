Yet why is my muse so wanton? Why does my book advise anybody to love? There is naught for me but confession of my error and my obvious fault: I repent of my talent and my tastes. Why rather did I not harass once again in my song Troy, which fell before the Argive arms? Why was I silent of Thebes and the mutual wounds of the brothers,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL151_78_1" id="target_note_LCL151_78_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and the seven gates each under command of its own leader? Warlike Rome did not refuse me a subject, and ’tis a pious task to tell the story of one’s native land. In fine, since thou hast filled the world with thy great deeds, Caesar, some one part of those many should have been the theme of my song, and as the glittering rays of the sun attract the eye, so thy exploits would have drawn forth my powers. Undeservedly am I blamed. Poor is the field I plough; that was a theme mighty and fruitful. A skiff ought not to trust itself to the sea just because it ventures to disport itself in a little pool. Perhaps (but even this I doubt) I am well enough suited to lighter verse, capable of humble measures; but if thou shouldst bid me sing of the Giants conquered by Jove’s lightning, the burden will weaken me in the attempt. Only a rich mind can tell the tale of Caesar’s mighty deeds if the theme is not to surpass the work. Even so I made the venture, but methought I impaired the theme and—an impious thing—wrought injury to thy might.</p>

I returned once more to my light task, the songs of youth, stimulating my breast with fictitious love. Would that I had not! But my fate drew me on to be clever to my own hurt. Alas that I ever acquired learning! Why did my parents teach me? Why did any letter ever beguile my eyes? </p></section><notes></notes></section>
