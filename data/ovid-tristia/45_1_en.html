Göll, <span class="italic">Gallus</span>, p. 475) find a reference to the game called <span class="italic">duodecim scripta</span>, which was in some respects like backgammon. It was played on a board with 12 lines (<span class="italic">duodecim scripta</span>) with 15 pieces on a side which were moved forwards and backwards according to the throws of the dice. But it is more probable that this couplet (and also <span class="italic">Ars amat</span>. iii. 355–356) refer to a game in which there were several sides or contestants. Each player had to decide at the throw of the dice which side or player to “join” (<span class="italic">subire</span>), which to “challenge (= <span class="italic">vocare, provocare</span>), <span class="italic">cf</span>. Brandt on <span class="italic">Ars amat</span>. iii. 353 f., 205. As in <span class="italic">duod. script</span>. the moves were conditioned by the throws (<span class="italic">dare missa</span>).

It was played with 30 pieces on each side on a board marked in squares. At least two kinds of pieces can be distinguished: <span class="italic">latrones</span> (<span class="italic">bellatores, milites</span>?), “officers,” and others called collectively <span class="italic">mandra</span>, “herd,” “drive,” <span class="italic">i.e</span>. “pawns” (?). Some scholars consider the <span class="italic">milites</span> to have been different from the <span class="italic">latrones</span>. The pieces or men were white, black, or (more commonly in the case of the <span class="italic">latrones</span>) variegated. Some (the <span class="italic">latrones</span>?) had greater freedom of movement (<span class="italic">vagi</span>) than others (<span class="italic">ordinarii</span>) but the only moves definitely known were straight forward and backward.
