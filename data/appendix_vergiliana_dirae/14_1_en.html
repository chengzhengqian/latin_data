<p class="noindent">[“Sweet lands, farewell! And Lydia, sweeter still, farewell, and ye, pure fountains, and ye fields of happy name!”]</p>
<p class="noindent">Ah! Poor she goats, come more slowly down the mountain: never again will ye browse on the soft familiar pastures; and do you, father of the flock, remain behind! Lo, upon the plains, my first and last possession, I gaze: to be bereft of them for ever remains my lot.</p>
<p class="noindent">[“Once more ye fields, farewell, and you, best Lydia, farewell; whether you live or not, in either case you will die with me.”]</p>
<p class="noindent">Our last strain, Battarus, let us recall on the reed!</p>
<p class="noindent">“Sooner shall sweet become bitter, and soft hard; eyes shall see white as black, and right as left; atoms of things shall pass into bodies of other kinds before love of you shall pass from my heart. Though you become fire, though water, I shall always love you.” [always I shall be allowed to recall your joys]</p>
