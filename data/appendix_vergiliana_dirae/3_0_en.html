Aetna were mediocre poets and worse; and the gods and men and booksellers whom they affronted by existing allotted them for transcription to worse than mediocre scribes. The Ciris was indited by a twaddler, and the Culex and Aetna by stutterers: but what they stuttered and twaddled was Latin, not double-Dutch; and great part of it is now double-Dutch, and Latin no more. The deep corruption of the mss is certified not merely by the jargon which they offer us, but by other and external proofs. For 150 verses of the Aetna we have the fragmentum Gyraldinum, and it reveals, for instance, that the mss on which we depend for the bulk of the poem have altered v. 227 <span class="italic">ingenium sacrare caputque</span> attollere <span class="italic">caelo</span> into <span class="italic">sacra peringentem capitique</span> attollere <span class="italic">caelum.</span> For 100 verses of the Ciris we have the codex Bruxellensis, and it tells us that the other mss have substituted <span class="italic">secum heu</span> for <span class="italic">eheu</span> at 469 and <span class="italic">uexauit et aegros</span> for <span class="italic">uexarier undis</span> at 481.

Just as it is hard to tell, in Statius or Valerius Flaccus, whether this or that absurd expression is due to miscopying or to the divine afflatus of the bard, so in the Culex and Ciris and Aetna it is for ever to be borne in mind that they are the work of poetasters.
