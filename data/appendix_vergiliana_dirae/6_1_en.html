<span class="italic">Moretum</span> survived on its own merits until “in the wholesale transference of Latin literature from roll to codex, it was swept into the Virgilian net,” very much as the poems of Lygdamus and Sulpicia were preserved by association with Tibullus. The poem describes in detail the preparation of his lunch by a ploughman with the aid of his African serving maid.</p>

<p>These three pieces are now acknowledged to be poems of Ausonius, whose oeuvre, like that of all creators who are both prolific and multifarious, poses difficulties for those compiling a complete canon; it is easy for minor pieces which are not obviously connected with larger portions of the author’s work nor marked with his name to become detached. As with so much else in the <span class="italic">Appendix Vergiliana,</span> such anonymous fragments could conveniently be assigned to Virgil, whose poems were intimately known to Ausonius.</p>
