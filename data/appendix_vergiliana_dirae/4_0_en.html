at being parted from his sweetheart by one who has also suffered eviction.</p>
<p>Yet another versifier has interpolated in <span class="italic">Dirae</span> some lines of farewell to Lydia in an attempt (exposed by Eduard Fraenkel) to give a unity to the two poems.</p>

<span class="italic">Culex</span>
</span>
<p>Although among the poems of the <span class="italic">Appendix</span> the external evidence for Virgilian authorship is strongest in the case of <span class="italic">Culex,</span> there can be little doubt that it is a fake: chronology forbids the claim of the composerâ€™s intimacy with Octavius in their student days, at a time when he was apparently able to echo passages from the <span class="italic">Eclogues, Georgics,</span> and <span class="italic">Aeneid.</span> Fraenkel quotes a particularly telling example: the phrase <span class="italic">hinc atque hinc</span> does not occur before the <span class="italic">Aeneid</span> (1.162, 500; 4.447; 8.387; 9.380, 440, 550; and 12.431) and rarely after it; but the author of <span class="italic">Culex</span> twice (16, 221) adopted this peculiarity of the <span class="italic">Aeneid</span> as he did many others.</p>
<p>Fraenkel is probably right in seeing behind <span class="italic">Culex</span> a Greek poem, the story of which was as follows. Overcome by the heat of the noonday sun, a shepherd falls asleep in the shade of a tree; however, a deadly serpent is creeping towards him and would undoubtedly have killed him, had not a kindly gnat warned him of his danger by stinging him in the eye; up jumps the shepherd in rage and at once crushes the insect; now fully awake he catches sight of the serpent, which he batters to death with a bough torn from a tree in desperation. As he sleeps that night he is haunted by the spirit of the gnat, which reproaches him for his ingratitude.</p>
