<p class="noindent">“Turn back your running waters, ye roving streams; turn back, and pour them again over the opposing fields: let brooks from all sides rush in with deep-cleaving waters, and let them not suffer our lands to be enslaved to vagabonds!”</p>
<p class="noindent">This sweeter strain, O Battarus, I remember you recalled:</p>
<p class="noindent">“Let marshes from parched ground suddenly spring forth, and, where once we gathered corn ears, let this man reap rushes; let the croaking frog dwell in the chirping cricket’s hollow lairs!”</p>
<p class="noindent">This sadder strain let my pipe give forth in turn:</p>
<p class="noindent">“From high mountains let rains rush streaming down, and with outspread flood widely occupy the plains; then, menacing evil to their lords, let them leave stagnant pools! When the waters, rushing down, reach my fields, then let the foreign ploughman fish within my bounds—a foreigner, who has always gained wealth from civil strife.”</p>
<p class="noindent">Accursed fields that stand as an indictment of those who seized you, and you, O Discord, ever the foe of your fellow citizens, have I, a needy exile, though not condemned to that, left my lands that a soldier may receive the rewards of deadly war? From this mound will I look my last upon my lands; from this will I pass to the woods; soon will the hills, soon will the mountains obstruct my view, but the plains will be able to hear me.</p>
