<p>Deep uncertainty surrounds the origins and transmission of the <span class="italic">Appendix Vergiliana.</span> It is essentially a heterogeneous collection; we know neither the circumstances in which it was put together nor the agent who was responsible. The items are identified by being mostly mentioned by Donatus and Servius, but the only clue to the textual tradition is an entry in a 9th-century Murbach catalogue which describes a manuscript containing the items 1–9 and a, b, c detailed above. Unfortunately this manuscript does not survive, and “since only two manuscripts contain as many as three works in the same order as the Murbacensis and only two late manuscripts contain in any order more than five, it is by no means clear that the Murbacensis or indeed any single manuscript gave rise to the extant tradition” (Reeve, 1983, 43).</p>
<p>In these circumstances my textual notes do not aspire to furnish more than first aid, and for the sake of clarity and simplicity the siglum W is employed to denote what seems to be the textual tradition of each item and thus will often refer to different mss; that such readings are archetypal and indeed those of the Murbacensis is conceivable though far from certain.</p>
