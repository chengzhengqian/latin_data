that their goodness and their existence are two different things. For let us suppose that one and the same good substance is white, heavy and round. Then its particular substance, its roundness, colour and goodness would all be different things. For if each of these qualities were the same as its particular substance, weight would be the same thing as colour, colour as goodness, and goodness as weightâ€”which is contrary to nature. Then in that case existence in them would be one thing, their particular being another, and then they would be good, but they would not have their particular being good. Therefore if they existed in any way, they would not be from the good and so good, and they would not be the same because good, but for them existence would be one thing, being good another. But if they were nothing else at all except good, and were neither heavy nor coloured nor extended in a spatial dimension, and there were in them no quality save only that they were good, then they (or rather it) would seem to be not things but the principle of things; for there is one thing alone of this kind, that is only good and nothing else. But since they are not simple, they could not even exist at all unless that which is the one sole good had willed them to exist. They are called good simply because their existence has derived from the will of the good. For the first good, since it exists, is good in virtue of its existence; but the secondary good, since it has derived from that whose existence is itself good, is itself also good. But the particular being of all things has derived from that which is the first good and which is such a
