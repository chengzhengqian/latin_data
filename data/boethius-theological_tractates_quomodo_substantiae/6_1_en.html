good that it is rightly said to be good in virtue of its existence. Therefore their particular being is good; for then it is in the first good.</p>
<p>Thereby the problem is solved. For though they are good in virtue of their existence, they are not therefore like the first good, since their particular being is not good under all circumstances, but because the particular being of things cannot exist unless it has derived from the first being, that is, the good; therefore their particular being is good, but it is not like that from which it derives. For that is good in any conditions in virtue of its existence; for it is nothing else than good. But if the former were not derived from that good, it could perhaps be good, but it could not be good in virtue of its existence. For in that case it might perhaps participate in the good; but their particular being, which such things would not have from the good, they could not have as good. Therefore, the first good being removed from these things by a mental process, these things, though they might be good, yet could not be good in virtue of their existence, and since they could not actually have existed unless that which is truly good had produced them, therefore their existence is good and yet that which has derived from the substantial good is not like its source; and unless they had derived from it, though they were good yet they could not be good in virtue of their existence, since they would be both apart from the good and not derived from it, while that very first good is existence itself and good itself and good existence itself. But will not those things which are white also have to be white in virtue of their being white, since they have derived from the will of God that they should be
