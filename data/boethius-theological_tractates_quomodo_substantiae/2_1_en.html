therefore followed the example of the mathematical<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL074_41_a" id="target_note_LCL074_41_a"><sup>a</sup></a> and cognate sciences and laid down bounds and rules according to which I shall develop all that follows.</p>
<p>I. A common conception of the mind is a statement which anyone accepts as soon as he hears it. Of these there are two kinds. For one is common in that all men possess it; as, for instance, if you say, “If you take equals from two equals, the remainders are equal.” Nobody who grasps that would deny it. But the other kind is intelligible only to the learned, though it is derived from the same class of common conceptions; as “Things which are incorporeal are not in space,” and the like; these conceptions are approved as obvious to the learned but not to the common herd.</p>
<p>II. Being and the thing that is<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL074_41_b" id="target_note_LCL074_41_b"><sup>b</sup></a> are different. For simple being awaits manifestation, but the thing that is is and exists as soon as it has received the form which gives it being.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL074_41_c" id="target_note_LCL074_41_c"><sup>c</sup></a></p>
<p>III. What is, can participate in something, but simple being does not participate in any way in anything. For participation is effected when something already is; but something is, when it has acquired being.</p>
<p>IV. That which is can possess something besides what it is itself. But simple being has no admixture of aught besides itself.</p>
<p>V. Merely to be something and to be something in virtue of existence are different; the former signifies an accident, the latter a substance.</p>
