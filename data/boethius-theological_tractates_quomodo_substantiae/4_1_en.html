being is good. But they owe their particular being to absolute being. Their existence therefore is good; therefore mere existence of all things is good. But if their existence is good, things which exist are good in virtue of their existence, and their existence is the same as the existence of the good. Therefore they are substantial goods, since they do not participate in goodness. But if the particular being in them is good, there is no doubt but that since they are substantial goods, they are like the first good, and thereby they will be that good itself; for nothing is like it save itself. Hence all things that are, are Godâ€”an impious assertion. Wherefore they are not substantial goods, and so there is not in them good existence; therefore they are not good in virtue of their existence. But neither do they participate in goodness; for they would in no wise tend to good. Therefore they are in no wise good.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL074_45_a" id="target_note_LCL074_45_a"><sup>a</sup></a></p>
<p>This problem will admit of the following solution.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL074_45_b" id="target_note_LCL074_45_b"><sup>b</sup></a> There are many things which are separated by a mental process, though they cannot be separated in fact. No one, for instance, actually separates a triangle or other mathematical figure from the underlying matter; but separating it mentally one considers the triangle itself and its properties apart from matter. Let us therefore remove from the mind for a moment the presence of the first good, which it is certainly agreed exists, as can be known from the opinion of all men, learned and unlearned, and from the religious beliefs of savage races. This having been thus for a moment removed, let us postulate that all things that are good exist, and let us consider how they could possibly be good if they did not derive from the first good. This leads me to perceive
