white? By no means. For existence is one thing, their being white is another; and that because he who produced them so that they existed is indeed good, but certainly not white. It is therefore in accordance with the will of the good that they should be good in virtue of their existence; but that which is a property of a thing like whiteness is not in accordance with the will of him who is not white, that it should be white in virtue of its existence; for such things have not derived from the will of one who is white. And so they are white simply because one who was not white willed them to be white; but because he willed them to be good who was good, they are good in virtue of their existence. Ought, then, according to this reasoning, all things to be just, since he himself is just who willed them to exist? That is not so either. For being good refers to essence, being just, to action. But in him being and acting are the same; and therefore being good is the same as being just. But for us being is not the same as acting; for we are not simple. Therefore being good is not the same for us as being just, but being is the same for all of us in virtue of our existence. Therefore all things are good, but not also just. Moreover, good is a genus, but just is a species, and this species does not apply to all. Therefore some things are just, others are something else, but all things are good.</p>
