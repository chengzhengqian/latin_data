Vulcan’s acknowledged haunt. As one passes beneath, the pools lie motionless oozing in veins of natural bituminous oil. I have often seen dogs dragged hither fordone from mischievous wasting, and their custodians overcome by still heavier suffering. “Thee first, O Vulcan, and thy peace, holy dweller in this place, do we entreat: grant final aid to our wearied fortunes, and, if no guilt is here deserving penalty so great, pity these many lives and suffer them, holy one, to attain to thy fountains”—thrice does each one call, thrice they offer rich incense on the fire, and the altar is piled with fruitful branches. Hereat (wondrous to tell and a portent elsewhere unknown) from the confronting caves and the mountain’s riven breast there has come, exultant in southern gales and darting forth ’mid a full flood of flame, the God himself: his priest, waving in pallid hand the olive branch, proclaims aloud: “In the presence of the God, in the presence of the altars, I ordain that all go out of the land far from here, who have put their hands to crime or contemplated it in their heart”: forthwith droop their spirits and their nervous limbs. Oh! whoso has ever impaired heaven’s law in the case of a wretched suppliant, whoso for a price has dared to aim at the life of brothers or of faithful friend or to outrage ancestral gods—if such a man be impelled hither by audacity, the comrade of unutterable sin, he will learn how mighty is the power of the God who followeth after as the avenger in wrath for crime committed.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL284_195_aa" id="target_note_LCL284_195_aa">
