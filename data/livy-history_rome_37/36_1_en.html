Calling for silence from the tower of the flagship, he said “Get up and take in with your eyes a wonderful sight.” They all rose and, observing the terror-stricken flight of their enemy, cried out with almost one voice that they should give chase. Eudamus’ own ship had been damaged in numerous collisions but he ordered Pamphilidas and Chariclitus to follow for as long as they thought safe. They did follow for a while, but when Hannibal began to approach the shore they became afraid of being pinned down by the wind on a coast held by the enemy and so returned to Eudamus. Then, with difficulty, they towed to Phaselis the captured ship with seven banks of oars that had been wrecked in the first collision.
