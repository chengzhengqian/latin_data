Then, when large numbers rushed there to defend it, a ram was moved up at the other point and the walls were then being demolished in both locations. Where they collapsed, Roman soldiers attacked over the fallen masonry and others also tried to scale the walls with ladders. So stubbornly did the townspeople resist, however, that it was readily apparent that they received more aid from their arms and their courage than from their fortifications.</p>
<p>The praetor was therefore forced by the danger facing his men to have the retreat sounded as he feared to expose his unwary soldiers to men crazed with frenzied despair. Not even when the battle was interrupted did the townspeople stop to rest; instead they rushed off in all directions to strengthen defenses and fill the gaps where they had been demolished. While they were engaged in this operation, Quintus Antonius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL301_383_114" id="target_note_LCL301_383_114"><sup>114</sup></a> approached them, sent by the praetor.
