This fact actually raised the confidence of the Romans: they could see that they had been allowed a crossing to Asia, something they had believed would involve heavy fighting. They remained in camp on the Hellespont for some time because the days of the moving of the shields—when there is a religious injunction against traveling—happened to have come round. Those same days had also separated Publius Scipio from the army as the religious obligations touched him more personally because he was a Salian priest; and he too caused delay for the army until he caught up.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL301_387_118" id="target_note_LCL301_387_118"><sup>118</sup></a></p>
