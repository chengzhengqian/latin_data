<p>When Pausistratus heard that Polyxenidas would be remiss in handling his fleet, he immediately became so himself. He sent some of his ships to Halicarnassus to fetch supplies and others to the city of Samos &lt;. . .&gt;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL301_319_47a" id="target_note_LCL301_319_47a"><sup>47</sup></a> so that he would be ready when he received the signal to attack from the traitor. Polyxenidas used more deception to delude him further: he beached a number of ships and rebuilt dockyards to make it look as if he would beach others; and instead of bringing his oarsmen to Ephesus from their winter quarters, he secretly assembled them at Magnesia.</p>
<p>11. When one of Antiochus’ soldiers had by chance come to Samos on a private matter, he was arrested as a spy and brought to the commander at Panhormus. Pausistratus asked him what was going on in Ephesus and he—whether from fear or from lack of loyalty to his own people is uncertain—told all. The fleet was anchored in the harbor drawn up and ready for action, he said; all the oarsmen had been sent to Magnesia;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL301_319_48" id="target_note_LCL301_319_48"><sup>48</sup></a> very few ships had been hauled ashore, and the docks were being covered over;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL301_319_49" id="target_note_LCL301_319_49"><sup>49</sup></a>

Walsh (37.137) suggests that Pausistratus wants the ships to take grain on board at the two cities, so that on their return he would be ready to move when given the signal. This is not convincing and, as has long been suspected, there may be a lacuna in the text; but all suggested supplements are, as Briscoe notes, also unconvincing,  and he suggests that “mere indication of a lacuna would be the more prudent course.”</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL301_319_47a').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL301_319_48"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL301_319_48" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">48</sup>Magnesia-on-the-Meander: <span class="italic">Barr.</span> 61 F2.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL301_319_48').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL301_319_49"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL301_319_49" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">49</sup>The reading (<span class="italic">tegi</span>) here is uncertain.
