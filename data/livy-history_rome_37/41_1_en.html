with provisions, and had promised 5,000 jars of wine. In midjourney Aemilius suddenly turned the fleet toward Teos, intending to take over, with the Teans’ assent, the supplies prepared for the enemy or else to treat the Teans themselves as enemies. After they turned their prows landward, some fifteen ships appeared before them off Myonnesus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL301_369_102" id="target_note_LCL301_369_102"><sup>102</sup></a> and the praetor, initially believing them to be from the king’s fleet, proceeded to give chase. But it then became clear that they were the cutters and skiffs of buccaneers. They had been raiding the coastline of Chios and were returning with all manner of plunder; and when they saw the Roman fleet from the open sea they turned to flight. They had the advantage of speed with their lighter vessels (expressly built for that) and they were also closer to land. As a result, they made good their escape to Myonnesus before the fleet could get near them. The praetor, having no knowledge of the area, began to follow them, thinking he would force the ships out of the harbor.</p>
<p>Myonnesus is a promontory lying between Teos and Samos, and is actually a cone-shaped hill rising from a rather broad base to a sharp peak. On the landward side it is accessible by a narrow pathway, and on the seaward side it terminates with cliffs eroded by the waves, so that in places the overhanging rocks jut out to sea beyond vessels at anchor there. The ships did not venture to approach land in that area in case they came within weapon range of the pirates, who were standing on the cliffs above them, and so they frittered away a day. Finally, with approach of night, they abandoned their abortive enterprise and moved on to Teos the following day. They moored their ships in the harbor behind the town—the local people call it Geraesticus—and the praetor sent his men forth to pillage the countryside around the city.</p>
