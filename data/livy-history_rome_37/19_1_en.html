and their magistrates proceeded to discuss with Livius terms of surrender, with the acquiescence even of Philotas, the garrison commander. A solution was delayed by their failure to agree on whether the king’s men were to be released with or without their weapons. They were negotiating this when news of the Rhodian disaster arrived and the matter was taken out of their hands; for Livius feared that Polyxenidas, encouraged by his success in such a major operation, might swoop down on the fleet stationed at Canae. He immediately discontinued the siege of Abydus and his protection of the Hellespont, and launched the ships that had been hauled ashore at Canae; and Eumenes also came to Elaea.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL301_325_53" id="target_note_LCL301_325_53"><sup>53</sup></a> Livius now made for Phocaea with his entire fleet, to which he had added two Mytilenean triremes. On hearing that the town was occupied by a powerful royal garrison and that Seleucus’ camp was not far away, he raided the coastline, hurriedly loaded the ships with his plunder (mostly human), and waited only for Eumenes to catch up with his fleet before he set sail for Samos.</p>

Then, aware that they had been taken by trickery and, worst of all, by one of their fellow citizens, their sorrow turned to anger. They immediately dispatched ten ships and a few days later a further ten, all under the command of Eudamus who, in general military skills, was in no way Pausistratus’ equal, but as he was less enterprising they believed he would be a more cautious leader.</p>
