died out. He had left his son Seleucus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL301_313_37" id="target_note_LCL301_313_37"><sup>37</sup></a> with an army in Aeolis to keep the coastal cities under control; Eumenes was inciting them to rebellion on the one side (from Pergamum), and the Romans were doing so on the other (from Phocaea and Erythrae).</p>
<p>The Roman fleet was wintering at Canae, as noted above,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL301_313_38" id="target_note_LCL301_313_38"><sup>38</sup></a> and about midwinter King Eumenes arrived there with 2,000 infantry and 500 cavalry. He claimed that a large amount of plunder could be taken from enemy territory around Thyatira,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL301_313_39" id="target_note_LCL301_313_39"><sup>39</sup></a> and by his urging prevailed upon Livius to send 5,000 men with him.

Winter quarters for the ships caused hardship for the Phocaeans; their tribute also caused hardship as 500 togas and 500 tunics had been requisitioned from them; even further hardship came from a shortage of grain and because of that the fleet and Roman garrison left them. With that the faction trying win the support of the commons for Antiochus in their meetings was delivered from fear; and while the senate and aristocrats advocated standing by the Roman alliance, the ringleaders of the disaffection had more influence with the masses.</p>
<p>Compensating for their tardiness the previous summer, the Rhodians were this time early in sending out Pausistratus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL301_313_41" id="target_note_LCL301_313_41"><sup>41</sup></a> (the same admiral as before) at the spring equinox, with thirty-six ships.
