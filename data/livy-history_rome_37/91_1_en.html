<p>In this period Lucius Aemilius Regillus, who had with his fleet defeated King Antiochus’ admiral,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL301_469_211" id="target_note_LCL301_469_211"><sup>211</sup></a> was given an audience with the senate in the temple of Apollo outside the city. When the senators heard of his achievements, the size of the enemy fleets<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL301_469_212" id="target_note_LCL301_469_212"><sup>212</sup></a> he had met in battle, and the number of ships he had sunk or captured, he was voted a naval triumph<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL301_469_213a" id="target_note_LCL301_469_213a"><sup>213</sup></a> by a large majority.
