<p>The euphoria of the triumph was curtailed by bad news from Spain where there had been a defeat in the war against the Lusitanians at the town of Lyco in the territory of the Bastetani.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL301_427_166" id="target_note_LCL301_427_166"><sup>166</sup></a> Six thousand men from the Roman army under the command of the proconsul Lucius Aemilius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL301_427_167" id="target_note_LCL301_427_167"><sup>167</sup></a> had lost their lives and the rest had been driven in panic within the palisade of their camp. After barely managing to defend this, they were brought back by forced marches into pacified territory like fugitives. Such was the news from Spain.</p>
<p>Envoys from the peoples of Placentia<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL301_427_168" id="target_note_LCL301_427_168"><sup>168</sup></a> and Cremona in Gaul were ushered into the senate by the praetor Lucius Aurunculeius. They complained about the dearth of colonists, some of whom had been lost as casualties of war, others through disease, while yet others had abandoned their colonies because they were sick of having Gauls as neighbors. The senate decreed that the consul Gaius Laelius should, if he agreed, enroll 6,000 households to be divided between the colonies involved, and that the praetor Lucius Aurunculeius should establish a board of three to escort the colonists. Chosen for this were Marcus Atilius Serranus, Lucius Valerius Flaccus, son of Publius, and Lucius Valerius Tappo, son of Gaius.</p>

He not only enrolled colonists to supplement the populations of Cremona and Placentia in accordance with the senatorial decree passed in his absence, but he also put forward a motion that two new colonies be founded in what had been territory of the Boii<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL301_427_169" id="target_note_LCL301_427_169"><sup>169</sup></a> and the senate approved his proposal.</p>
