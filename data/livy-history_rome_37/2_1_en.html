or else pay a thousand talents and accept the same friends and enemies as the Romans.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL301_291_3" id="target_note_LCL301_291_3"><sup>3</sup></a> The Aetolians wanted clarification of the areas in which they would be in the senate’s hands but were given no clear answer. They were therefore sent off without a peace settlement and ordered to leave the city that same day and Italy within fifteen days.</p>
<p>Discussion of the consuls’ provinces then began. Both wanted Greece; and Laelius had great influence in the senate. When the senate instructed the consuls either to proceed to sortition or come to an agreement on the provinces, he said the consuls would be better advised to leave the matter to the judgment of the senators than to a lottery. Scipio, after replying that he would reflect on the course he should take, then discussed the question with his brother, and with him alone. Told by his brother that he could confidently leave the matter to the senate, he reported to his colleague that he would accept his suggestion. This was a novel procedure or else one based on precedents long forgotten and it had piqued the interest of the senators, who were now expecting a contest. Then Publius Scipio Africanus declared that, if the senators formally assigned the province of Greece to his brother, Lucius Scipio, he would go there as his legate. This statement, which was received with great approval, ended the contest. The senate wished to put to the test which of the two had the more solid support, Antiochus in the defeated Hannibal or the consul and the Roman legions in his conqueror, Africanus. Their decision to assign Greece to Scipio and Italy to Laelius was almost unanimous.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL301_291_4a" id="target_note_LCL301_291_4a"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
