<p>“Members of the senate, I am not going to say: ‘Who in this war can stand comparison with me in terms of services to you?’ Of all those whom you greatly esteem, whether they be peoples or monarchs, there is none with whom I would not venture to compare myself. Masinissa was your enemy before he was your ally,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL301_449_193" id="target_note_LCL301_449_193"><sup>193</sup></a> and he did not come over to you with auxiliary forces when his kingdom was intact.
