 The Rhodians were not averse to peace but Eumenes declared it was neither honorable to discuss peace terms at this juncture nor possible to bring the matter to a conclusion. “For,” he said, “how shall we honorably accept so-called peace terms when we are shut up within our walls facing a siege? Or who will consider such a peace treaty valid when we shall have concluded it without the consul and without senatorial authorization or the bidding of the Roman people? Supposing that peace <span class="italic">is</span> made on your authority, I have this question: are you going to return to Italy immediately, withdrawing your fleet and your army? Or are you going wait for word of the consul’s pleasure in the matter, for the vote of the senate or the order of the Roman people? Your only option in that case is to stay in Asia and have your troops led back to winter quarters, abandoning the campaign and draining your allies by their provisioning of supplies! And then, if those with the authority see fit, we must start the war all over again, a war that we can have finished before winter, god willing, if none of the impetus in the operation is lost through delay.”</p>
<p>This view carried the day and Antiochus was given the reply that peace terms could not be discussed before the arrival of the consul. His attempt to gain peace a failure, Antiochus first laid waste the fields of the people of Elaea and after that those of the Pergamenes. Leaving his son Seleucus in place, he then marched on Adramytteum and headed for the rich land they call the Plain of Thebe, made famous by Homer’s poetry.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL301_345_74" id="target_note_LCL301_345_74"><sup>74</sup></a> In no other place in Asia was greater booty won by the soldiers of the king. Aemilius and Eumenes, sailing around with their ships, also came to Adramytteum in order to give protection to the city.</p>
