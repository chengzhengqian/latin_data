While these events were taking place in Asia two proconsuls arrived in Rome from their provinces at about the same time, hoping for a triumph: Quintus Minucius from Liguria and Manius Acilius from Aetolia. After the senate had heard accounts of the exploits of each man, Minucius was refused a triumph while Acilius was voted one by a large majority, and he rode into the city in triumph over King Antiochus and the Aetolians. Borne before him in that triumph were 230 military standards, 3,000 lbs of uncoined silver, 113,000 Attic four-drachma coins, 249,000 coins stamped with the <span class="italic">cista,</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL301_425_163" id="target_note_LCL301_425_163"><sup>163</sup></a> and many embossed silver vessels of great weight.

(A few days earlier the Aetolian leader Damocritus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL301_425_165a" id="target_note_LCL301_425_165a"><sup>165</sup></a> after escaping from prison by night, fatally stabbed himself with a sword on the bank of the Tiber before he could be overtaken by the guards that were chasing him.) All that was missing were soldiers to attend his chariot; apart from that, the triumph was splendid as a spectacle and as a celebration of Acilius’ achievements.</p>
