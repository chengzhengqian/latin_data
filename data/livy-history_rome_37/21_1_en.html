peasants there that enemy ships were anchored at Aethalia, they held a meeting to decide whether to fight it out immediately or await the Rhodian fleet. Deferring the encounter (such was their decision), they crossed to Corycus, the point from which they had come. After a fruitless wait, Polyxenidas also went back to Ephesus.</p>
<p>With the sea unimpeded by the enemy, the Roman ships now crossed to Samos and the Rhodian fleet arrived at the same destination a few days later. To make it look as if this was all that they had been waiting for, the Romans immediately set sail for Ephesus, intending either to decide the contest with a battle at sea or else to wring an admission of fear from the enemy if he refused engagement—something of great importance vis-à-vis the inclinations of the city-states. They positioned themselves opposite the harbor mouth with their vessels facing it in a line. When no one confronted them, they divided the fleet and while one part rode at anchor on the open sea off the harbor entrance the other put ashore its fighting men. After raiding the countryside far and wide, these were bringing back an enormous quantity of booty when Andronicus the Macedonian, a member of the garrison at Ephesus, made a sortie against them as they approached the walls, stripped them of most of their plunder, and drove them back to their vessels on the shore. The next day the Romans set an ambush about half way between the two sides and then marched in a column toward the city in order to lure the Macedonian outside the walls. Then, when suspicion that this very scheme was afoot deterred anyone from coming out, they returned to their ships; and since the enemy was avoiding engagement on both land and sea, the Roman fleet returned to Samos, its point of departure.</p>
