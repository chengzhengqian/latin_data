sortition for Aetolia and Asia. The man drawing Asia was to be allocated the army that Lucius Scipio then commanded and as supplementary forces he was to have 4,000 Roman infantry and 200 cavalry, plus 8,000 infantry and 400 cavalry from the allies and those with Latin rights.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL301_435_180" id="target_note_LCL301_435_180"><sup>180</sup></a> With these troops he was to prosecute the war against Antiochus.
