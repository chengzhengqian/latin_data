Aemilius was galled by the long period of delay and inactivity at Samos, for the last thing he expected was that Polyxenidas, whom he had twice challenged in vain, would give him an opportunity to engage. He also thought it a disgrace that the fleet of Eumenes should be helping the consul transport the legions to Asia while he himself was tied up bringing relief to the beleaguered city of Colophon, an operation with no end in sight. The Rhodian Eudamus, who had also kept him at Samos earlier when he wanted to leave for the Hellespont, was now, along with everybody else, pressing him to stay—much better to raise the blockade of his allies, they said,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL301_367_98" id="target_note_LCL301_367_98"><sup>98</sup></a> or inflict another defeat on a navy they had already beaten once and thereby seize total control of the sea.
