When all was ready for carrying through his plans, the consul moved from his base camp and came first to Dardanus, then to Rhoeteum;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL301_395_124" id="target_note_LCL301_395_124"><sup>124</sup></a> and the people of both communities poured out to meet him. From there he advanced to Ilium, and encamped in the plain beneath its walls. He went up to the city and its citadel, and sacrificed to Minerva,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL301_395_125" id="target_note_LCL301_395_125"><sup>125</sup></a> protectress of the citadel, while the people of Ilium acknowledged the Romans as their descendants by showing them every mark of respect in their words and actions, and the Romans expressed their happiness with their ancestry.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL301_395_126" id="target_note_LCL301_395_126"><sup>126</sup></a></p>

He was sent back to Pergamum from the camp to organize provisions and, after delivering grain to the people specified by the consul, he returned to the same base camp. The plan was to prepare several days’ worth of rations and head out against the enemy from there before winter overtook them.</p>
