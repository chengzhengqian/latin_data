These were mostly Syrian, with an admixture of Phrygians and Lydians. Before this cavalry force there were scythed chariots<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL301_407_143" id="target_note_LCL301_407_143"><sup>143</sup></a> and the camels they call dromedaries. Riding these were Arab archers holding narrow-bladed swords that were four cubits in length so they could reach the enemy from their elevated position.

Then there were Cyrtian and Elymaean auxiliary forces in numbers equal to those stationed on the right wing, and 16 elephants a short distance from them.</p>
