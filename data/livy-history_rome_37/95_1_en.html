<p class="noindent">The consul Lucius Cornelius Scipio set off to conduct the war against King Antiochus with his brother Scipio Africanus as his legate, and he was the first of all Roman commanders to cross to Asia (Africanus had declared that he would be his brotherâ€™s legate if the province was allocated to him, because it looked as if it would be given to Gaius Laelius, who had great influence in the senate). Regillus, with the help of the Rhodians, fought successfully against the royal fleet of Antiochus at Myonnesus. The son of Africanus, who had been captured by Antiochus, was returned to his father. Then Antiochus was defeated by Lucius Cornelius Scipio, assisted by King Eumenes of Pergamum, son of Attalus, and was granted peace on the condition that he withdraw from all the territories this side of the Taurus Mountains. Lucius Cornelius Scipio, who had brought to an end the war with Antiochus, was put on a level with his brother when he was given the cognomen Asiaticus.</p>
<p>A colony was established Bononia. The kingdom of Eumenes, with whose help Antiochus had been defeated, was extended. The Rhodians, who had themselves also given help, were granted a number of cities. Aemilius Regulus, who had crushed the officers of Antiochus in a naval battle, celebrated a naval triumph. Manius Acilius Glabrio triumphed over Antiochus, whom he had expelled from Greece, and over the Aetolians.</p>
