Phaselis lies on the border of Lycia and Pamphylia.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL301_355_85" id="target_note_LCL301_355_85"><sup>85</sup></a> It juts far out into the sea and is the first land sighted by voyagers heading toward Rhodes from Cilicia; and it also affords a view of ships far away. It was chiefly for that reason that it was chosen as the place to encounter the enemy fleet. There was, however, something that they did not anticipate: because of the insalubrious locality and the time of year (it was midsummer), and also because of an unusual stench, diseases began to spread widely among them, affecting oarsmen in particular. They left the place from fear of the epidemic; but when they were sailing along the Gulf of Pamphylia they put in at the River Eurymedon, and were there told by the people of Aspendus that the enemy was now at Side.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL301_355_86" id="target_note_LCL301_355_86"><sup>86</sup></a> The king’s navy had made quite a slow voyage because it was the unfavorable season of the Etesians,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL301_355_87" id="target_note_LCL301_355_87"><sup>87</sup></a> one almost exclusively given over to northwesterly winds.
