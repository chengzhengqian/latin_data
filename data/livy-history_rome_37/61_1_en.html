<p>There was a morning mist that rose to form clouds as the day advanced and produced overcast conditions. Then a drizzle, like that brought by the south wind, dampened everything. While these factors had no adverse affects on the Romans, they were particularly disadvantageous for the king’s troops. Their line being relatively short, the faintness of the light did not hamper the Romans’ view in any direction and, their troops being almost all heavy-armed, the drizzle did not take the edge off swords or spears. With such a wide line of battle, the king’s men were unable to see from the center to their wings, and much less could the flanks keep each other in sight, while the drizzle had taken the tautness out of bows, slings and spear thongs. Furthermore, the four-horse scythed chariots, with which Antiochus had believed he would throw the enemy line into disarray, instead brought terror to the Syrians themselves.</p>
<p>The chariots were fitted out much as follows. They had spikes ten cubits long projecting like horns from the yoke, on both sides of the pole,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL301_409_148" id="target_note_LCL301_409_148"><sup>148</sup></a> designed to transfix anything that came in their way; and at either end of the yoke two blades protruded, one on a level with the yoke, the other below it and pointing toward the ground—the former intended slash through whatever met it on the sides, the latter to catch any who fell or got beneath the chariot. There were also two blades attached in similar fashion to the wheel hubs on both sides and likewise pointing in the different directions. As was observed above, the king had positioned the chariots, armed in this manner, in the front line because it would have been necessary to drive them through his own men had they been placed at the extremities of the line or in the center.</p>

It is possible that Livy, having never seen such chariots, again misunderstood Polybius (so Briscoe ad loc.).</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL301_409_148').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
