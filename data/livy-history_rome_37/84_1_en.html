of the coast. You, however, have not harbored ambitions for these things before having them in your control, and now that the world is in your power you <span class="italic">cannot </span>harbor them.

You have undertaken to protect from enslavement to a king the independence of an ancient people well-known through the fame of its achievements and through the universal esteem it enjoys for culture and the arts. This defense of an entire race that you have taken under your protection and guardianship you should maintain in perpetuity. The cities on the ancient soil are no more Greek than their colonies that left it for Asia in the past—the change of land did not change their lineage or culture. All our communities have ventured to compete respectfully with their parents and founders in every noble art and sphere of excellence. Most of you have been to the cities of Greece and those of Asia; apart from our greater distance from you, we are in no way inferior to them. If one’s innate character could be overcome by what one may term the character of the land, the people of Massilia would long ago have been brutalized by so many uncivilized tribes living around them; but we are told that they are held in as much honor and are deservedly shown as much respect by you as if they were living in the very heart of Greece. They have preserved, pure and untouched by contact with their neighbors, not only the pronunciation of their language, their mode of dress and overall appearance, but above all their culture, laws and character.</p>
