Antiochus, king of Asia and part of Europe, offered me his daughter in marriage and was ready to restore immediately the city-states that had defected from us. He offered me strong assurances of later increasing my kingdom if I joined him in making war on you.</p>
<p>“I shall not boast that I have in no way been derelict in my duty to you; rather I shall point to the things that are worthy of my house’s long-standing friendship with you. I have aided your commanders with land and naval troops on such a scale that none of your allies could equal me; I have supplied you with provisions by land and sea; I have taken part in all your naval battles, fought in many locations; nowhere did I shrink from hardship or danger. I have suffered the worst fate in warfare, a siege—I was blockaded at Pergamum, my life and kingdom both in critical danger.

I never left the consul’s side after your army had crossed to Asia and there was not a Roman soldier in your camp more devoted than my brothers and I. There was no military enterprise, no cavalry engagement undertaken without me. In battle I took my place and defended my position where the consul wanted me to be.</p>
