Accordingly I am in a position to assert that no one was ever put upon his trial on the question “what had become of the money?” unless he had been summoned in the assessment of damages; and in such assessments<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL252_377_a" id="target_note_LCL252_377_a"><sup>a</sup></a> no one was summoned save upon the depositions of witnesses or accounts of private persons or entries in municipal ledgers. Consequently,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">10</span><span class="br"></span>
when such cases were brought on, it was common for those to attend who were in some apprehension concerning themselves, and, when summoned, to contradict what had been said, if they thought fit; if however they feared to bring themselves into bad odour because the facts were fresh in mind, they chose to answer later; and by acting in this way, they very frequently gained their ends.</p>

<p>V. But the present procedure is entirely new and unprecedented. In the assessment the name of Postumus nowhere occurs. In the assessment, do I say? You yourselves were lately empanelled in the case of Aulus Gabinius. Did any witness then mention Postumus? Witness, do I say? Did the prosecutor himself? Did you, in short, in the whole course of that trial once hear the name of Postumus? Postumus is then not a residuary defendant from a<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">11</span><span class="br"></span>
trial which has already been decided; no, he is a single Roman knight dragged before a court upon a charge of extortion. And on what account-books is the charge founded? On some which were not read at the trial of Gabinius. What witness supports it? One who never once summoned Postumus on that occasion. As a result of what assessment of damages? Of one in which Postumus’s name was never mentioned. Under what law? Under one to which he is not amenable.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL252_377_b" id="target_note_LCL252_377_b"><sup>b</sup></a></p>
