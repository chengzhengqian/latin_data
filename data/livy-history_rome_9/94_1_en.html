nobody, advanced at a quick pace towards the Aequian camp. But not perceiving any outposts before the gates or anybody on the rampart, and missing the usual noises of a camp, they were troubled by the unaccustomed silence, and apprehending an ambush, halted. Later, when they had scaled the rampart and found everything deserted, they attempted to follow the enemy by his tracks; but the tracks, which led in all directions—as they would when an army had dispersed—at first bewildered them. Afterwards they found out through their scouts what the enemy designed to do; and attacking his cities in succession, one after another, they captured thirty-one of them within fifty days, in every instance by assault. Of these the greater number were dismantled and burnt, and the Aequian name was almost blotted out. A triumph was celebrated over the Aequi; and warned by the example of their downfall, the Marrucini, Marsi, Paeligni, and Frentani sent ambassadors to Rome to sue for peace and friendship. These nations, at their request, were granted a treaty of alliance.</p>
<p>XLVI. In the same year a government clerk, Gnaeus Flavius, the son of Gnaeus, was curule aedile. Born in humble circumstances—his father being a freedman—he was, for the rest, a man of shrewdness and eloquence.
