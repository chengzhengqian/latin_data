dost benefit. Suffer him to heal the human race, that has long been sick and in evil case, suffer him to restore and return all things to their place out of the havoc the madness of the preceding prince<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL254_395_a" id="target_note_LCL254_395_a"><sup>a</sup></a> has wrought! May this sun, which has shed its light upon a world that had plunged into the abyss and was sunk in darkness, ever shine!

Meanwhile, the great consolation of my own wretchedness is to see his compassion spreading over the whole world; and since even in this remote corner, in which I am planted, his mercy has unearthed many who were buried under a downfall that came long years ago, and has restored them to light, I do not fear that I shall be the only one it will pass by. But he himself knows best the time at which he ought to come to each man’s rescue; I, for my part, shall strive that he should not blush to come to mine. O how blessed is your mercy,
