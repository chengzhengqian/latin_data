won approbation in warfare and had long been suspected by Gallienus because he seemed worthy to rule; he was, moreover, a Dacian by birth and. a kinsman, so it was said, of Decebalus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_89_1" id="target_note_LCL263_89_1"><sup>1</sup></a> himself. There is still in existence a letter written by the Deified Claudius, then still a commoner, in which he expresses his thanks to Regalianus, as general in command of Illyricum, for recovering this district, at a time when Gallienus’ slothfulness was bringing all things to ruin. This letter, which I have found in the original form, I think should be inserted here, for it was written officially:</p>
<p>“From Claudius to Regalianus many greetings. Fortunate is the commonwealth, which has deserved to have such a man as yourself in its military camps, and fortunate is Gallienus, though no one tells him the truth about either good men or bad. Word has been brought to me by Bonitus and Celsus, the attendants of our emperor, how you conducted yourself in fighting at Scupi<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_89_2" id="target_note_LCL263_89_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and how many battles you fought in a single day and with what great speed. You were worthy of a triumph, did but the olden times still remain. But why say more? I could wish that you might be mindful of a certain person and therefore be more cautious in gaining victories. I should like you to send me some Sarmatian bows and two military cloaks, but provided with clasps, for I am sending you some of my own.”</p>
<p>This letter shows what opinion of Regalianus was held by Claudius, whose judgement was without doubt most weighty in his own time.</p>
<p>It was not, indeed, from Gallienus that Regalianus received his promotion, but from his father, Valerian, as did also Claudius, Macrianus, Ingenuus, Postumus
