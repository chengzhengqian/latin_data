As others, however, have related with greater truth, the Gauls themselves, hating Gallienus most bitterly and being unwilling to endure a boy as their emperor, hailed as their ruler the man who was holding the rule in trust for another, and despatching soldiers they slew the boy.

In consequence of this rivalry Postumus seized Cologne and caused Silvanus and the prince to be put to death; see Zosimus, i. 38, 2 and Zonaras, xii. 24.

Saloninus, however, Gallienus’ younger son (cf. <span class="italic">Gall.</span>, xix. 1 and note) seems to have been alive as late as 260–261. Moreover, according to <span class="italic">Epit.</span>, 32, 3; 33, 1, it was the elder son (Valerian) who was put to death at Cologne; he is shown by the evidence of papyri to have died in 258.
