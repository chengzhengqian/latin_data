<p>XXII. It is the wont of the people of Egypt that like madmen and fools they are led by the most trivial matters to become highly dangerous to the commonwealth;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_119_2" id="target_note_LCL263_119_2"><sup>2</sup></a> for merely because a greeting was omitted, or a place in the baths refused, or meat and vegetables withheld, or on account of the boots of slaves or some other such things, they have broken out into riots, even to the point of becoming highly dangerous to the state, so that troops have been armed to quell them. With their wonted madness, accordingly, on a certain occasion, when the slave of the chief magistrate<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_119_3" id="target_note_LCL263_119_3"><sup>3</sup></a> then governing Alexandria had been killed by a soldier for asserting that his sandals were better than the soldier’s, a mob gathered together, and, coming to the house of the general Aemilianus, it assailed him with all the implements and the frenzy usual in riots; he was pelted with stones and attacked with swords, and no kind of weapon used in a riot was lacking.

It is known from papyri that L. Mussius Aemilianus and Aurelius Theodotos (§ 8) were prefects of Egypt, the former as late as Oct. 259, the latter in August 262. Aemilianus would seem to have held central Egypt (the Thebais) for Gallienus against Macrianus and Quietus, who were acknowledged as emperors in lower Egypt in 260. However, no genuine coins of his are known, and it is unlikely that he ever assumed the imperial power; therefore it is hard to understand why he should have been arrested by order of Gallienus; see Milne in <span class="italic">Journ.
