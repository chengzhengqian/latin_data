<p>XII. After the capture of Valerian, long a most noble prince in the state, then a most valiant emperor, but at the last the most unfortunate of all men (either because in his old age he pined away among the Persians or because he left behind him unworthy descendants), Ballista,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_95_2" id="target_note_LCL263_95_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Valerian’s prefect, and Macrianus,
the foremost of his generals, since they knew that Gallienus was worthy only of contempt and since the soldiers, too, were seeking an emperor, withdrew together to a certain place, to consider what should be done. They then agreed that, since Gallienus was far away and Aureolus was usurping the imperial power, some emperor ought to be chosen, and, indeed, the best man, lest there should arise some pretender. Therefore Ballista (or so Maeonius Astyanax,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_95_3" id="target_note_LCL263_95_3"><sup>3</sup></a> who took part in their council, relates) spoke as follows: “As for myself, my age and my calling and my desires are all far removed from the imperial office, and so, as I cannot deny, I am searching for a worthy prince. But who, pray, is there who can fill the place of Valerian except such a man as yourself, brave, steadfast, honourable, well proved in public affairs, and—what is of the highest importance for holding the imperial office—possessed of great wealth?

Fulvius Macrianus Augustus. As Valerian’s κόμης τῶν θησαυρῶν καὶ ἐφεστὼς τῇ ἀγορᾷ τοῦ σίτου he was not present when the Emperor was captured; later he succeeded in rallying the soldiers at Samosata; see Continuator of Cassius Dio, frg. 159 (ed.

Papyri dated in the first year of Macrianus and Quietus (c. xiv.) show that they were accepted in Egypt as emperors in 260.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL263_95_1a').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL263_95_2"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL263_95_2" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">2</sup>See c. xviii.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL263_95_2').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL263_95_3"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL263_95_3" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">3</sup>Otherwise unknown.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL263_95_3').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
