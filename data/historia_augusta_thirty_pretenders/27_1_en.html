was given the name Frugi, and he was said to derive his descent from that family of Pisos with which Cicero had formed an alliance for the purpose of entering the nobility.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_117_1" id="target_note_LCL263_117_1"><sup>1</sup></a> He was highly esteemed by all the emperors; in fact, Valens himself, who is said to have sent the assassins against him, declared, it is told, that never could he render account to the gods of the lower world for having given an order to put Piso to death, albeit his enemy, for his like the Roman commonwealth did not contain.</p>
<p>I have gladly inserted the senate’s decree<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_117_2" id="target_note_LCL263_117_2"><sup>2</sup></a> which was passed concerning Piso, in order that his honours may be made known: On the seventh day before the Kalends of July, when word had been brought that Piso was slain by Valens and Valens himself by his own soldiers, Arellius Fuscus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_117_3a" id="target_note_LCL263_117_3a"><sup>3</sup></a> the consular whose right it was to give his opinion first, having succeeded to the place of Valerian, said: “Consul, consult us.” And on being asked his opinion, he said, “I propose divine honours for Piso, Conscript Fathers, and I firmly believe that this will be approved by our emperors, Gallienus, Valerian, and Saloninus; for never was there a better man or a braver.” After him the others also on being consulted voted Piso a statue among the triumphant generals and also a four-horse chariot. His statue is still to be seen, but the chariot which they decreed was erected only to be moved elsewhere, and it has not yet been brought back. For it was set up in the place where the Bath of Diocletian<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_117_4" id="target_note_LCL263_117_4"><sup>4</sup></a> was afterwards built, destined to have a name as undying as it is revered.</p>
