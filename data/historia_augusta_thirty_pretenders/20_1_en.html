defeated by Aureolus, and that their soldiers had yielded to his power in the belief that he was upholding the cause of Gallienus, he put the young man to death and with him Ballista, for a long time prefect. This young man, too, was worthy to hold the power at Rome, so that he seemed to be truly the son of Macrianus and also the brother of Macrianus, who together were well able to govern the commonwealth in its stricken state.</p>
<p>It does not seem to me, in telling of the family of the Macriani (which is still flourishing to-day),<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_103_1" id="target_note_LCL263_103_1"><sup>1</sup></a> that I should fail to speak of a peculiar custom which they have always observed. For an embossed head of Alexander the Great of Macedonia was always used by the men on their rings and their silver plate, and by the women on their head-dresses, their bracelets, their rings and ornaments of every kind, so that even to-day there are still in that family tunics and fillets and womenâ€™s cloaks which show the likeness of Alexander in threads of divers colours. We, ourselves, recently saw Cornelius Macer, a man of that same family, while giving a dinner in the Temple of Hercules,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_103_2" id="target_note_LCL263_103_2"><sup>2</sup></a> drink the health of a pontiff from a bowl made of electrum,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_103_3" id="target_note_LCL263_103_3"><sup>3</sup></a> which had in the centre the face of Alexander and contained on the circumference his whole history in small and minute figures, and this he caused to be passed around to all the most ardent admirers of that great hero. All this I have included because it is said that those who wear the likeness of Alexander carved in either gold or silver are aided in all that they do.</p>
