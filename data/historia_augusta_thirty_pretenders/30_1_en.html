<p>XXIII. The best of the generals of the time of Gallienus, though, in fact, he was chosen by Valerian, was Saturninus.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_123_1" id="target_note_LCL263_123_1"><sup>1</sup></a> He also, being unable to endure the loose ways of Gallienus, who revelled all night in public places, and preferring to command the soldiers in his own way rather than in that of his emperor, accepted the imperial power from the army. He was a man unequalled in wisdom, outstanding in dignity, lovable in his ways, and because of his victories well known everywhere, even among the barbarians. On the day on which the soldiers clothed him with the imperial robe he called together an assembly, it is related, and said: “Fellow-soldiers, you have lost a good general and made a bad emperor.” Finally, after doing many vigorous deeds during his rule, merely because he was too severe and too harsh to the soldiers he was killed by those very men who had made him emperor. He is famous for having commanded the soldiers, when reclining at table, to wear military cloaks in order that their lower limbs might not be bared, heavy ones in winter and very light ones in summer.</p>
