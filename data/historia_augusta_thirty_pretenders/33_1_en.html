<h2><span class="ac">Trebellianus</span></h2>
<p>XXVI. I am by this time ashamed to tell how many tyrants there were in the reign of Gallienus, all on account of the vices of that pestiferous man, for such, indeed, were his excesses that he deserved to have many rebels rise up against him, and such his cruelty that he was rightly regarded with fear. This cruelty he showed also toward Trebellianus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_129_1" id="target_note_LCL263_129_1"><sup>1</sup></a> who was made ruler in Isauria<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_129_2" id="target_note_LCL263_129_2"><sup>2</sup></a>—for the Isaurians desired a leader for themselves. He, though others dubbed him arch-pirate, gave himself the title of emperor. He even gave orders to strike coins<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_129_3" id="target_note_LCL263_129_3"><sup>3</sup></a> and he set up an imperial palace in a certain Isaurian stronghold. Then, when he had betaken himself into the inmost and safest parts of Isauria, where he was protected by the natural difficulty of the ground and by the mountains, he ruled for some time among the Cilicians. Camsisoleus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_129_4" id="target_note_LCL263_129_4"><sup>4</sup></a> however, Gallienus’ general and an Egyptian by race, the brother of that Theodotus who had captured Aemilianus, brought him down to the plains and then defeated and slew him. Never afterwards, however, was it possible to persuade the Isaurians, fearing that Gallienus might vent his anger upon them, to come down to the level ground, not even by any offer of kindness on the part of the emperors. In fact, since the time of Trebellianus they have been considered barbarians; for indeed their district, though in the midst of lands belonging to the Romans, is guarded by a novel kind of defence, comparable to a frontier-wall, for it is protected not by men but by the nature of the country. For the Isaurians are not of noble stature or distinguished courage, not well provided with arms or wise in counsel, but they are kept
