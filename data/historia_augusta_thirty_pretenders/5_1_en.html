<p>IV. Concerning this man<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_73_1" id="target_note_LCL263_73_1"><sup>1</sup></a> there is naught to relate save that after receiving the name of Caesar from his father and later, as a mark of honour to him, that of Augustus, he was killed, it is said, together with his father at the time when Lollianus, who was put in Postumus’ place, took the imperial power offered to him by the Gauls. He was, moreover—and only this is worthy of mention—so skilled in rhetorical exercises that his <span class="italic">Controversies</span> are said to have been inserted among those of Quintilian,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_73_2" id="target_note_LCL263_73_2"><sup>2</sup></a> who, as the reading of even a single chapter will show at the first glance,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_73_3" id="target_note_LCL263_73_3"><sup>3</sup></a> was the sharpest rhetorician of the Roman race.</p>

Lollianus was, indeed, a very brave man, but in the face of rebellion his strength was insufficient to give him authority over the Gauls. He was killed, moreover, by Victorinus, son of Vitruvia, or rather Victoria,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_73_5" id="target_note_LCL263_73_5"><sup>5</sup></a> who was later entitled Mother of the Camp and honoured by the name of Augusta, though she herself, doing her utmost to escape the weight of so great a burden,
