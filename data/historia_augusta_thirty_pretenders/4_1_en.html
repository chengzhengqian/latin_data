<p>If anyone, indeed, desires to know the merits of Postumus, he may learn Valerian’s opinion concerning him from the following letter which he wrote to the Gauls: “As general in charge of the Rhine frontier and governor of Gaul we have named Postumus, a man most worthy of the stern discipline of the Gauls. He by his presence will safeguard the soldiers in the camp, civil rights in the forum, law-suits at the bar of judgement, and the dignity of the council-chamber, and he will preserve for each one his own personal possessions; he is a man at whom I marvel above all others and well deserving of the office of prince, and for him, I hope, you will render me thanks. If, however, I have erred in my judgement concerning him, you may rest assured that nowhere in the world will a man be found who can win complete approval. Upon his son, Postumus by name, a young man who will show himself worthy of his father’s character, I have bestowed the tribuneship of the Vocontii.”</p>
