energy, to a share in the imperial power, and in company with him he fought against Gallienus. Having summoned to their aid huge forces of Germans, they protracted the war for a long time, but at last they were conquered. Then, when Lollianus, too, had been slain, Victorinus alone remained in command. He also, because he devoted his time to seducing the wives of his soldiers and officers, was slain at Agrippina<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_77_1" id="target_note_LCL263_77_1"><sup>1</sup></a>
through a conspiracy formed by a certain clerk, whose wife he had debauched; his mother Vitruvia, or rather Victoria,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_77_2" id="target_note_LCL263_77_2"><sup>2</sup></a> who was later called Mother of the Camp, had given his son Victorinus the title of Caesar, but the boy, too, was immediately killed after his father was slain at Agrippina.</p>
<p>Concerning Victorinus, because he was most valiant and, save for his lustfulness, an excellent emperor, many details have been related by many writers. We, however, deem it sufficient to insert a portion of the book of a certain Julius Atherianus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_77_3" id="target_note_LCL263_77_3"><sup>3</sup></a> in which he writes of Victorinus as follows: “With regard to Victorinus, who ruled the provinces of Gaul after Julius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_77_4" id="target_note_LCL263_77_4"><sup>4</sup></a> Postumus, I consider that no one should be given a higher place, not Trajan for his courage, or Antoninus for his kindness, or Nerva for his noble dignity, or Vespasian for his care of the treasury, or yet Pertinax or Severus for the strictness of their whole lives or the severity of their military discipline. All these qualities, however, were offset to such an extent by his lustfulness and his desire for the pleasures gotten from women that no one would dare to set forth in writing the virtues of one who, all are agreed, deserved to be punished.” And so, since this is the judgement that writers have given concerning Victorinus, I consider that I have said enough regarding his character.</p>
