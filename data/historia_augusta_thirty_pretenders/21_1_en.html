<p>XV. Had not Odaenathus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_105_1a" id="target_note_LCL263_105_1a"><sup>1</sup></a> prince of the Palmyrenes,
seized the imperial power after the capture of Valerian, when the strength of the Roman state was exhausted, all would have been lost in the East. He assumed, therefore, as the first of his line, the title of King, and after gathering together an army he set out against the Persians, having with him his wife Zenobia,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_105_2" id="target_note_LCL263_105_2"><sup>2</sup></a> his elder son, whose name was Herodes, and his younger sons, Herennianus and Timolaus.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_105_3" id="target_note_LCL263_105_3"><sup>3</sup></a> First of all, he brought under his power Nisibis and most of the East together with the whole of Mesopotamia, next, he defeated the king himself and compelled him to flee. Finally, he pursued Sapor and his children even as far as Ctesiphon, and captured his concubines and also a great amount of booty; then he turned to the oriental provinces, hoping to be able to crush Macrianus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_105_4" id="target_note_LCL263_105_4"><sup>4</sup></a> who had begun to rule in opposition to Gallienus, but he had already set out against Aureolus and Gallienus. After Macrianus was slain, Odaenathus killed his son Quietus also, while Ballista, many assert, usurped the imperial power<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_105_5" id="target_note_LCL263_105_5"><sup>5</sup></a> in order that he, too, might not be slain. Then, after he had for the most part put in order the affairs of the East, he was killed by his cousin

A member of the most important family of Palmyra, he received from the Roman government the title of consularis, which he bears in an inscription of 258 (Lebas-Wad. 2602) and on his coins. Later he received from Gallienus the office of στρατηγὸς τῆς Ἐῴας or πάσης Ἀνατολῆς; see Zonaras, xii. 23–24 and Syncellus, L, p. 716 (cf. <span class="italic">Gall.</span>, iii. 3; x. 1). This indicates a general imperium over all the Asiatic provinces and Egypt, but subject to that of the Roman Emperor. He afterwards took the title of King of Palmyra (§ 2), and on a Palmyrene inscription set up in 271 after his death he is called “King of Kings.” There is no evidence that he ever received the title of Augustus from Gallienus (<span class="italic">Gall.</span>, xii. 1), or assumed it himself, or in any way formally rebelled against the power of Rome, although in fact his position was almost that of an independent prince. On his suppression of the revolt of Quietus see also c. xiv. 1 and <span class="italic">Gall.</span>, iii. 1–5, and on his invasion of Mesopotamia after the capture of Valerian see <span class="italic">Val.</span>, iv. 2–4; <span class="italic">Gall.</span>, x. 3–8; xii. 1.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL263_105_1a').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL263_105_2"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL263_105_2" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">2</sup>See c. xxx.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL263_105_2').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL263_105_3"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL263_105_3" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">3</sup>See c. xxvii-xxviii.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL263_105_3').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL263_105_4"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL263_105_4" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">4</sup>See c. xii.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL263_105_4').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL263_105_5"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL263_105_5" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">5</sup>See note to c. xviii. 1.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL263_105_5').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
