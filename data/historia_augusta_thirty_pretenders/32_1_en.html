<p>XXV. He,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_127_1" id="target_note_LCL263_127_1"><sup>1</sup></a> when a little lad, received the name of Caesar from Victoria when she herself had been entitled by the army Mother of the Camp.

The house of the Tetrici is still standing to-day, situated on the Caelian Hill between the two groves and facing the Temple of Isis built by Metellus;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_127_4" id="target_note_LCL263_127_4"><sup>4</sup></a> and a most beautiful one it is, and in it Aurelian is depicted bestowing on both the Tetrici the bordered toga and the rank of senator and receiving from them a sceptre, a chaplet, and an embroidered robe. This picture is in mosaic, and it is said that the two Tetrici, when they dedicated it, invited Aurelian himself to a banquet.</p>
