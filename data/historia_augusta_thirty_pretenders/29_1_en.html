Egypt, and to the best of his powers drove back the barbarians with courage and firmness. Finally, he won by his merits the name of Alexander, or else Alexandrinus—for this is considered uncertain. But when he was making ready for a campaign against the people of India, the general Theodotus was sent against him by order of Gallienus, and so he suffered punishment, for it is related that, like the captives of old,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_121_1" id="target_note_LCL263_121_1"><sup>1</sup></a> he was strangled in prison.</p>
<p>Now, since I am speaking of Egypt, I think I must not fail to relate what the history of former times has suggested and, in connection therewith, a deed of Gallienus. For when he wished to confer proconsular power on Theodotus, the priests forbade it, saying that it was not lawful for the consular fasces to be brought into Alexandria. This, we know well enough, was mentioned by Cicero in his speech against Gabinius,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_121_2" id="target_note_LCL263_121_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and, in fact, it is still remembered that this practice was maintained. Therefore, your<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_121_3" id="target_note_LCL263_121_3"><sup>3</sup></a> kinsman Herennius Celsus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_121_4" id="target_note_LCL263_121_4"><sup>4</sup></a> in seeking the consulship, ought to know that what he desires is not lawful. For at Memphis, they say, it was written on a golden column in Egyptian letters that Egypt would at last regain its freedom when the Roman fasces and the Roman bordered toga had been brought into the land. This may be found in Proculus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_121_5" id="target_note_LCL263_121_5"><sup>5</sup></a> the grammarian, the most learned man of his time, in the place where he tells of foreign countries.</p>
