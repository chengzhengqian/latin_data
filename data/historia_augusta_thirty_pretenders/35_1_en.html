<p>XXIX. When the various parts of the empire were seized, namely Gaul, the Orient, and even Pontus, Thrace and Illyricum, and while Gallienus was spending his time in public-houses and giving up his life to bathing and pimps, the Africans also, at the instance of Vibius Passienus, the proconsul of Africa, and Fabius Pomponianus, the general in command of the Libyan frontier, created an emperor, namely Celsus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_133_1" id="target_note_LCL263_133_1"><sup>1</sup></a> decking him with the robe of the goddess Caelestis.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_133_2" id="target_note_LCL263_133_2"><sup>2</sup></a> This man, a commoner and formerly a tribune stationed in Africa, was then living on his own estates, but such was his reputation for justice and such the size of his body that he seemed worthy of the imperial power.

His body was devoured by dogs, for such was the command of the people of Sicca,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_133_3" id="target_note_LCL263_133_3"><sup>3</sup></a> who had remained faithful to Gallienus, and then with a new kind of insult his image was set up on a cross, while the mob pranced about, as though they were looking at Celsus himself affixed to a gibbet.</p>
