why should I say pardon? They have done nothing. Let them live, therefore, free from all anxiety, knowing that they live under Marcus. Let them live in possession of their parents’ property, granted to each in due proportion; let them enjoy gold, silver, and raiment; let them be rich; let them be free from anxiety; let them, unrestricted and free to travel wheresoever they wish, carry in themselves before the eyes of all nations everywhere an example of my forbearance, an example of yours. Nor is it any great act of mercy, Conscript Fathers, to grant pardon to the wives and children of outlawed men. I do beseech you to save these conspirators, men of the senatorial and equestrian orders, from death, from proscription, from terror, from disgrace, from hatred, and, in short, from every harm, and to grant this to my reign, that whoever, in the cause of the pretender, has fallen in the strife may, though slain, still be esteemed.”</p>

<p>XIII. The senate honoured this act of mercy with these acclamations:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_259_1" id="target_note_LCL139_259_1"><sup>1</sup></a> “God save you, righteous Antoninus. God save you, merciful Antoninus. God save you, merciful Antoninus. You have desired what was lawful, we have done what was fitting. We ask lawful power for Commodus. Strengthen your offspring. Make our children free from care. No violence troubles righteous rule. We ask the tribunician power<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_259_2" id="target_note_LCL139_259_2"><sup>2</sup></a> for Commodus Antoninus. We beseech your presence. All praise to your philosophy, your patience, your principles, your magnanimity, your innocence! You conquer your foes within, you prevail over those without, the gods are watching over you,” and so forth.</p>
<p>And so the descendants of Avidius Cassius lived unmolested and were admitted to offices of honour.
