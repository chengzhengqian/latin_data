In his youth, they say, he tried to wrest the empire from Pius too, but through his father, a righteous and worthy man, he escaped detection in this attempt to seize the throne, though he continued to be suspected by Pius’ generals. Against Verus he organized a genuine conspiracy, as a letter of Verus’ own, which I append, makes clear.
