had been insulting to them. He even put them under the protection of his uncle by marriage.</p>
<p>If any one wishes, moreover, to know the whole of this story, let him read the second book of Marius Maximus on the life of Marcus, in which he relates everything that Marcus did as sole emperor after the death of Verus. For it was during this time that Cassius rebelled, as a letter written to Faustina shows, from which the following is an extract:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_253_1" id="target_note_LCL139_253_1"><sup>1</sup></a> “Verus told me the truth about Avidius, that he desired to rule. For I presume you heard what Verus’ messengers reported about him. Come, then, to our Alban villa, so that with the help of the gods we may prepare for everything, and do not be afraid.” It would appear from this that Faustina knew nothing of the affair, though Marius Maximus, wishing to defame her, says that it was with her connivance that Cassius attempted to seize the throne.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_253_2" id="target_note_LCL139_253_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Indeed, we have also a letter of hers to her husband in which she urges Marcus to punish Cassius severely. A copy of Faustina’s letter to Marcus reads: “I shall come to our Alban villa to-morrow, as you command. Yet I urge you now, if you love your children, to punish those rebels with all severity. For soldiers and generals have an evil habit of crushing others if they are not crushed themselves.”</p>

<p>X. Another letter of this same Faustina to Marcus reads similarly: “When Celsus revolted,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_253_3" id="target_note_LCL139_253_3"><sup>3</sup></a> my mother, Faustina, urged your father, Pius, to deal righteously first with his own kin, and then with strangers. For no emperor is righteous who does not take thought for his wife and children. You can see how young our son Commodus is; our son-in-law Pompeianus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_253_4" id="target_note_LCL139_253_4"><sup>4</sup></a> is an elderly man and a foreigner besides.
