in the midst of the camp, he beheaded those who deserved it with the axe, and in numerous instances cut off’ his soldiers’ hands. He forbade the soldiers, moreover, to carry anything when on the march save lard and biscuit and vinegar, and if he discovered anything else he punished the breach of discipline with no light hand. There is a letter concerning Cassius that the Deified Marcus wrote to his prefect, running somewhat as follows: “I have put Avidius Cassius in command of the Syrian legions, which are running riot in luxury and conducting themselves with the morals of Daphne; concerning these legions Caesonius Vectilianus has written that he found them all accustomed to bathe in hot water.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_243_1" id="target_note_LCL139_243_1"><sup>1</sup></a> And I think I have made no mistake, for you too know Cassius, a man of true Cassian strictness and rigour. Indeed, the soldiers cannot be controlled except by the ancient discipline. You know what the good poet says, a line universally quoted:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">’The state of Rome is rooted in the men and</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent3">manners of the olden time.’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_243_2" id="target_note_LCL139_243_2"><sup>2</sup></a></span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p></blockquote>
<p>Do you take care only that provisions are abundantly provided for the legions, for if I have judged Avidius correctly I know that they will not be wasted.” The prefect’s answer to Marcus runs: “You planned wisely, Sire, when you put Cassius in command of the Syrian legions. Nothing benefits Grecianized soldiers like a man who is somewhat strict. He will certainly do away with all warm baths, and will strike all the flowers from the soldiers’ heads and necks and breasts. Food for the soldiers is all provided; and nothing is lacking under an able general, for but little is either asked or expended.”</p>
