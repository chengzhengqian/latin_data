<p>. . . Well then, if the Roman people were free, ought Aesopus or Accius, rather than the chief men in the state, to have spoken thus on my behalf?</p>
<p>The scholiast of Bobbio: Aesopus, the most noted actor of tragic plays in those times, seems to have acted, in the play of Accius which is entitled <span class="italic">Eurysaces</span>, in such a way that throughout the whole course of the action pointed allusions were made to contemporary politics, and, in particular, the bad fortune which had overtaken Cicero was deplored.</p>

Accordingly all those lines of the tragedy are perverted so as to apply to Cicero himself . . . so that the intention of the work as written by the poet was quite different from the meanings put into it by the actor himself.</p>
