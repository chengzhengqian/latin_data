<blockquote><p>
<span class="line indent1">Who did with steadfast soul the commonwealth</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent1">Aid and set upright, and did stand beside</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent1">The Achivi,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p></blockquote>
<p>stood beside you, and with what powerful effect did he keep pointing to your rows of seats! He was encored by one and all at the words—</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line indent1">In doubtful fortune doubted not his life</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent1">To expose, his person spared not;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p></blockquote>
<p>What shouts accompanied his acting of this scene! . . . <a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL314_447_a" id="target_note_LCL314_447_a">
<sup>a</sup>
</a>And then what groans from the Roman people accompanied the acting of the following by the same man a little later in the same play—</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line indent3">O father<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL314_447_b" id="target_note_LCL314_447_b">
<sup>b</sup>
</a> . . .</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p></blockquote>
<p>He meant <span class="italic">me</span>, yes me, so far away; he had thought me worthy to be mourned like a ‘father’ . . . What sobs there were over that notorious burning and devastation of my possessions, when he mourned a . . . ‘father banished, fatherland laid low, his dwelling burned and overthrown’!<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL314_447_c" id="target_note_LCL314_447_c">
<sup>c</sup>
</a> All this he acted in such a way, that when he had described bygone good fortune, and turned round with the words—</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line indent1">All this I saw with flame devoured,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p></blockquote>
<p>he drew a sob even from my enemies and those who hate me—</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line indent1">Ah! Immortal gods!<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL314_447_d" id="target_note_LCL314_447_d">
<sup>d</sup>
</a>
</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p></blockquote>
<p>And again, how wonderfully he spoke those famous words also!
. . .—</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line indent8">O you unthankful Argives!</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent1">Undutiful Greeks! Unmindful of a kindness!</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p></blockquote>
<p>That indeed was not true of you. . . . But be that as it may, that passage was written for me by a most eloquent poet, acted about me by an actor not only the best but the bravest, since he pointed at all the rows of seats, and accused the senate, the Roman knights, the whole Roman people—</p>
