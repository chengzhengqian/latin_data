<h2>
<span class="italic">Oenomaus</span>
</h2>
<p>but at last Pelops, a son of Tantalus, came and saw over the doors the human heads of all who had tried to win the maid. Angry at Oenomaus’ cruelty, he promised to give half the kingdom to Oenomaus’ charioteer Myrtilus if he would help in a plot. Myrtilus consented and prepared a chariot which had no linchpins in the naves of the wheels. The result was that Oenomaus’ chariot was wrecked. Pelops came home with Hippodamia and Myrtilus, but broke faith with Myrtilus and threw him into the sea. As he sank, Myrtilus cursed Pelops and all his race. Such was the plot of the play Ὀινόμαος of Sophocles followed by Accius. Scene: Pisa. Cf. R., 431 ff.</p>
