<span class="italic">Amphitryon</span>
</h2>
<p>Thebes, where she declared that she would marry the avenger of her brothers and no other. Amphitryon with other leaders laid waste Taphos of the Teleboans. Comaetho, daughter of Pterelaus, loved Amphitryon, and cut off from her father’s head the golden hair which had made him immortal. He now died, and the Taphians were subdued. But Amphitryon killed Comaetho and returned to Thebes (cf. Apollod., II, 4, 4 ff.).</p>
<p>In the most important variant of this theme, Electryon and his sons are killed in war against the Teleboans, and Alcmene will marry the avenger of her father; Amphitryon becomes this avenger and marries her. Accius, however, probably followed the same story as Apollodorus tells. Without any feeling of certainty, I suggest that the play contained three scenes, one at Mycenae (represented perhaps by lines 45–9), another at Thebes (represented perhaps by lines 50–4), and a third at Taphos.</p>
