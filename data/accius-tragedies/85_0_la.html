<span class="italic">Oenomaus</span>
</h2>
<p>According to Hyginus, <span class="italic">Fab.</span>, 84, Oenomaus, a son of Mars and Asterope, and husband of Euarete, a daughter of Acrisius, was afraid to give his lovely daughter Hippodamia in marriage because an oracle had said that he must beware of death at the hands of a son-in-law. Many wooed her, and so he ordained that whoever should defeat him in a chariot race should wed her; the loser would be put to death. Oenomaus gave each competitor a start, sacrificed a ram, and then mounted his chariot with Myrtilus his charioteer, and speared the wooer when he came up with him (Diodor. Sic., IV, 73; Schol., ad Pind. <span class="italic">Ol.,</span> I, 14). Oenomaus had horses which were swifter than the north wind, and many a man lost the race and his life;</p>
