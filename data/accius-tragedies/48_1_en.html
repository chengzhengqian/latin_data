<span class="ac">The After-Born</span>
</h2>
<p>dition failed, and Amphiaraus miraculously disappeared. When the sons of the Seven prepared the second expedition in order to avenge their fathers, they chose Alcmaeon to be their leader; he, however, hesitated, not having killed his mother Eriphyle. But she, now possessing Harmonia’s ‘peplus’ besides the necklace, persuaded him to go. After the fall of Thebes (so Apoll., III, 86; another version, followed by Ribbeck, makes Alcmaeon kill his mother before the second expedition), Alcmaeon, having discovered the reason why she had induced him to take part in the expedition, slew her with the help of his brother Amphilochus, was afflicted with madness, and became an exile. (See the plays <span class="italic">Alcmeo</span> and <span class="italic">Alphesiboea,</span> pp. 332 ff.)</p>
