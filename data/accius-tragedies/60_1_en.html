<p>Nonius: ‘Disertim’ (plainly, expressly) is a term we can, on the authority of Titinius, use for clearly, openly . . .—</p>

<p>Nonius: ‘Miserari’ and ‘misereri.’ The old writers saw fit to take these words in different senses, as follows: ‘miserari’ being to weep and lament, ‘misereri’ to show commiseration at another’s calamities; and they held that the verb in the active form (<span class="italic">sc.</span> ‘miserare’) applied to the former emotion, in the deponent to the latter.

<p>Cicero: He (<span class="italic">sc.</span> Aesopus) acted my cause before the people in words far weightier than I could have used in pleading for myself! For he expressed the genius of an excellent poet not only by his art but by his grief also. With what powerful effect did he say that I, a man—</p>
