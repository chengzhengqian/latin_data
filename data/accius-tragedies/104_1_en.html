<p>Aeschylean passage are given as from Accius’ <span class="italic">Prometheus</span> by Nonius, whose quotation apparently goes back to some commentary on Cicero; Nonius’ quotation comes after one from Lucretius, which follows two from Cicero (<span class="italic">de Nat. Dear,</span> and <span class="italic">de Offic.</span>). As regards accepting the passage as Accius’, the testimony of Nonius at this point in his text is no sure foundation on which to rest. I have done no more than include doubtfully the passage quoted by Nonius as from Accius’ <span class="italic">Prometheus.</span> Cf. Ribb., 543 ff., and <span class="italic">Trag. Fragm.</span>, LVII; Przychocki, <span class="italic">Eos,</span> XXXII, 215 ff.; Fraenkel, <span class="italic">Gnomon,</span> VI, 663.</p>
