<span class="italic">Atreus on his brother’s intrigues with Aerope:</span>
</p>
<p>Cicero: Again, when that famous villain is plotting the deadly feast for his brother, does he not turn and reason the plan hither and thither in his thoughts? . . . But we must not pass over Thyestes himself—</p>

</span>
<span class="line indent1">Who was not satisfied when he allured</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent1">My wife into debauchery;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<p>a sin about which Atreus speaks rightly and with perfect truth—
</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line indent8">. . . a thing I hold to be</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent1">In matters of high state the height of danger—</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent1">When mothers of the royal house are polluted,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent1">Their stock defiled, their lineage confused.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">But how cunningly is this very villainy plotted by Thyestes, one who sought to gain the kingdom by adultery—
</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line indent1">Thereto withal the lord of heaven by portent</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent1">Sent me a prodigy, for my realm a stay,—</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent1">A ram of golden fleece among my sheep</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent1">Shone brilliant; him Thyestes durst by stealth</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent1">Purloin from out the palace; and in this deed</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent1">He took my wedded queen for his accomplice.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">Do you not see that Thyestes practised the greatest dishonour and yet shewed perfect rationality?</p>
