on the strength of my close connexion with that order they have represented to me the position of the public interests and the danger of their private fortunes: how that in Bithynia,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL198_19_a" id="target_note_LCL198_19_a"><sup>a</sup></a> now a province of<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span> yours, many villages have been burnt to the ground; the kingdom of Aziobarzanes which borders on your tributary states, is entirely in the hands of the enemy; Lucius Lucullus, despite great achievements, is retiring from the campaign; his successor is not adequately equipped for the conduct of so great a war: one man is universally desired and demanded by citizens and allies alike as the commander for this war; one and the same commander is feared by the enemy, and they fear none but him.</p>
