own influence, loyalty, and determination, all this I promise and devote to you and to the Roman People for the achievement of our purpose; and I call all<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">70</span><span class="br"></span> the gods to witness—most especially the guardians of this hallowed spot who clearly see into the hearts of all who enter upon public life—that I am acting thus neither in deference to any man’s request nor with any idea of winning for myself by my support of this cause the favour of Gnaeus Pompeius, nor in the hope of gaining for myself from any man’s high position either protection from dangers or aids to advancement; for dangers, so far as a man may guarantee, I shall readily repel in the security of innocence, and advancement will come to me, if such is your good pleasure, not through the favour of any one man nor through speeches delivered from this platform, but as the reward of a life now as ever devoted to hard work. Wherefore any effort I may<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">71</span><span class="br"></span> have made in this cause, gentlemen, I protest has been made in the cause of my country; and far from seeming to have sought any popularity for myself, I am aware of having even incurred many enmities, some overt and some secret, which I might have avoided, though not without some detriment to you. But I have made up my mind that, invested as I am with this high office and enjoying the great reward of your goodwill, it is my duty to place your wishes, the honour of the State, and the well-being of our provinces and allies above any advantages and interests of my own.</p>
