in Asia, and you ought to consult their interests in their absence; while others of them have vast sums invested in that province. Your humanity therefore enjoins that you should save this large body of citizens from ruin, and your wisdom shows you that the State cannot but be involved in the ruin of many of its citizens. For in the first place the subsequent recovery of our taxes through victory makes but little difference once the tax-farmers are lost; for the individuals in question will lack the power to buy the contract<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL198_31_a" id="target_note_LCL198_31_a"><sup>a</sup></a> owing to their ruin and any others the inclination owing to their fear. In the second<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">19</span><span class="br"></span> place we ought assuredly to remember the lesson which we learned from this same Mithridates at the beginning of the Asiatic war, since we were taught it through disaster. For, coinciding with the loss by many people of large fortunes in Asia, we know that there was a collapse of credit at Rome owing to suspension of payment.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL198_31_b" id="target_note_LCL198_31_b"><sup>b</sup></a> It is, indeed, impossible for many individuals in a single State to lose their property and fortunes without involving still greater numbers in their own ruin. Do you defend the commonwealth from this danger; and believe me when I tell you—what you see for yourselves—that this system of credit and finance which operates at Rome, in the Forum, is bound up in, and depends on capital invested in Asia; the loss of the one inevitably undermines the other and causes its collapse. Bethink you, therefore, whether you should hesitate to throw yourselves with the utmost enthusiasm into a war to defend the honour of your name, the well-being of your allies, the most important of your revenues and—a thing in which the commonwealth is closely concerned—the fortunes of so many citizens.</p>
