<span class="italic">Romans use Greek words instead of the good old Latin</span>:</p>
<p>Charisius: There are certain nouns . . . which Pliny calls of the passive function, as ‘aquale’; for example Lucilius in the first book of the <span class="italic">Satires—</span>

<p class="lineGroup">
<span class="line indent2">“and the term ‘draw-liquids’ is used” said he,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">“for water-basins.”</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p>
<span class="label">15–6</span>
<p>Macrobius: Virgil inserted into his work even Greek words, but he was not the first to be so bold as to do this. . . . Lucilius in the first book—</p>
<p class="lineGroup">
<span class="line indent2">“And further, the way we said ‘clinipods’ and</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">‘lustres’ magnifically, instead of ‘bed-feet’ and</span><span class="linebreak"></span>

<span class="italic">End of a god’s speech</span>:</p>
<p>Nonius: ‘Pausa’ means rest from something . . . —</p>

<span class="line indent2">When he had said these words, he made a pause in</span><span class="linebreak"></span>

<span class="italic">Some god speaks of a former council</span>:</p>
<p>Pseudo-Asconius: . . . The old writers, as Virgil shows, used to begin either with calling upon the gods, . . . or with a reproach of former times, as Lucilius has it—</p>
