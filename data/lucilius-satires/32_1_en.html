<p>Cicero: Our Laelius, who as a young man had heard lectures given by Diogenes the Stoic and later by Panaetius, was called wise not because he did not understand what made the pleasantest eating . . . —</p>
<p class="lineGroup">
<span class="line indent2">O sorrel, how art thou a plaything of scorn,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL329_65_a" id="target_note_LCL329_65_a">

<span class="line">when he was reproaching all our gluttons one by one.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>

<p>Brilliantly said by Laelius; and he is rightly called ‘savant.’ This too is a true hit—</p>
<p class="lineGroup">
<span class="line indent2">“O Publius, O glutton Gallonius, you’re a poor</span><span class="linebreak"></span>

<p>The man who speaks these words is one who . . . does not deny that Gallonius ever dined with a will (for he would be telling an untruth), but he denies that he dined well. . . . Laelius dined always well. What does ‘well’ mean? Lucilius shall tell us—</p>

<p>Nonius: ‘Multum’ and ‘satis’ . . . —</p>

<span class="line indent2">“For if that which is enough for a man could have</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
