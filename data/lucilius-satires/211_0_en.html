lines of Lucilius (see pp. 166–7, 378–9), to whom Vahlen attributed this fr. also. But the name Lucilius is not mentioned.</p>
<p>‘panaceam ubique salem’ (salt everywhere an allheal). Servius, ad <span class="italic">Aen.,</span> XII, 419, where ‘panacea’ is a plant all-heal. Servius quotes these words from <span class="italic">Lucretius</span> to support his idea (a false one) that in Virgil’s passage also ‘panacea’ may mean salt. Our extant Lucretius, however, uses only ‘panaces’ (IV, 124), without the words ‘ubique salem,’ and without any reference to salt. Hence Pius ‘attribution to Lucilius may be right. Marx would correct to’ panacean.’</p>
<p>‘Luciliades’ (son-o’-Lucilius’ house). Explanat. in Donat., <span class="italic">G.L.,</span> IV, 527, 10 ff. K, where ‘Memmiades’ and ‘Scipiades’ also are given as examples of this form. We have certainly ‘Scipiadas’ in Lucilius (see pp. 80, 134), and so, if not ‘Memmiades’ or Memmiadas,’ at least ‘Luciliades’ or ‘Luciliadas’ may have come in the satires of Lucilius, who in them seems to have mentioned himself by name several times. The attribution of Luciliades to Lucilius is Mueller’s.</p>
<p>Jerome, <span class="italic">Ep. ad Chrom. lov. Euseb.,</span> I, p. 340 M shows that Lucilius said M. Crassus laughed once only in his life, namely at the application of some proverb— ‘similem habent labra lactucam asino carduos comedente.’— ‘His lips hold a lettuce like when an ass is devouring thistles.’ Cicero, <span class="italic">de Fin.,</span> V, 92 (cp. <span class="italic">Tusc. Disp.,</span> III, 31; Pliny, <span class="italic">N.H.,</span> VII, 79) says that Crassus was still called ‘Agelastus,’ ‘Unsmiling,’ as Lucilius said. Restorations of this fr. as quoted by Jerome are uncertain. Cf. Ammianus Marcellinus, XXVI, 9, 11.</p>
<p>Cicero, <span class="italic">de Or.,</span> I, 72 says Lucilius often used to say (<span class="italic">in Satires?</span>) ‘Neminem esse in oratorum numero habendum qui non sit omnibus iis artibus quae sunt libero dignae perpolitus.’ — ‘No one is to be counted amongst orators who has not been
