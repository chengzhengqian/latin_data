<p>than senarii, septenarii, hexameters, and elegiac couplets; but it seems to me that in one satire in this book, in which he quoted or parodied literary works, he did use metres for him unusual, but employed in the works he was satirising. Fragment no. 885 quoted from Ennius’ Thyestes supports this view, but does not prove it, since the words can be put in septenarian metre. We should not forget that Lucilius was experimenting in these earlier books</p>
