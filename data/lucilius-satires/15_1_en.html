<span class="italic">Albucius a hellenomaniac; joke played on him by Scaevola’s cohors at Athens—cause of Albucius’ hatred of him</span>:</p>
<p>Cicero: As for good themes, spoken with dignity and beauty with choice words, who would not read them? Unless it be one who wants himself to be called downright Greek, just as Albucius was greeted at Athens by Scaevola the praetor.

<p>contained not only the account to a friend of the journey actually taken, but also a separate <span class="italic">propempticon</span> (farewell poem) to the same friend for a future journey as well, the fragments of this being distinguishable by the use of the second person.
