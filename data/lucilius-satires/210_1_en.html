<p>‘pistrina’ (bakery or pounding-mill) and ‘pistrix’ (bakeress). Varro, <span class="italic">L.L.,</span> V, 138. We have had ‘pistrina’ already in Lucilius (line 556); likewise ‘pistrix’ (line 1055). But Varro says ‘in urbe Lucili pistrina et pistrix’ which makes it possible that these two words occurred apart from the two fragments cited, and in a satire entitled <span class="italic">Urbs, The City.</span> ‘Pistrix’ as a female baker must be distinguished from the word given next.</p>
<p>‘pistrices’ (sea beasts; <span class="italic">or</span> saw-fish). <span class="italic">C.G.L.,</span> V, 234, 1. This word (in Greek πίστρις, πρίστις) appears also as ‘pristix,’ ‘pristis,’ ‘pistris.’ <span class="italic">In the gloss.</span> Lucilius (<span class="italic">thus</span> Loewe) <span class="italic">for</span> lucius <span class="italic">is probable;</span> but cf. Niedermann, <span class="italic">Rev. de Phil.,</span> XLI, 231–3 (‘lucius’ = fresh-water pike).</p>
<p>‘naterum’ (of buttocks) instead of ‘natium.’ Charisius, <span class="italic">G.L.,</span> I, 54, 21 K dixit Lucilius (<span class="italic">cd. Neapol.</span> Caecilius <span class="italic">cd. Colon.</span>) naterum (<span class="italic">cd. Colon,</span> naverum <span class="italic">cd. Neapol.</span>). Author and fragment uncertain.</p>
<p>‘hos vappones’ (these moths). Mar. Plot. = Prob. cath., ap. <span class="italic">G.L.</span> IV, 10, 30 ff. K where the text attributes the expression to Lucretius. But it is not to be found in Lucretius. I. Dousa attributes the words to Lucilius.</p>
<p>‘pergit capulare cadaver’ (the coffined corpse moves on). Fulgentius, <span class="italic">Exposit. Serm. Antiqu.,</span> 23, 118, 14 (Helm), who attributes the phrase to Lucilius but goes on to quote . . . ‘capularis senex’ from the comedy <span class="italic">Melene</span> of Flaccus Tibullus, an author apparently fictitious. Thus the fr. of Lucilius also is probably invented.</p>
<p>‘hypereticŏsque celetes’ (and a service-boat). Inscription on a mosaic at Tunis (<span class="italic">Musée Alaoui,</span> 166, p. 32; Buecheler, <span class="italic">Rhein. Mus.,</span> LIX, 1904, 322), which shows a ship called there κέλητες also. Cf. Xen., <span class="italic">Hellen.,</span> I, 6, 36 ὁ ὑπηρετικὸς κέλης. The mosaic gives also two undoubted
