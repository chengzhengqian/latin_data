Farewell, blessed Meliboeus; Apollo of the country-side plucks the laurel and offers you gifts of fragrant foliage. The Fauns offer, each according to his power, grape-clusters from the vine, harvest-stalks from the field, and fruits from every tree. Time-honoured Pales offers bowls foaming with milk; the Nymphs bring honey; Flora offers chaplets of varied hue. Such is the last tribute to the departed. Songs the Muses offer: the Muses offer song: and we play your praises on the flute. Your name, Meliboeus, is in the whisper of the forest plane-tree and the pine: every tuneful answer that echo makes to the woodland resounds your name. ‘Tis you our herds have upon their lips. For first will seals browse in the dry meadow, the shaggy lion live in the sea, and yew-trees drip sweet honey; first will the year confound its laws and winter’s gloom control the harvest and summer the olive-crop;
autumn will yield blossoms, spring will yield grapes, ere your praises, Meliboeus, are hushed upon my flute.”</p></div>
