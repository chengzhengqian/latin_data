</span> Turn your gaze on me at last, Iollas, cruel boy. You will not be ever thus. Herbs lose their bloom, thorns lose their roses, nor are lilies always white; the vine keeps not its leaf for long nor the poplar its shady foliage. Beauty is a short-lived gift nor one that lends itself to age.</p><p class="lineGroup">Let each sing of what he loves: song too relieves love’s pangs.</p></div>

</span> The doe follows the buck, the comely heifer the bull, wolves have felt the stirring of love, lionesses have felt it, and the tribes of the air, the birds, and the throng of scaled creatures, and mountains and woods—and trees have their own loves. You alone flee from love; you betray your hapless lover.</p><p class="lineGroup">Let each sing of what he loves: song too relieves love’s pangs.</p></div>

</span> Time nurtures all things, time snatches them away; enjoyment lies within narrow bounds. ‘Twas spring, and I saw beneath their mothers yonder calves, which now have met in horned battle for the snow-white cow. For you, already your nostrils swell, already your neck grows strong, already you count your years by twenty harvests.</p><p class="lineGroup">Let each sing of what he loves: song too relieves love’s pangs.</p></div>

</span> Come hither, fair Meroe; the heat calls us to the shade. Now the herds have found cover in the wood; now there is no bird that sings from tuneful throat; the scaly serpent marks not the ground with its sinuous trail. Alone I sing, all the wood resounds with my strain, nor do I yield in song to the summer cicalas.</p></div></section><notes></notes></section>
