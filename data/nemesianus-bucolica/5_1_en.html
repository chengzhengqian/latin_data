<h2><span class="sc">Idas: Alcon</span></h2>
<p>Young Idas and young Alcon had a burning passion for the fair Donace; both, ablaze in their inexperienced years, rushed with frenzied spirit into their love for Donace. Her they assailed together, when she was gathering flowers in the neighbouring garden vales and filling her lap with soft acanthus.

And beneath a plane-tree—Idas on the flute followed by Alcon in his verse—they poured out this solace for their sad plight.</p>
