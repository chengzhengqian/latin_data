No one has ever had such prestige among foreign nations as he,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_125_1" id="target_note_LCL139_125_1"><sup>1</sup></a> for he was ever a lover of peace, even to such a degree that he was continually quoting the saying of Scipio in which he declared that he would rather save a single citizen than slay a thousand foes.</p>

<p>X. When the senate declared that the months of September and October should be called respectively Antoninus and Faustinus, Antoninus refused. The wedding of his daughter Faustina, whom he espoused <span class="marginNote right">145.</span>to Marcus Antoninus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_125_2" id="target_note_LCL139_125_2"><sup>2</sup></a> he made most noteworthy, even to the extent of giving a donative to the soldiers. He made Verus Antoninus consul after his quaestorship. <span class="marginNote right">154.</span>On one occasion, he sent word to Apollonius,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_125_3a" id="target_note_LCL139_125_3a"><sup>3</sup></a> whom he had summoned from Chalcis, to come to the House of Tiberius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_125_4" id="target_note_LCL139_125_4"><sup>4</sup></a> (where at the time he was staying) in order that he might put Marcus Antoninus in his charge, but Apollonius replied “The master ought not come to the pupil, but the pupil to the master”. Whereupon the Emperor ridiculed him, saying “It was easier, then, for Apollonius to come to Rome from Chalcis than from his house to my palace”. The greed of this man he had noticed even in the matter of his salary. It is related of him, too, as an instance of his regard for his family, that when Marcus was mourning the death of his tutor and was restrained by the palace servants from this display of affection, the Emperor said: “Let him be only a man for once; for neither philosophy nor empire takes away natural feeling”.</p>
