<p>So I now take back what I just said. I shall write to them and tell them, if anyone should inquire whether your charge against me is true, not to deny it to anyone at all. Frankly, I am afraid that they may be criticized themselves for keeping me in the dark, or else that the refusal on my part to accept an invitation to join may be highly discreditable to me. For never, holy Jupiter, was a greater deed done in Rome or anywhere else in the world; none more glorious, none more sure to live forever in the memory of mankind. Do you make me a partner in that enterprise, shutting me inside with the leaders as in a Trojan Horse? I <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">33</span><span class="br"></span>do not decline, I even thank you, no matter what your motive. It is so great a matter that this odium which you want to stir up against me is in my eyes minor in comparison with the praise I shall receive. Is there anything happier than these men whom you boast of having driven out and banished? Is there a region either so uninhabited or so uncivilized that it will not seem to speak words of welcome when they approach? Are there any human beings so uncouth as not to rate the sight of them the greatest experience of their lives? No future age will be found so unmindful, no literature so ungrateful as not to preserve their glory in everlasting remembrance. Yes, indeed, add my name to such a roll.</p>
