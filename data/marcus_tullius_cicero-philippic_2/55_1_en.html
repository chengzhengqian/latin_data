The statues and paintings which Caesar bequeathed to the people along with his suburban estate, those objects Antonius removed, partly to Pompeius’ estate, partly to Scipio’s villa.</p>

<p>[43] And are <span class="italic">you</span> looking after Caesar’s memory, do <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">110</span><span class="br"></span>you love him in his grave? What greater honor had Caesar attained than to have a sacred couch,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL189_163_138" id="target_note_LCL189_163_138"><sup>138</sup></a> an image, a gable,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL189_163_139" id="target_note_LCL189_163_139"><sup>139</sup></a> a special priest? Just as Jupiter and Mars and Quirinus have their priests, so the divine Julius has Marcus Antonius. Why do you delay then? Why are you not inaugurated? Choose a date, choose someone<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL189_163_140" id="target_note_LCL189_163_140"><sup>140</sup></a> to inaugurate you. We are your colleagues, nobody will refuse. Abominable creature, whether because you are the priest of a tyrant or of a dead man! Next I ask whether you are unaware what day it is today. Don’t you know that yesterday was the fourth day of the chariot races at the Roman Games<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL189_163_141" id="target_note_LCL189_163_141"><sup>141</sup></a> and that you yourself put a law through an assembly of the people providing for a fifth day to be added in Caesar’s honor? Why are we not in our holiday clothes? Why do we let the honor granted Caesar by your law be omitted? Perhaps you allowed public thanksgivings to be polluted by adding a day<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL189_163_142" id="target_note_LCL189_163_142"><sup>142</sup></a> but did not want pollution to sully the sacred couches? Either abolish religion altogether or preserve it in every possible respect. You ask whether I approve of the <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">111</span><span class="br"></span>sacred couch, the gable, the special priest. Certainly not, none of it has my approval. But you, who are the defender of Caesar’s acts, how can you explain your defense of some acts and indifference to others? Unless perhaps you are willing to admit that you measure everything by your own profit, not Caesar’s honor. Well, what have you to say to all </p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL189_163_138"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL189_163_138" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">138</sup>At the ceremony of the <span class="italic">lectisternium</span>, images of the gods were borne on couches (<span class="italic">pulvinaria</span>).
