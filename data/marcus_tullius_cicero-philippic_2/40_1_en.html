Who does not know how perfidiously you both behaved toward Dolabella? Caesar led him on to stand for the office, and then, after it had been promised and guaranteed, snatched it away and transferred it to himself. You cloaked your own desire to block Dolabella’s consulship by placing the blame on Caesar’s treachery. The first of January arrived. We were summoned to a meeting of the senate, where Dolabella delivered a much more copious and studied invective against Antonius than I am delivering now. Good gods, what a speech Antonius made in anger! <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">80</span><span class="br"></span>To begin with, Caesar had made it clear that before leaving Rome he would order the consulship to be conferred on Dolabella—Caesar was always doing and saying that sort of thing, and yet they deny that he was a monarch!—anyway, Caesar having so pronounced, this fine augur of ours then stated that he was invested with a priestly office which enabled him to hold up or invalidate the elections by means of auspices, and he emphatically declared that this was his intention. First, note the unbelievable stupidity of the man. What do I mean? Well, if you were <span class="italic">not</span> an augur <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">81</span><span class="br"></span>and were truly a consul, would you have been any the less able to do what you said you could do by your priestly prerogative? Surely you could have done it even more easily. We augurs only possess the right to report an unfavorable omen, whereas consuls and the rest of the magistrates also have the right to look for omens. So be it; he made this statement incompetently—after all, we cannot demand expertise from a man who is never sober. But consider his impudence: many months before the event, he stated in the senate that he would either use the auspices to block the assembly called to elect Dolabella, or do what in fact he did.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL189_133_94" id="target_note_LCL189_133_94"><sup>94</sup></a> Can anyone foretell a flaw in the auspices unless he </p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL189_133_94"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL189_133_94" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">94</sup>I.e., nullify the results of the election after the assembly voted (§83).</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL189_133_94').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
