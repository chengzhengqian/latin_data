In this affair, I could not help but feel not so much pleased at not having been killed by you as unhappy that you could have done this with impunity.</p>
<p>But grant it was a kindness, since none greater could be <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">6</span><span class="br"></span>accepted from a bandit: where can you say I have been ungrateful? Should I have refrained from protesting at the destruction of the Republic for fear of seeming ungrateful to you? And yet, in making that protest, a melancholy, mournful business but a necessary one in view of the rank conferred upon me by the senate and people of Rome, did I say an offensive word, did I speak immoderately, did I speak in an unfriendly fashion? That speech required a good deal of self-restraint—to complain of Marcus Antonius while refraining from personal attack! And that too after you had scattered the last remnants of the Republic to the winds, when everything was up for sale at your house in a shameful market, when you were acknowledging that you were both the beneficiary and author of legislation that was adopted without ever having been promulgated,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL189_61_7" id="target_note_LCL189_61_7"><sup>7</sup></a> when as augur you had abolished the auspices and as consul the right of veto, when you were surrounded by your abominable armed bodyguard, when you were daily indulging in every kind of vice in a virtuous house,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL189_61_8" id="target_note_LCL189_61_8"><sup>8</sup></a> exhausted by drink and debauchery? And yet, just as though <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">7</span><span class="br"></span>I were in a controversy with Marcus Crassus, with whom I had many notable affrays, and not with the most worthless gladiator, I complained in grave terms on public grounds but said nothing about the man. Very well, today I shall make him realize just how considerable a kindness he had from <span class="italic">me</span> on that occasion.</p>
