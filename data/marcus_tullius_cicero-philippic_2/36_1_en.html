Why not I rather from him? Did he win without me? Indeed he couldn’t. I brought him his pretext for civil war, I sponsored pernicious laws, I bore arms against consuls and commanders of the Roman people, against the senate and the people of Rome, against our ancestral gods and altars and hearths, against our native land. Did he win only for himself? Why shouldn’t those who share the guilt share the loot?” You were asking for your right, but what of that? He was the stronger. And so, shrugging aside your protests, <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">73</span><span class="br"></span>he sent soldiers to you and your sureties; at which point you suddenly posted that magnificent notice announcing a sale. Loud was the laughter to see so long a list of properties so many and various, of which (except for a share in the Misenum estate) there was not one that the person putting them up for sale could call his own. Ah, but the auction itself was a sorry spectacle. Some tapestries of Pompeius’, just a few and stained at that; certain dented articles of silver, also his; some squalid slaves. It made us sad that anything remained for us to see.

Indeed, at that very time, the story circulated that an assassin sent by Antonius had been arrested in Caesar’s house with a dagger; Caesar complained about it and railed against you openly in the senate.</p>
