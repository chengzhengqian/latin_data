Rouse yourself from your intoxication, I say, and blow it all out. Will it take lighted torches to rouse you from your slumbers over an issue like this? Will you never understand that you have to make up your mind whether the authors of that deed are murderers or champions of freedom?</p>

<section class="div2">
<p> [13] Pay attention for a little while, and just for a moment try to <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">31</span><span class="br"></span>think like a sober man. I, who am their close friend, as I myself acknowledge—their partner, as you accuse me of being—state that there is no middle ground: if they are not liberators of the Roman people and preservers of the Republic, I confess them to be worse than assassins, worse than murderers, worse even than parricides, if indeed it is a more atrocious crime to kill the “father of the fatherland”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL189_85_29" id="target_note_LCL189_85_29"><sup>29</sup></a> than one’s own parent. Well, what do you say in your pensive wisdom? If you regard them as parricides, why have you always named them with respect both in this body and before the Roman people? Why was Marcus Brutus on your motion granted dispensation from the laws, if he should be absent from Rome more than ten days?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL189_85_30" id="target_note_LCL189_85_30"><sup>30</sup></a> Why were the Apollinarian Games celebrated with exceptional honor to Marcus Brutus?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL189_85_31" id="target_note_LCL189_85_31"><sup>31</sup></a> Why were provinces given to Brutus and Cassius, why were quaestors assigned, why was the number of legates increased?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL189_85_32" id="target_note_LCL189_85_32"><sup>32</sup></a> And yet all of this was done through you. Therefore you do not take them for murderers. It follows that in your judgment they are liberators, since there can be no third possibility. What is <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">32</span><span class="br"></span>it? Can it be that I am confusing you? Perhaps you don’t quite understand a logical dilemma.
