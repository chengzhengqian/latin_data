<p>[6] But inasmuch as the Republic is now bereft of all <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">13</span><span class="br"></span>the distinguished personages whom I have named, let me come to the two living consulars out of that roll who are still with us. There is the extremely wise and gifted Lucius Cotta. <span class="italic">He</span> proposed a Thanksgiving in the most flattering terms for the actions which you reprobate, and the entire senate, including these same consulars whose names I have just rehearsed, agreed to the motion. Never before, since the foundation of Rome, had that honor been granted to a civilian. There is also Lucius Caesar, your uncle, <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">14</span><span class="br"></span>who made a most eloquent, resolute, and impressive speech against his own brother-in-law, your stepfather.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL189_69_14" id="target_note_LCL189_69_14"><sup>14</sup></a> You should have made him your guide and mentor in all decisions, in your whole life; but you preferred to resemble your stepfather rather than your uncle. As consul I availed myself of his counsels, though I had no family connection with him: you are his sister’s son, but have you ever once consulted him on public affairs? But good heavens, whom <span class="italic">does</span> Antonius consult? Those fellows, I suppose, whose very birthdays have to be brought to our notice. “Antonius is not appearing in public today.” “Oh, why <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">15</span><span class="br"></span>is that?” “He is giving a birthday party on his suburban estate.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL189_69_15" id="target_note_LCL189_69_15"><sup>15</sup></a> “For whom?” Well, gentlemen, I won’t name names. One day it will be for some Phormio, let us suppose, another for Gnatho, and another for Ballio even.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL189_69_16" id="target_note_LCL189_69_16"><sup>16</sup></a> Foul! Infamous! Oh the intolerable shamelessness, worthlessness, licentiousness! Even though you have a leading senator, an outstanding member of the community as such a close relative, are you never to consult him about public affairs, but rather are you to consult those who have nothing of their own and drain what is yours?</p>
<p>So clearly your consulship is salutary, mine ruinous!</p>
