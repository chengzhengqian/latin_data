Will men put up with you, when they did not put up with Caesar? Believe me, from now on it will be a race <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">118</span><span class="br"></span>to get to the job; there will be no waiting for an opportunity which might be slow in coming.</p>
<p>Be so kind as to look back at last upon the Republic, Marcus Antonius. Think of the men from whom you sprang, not of those with whom you associate. Make your peace with me or not, just as you please; but make your peace with the Republic. However, as for you, it is for you to determine. As for me, out of my own mouth I will make this declaration: I defended the Republic when I was young; I shall not desert it now that I am old. I despised Catiline’s blades; I shall not fear yours. Yes, and I should be happy to offer my body if my death can bring into reality the freedom of our state so that the suffering of the Roman people at length brings to birth what has so long been in the womb. In this very temple almost twenty years ago I <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">119</span><span class="br"></span>said that death could not be untimely for a consular; with how much greater truth shall I now say, “for an old man”! For me, Members of the Senate, death is now something even to be wished for after the offices I have attained and the services I have rendered. I make only these two prayers: the first, that when I die, I leave the Roman people free—the immortal gods can grant me no greater favor than this—the second, that each man’s fate match his deserts as a patriot.</p>
