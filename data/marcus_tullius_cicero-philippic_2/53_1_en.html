But when <span class="italic">you</span> were its tenant—not its owner—every room echoed with the shouts of drunkards, the pavements swam with wine, the walls were wet with it, boys of free birth mingled with child prostitutes, harlots with married ladies.

<p>When he departed from there for Rome and approached <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">106</span><span class="br"></span>Aquinum, a pretty large crowd came out to meet him, as might be expected from a populous town. But he was carried through the streets in a closed litter like a dead man. It was foolish of the people of Aquinum, but they did live on the highway. What about the inhabitants of Anagnia? Although they were at a distance from Antony’s route, nonetheless, they came down to pay their respects as though he were a consul. It is amazing to report, but it is agreed by all that nobody’s greeting was returned—even though he had two native sons of Anagnia with him, Mustela and Laco, one a master swordsman, the other a master drinker.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL189_159_136" id="target_note_LCL189_159_136"><sup>136</sup></a> I need not relate the threats and insults <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">107</span><span class="br"></span>with which he spoke harshly against the people of Sidicinum and persecuted the people of Puteoli because they had chosen Gaius Cassius and the Bruti as their patrons.
