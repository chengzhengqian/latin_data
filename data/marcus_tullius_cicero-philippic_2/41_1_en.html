But that is illegal at elections; and if anyone has watched for omens, he ought to make his announcement not after but before the elections are held. Ignorance compounded by impudence!

<p>Well, then, recall his behavior as consul from that day <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">82</span><span class="br"></span>down to the fifteenth of March. Was there ever a magistrate’s assistant so abjectly subservient? He had no power of his own. He asked for everything. Putting his head into the back of his colleague’s litter, he would beg favors from him in order to sell them.</p>

What had you seen, what had you perceived, what had you heard? For you did not say that you had watched the heavens, nor are you saying so today. So the flaw which you had already foreseen on the first of January and predicted so long beforehand duly appeared. Thus, by god, you lied about the auspices, to your own great mischief, I truly hope, and not to that of the Republic. You bound the Roman people in a religious liability.
