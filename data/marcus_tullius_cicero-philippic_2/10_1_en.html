<p> [8] But in your witlessness you were fighting against yourself all through your speech. Not only did what you said lack coherence, but it was also downright out of joint and self-contradictory so that you were more in conflict with yourself than with me. You admitted that your stepfather had been involved in that monstrous crime, but you complained of his punishment, thus praising what is properly mine and blaming what is entirely the senate’s. For the arrest of the guilty men was my doing, their punishment was the senate’s. Indeed a clever pleader!

It is not audacity that makes you say these shameless things, but your failure to perceive glaring inconsistencies. Obviously you are a fool, for nothing could be more senseless than to reproach another man for using armed force in the public interest when you have resorted to it yourself to the public injury.</p>
