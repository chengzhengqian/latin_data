<p>Caesar left for Spain after granting you a few days’ grace in which to pay in consideration of your lack of means. You did not follow him on this occasion either. Should so good a gladiator have taken his discharge<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL189_127_82" id="target_note_LCL189_127_82"><sup>82</sup></a> so soon? Would anyone fear this fellow who was so cowardly in supporting his own side, that is, his own fortunes?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL189_127_83" id="target_note_LCL189_127_83"><sup>83</sup></a> </p>

Then how did Dolabella get there? You should either not have enlisted under that banner, Antonius, or having done so, you should have fought for it to the end. Three times Caesar met his countrymen in decisive battle, in Thessaly, Africa, and Spain. Dolabella took part in all these engagements; in the Spanish one he was actually wounded. If you ask my opinion, I would wish he had not. All the same, while his original choice is censurable, his constancy is nevertheless praiseworthy. But what sort of fellow are <span class="italic">you</span>? In that campaign, the sons of Gnaeus Pompeius were first of all trying to reclaim their native land. Very well, let us grant that this was the common cause of their side. Furthermore, they were trying to reclaim their ancestral gods, altars, hearths, their family home, which you had invaded. When the legal owners claimed their property by resorting to arms, who—I know there can be no justice in such iniquity, but still, <span class="italic">who</span> could most justly be expected to fight against Gnaeus Pompeius’ sons? Who but you, the liquidator of those confiscated assets? Or was Dolabella to fight on your behalf in Spain so <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">76</span><span class="br"></span>that you might vomit over your hosts’ dinner tables at Narbo?</p>
<p>But what a return he made from Narbo—and he was asking why I turned back so suddenly, abandoning my journey! Members of the Senate, I explained the reason for my return not long ago.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL189_127_84" id="target_note_LCL189_127_84"><sup>84</sup></a> I wanted, if possible, to be of </p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL189_127_82"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL189_127_82" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">82</sup>Lit. “wooden sword” (<span class="italic">rudis</span>), a symbol of a gladiator’s discharge.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL189_127_82').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL189_127_83"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL189_127_83" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">83</sup>I.e., Antony had a personal stake in defeating the sons of Pompey in the Spanish campaign so that he could continue to occupy Pompey’s confiscated holdings.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL189_127_83').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL189_127_84"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL189_127_84" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">84</sup>See 1.7–10.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL189_127_84').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
