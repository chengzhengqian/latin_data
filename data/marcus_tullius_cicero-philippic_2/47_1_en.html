All this he took away in his lifetime and returns after his death! And in what terms! Sometimes “it seems fair” to him, <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">95</span><span class="br"></span>sometimes “it seems not unfair.” A remarkable turn of phrase! But Caesar never said that anything <span class="italic">we</span> asked of him on Deiotarus’ behalf “seemed fair”—I know, for I always appeared for Deiotarus in his absence. A bond for ten million sesterces was signed by envoys, worthy men but timid and inexperienced, without my approval or that of the king’s other friends in Rome. The document was signed in the women’s apartments, where a great many things have been sold and are being sold. I advise you<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL189_147_117" id="target_note_LCL189_147_117"><sup>117</sup></a> to consider well what action you are going to take on that bond. For the king himself, of his own volition and without any memoranda of Caesar’s, recovered his possessions with his own military might as soon as he heard the news of Caesar’s death. He knew in his wisdom that it has ever <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">96</span><span class="br"></span>been lawful for those whose possessions have been seized by tyrants to recover them after the tyrants have been killed. No jurist, not even that person<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL189_147_118" id="target_note_LCL189_147_118"><sup>118</sup></a> whom only you believe to be a jurist, through whom you are conducting this business, will say that payment is due on that bond for items which had been recovered before the bond was signed. Deiotarus did not buy from you, but before you could sell him his own property, he took possession himself. </p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL189_147_115"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL189_147_115" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">115</sup>Mithridates of Pergamum, an adventurer to whom Caesar granted territory in eastern Galatia, a tetrarchy Deiotarus had managed to seize temporarily during the confusion caused by the Civil War.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL189_147_115').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL189_147_116"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL189_147_116" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">116</sup>I.e., Armenia Minor, a region south of the eastern end of the Black Sea (in mod.
