Has anyone possessing the least acquaintance with the behavior of gentlemen ever produced a letter written to him by a friend with whom he had subsequently had a difference and read it aloud in public? That amounts to robbing life of its social foundations, abolishing conversation between absent friends. How many jests find their way into letters which would seem silly if produced in public, along with much that is serious but on no account to be divulged!
