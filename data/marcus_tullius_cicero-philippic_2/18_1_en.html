<p>But after all, Antonius, if it is a crime to have wished Caesar to be killed, consider, please, what is to become of <span class="italic">you</span>, since it is common knowledge that you plotted his death at Narbo with Gaius Trebonius;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL189_89_34" id="target_note_LCL189_89_34"><sup>34</sup></a> and it was because of your association with him in that plan that when Caesar was being killed we saw Trebonius take you aside. For my own part—do note how far I am from treating you as an enemy—I applaud the salutary thought you once entertained. I thank you for not turning informer. I forgive you for not taking action; that enterprise needed a <span class="italic">man</span>. But if <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">35</span><span class="br"></span>someone should take you to court and quote that watchword of Cassius,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL189_89_35" id="target_note_LCL189_89_35"><sup>35</sup></a> “Who stood to gain?”, please be on your guard against getting caught. And yet, as you yourself used to say, everybody who did not want to be a slave gained thereby, but particularly you, who are not only no slave but even a monarch. You took a vast load of debt off your shoulders at the Temple of Ops. You used the same records to squander more money than is able to be counted. So many things have been transferred from Caesar’s house to yours; and there a most lucrative factory of false memoranda and handwritten documents is in operation, and a scandalous market in lands, towns, exemptions, revenues. After all, <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">36</span><span class="br"></span>what but Caesar’s death could have relieved your poverty and debt? You seem a trifle agitated. Can it be that deep down inside you are afraid that this charge may appear to have something to do with you? I free you of your fear: nobody will ever believe it. Service to the Republic is not your style. As authors of that magnificent exploit the Republic has illustrious men. I say only that you are glad of it; I don’t charge you with having done it.</p>
<p>I have answered the most serious charges. Now I must answer the rest as well.</p>
