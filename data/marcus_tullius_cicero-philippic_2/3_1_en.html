How dare you make such a preposterous assertion? And at the time when Gnaeus Pompeius and Quintus Hortensius put my name forward at the instance of the entire College—no more than two nominators being permitted—you were a bankrupt who saw your only salvation in the overthrow of the Republic. Besides, could you stand for the augurate at that time seeing that Curio was out of Italy, or on that occasion when you were elected, would you have been able to carry a single tribe without Curio? Friends of his were actually convicted of violence because of their excessive zeal on your behalf.</p>

To be sure, what you are talking about is indeed something I have always been the first to acknowledge. I have preferred to confess myself in your debt rather than let some foolish person think me wanting in gratitude. But what was the kindness? That you did not kill me at Brundisium? Could you have killed one whom the conqueror himself, who, as you used to boast, had made you chief of his robber band, had wished to spare and ordered to return to Italy?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL189_59_5" id="target_note_LCL189_59_5"><sup>5</sup></a> Suppose you could have done. That is the sort of kindness one gets from bandits, Members of the Senate: they can say they granted their lives to those whose lives they did not take. If that were a kindness, those who killed the man who had spared them, whom you yourself often call “illustrious gentlemen,” would never have won so much glory.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL189_59_6" id="target_note_LCL189_59_6"><sup>6</sup></a> But where is the kindness in abstaining </p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL189_59_4"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL189_59_4" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">4</sup>Cicero was elected in the summer of 53, or possibly in the spring of 52, while Antony was elected in 50, through Caesar’s influence.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL189_59_4').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note inline" id="note_LCL189_59_5"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL189_59_5" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">5</sup>In the autumn of 48, Cicero was allowed to return to Italy but to go no farther than Brundisium until Caesar returned in Sept. 47 and granted him a full pardon.
