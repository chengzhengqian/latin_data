You gentlemen know all that much better than I, but still I beg you to listen closely, as you are doing. In matters such as these we should be stirred not only by learning of them but even by remembering them. However, I think I had best cut short the middle of the story lest it take me too long to reach the final stages.</p>
<p>This fellow who is reminding me of the favors he <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">48</span><span class="br"></span>has done me was intimate with Clodius during the latter’s tribunate. Antonius was the torch that set light to all Clodius’ conflagrations, and even at that period, he was up to something in Clodius’ house. He himself knows very well what I mean.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL189_101_46" id="target_note_LCL189_101_46"><sup>46</sup></a> Then his journey to Alexandria, in defiance of the senate’s authority, of the Republic, of religious bars<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL189_101_47" id="target_note_LCL189_101_47"><sup>47</sup></a>—but he served under Gabinius, and anything he did in Gabinius’ company could not but be right and proper. So what was the manner of his return at that time? First, he traveled from Egypt to Outer Gaul<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL189_101_48" id="target_note_LCL189_101_48"><sup>48</sup></a> instead of coming home. And what home?

Nowhere on earth was there a place where you could set foot on your own ground, excepting only your property at Misenum,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL189_101_50" id="target_note_LCL189_101_50"><sup>50</sup></a> which you held with partners like a property at Sisapo.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL189_101_51" id="target_note_LCL189_101_51"><sup>51</sup></a></p>
