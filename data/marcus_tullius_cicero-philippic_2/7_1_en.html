Every decision, every official act, everything I did was done by the advice and authority and vote of this body. And now you, as a man of sense and not merely of eloquence, have dared to abuse these measures in front of those whose advice and wisdom determined them! Who was ever heard abusing my consulship except yourself and Publius Clodius, whose fate awaits you, as it awaited Gaius Curio, since you have that in your house which proved fatal to them both?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL189_67_12" id="target_note_LCL189_67_12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>Marcus Antonius disapproves of my consulship. <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">12</span><span class="br"></span>But Publius Servilius approved of it—to single out first among the consulars of that time the name of him who is the latest to have died. So did Quintus Catulus, a name that will ever live respected in this Republic. So likewise the two Luculli, Marcus Crassus, Quintus Hortensius, Gaius Curio, Gaius Piso, Manius Glabrio, Manius Lepidus, Lucius Vulcatius, Gaius Figulus.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL189_67_13" id="target_note_LCL189_67_13"><sup>13</sup></a> So too the two consuls-elect at that time, Decimus Silanus and Lucius Murena. The consulars’ approval was shared by Marcus Cato, who in taking leave of life displayed foresight in sparing himself many sorry sights but none sorrier than you as consul. Above all, my consulship was approved by Gnaeus Pompeius, who at our first meeting on his return from Syria embraced me and congratulated me, saying that he owed it to me that he would see his native land again. But why mention individuals? A very full meeting of the senate approved so heartily that every member present thanked me as a son might thank a father, acknowledging himself indebted to me for life, goods, children, and the Republic.</p>
