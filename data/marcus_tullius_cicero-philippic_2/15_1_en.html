<p>[12] However, do remember how the clever fellow <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">28</span><span class="br"></span>proved his point against me. “The moment Caesar was killed,” says he, “Brutus raised his bloodstained dagger high, called on Cicero by name, and congratulated him on the recovery of freedom.” Now why me in particular? Because I knew? Quite possibly the reason he called my name was just this: after an achievement similar to my own he called on me rather than another to witness that he was now my rival in glory.</p>
<p>You utter fool! Don’t you see that if it is a crime to have <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">29</span><span class="br"></span>wished Caesar killed, which is the charge you bring against me, it is also a crime to have been glad of Caesar’s death? What difference is there between one who advises an action and one who approves of it? Or what does it matter whether I wanted it done or rejoice at the doing? Well then, is there anyone, apart from those who were happy to see Caesar king of Rome, who did not want this to happen or disapproved of the act? So we are all guilty. And so, all decent men killed Caesar so far as it was in them to do so: some lacked design, some courage, some opportunity; none lacked the will.</p>
<p>Observe the stupidity of the man, or of the brute, I <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">30</span><span class="br"></span>should rather say. For this is what he said: “Marcus Brutus, whose name I mention with respect, called on Cicero as he held his bloodstained dagger: hence it ought to be inferred that Cicero was in the plot.” So then: you call <span class="italic">me</span> a criminal because you suspect that I suspected something, whereas Brutus, who brandished his dripping weapon, is named by you with respect! Very good; so much for the stupidity in your words: how much greater the stupidity in your actions and opinions! Make up your mind, consul, at long last: decide what you want the status of the Bruti, Gaius Cassius, </p></section><notes></notes></section>
