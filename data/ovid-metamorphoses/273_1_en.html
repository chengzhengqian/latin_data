dying face lies prone, the neck, its strength all gone, cannot sustain its own weight and falls back upon the shoulders. ‘Thou art fallen, defrauded of thy youth’s prime, Oebalides,’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL043_79_1" id="target_note_LCL043_79_1"><sup>1</sup></a> says Phoebus, ‘and in thy wound do I see my guilt; thou art my cause of grief and self-reproach; my hand must be proclaimed the cause of thy destruction. I am the author of thy death. And yet, what is my fault, unless my playing with thee can be called a fault, unless my loving thee can be called a fault? And oh, that I might meet death together with thee and might with thee give up my life! But since we are held from this by the laws of fate, thou shalt be always with me, and shalt stay on my mindful lips. Thee shall my lyre, struck by my hand, thee shall my songs proclaim. And as a new flower, by thy markings shalt thou imitate my groans. Also the time will come when a most valiant hero<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL043_79_2" id="target_note_LCL043_79_2"><sup>2</sup></a> shall be linked with this flower, and by the same markings shall he be known.’ While Apollo thus spoke with truth-telling lips, behold, the blood, which had poured out on the ground and stained the grass, ceased to be blood, and in its place there sprang a flower brighter than Tyrian dye. It took the form of the lily, save that the one was of purple hue, while the other was silvery white. Phoebus, not satisfied with this—for ’twas he who wrought the honouring miracle—himself inscribed his grieving words upon the leaves, and the flower bore the marks, AI AI, letters of lamentation, drawn thereon. Sparta, too, was proud that Hyacinthus was her son, and even to this day his honour still endures; and still, as the anniversary returns, as did their sires, they celebrate the Hyacinthia in solemn festival.</p>
