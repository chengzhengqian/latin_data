power, my daughter, think to move the changeless fates? Thou thyself mayst enter the abode of the three sisters. Thou shalt there behold the records of all that happens on tablets of brass and solid iron, a massive structure, tablets which fear neither warfare in the heavens, nor the lightning’s fearful power, nor any destructive shocks which may befall, being eternal and secure. There shalt thou find engraved on everlasting adamant thy descendant’s fates. 1 have myself read these and marked them well in mind; and these will I relate, that thou mayst be no longer ignorant of that which is to come. This son of thine, goddess of Gythera, for whom thou grievest, has fulfilled his allotted time, and his years are finished which he owed to earth. That as a god he may enter heaven and have his place in temples on the earth, thou shalt accomplish, thou and his son. He as successor to the name shall bear alone the burden placed on him, and, as the most valiant avenger of his father’s murder, he shall have us as ally for his wars. Under his command the conquered walls of leaguered Mutina shall sue for peace; Pharsalia shall feel his power; Emathian<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL043_423_1" id="target_note_LCL043_423_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Philippi shall reek again<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL043_423_2" id="target_note_LCL043_423_2"><sup>2</sup></a> with blood; and he of the great name<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL043_423_3" id="target_note_LCL043_423_3"><sup>3</sup></a> shall be overcome on Sicilian waters. A Roman general’s Egyptian mistress, who did not well to rely upon the union, shall fall before him, and in vain shall she have threatened that our Capitol shall bow to her Canopus. But why should I recall barbaric lands to you and nations lying on. either ocean-shore? Nay, whatsoever habitable land the earth contains shall be his, and the sea also shall come beneath his sway!</p>
