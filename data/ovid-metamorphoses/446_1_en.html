<p>“When peace has been bestowed upon all lands he shall turn his mind to the rights of citizens, and as a most righteous jurist promote the laws. By his own good example shall he direct the ways of men, and, looking forward to future time and coming generations, he shall bid the son,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL043_425_1" id="target_note_LCL043_425_1"><sup>1</sup></a> born of his chaste wife, to bear his name and the burden of his cares; and not till old age, when his years have equalled his benefactions, shall he attain the heavenly seats and his related stars. Meanwhile do thou catch up this<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL043_425_2" id="target_note_LCL043_425_2"><sup>2</sup></a> soul from the slain body and make him a star in order that ever it may be the divine Julius who looks forth upon our Capitol and Forum from his lofty temple.”</p>
<p>Scarce had he spoken when fostering Venus took her place within the senate-house, unseen of all, caught up the passing soul of her Caesar from his body, and not suffering it to vanish into air, she bore it towards the stars of heaven. And as she bore it she felt it glow and burn, and released it from her bosom. Higher than the moon it mounted up and, leaving behind it a fiery train, gleamed as a star. And now, beholding the good deeds of his son, he confesses that they are greater than his own, and rejoices to be surpassed by him. And, though the son forbids that his own deeds be set above his father’s, still fame, unfettered and obedient to no one’s will, exalts him spite of his desire, and in this one thing opposes his commands. So does the great Atreus yield in honour to his son, Agamemnon; so does Theseus rival Aegeus, and Achilles, Peleus; finally, to quote an instance worthy of them both, is Saturn less than Jove. Jupiter controls the heights
