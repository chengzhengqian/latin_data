for whom the Lapithae took arms, or the wife of the all too slow-returning Ulysses. And even as it is, though you shun them and turn in contempt from their wooing, a thousand men desire you, and half-gods and gods and all the divinities that haunt the Alban hills. But if you will be wise, and consent to a good match and will listen to an old woman like me, who love you more than all the rest, yes, more than you would believe, reject all common offers and choose Vertumnus as the consort of your couch. You may also have my guaranty for him; for he is not better known to himself than he is to me. He does not wander idly throughout the world, but he dwells in the neighbourhood here alone; nor, as most of your suitors do, does he fall in love at sight with every girl he meets. You will be his first love and his last, and to you alone he will devote his life.

And that you may the more fear these (for my long life has brought me knowledge of many things), I will tell you a story that is well known all over
