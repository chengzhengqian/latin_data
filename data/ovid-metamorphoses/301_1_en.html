Nephele, he came to earth in the country of Laomedon. Midway between the Sigean and Rhoetean promontories was an ancient altar sacred to the Panomphaean Thunderer. There Apollo saw Laomedon beginning to build the walls of his new city, Troy; and, perceiving that the mighty task was proceeding with great difficulty, and demanded no slight resources, he, together with the trident-bearing father of the swollen sea, put on mortal form and built the walls for the Phrygian king, having first agreed upon a sum of gold for the walls. There stood the work. But the king repudiated his debt and, as a crowning act of perfidy, swore that he had never promised the reward. “But you shall not go unpunished,” the sea-god said, and he set all his waters flowing against the shores of miserly Troy. He flooded the country till it looked like a sea, swept away the farmers’ crops and whelmed their fields beneath his waters. Nor was this punishment enough; the king’s daughter also must be sacrificed to a monster of the deep. But while she was bound there to the hard rocks, Alcides set her free, and then demanded his promised wage, the horses that were agreed upon. But the great task’s price was again refused, and so the hero took the twice-perjured walls of conquered Troy. Nor did Telamon, the partner of his campaign, go without reward, and Hesione was given him.
