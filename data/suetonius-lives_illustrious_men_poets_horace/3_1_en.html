<p>forced from Horace the selection which begins with these words:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">Seeing that single-handed thou dost bear the burden</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">of tasks so many and so great, protecting Italy’s</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">realm with arms, providing it with morals, reforming</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">it by laws, I should sin against the public weal,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Caesar, if I wasted thy time with long discourse.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL038_471_36" id="target_note_LCL038_471_36"><sup>36</sup></a></span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p></blockquote>
<p>In person he was short and fat, as he is described with his own pen in his satires<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL038_471_37" id="target_note_LCL038_471_37"><sup>37</sup></a> and by Augustus in the following letter: “Onysius has brought me your little volume, and I accept it, small as it is, in good part, as an apology. But you seem to me to be afraid that your books may be bigger than you are yourself; but it is only stature that you lack, not girth. So you may write on a pint pot, that the circumference of your volume may be well rounded out, like that of your own belly.”</p>
<p>It is said that he was immoderately lustful; for it is reported that in a room lined with mirrors he had harlots so arranged that whichever way he looked, he saw a reflection of venery. He lived for the most part in the country on his Sabine or Tiburtine estate, and his house is pointed out near the little grove of Tiburnus. ∗ ∗ ∗ I possess some elegies attributed to his pen and a letter in prose, supposed to be a recommendation of himself to Maecenas, but I think that both are spurious; for the elegies are commonplace and the letter is besides obscure, which was by no means one of his faults.</p>
