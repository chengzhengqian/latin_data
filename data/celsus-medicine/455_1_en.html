Since in women when the stone is small, the use of the knife is unnecessary because the stone is forced by the urine into the neck of the bladder which is shorter and more yielding in females than in males. Therefore the stone often escapes of itself, and if it sticks in the first part, which is narrower, yet it may be extracted by the scoop described above<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL336_440_a" id="target_note_LCL336_440_a"><sup>a</sup></a> without any harm. But for larger stones the treatment is the same.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL336_440_b" id="target_note_LCL336_440_b"><sup>b</sup></a> Except that in the case of a virgin the fingers are passed as in males, in the case of a woman into the vagina. Then the incision is to be made in a virgin just under the left labium, in a woman between the urethra and pubic bone, and in both instances by a transverse wound.<sup>c</sup> There is no need to be frightened if there is freer bleeding from a woman.</p>

Besides it is not unfitting for him to move about a little, in order that any blood clot still inside may drop out. But if again the bleeding does not cease of its own accord, it must be stopped lest all his strength be used up; and in weaker patients this is to be done immediately after the operation; since just as there is the risk of spasm from pushing about the bladder, so there is a second danger that [in the absence of medicaments] so much blood may be lost as to prove fatal. To prevent this the patient should be seated in a bath of strong vinegar to which a little salt has been added; under this treatment the bleeding generally stops, and it also has an astringent effect on the bladder so that the inflammation there is lessened.
