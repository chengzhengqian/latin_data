incised and the tunic pressed out into the wound; from it the veins are separated by a finger or the handle of the scalpel. But at the part where they are still attached, the veins are to be tied with linen thread both above and below that part; then cut away just beyond the ligatures and the testicle replaced. But when the varix is situated upon the inner tunic, it is necessary to cut through the middle tunic; then, if but two or three veins are swollen and some part only is involved, so that most of it is still free of the disease, the same is to be done as described above, so that the veins after being ligatured on the side of the groin and testicle respectively are cut away, after which the testicle is replaced. But if the varix involves the whole of one testis, the index finger is to be passed into the wound and under the veins, so as to draw them gradually forward, and they must be brought up until the testicle of that side is level with the opposite one. Then pins are passed through the edges so that at the same time they take up the veins as well. It is done in this way: the pin perforates from without through one edge of the wound, then it is passed not through an actual vein but through its membrane, and is pushed out through this to the opposite margin of the incision. A vein should not be wounded lest it bleed. There is always a membrane between these veins, and no danger is involved, and when the pin<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL336_416_a" id="target_note_LCL336_416_a"><sup>a</sup></a> has been fixed by a thread it holds the veins fast enough. Hence two pins are enough. Then whatever veins have been drawn forwards should be pushed back within the inguinal wound by the reverse end of the specillum. The time to take out the pins is when the inflammation
