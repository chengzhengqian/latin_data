closely adherent to the inner one; the Greeks call it dartos.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL336_392_a" id="target_note_LCL336_392_a"><sup>a</sup></a> Further, many fine membranes hold together the veins, and the arteries, and the cords aforesaid, and also in between the two tunics there are some fine and very small membranes, descending from the parts above. Thus far the coverings and supports belong to each testicle separately; next common to both and to all within is the pouch which is now visible to us; the Greeks call it oscheon,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL336_392_b" id="target_note_LCL336_392_b"><sup>b</sup></a> we the scrotum; and at its lowest part this is slightly connected with the middle coverings, higher up it is only surrounded by them. Now, underneath the scrotal covering many lesions are apt to occur, sometimes after the rupture of the coverings which, as I have said, begin from the groins, sometimes when they are uninjured. Since at times either owing to disease there is first inflammation, then afterwards a rupture from the weight; or after some blow there, there is a direct rupture of the covering which ought to separate the intestines from the parts below; then either omentum, or it may be intestine, rolls down by its own weight; this having found a way gradually from the groins into the parts below as well, there separates by its pressure the coverings which are fibrous and therefore give way. The Greeks call the condition enterocele<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL336_392_c" id="target_note_LCL336_392_c"><sup>c</sup></a> and epiplocele, with us the ugly but usual name for it is hernia.</p>
<p>Now if omentum has come down, the tumour in the scrotum never disappears, either if the patient fasts, or if his body is turned from side to side, or lies in some special position; again, if the breath is held, it does not increase to any extent; to the touch it seems uneven and soft and slippery. But if intestine has also come down this tumour is without
