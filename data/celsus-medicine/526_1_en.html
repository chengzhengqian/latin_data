is there right in front and holds the head of the tibia in place. Meges, however, has recorded a case in which he replaced a knee which had slipped forwards.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL336_582_a" id="target_note_LCL336_582_a"><sup>a</sup></a> In cases affecting the knee-joint the sinews can be extended by the same means as I have described for the thigh. And when it has slipped out backwards, as described above, a round ball of some kind is placed on the ham, and when the leg is bent up over it, the knee slips back again. In the other cases it is to be replaced by the surgeonâ€™s hands while the bones are being drawn apart in opposite directions.</p>

When it slips out inwards, the sole of the foot is turned outwards; when outwards, the contrary sign is exhibited.

But this is also replaced by manipulation, the foot and leg first being stretched in opposite directions. And after this kind of accident also, the patient should stay for a long while in bed, lest the ankle, which sustains the whole weight of the body, should give way and again be displaced if the sinews have not gained strength enough for bearing the weight. At first low shoes should be worn, so that the ankle may not be injured by tight lacing.</p>
