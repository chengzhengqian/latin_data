allow of it, for a whole hour before noon, or for half an hour after noon. Repressing poultices are of benefit, especially for the more delicate. Also an incision should be made four fingers’ breadth above the ankle on the inner side through which humour may discharge freely for some days, and the actual swellings ought to be incised by deep cuts; the body also is to be shaken up by much rocking (II. <span class="bold">15</span>); then after the incisions have formed a scab, both exercises and food must be increased, until the patient is restored to his former state of health. The food should be nutritious and glutinous, mostly meat. The wine, when the stomach permits of it, should be rather sweet, but should be drunk alternately with water every two or three days. The seeds of the wolf’s-milk plant, which grows to a large size on the seacoast, may be advantageously administered<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL292_321_a" id="target_note_LCL292_321_a"><sup>a</sup></a> in a draught with water.
