On this account the practitioner should not take his seat in a dark part of the room, nor at the patientâ€™s head, but he should face the patient in a good light, so that he may note all the signs from his face as he lies in bed. Now when there has been fever and it has decreased, one should observe whether the temples or other parts of the body are becoming a little moist, which is evidence that sweating is about to set in; and if there is any sign of it, then and not before hot water should be given to drink, of which the effect is salutary if it causes a general sweating all over the body. Now to promote this the patient should keep his hands well covered under the bedclothes, and do the same with his legs and feet.
