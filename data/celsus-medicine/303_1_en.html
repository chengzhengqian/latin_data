boil, in fact all the corrupted flesh is turned into pus. Now in children this occurs more often and is more readily relieved; in young adults it is more rare and more difficult to treat. Where age has hardened the body, the disease does not even occur. By what medicaments it should be dispersed has been stated above.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL304_144_a" id="target_note_LCL304_144_a"><sup>a</sup></a></p>
<p>Phygetron, again, is a wide swelling, not much raised up, in which there is a certain resemblance to a pustule.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL304_144_b" id="target_note_LCL304_144_b"><sup>b</sup></a> The pain and tension is severe, and more than would be expected from the size of the swelling; at times there is also feverishness. The ripening takes place slowly, and not much pus is formed. It occurs particularly on the top of the head, or in the armpits or groins. Our people call it panus, from its spindle-shape. And I have pointed out above by what medicament this should be relieved.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL304_145_c" id="target_note_LCL304_145_c"><sup>c</sup></a></p>
<p>But although all these diseases are really only minute abscesses, that name implies in general a more extensive lesion, tending to suppuration; and it occurs usually either after fevers or after pains in some part, and particularly after those which have attacked the abdomen. And generally it is visible, since there is some rather widespread swelling, like that which I have previously described as called phyma, and it grows red and hot and shortly afterwards hard as well, and becomes more painful as it increases and occasions both thirst and insomnia: sometimes, however, there may be none of these signs to note in the skin, and especially when pus is forming more deeply; but along with the thirst and insomnia some stabbing pains are felt internally.
