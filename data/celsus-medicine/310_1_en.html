not unaware that many favour the insertion of lint formed into a tent and dipped in honey; but this agglutinates more quickly than flesh is formed. There need be no fear that clean flesh in contact with clean flesh will fail to unite: we see that there is often no need to add medicaments as well to effect this, since often when there is ulceration of the fingers, unless we have taken careful precautions, they become joined together whilst healing.</p>
<p>There is besides a class of ulceration which the Greeks call κηρίον<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL304_158_a" id="target_note_LCL304_158_a"><sup>a</sup></a> from its resemblance to honeycomb, and of this there are two kinds.

If it is cut into, there appears much more corruption than in a boil, and it penetrates deeper. It is rare except in the scapular region. The other kind is found only in the head; it projects less above the surface, is hard, broad, greenish or greyishgreen in colour, more ulcerated; there are holes at the root of each hair, through which is discharged a glutinous greenish-white humour, in consistency like honey or mistletoe-juice, or at times like olive-oil. If it is cut into, the flesh within appears green. The pain also and inflammation are so severe that they generally cause acute fever. On a case which is only irritated by a few openings, suitable applications are a dry fig and linseed boiled in honey wine or plasters or emollients which draw out diseased matter, or the medicaments noted above for such purposes.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL304_158_b" id="target_note_LCL304_158_b"><sup>b</sup></a> For the other form of this, the same medicaments are good, also flour boiled in honey wine mixed with half its quantity of turpentine-resin;
