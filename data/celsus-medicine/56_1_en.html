in whom sleep aggravates pain, and one in whom, at the very beginning of a fresh disorder, black bile presents itself, whether below or above; or after his body has become attenuated by a long illness and weakened, when such bile gains exit either way. Expectoration of bile or pus, whether they come up separately or mixed, discloses a danger of death. And when either commences about the seventh day, the patient will most likely die about the fourteenth day, unless other signs, better or worse, supervene; and according as these subsequent signs are the slighter or the graver, so they denote a later or earlier death. In an acute fever a cold sweat is noxious,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL292_113_a" id="target_note_LCL292_113_a"><sup>a</sup></a> and so is a vomit in any malady when varied in composition and multicoloured, particularly so when malodorous.
