that the membrane is not clean, equal parts of its special medicament and of honey are to be mixed together and poured on, and to keep this in place one or two pads of lint must be put on, and over all linen upon which some of the medicament has been smeared. When the membrane is clean, a cerate to form flesh is to be added to the medicament and similarly applied.</p>
<p>As regards abstinence and the food and drink at first and later, the same course is to be adopted as I prescribed for wounds,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL336_516_a" id="target_note_LCL336_516_a"><sup>a</sup></a> and all the more because the danger is greater when this part is affected. And even when the time has come not only to sustain but also to build up the patient, still anything requiring mastication should be avoided; and also smoke and anything which provokes sneezing. But there is good hope when the membrane is movable and of normal colour, when the flesh growing up is a bright red, and when the jaw and neck move with ease. Bad signs are: the membrane immobile, black or livid or any other unwholesome colour; delirium, acrid vomiting, paralysis or spasm; livid flesh, rigor of jaw and neck. As for other signs—sleep, appetite, fever, colour of the pus—the indications as to recovery or death are the same as in the case of other wounds. When things are going well, flesh grows up from the membrane itself and from the bone as well if it is in two layers, so that the space between the bones becomes filled up; sometimes it even grows out above the skull. If this occurs copper scales are to be dusted on in order to repress and control it. Also applications to induce a scar must be laid on the flesh. And this is readily brought about everywhere except on the forehead a little above the eyebrows;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL336_518_a" id="target_note_LCL336_518_a"><sup>a</sup></a>
