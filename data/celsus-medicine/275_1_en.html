<p>The bandage too for binding up a wound is best made of linen, and it should be so wide as to cover in a single turn, not the wound alone but somewhat of its edges on either side. If the flesh has receded more from one edge, the traction is better made from that side. If equally from both, the bandage, put crosswise, should press the margins together; or if the character of the wound does not admit of that, the middle of the bandage is to be applied first, so that it may then be drawn to either side.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL304_88_a" id="target_note_LCL304_88_a"><sup>a</sup></a> Moreover, the wound is to be bandaged so that it is held together, yet not constricted.

In winter there should be more turns of the bandage, in summer just those necessary; finally, the end of the bandage is to be stitched by means of a needle to the deeper turns; for a knot hurts the wound, unless, indeed, it is at a distance from it.</p>
<p>On the following point no practitioner should be ignorant so that he has to enquire as to the special treatment required for the internal organs, which I have spoken of above.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL304_88_b" id="target_note_LCL304_88_b"><sup>b</sup></a> For whilst an external wound is to be treated either by suture, or by some sort of medicine; in the case of the internal organs, nothing is to be moved, unless it be to cut away some bit of liver or spleen or lung which hangs outside. Otherwise internal wounds will be cured by the regulation of diet, and by those medicaments which I have stated in the preceding book to suit each individual organ.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL304_88_c" id="target_note_LCL304_88_c"><sup>c</sup></a></p>
