which have been rubbed together are mixed by the aid of a liquid free from fat, such as wine or vinegar and the mixture is dried again, and when required for use, dissolved in a liquid of the same kind. Further, a plaster is laid on, a pastil is smeared on, or is mixed with something softer such as a cerate.</p>

There is, however, one kind which can cool, being suitable for hot podagras.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL304_16_a" id="target_note_LCL304_16_a"><sup>a</sup></a> It is a cupful of oak-galls, unripe or otherwise, coriander seed, hemlock, dried poppy-tears, and gum, of each 63 c.cm.; of washed cerate called by the Greeks πεπλύμένον<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL304_16_b" id="target_note_LCL304_16_b"><sup>b</sup></a> 168 grms.</p>
