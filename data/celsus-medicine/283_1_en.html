the place should be burnt by a cautery until no more humour escapes from it; for sound flesh is dry when it is burnt. After the cauterizing of a putrid wound, such drugs are to be applied as will loosen from the living flesh the crusts<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL304_104_a" id="target_note_LCL304_104_a"><sup>a</sup></a> which the Greeks call eschara.
