In order also that the eye to be treated may be held more still, wool is put over the opposite eye and bandaged on: further the left eye should be operated upon with the right hand, and the right eye with the left hand. Thereupon a needle is to be taken pointed enough to penetrate, yet not too fine; and this is to be inserted straight through the two outer tunics at a spot intermediate between the pupil of the eye and the angle adjacent to the temple, away from the middle of the cataract, in such a way that no vein is wounded.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL336_350_a" id="target_note_LCL336_350_a"><sup>a</sup></a> The needle should not be, however, entered timidly, for it passes into the empty space; and when this is reached even a man of moderate experience cannot be mistaken, for there is then no resistance to pressure. When the spot is reached, the needle is to be sloped against the suffusion itself and should gently rotate there and little by little guide it below the region of the pupil; when the cataract has passed below the pupil it is pressed upon more firmly in order that it may settle below.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL336_350_b" id="target_note_LCL336_350_b"><sup>b</sup></a> If it sticks there the cure is accomplished; if it returns to some extent, it is to be cut up with the same needle and separated into several pieces, which can be the more easily stowed away singly, and form smaller obstacles to vision.
