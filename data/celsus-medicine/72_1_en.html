disease, after pus has been expectorated, it is fatal for there to be an entire cessation of spitting. In the course of phthisis, even in adolescents, abscesses followed by fistulae<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL292_145_a" id="target_note_LCL292_145_a"><sup>a</sup></a> arise in the lung; and unless numerous signs of convalescence follow, they do not readily heal. But as regards others, the least easily cured are girls, or those women in whom suppression of menses has supervened upon the phthisis. When again in a man who has been healthy there arises suddenly pain in the head, next he is so overcome by sleep that he snores and cannot be awaked, he will die by the seventh day; the more so, if a loose motion has not preceded, if the eyelids of the sleeper are unclosed and the whites of the eyes show.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL292_145_b" id="target_note_LCL292_145_b"><sup>b</sup></a> And in these cases death follows except if the malady has been dispersed by fever.</p>
<p>Again dropsy, if caused by an acute disease, is seldom conducted to a cure, at any rate when signs supervene the reverse of those noted above.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL292_145_c" id="target_note_LCL292_145_c"><sup>c</sup></a> Likewise too in this disease a cough takes away hope as is also the case if there is an outburst of blood whether upwards or downwards and water fills the middle<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL292_145_d" id="target_note_LCL292_145_d"><sup>d</sup></a> of the body. In some also in this disease swellings arise, then subside, and again recur: such patients are in a somewhat safer state than those mentioned above, if they give attention; but generally they are undone by over-confidence in their health. Here we may wonder with good reason why there should be occurrences which cause our bodies harm, and yet at the same time in a measure are beneficial: for whether it is dropsical fluid which has filled a patient up, or whether it is a quantity of pus which has collected in a large abscess, evacuation all at once is as fatal to him, as if a healthy man loses blood by a wound.</p>
