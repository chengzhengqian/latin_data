wound there is to be applied, first a sponge squeezed out of vinegar; or out of wine if the patient cannot bear the strength of vinegar. A slight wound is even benefited if a sponge is applied wrung out of cold water. But in whatever way it is put on, it is only of service whilst moist; and so it must not be allowed to become dry. And a wound can be treated without foreign and far-fetched and complicated medicaments. But if any one has not confidence in this treatment, a medicament should be put on, which has no suet in its composition, chosen from those which I have stated to be suitable for bleeding wounds:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL304_86_a" id="target_note_LCL304_86_a"><sup>a</sup></a> and especially, if it is a flesh wound, the composition called barbarum;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL304_86_b" id="target_note_LCL304_86_b"><sup>b</sup></a> if a wound of sinews or of cartilage or of some projecting part, such as the ears or lips, the seal of Polyides:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL304_86_c" id="target_note_LCL304_86_c"><sup>c</sup></a> the green composition called Alexandrian<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL304_86_d" id="target_note_LCL304_86_d"><sup>d</sup></a> is also suitable for sinews; and that which the Greeks call rhaptousa<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL304_86_e" id="target_note_LCL304_86_e"><sup>e</sup></a> for parts which project. When the body is bruised it is usual also for the skin to be broken to a small extent. When this occurs, it is not improper to lay it open more widely with a scalpel, unless there are muscles and sinews near, as it is inexpedient to cut into these. When it has been sufficiently opened, a medicament is to be put on. But if the skin over the contusion, although broken too little, yet must not be laid open more widely on account of sinews or muscles, then such applications should be made as gently extract humour, especially that which I have said is called rhypodes.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL304_87_f" id="target_note_LCL304_87_f"><sup>f</sup></a> It is also not inappropriate, when the wound is severe, after putting on what is beneficial, to lay on over this, wool saturated with vinegar and oil; or a poultice,
