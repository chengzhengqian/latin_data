liable to injury owing to the thinness of the skin. But during the whole course of recovery the patient must avoid shouting or even straining the voice, noise, anger, violent bodily movements, smoke, dust, and anything that causes a cough or sneeze; it is not even advisable to hold the breath for long. But if a rib has been broken right across the case is more severe; for grave inflammations follow and fever and suppuration and often danger to life: and blood is expectorated. If therefore the strength allows, blood should be let from the arm on the side of the injury; if strength does not allow of this the trouble is, however, to be countered by a clyster that will not irritate, and by a low diet for a long while. Bread is not allowed before the seventh day, but only broth; and locally a cerate is to be applied made of linseed, to which boiled resin is added; or the poultice of Polyarchus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL336_532_a" id="target_note_LCL336_532_a"><sup>a</sup></a> or cloths soaked in wine, rose oil and olive oil; and over that soft undressed wool, then two bandages beginning from the middle and loosely bound on. But it is more important to avoid all the things mentioned above, so much so that even breathing should not be hurried. If cough is persistent, a draught of germander or rue or French lavender<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL336_533_b" id="target_note_LCL336_533_b"><sup>b</sup></a> or of cumin and pepper should be taken. But if more severe pain comes on a plaster of darnel or of barley meal is also to be applied, to which is added a third of a ripe fig; and this will lie upon the place by day; but at night, as the plaster may become displaced, use the same cerate or poultice or cloths as above. Therefore too the dressing must be taken off every day until we find the cerate or poultice sufficient.
