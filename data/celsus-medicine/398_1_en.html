a slight but persistent discharge of rheum from the eyes; and these generally occur in children. When the eyeball has been pressed with two fingers so as to render the skin of the upper eyelid tense, a transverse linear incision is to be made with a scalpel, with so light a touch that the cyst itself is not cut into; when the way is opened it protrudes of itself. It should then be seized with the fingers and taken out, for it comes away easily. One of the ointments, with which running eyes are anointed, is then smeared on, and in a very few days a fine scar is induced. There is more trouble when the cyst has been cut into, for it lets out a humour, and afterwards, because it is very thin, it cannot be laid hold of. Should this chance to happen, something to promote suppuration should be applied.</p>
<p>A very small tumour forms in the same upper eyelid, above the line of the eyelashes, which from its resemblance to a barleycorn<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL336_326_a" id="target_note_LCL336_326_a"><sup>a</sup></a> is termed by the Greeks <span class="italic">crithÃª</span>. Its contents are slow to come to a head and contained within a coat; it should be fomented with hot bread or with wax gently heated, but not so hot that it cannot easily be borne by that part; for under this treatment it is often dispersed, but at times it matures. When pus shows itself, it should be cut across with a scalpel and any humour inside squeezed out; then the eyelid is afterwards also to be fomented as above by steam,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL336_327_b" id="target_note_LCL336_327_b"><sup>b</sup></a> and ointment applied until it heals.</p>
<p>Other tumours also, not unlike these, form on the eyelids; but they are not quite the same shape and are mobile, so that they can be pushed about
