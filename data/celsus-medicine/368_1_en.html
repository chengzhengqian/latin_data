used is dissolved in honey or wine. But the same by itself is also good for fistulae. The ulceration at times even penetrates to fibrous tissues; there is a running discharge, then sanies, thin and foul, coloured or like water in which fresh meat has been soaked; and the place is painful and has a pricking sensation. This kind, although purulent, is none the less to be treated by bland applications, such as the tetrapharmacum plaster<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL304_274_a" id="target_note_LCL304_274_a"><sup>a</sup></a> dissolved in rose oil with the addition of a little frankincense; or the composition made of butter, rose oil, resin and honey noted by me above.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL304_274_b" id="target_note_LCL304_274_b"><sup>b</sup></a> In particular this ulcer should be fomented freely with hot water, and should be kept covered, not exposed to cold. Sometimes through such an ulceration the penis is so eaten away underneath the foreskin that the glans falls off; in which case the foreskin itself must be cut away all round. It is the rule, whenever the glans or any part of the penis has fallen off, or has been cut away, that the foreskin should not be preserved, lest it come into contact, and adhere to the ulceration, so that afterwards it cannot be drawn back, and further perhaps may choke the urethra. Again, little tumours, which the Greeks call phymata,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL304_274_c" id="target_note_LCL304_274_c"><sup>c</sup></a> spring up around the glans; they are burnt away by caustic or the cautery; when the crusts fall off, copper scales are dusted that no more may grow there.</p>
<p>The foregoing ulcerations stop short of canker,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL304_274_d" id="target_note_LCL304_274_d"><sup>d</sup></a> which in other parts, but here the more especially, attacks ulcerations. It begins in a black patch. If it invades the foreskin, at once a probe should be passed underneath, upon which the foreskin is to be incised and the margins seized with forceps; then
