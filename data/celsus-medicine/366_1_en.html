whether the foreskin will yield; if it does not give way, the foreskin is to be notched at its margin with a scalpel. For when sanies has flowed out this part will become thinner, and the foreskin the more easily drawn upon. But whether the foreskin is made to yield by this procedure, or whether it has at no time proved resistant, ulcerations will be found, either in the ulterior part of the foreskin, or in the glans, or behind this in the penis, and these ulcerations must of necessity be either clean or dry or moist and purulent. If they are dry, they must in the first place be fomented with hot water; then apply either buckthorn in wine, or olive lees in the same, or butter with rose oil. If there is a thin humour, the ulcerations should be bathed with wine, and then to butter and rose oil a little honey and a fourth part of turpentine resin is to be added and this dressing put on. But when pus runs from the ulcers, first they are to be bathed with hot honey wine; then there is put on: pepper 4 grms.; myrrh 0·66 grm.; saffron and boiled antimony sulphide 8 grms. each; these are heated in dry wine to the consistency of honey. Moreover, the same composition is suitable for the tonsils, a dripping uvula, and ulcerations of the mouth and nostrils. Another for the same purpose consists of pepper and myrrh 0·66 grm. each; saffron 1·33 grm.; cooked antimony sulphide 4 grms.; roasted copper 8 grms.; these are first pounded together in dry wine, then, when they are dry, are again pounded up in 125 c.cm. of raisin wine and heated to the consistency of birdlime.
