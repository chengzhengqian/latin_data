flatulent; nothing should be taken of those things which appear to collect the semen, such things are siligo, simila, eggs, spelt, starch, all glutinous flesh, pepper, colewort, bulbs, pine kernels. It is not inexpedient to bathe the lower extremities in a decoction of astringent vervains, to cover the hypogastrium
and groins with plasters prepared from the same decoction, and in particular from rue preserved in vinegar: also the patient should avoid sleeping on his back.</p>
<p><span class="bold">29.</span> It remains for me to come to the extremities of the body which are interconnected by joints. I begin with the hips. In these severe pain is wont to occur,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL292_453_a" id="target_note_LCL292_453_a"><sup>a</sup></a> and this often weakens the patient, and some it never leaves: and on this account it is a difficult class to treat, for it is generally after chronic diseases that a pestiferous force directs itself to the hip; which, as it releases other parts, seizes upon this, which now becomes the seat of the disease. The hip is to be first fomented with hot water, after which hot plasters are applied. Those which appear to be especially beneficial are these: caper bark chopped up and mixed either with barley meal or with fig decoction, or darnel meal boiled in diluted wine and mixed with sour wine lees: since these are apt to grow cold, by night it is better to put on emollients. Inula root also pounded and afterwards boiled in dry wine and applied widely over the hip is among the most efficacious of remedies. If these do not resolve the trouble, then hot moist salt<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL292_453_b" id="target_note_LCL292_453_b"><sup>b</sup></a> is to be employed. If even these measures do not end the pain, and a swelling supervenes, the skin is incised and cups are to be applied; diuretics are given; and the bowels if costive are to be clystered.
