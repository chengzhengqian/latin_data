This is produced sometimes by lightning stroke, sometimes by disease; the Greeks call this latter apoplexia. In these cases, blood is to be let, and either white hellebore (II. <span class="bold">13.</span> 2) or a clyster administered; then rubbings are applied, and food of the middle class given, and that the least fatty; also some which is acrid; there is to be abstinence from wine.</p>
