126 c.cm. of oil. But this soda is pounded up beforehand over a period of three days, water being added drop by drop, and then boiled in half a litre of water until all fluid has gone. This composition too can be applied to parotid swellings, phymata, scrofulous tumours, and to soften any collection of humour.</p>
<p>Some apply to joints with good effect part of a dried fig mixed with catmint; or black bryony berries without the seeds, with pennyroyal.</p>

But for this there is also Ariston’s emollient which consists of nard, cinnamon, casia, chameleon, angular rush, 32 grms. each, goat’s suet in liquid iris oil 80 grms., iris which should have been steeped in the sharpest vinegar for 20 days, 4 grms.: this emollient also disperses recent phymata and pain of all sorts.</p>
<p>But Theoxenus for pain in the feet mixed one part of kidney-suet with two parts of salt and applied a thin membrane smeared with these, then poured over it ammoniacum for fumigation dissolved in vinegar.</p>
<p>But Numenius used to soften podagra and all cases of indurated joints with an emollient consisting of southernwood, dried rose-leaves and poppy-tears, 12 grms. each, turpentine-resin 16 grms., frankincense and soda-scum, 32 grms. each, iris and aristolochia, 48 grms. each, wax 1 kilogram, to which is added of cedar-oil 42 c.cm., of laurel-oil 126 c.cm., of bitter olive-oil 500 c.cm.</p>
<p>If at any time callus has formed in joints, Dexius advised an application of lime 16 grms., white lead 32 grms., pine-resin 80 grms., 30 peppercorns, wax 56 grms. While these are being pounded together 250 c.cm. of mild wine is dropped in.</p>
