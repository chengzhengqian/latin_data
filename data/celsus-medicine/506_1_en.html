splints should all be bent opposite to a joint so as not to injure it, and they should not press more than is requisite to hold the fragments in place; and since after a while they become loose, every third day the straps keeping them in place are tightened; if there is no itching, or pain, they are kept on for two-thirds of the time which it takes for such a fractured bone to unite;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL336_542_a" id="target_note_LCL336_542_a"><sup>a</sup></a> after that the part is fomented lightly with hot water, for the diseased matter must be first dissolved, then extracted. For this reason there should also be gentle inunction with liquid cerate, and superficial rubbing; and the bandaging should be looser. Every third day this bandage is removed, and omitting the hot fomentations, the same treatment is carried out. except that at each change there is one bandage less.</p>
<p>The foregoing treatment is general, the following applies to particular fractures. If the upper arm<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL336_542_b" id="target_note_LCL336_542_b"><sup>b</sup></a> is fractured, extension is not made as in other limbs, but the patient is seated on a high stool, whilst the surgeon faces him on a lower one. One bandage about the patient’s neck is to serve as a sling to support the forearm; another is looped under the armpit<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL336_543_c" id="target_note_LCL336_543_c"><sup>c</sup></a> and is knotted over the head; a third surrounding the lower end of the humerus is carried down and has its ends tied together below. Then an assistant behind the patient stretches out his right forearm through the second loop, if it is the patient’s right humerus which is to be extended, his left if it is the left, and grasps a stick placed upright between the patient’s thighs. At the same time the surgeon puts his right foot in the third loop I have described, if the left arm is being
