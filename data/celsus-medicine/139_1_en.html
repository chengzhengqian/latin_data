to see if these when taken excite heat which prevents the shivering. Further in the same way as prescribed for a chill before shivering can come on, the patient should be covered up, and the whole body surrounded with foments—but the stronger ones are to be used at once<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL292_279_a" id="target_note_LCL292_279_a"><sup>a</sup></a>—and thoroughly encompassed by wraps which enclose hot tiles<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL292_279_b" id="target_note_LCL292_279_b"><sup>b</sup></a> and cinders.

Nor should it be stopped even if he shivers; for often the pertinacity of the rubber overcomes the body’s malady.

But if the shivering is too slow in subsiding, in addition to the above, a clyster should be given; for that also is of good effect by unloading the body.

If it is a daily fever, it is particularly important to abstain for the first three days, then to make use of food upon alternate days: if this fever has become inveterate, the bath and wine are to be tried at the end of the paroxysm, and especially so when the fever persists after the shivering has been removed.</p>
