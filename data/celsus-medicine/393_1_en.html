heals more easily because it can be dressed with a medicament at both ends. But if the missile is to be drawn back, the wound should be enlarged with a scalpel, for then the missile comes away more easily, also less inflammation is caused; for this becomes more severe if the missile itself lacerates the tissues while being withdrawn. So also when a counter opening is made, this ought to be too wide for the missile to fill as it is passing out. In either case, the greatest care should be taken that no vein,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL336_316_a" id="target_note_LCL336_316_a"><sup>a</sup></a> nor one of the larger sinews, nor an artery, is cut. When any one of these is observed, it is to be caught by a blunt hook and held away from the scalpel. When the incision has been made large enough, the missile is to be drawn out, proceeding in the same way, and taking the same care, lest that which is being extracted should injure one of those structures which I have said are to be protected.</p>
<p>The foregoing are general rules; there are some rules which apply to special missiles, and these I will at once set out. Nothing penetrates so easily into the body as an arrow, and it also becomes very deeply fixed. And this happens both because it is propelled with great force and because it is sharply pointed. Hence it is more often to be extracted through a counter opening than through the wound of entry, and especially so because it is generally furnished with barbs which lacerate more when drawn backwards than if pushed through a counter opening. When a passage out has been laid open, the flesh ought to be stretched apart by an instrument like a Greek letter;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL336_316_b" id="target_note_LCL336_316_b"><sup>b</sup></a> next when the point has come into view, if the shaft is still attached, it is to be pushed on until the point can be seized from
