patient should be clystered, the food diminished, and milk given as drink, in order to mollify the acrid matter which is doing harm. As regards poultices and medicaments, what has been prescribed for inflammation must be used. And here again the salve of Nileus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL304_204_a" id="target_note_LCL304_204_a"><sup>a</sup></a> is best: but when the carbuncle is on the outer surface of the eyelid, the most suitable poultice is one of linseed boiled in honeyed wine, or, if that is not at hand, flour boiled in the same.</p>
<p>Pustules are also an occasional consequence of inflammation. If this happens early during the first stage, the blood-letting and rest prescribed above should be even more strictly enforced; if later than the stage when blood-letting is possible, the bowels, nevertheless, should be clystered; and if anything should prevent this also, at any rate the regimen as to diet should be followed. For this condition also soothing medicaments are necessary, such as those of Nileus and Cleon.</p>
<p>Also the salve<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL304_204_b" id="target_note_LCL304_204_b"><sup>b</sup></a> named after Philalethus is suitable, consisting of: myrrh and poppy-tears 4 grms. each; washed lead, Samian earth called aster,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL304_204_c" id="target_note_LCL304_204_c"><sup>c</sup></a> and traga-canth 16 grms. each; boiled antimony sulphide and starch 24 grms. each; washed oxide of zinc and washed cerussa 32 grms. each. These are made up with rain-water. The salve is used either with white of egg or milk.</p>
<p>From pustules ulcerations sometimes arise. These when recent are likewise to be treated by mild applications, generally by the same as I have prescribed above for pustules.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL304_204_d" id="target_note_LCL304_204_d"><sup>d</sup></a> That which is called ‘dia libanu’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL304_204_e" id="target_note_LCL304_204_e"><sup>e</sup></a> is specially prepared for the above condition. It is composed of roasted and washed copper, and parched poppy-tears 4 grms.
