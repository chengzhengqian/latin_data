sulphide and oak-galls, if they are mixed in equal proportions, corrode flesh. We may either sprinkle this mixture on dry or take it up in cadmian<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL304_50_a" id="target_note_LCL304_50_a"><sup>a</sup></a> ointment and smear it on.</p>
<p>Honey mixed with lentils or with horehound or with olive leaves previously boiled in wine holds in check putrid flesh, prevents its further spread, and is a mild corrosive. The same is the action of melilot, boiled in honey wine, then pounded up; or lime with cerate; or bitter almonds with garlic in the proportion of three to one, with the addition of a little saffron. Or the composition containing litharge 24 grms., burnt ox-horn 48 grms., myrtle-oil and wine, 125 c.cm. of each. Or that mixture which consists of pomegranate flowers, blacking and lign-aloes, 8 grms. each, split alum and frankincense 16 grms., oak-galls 32 grms., aristolochia 40 grms. Stronger as a corrosive is that compounded by calcining orpiment with copper ore, and with either soda or lime or burnt papyrus; salt with vinegar is similar. Or that composition which contains copper ore, pomegranate heads, lign-aloes, 8 grms. each, split alum and frankincense, 16 grms. each, oak-galls 32 grms., aristolochia 40 grms., with sufficient honey to combine them. An alternative is the composition containing cantharides 4 grms., sulphur 4 grms., darnel 12 grms., to which is added enough liquid pitch to combine them. Or also that composed of copper ore mixed with resin and rue; or slag similarly with resin; or black bryony berries with liquid pitch. The same property too belongs both to burnt wine-lees and lime and soda, equal parts, or to split alum, 1Â·33 grms., frankincense, sandarach and soda, 4 grms. each, oak-galls 32 grms., aristolochia 40 grms., and as much honey as is required.</p>
