But if the patient has no relief even in the morning, it becomes all the worse time for food, just because, although by itself that time should be better, owing to the fault of the disease it is not so; and at the same time, it is followed by midday, after which generally patients become worse, and so it may be feared that the patient may become more distressed than usual. To such a patient, therefore, others give food in the evening: but since at that time those who are ill are generally at their worst, there is fear that any action we may then take may exasperate the fever somewhat. For these reasons I delay until midnight, that is, when one critical time is over, and the next the furthest off, whilst the hours which follow before dawn are those during which all patients generally sleep the most; after that comes early morning, naturally a period of greatest relief. If, however, fevers are erratic, since there is apprehension that paroxysms may immediately follow food, whenever a patient begins to have relief after a paroxysm, then food ought to be taken. But if several paroxysms occur on the same day, it should be noted whether they are equal in all respects, which can scarcely ever be the case, or unequal. If they are equal in all respects, food should be given rather after any paroxysm which does not desist between midday and evening. If they are unequal, it is to be considered in what way they differ; for if one is more severe and another slighter, food should be given after the more severe; if one lasts longer, another a shorter time, after the longer; if one is more severe, another more prolonged, it is to be observed which of the
