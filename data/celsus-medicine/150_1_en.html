rather put forward; entertainment sought by storytelling, and by games, especially by those with which the patient was wont to be attracted when sane; work of his, if there is any, should be praised, and set out before his eyes; his depression should be gently reproved as being without cause; he should have it pointed out to him now and again how in the very things which trouble him there may be cause of rejoicing rather than of solicitude. When there is fever besides, it is to be treated like other fevers.</p>
<p>The third kind of insanity is of all the most prolonged whilst it does not shorten life, for usually the patient is robust. Now of this sort there are two species: some are duped not by their mind, but by phantoms, such as the poets say Ajax<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL292_301_a" id="target_note_LCL292_301_a"><sup>a</sup></a> saw when mad or Orestes;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL292_301_b" id="target_note_LCL292_301_b"><sup>b</sup></a> some become foolish in spirit.</p>

Therefore even if one dose of the hellebore has little effect, after an interval another should be given. It should be known that a madmanâ€™s illness is less serious when accompanied by laughter than by gravity. This also is an invariable precept in all disease, that when a patient is to be purged downwards, his belly is to be loosened beforehand, but confined when he is to be purged upwards.</p>
