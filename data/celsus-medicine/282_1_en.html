Then when the blood has been let out and the wound made like a new one, the same treatment is to be adopted as that described for recent wounds. If anyone does not want to use the scalpel, healing may be secured by using the plaster made up with ladanum,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL304_102_a" id="target_note_LCL304_102_a"><sup>a</sup></a> and, when that has eaten away the ulcer, by the one which induces a scar.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL304_103_b" id="target_note_LCL304_103_b"><sup>b</sup></a></p>

Whatever is put on is to be covered over with beet leaves, and over that with lint wetted with cold water. If refrigerants by themselves have little effect, they are to be combined with the following: sulphur 4 grms., white-lead and saffron, 50 grms. each; and these are pounded up with wine and the place smeared with them: or when the skin is more hardened, nightshade leaves are pounded, mixed with lard, and applied spread on lint.</p>
<p>But if there is a blackening which is not yet spreading, the milder corrosives of putrid flesh are to be put on, and the wound having been thus cleaned out, is cared for like other wounds.
