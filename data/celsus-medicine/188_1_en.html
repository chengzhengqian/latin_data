gravity. There is, however, no disease more distressing, and more acute, than that which by a sort of rigor of the sinews, now draws down the head to the shoulder-blades, now the chin to the chest, now stretches out the neck straight and immobile. The Greeks call the first opisthotonus, the next emprosthotonus,
and the last tetanus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL292_377_aa" id="target_note_LCL292_377_aa"><sup>a</sup></a> although some with less exactitude use these terms indiscriminately. These diseases are often fatal within four<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL292_377_b" id="target_note_LCL292_377_b"><sup>b</sup></a> days. If the patients survive this period, they are no longer in danger. They are all treated by the same method and this is agreed upon, but Asclepiades in particular believed in blood-letting, which some said should be particularly avoided, because the body was then especially in need of that heat which was in the blood. But this is false; for it is not in the nature of the blood to be especially hot, but of all that composes man, the blood<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL292_377_c" id="target_note_LCL292_377_c"><sup>c</sup></a> most quickly turns, now hot, now cold. Still, whether or no it ought to be let, can be learnt from the instructions concerning blood-letting (<span class="bold">II. 10, 11</span>). But anyhow it is right to give castory, and with it pepper or laser; further, a warm and moist fomentation is needed. For this purpose most pour hot water freely at intervals over the neck. This affords temporary relief, but renders the sinews more susceptible to cold, a thing certainly

This disease continued unchanged and uncontrolled by treatment until the discovery that it is caused by special bacilli, and that it is a chronic disease in old horses. Active spores pass out in the manure to infect roads and the soil of gardens and fields and to enter any open blood-vessel. The relative re-sistance of the horse gives rise to an antitoxin in the animal’s serum, which being used as a vaccine immediately following upon inoculation, arrests the progress of the infection.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL292_377_aa').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL292_377_b"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL292_377_b" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">b</sup>The disease usually shows itself by stiffness of the jaw, more rarely by stiffness near the infected spot; in the last stages tetanic spasms bend the patient so that he rests on the back of his head and his heels, Opisthotonos; or he is doubled up forwards, his chin to his chest, Emprosthotonos.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL292_377_b').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL292_377_c"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL292_377_c" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">c</sup>Hipp. <span class="italic">De Corde</span> 12 (Littré, IX. 92).</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL292_377_c').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
