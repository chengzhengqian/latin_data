Here also it must be seen to that no blood remains in the scrotum.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL336_406_a" id="target_note_LCL336_406_a"><sup>a</sup></a> Then agglutinants are put on.

Should inflammation increase, to the previously mentioned applications add a plaster of lentils and honey or of pomegranate rind boiled in dry wine, or of the two combined.
