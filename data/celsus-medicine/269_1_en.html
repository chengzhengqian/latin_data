<p>When the bladder has been wounded, the groins are painful; the hypogastrium becomes tense; blood is passed, instead of urine, the urine being discharged from the actual wound. The gullet is affected, and so the patients either vomit bile or hiccough. Coldness and after that death follows.</p>
<p>Even when these facts are known, there are still some other things to be learnt about wounds and ulcerations in general, of which we will now speak. From wounds, then, there comes out blood, or sanies, or pus. Blood everybody knows; sanies is thinner than blood, varying both in thickness and stickiness and colour. Pus is the thickest and whitest, more sticky than either sanies or blood. Now blood comes out from a fresh wound or from one which is already healing, sanies between these two periods, pus from an ulceration already beginning to heal. Again, the Greeks distinguish by name different kinds of sanies and pus. For there is a kind of sanies which is named either hidros<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL304_76_a" id="target_note_LCL304_76_a"><sup>a</sup></a> or melitera;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL304_76_b" id="target_note_LCL304_76_b"><sup>b</sup></a> there is pus which is called elaeodes.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL304_76_c" id="target_note_LCL304_76_c"><sup>c</sup></a> Hidros is thin, whitish, and comes from a bad ulceration, especially when inflammation has followed upon a wound of a sinew. Melitera is thicker, stickier and whitish, something like honey. It is likewise discharged from bad ulcerations, when sinews near to joints have been wounded, and among such places especially from the knees. Elaeodes is thin, whitish, fatty, in colour and fattiness not unlike white olive-oil; it appears
