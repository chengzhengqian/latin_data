needle is drawn straight out; and soft wool soaked in white of egg is to be put on, and above this something to check inflammation; and then bandages. Subsequently the patient must have rest, abstinence, and inunction with soothing medicaments; the day following will be soon enough for food, which at first should be liquid to avoid the use of the jaws; then, when the inflammation is over, such as has been prescribed for wounds,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL336_352_a" id="target_note_LCL336_352_a"><sup>a</sup></a> and in addition to these directions it is necessary that water should for some time be the only drink.</p>
