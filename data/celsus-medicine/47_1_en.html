adolescents enjoy the best health in spring, and are safest in early summer; old people are at their best during summer and the beginning of autumn; young and middle-aged adults in winter. Winter is worst for the aged, summer for young adults. At these periods should any indisposition arise, it is very probable that infants and children still of tender age should suffer from the creeping ulcerations of the mouth which the Greeks call aphthas,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL292_95_a" id="target_note_LCL292_95_a"><sup>a</sup></a> vomiting, insomnia, discharges from the ear, and inflammations about the navel.
