I do not name the kind of fluid to be added, I would have water to be understood.</p>
<p>For the same purpose there is the salve of Euelpides, which he called memigmenon,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL304_210_a" id="target_note_LCL304_210_a"><sup>a</sup></a> containing poppy-tears and white peppercorns 28 grms. each; gum 336 grms.; roasted copper 6 grms. However, in the course of the treatment, after a subsidence of the disease, the bath and wine are of some service. In all cases of ophthalmia food that makes thin should be avoided, but especially in those who have had for long a discharge of thin humour. But if food which renders the rheum thicker comes to be disliked, which very readily happens with this kind of diet, recourse should be had to those foods which, in bracing up the bowels, do the same to the body in general.</p>
<p>Again, ulcerations which do not heal after inflammation has ended, tend to become fungous or foul or excavated, or at any rate chronic. Such as are fungous are best repressed by the salve called memigmenon; those which are foul are cleaned both by the same and by that called zmilion.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL304_210_b" id="target_note_LCL304_210_b"><sup>b</sup></a> This contains: verdigris 16 grms.; gum the same; ammoniacum and Sinopic minium 64 grms.; some pound up these with water, others with vinegar, in order to make it more active.</p>
<p>The salve of Euelpides also which he called pyrron<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL304_211_c" id="target_note_LCL304_211_c"><sup>c</sup></a> is of use for this: saffron 4 grms.; poppy-tears and gum 8 grms.; roasted and washed copper and myrrh 16 grms. each; white pepper 24 grms. But the eyes are first smeared with a mild ointment, then with the above.</p>
