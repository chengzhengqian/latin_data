If the disorder is of longer standing the proper thing is to swallow a bit of the best laser the size of a peppercorn, to drink wine and water on alternate days, between meals at times to sip a cupful of wine; to administer a clyster of tepid rain-water, especially if pain persists in the lower bowel.</p>

Diocles of Carystus named the disease of the small intestines chordapsos, of the large eileos. I note that by many the former is now termed eileos, the latter colicos.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL292_427_a" id="target_note_LCL292_427_a"><sup>a</sup></a> The former excites pain, at times above, at times below the navel.

If the upper part is affected, food, if the lower, faeces is returned by the mouth, if either happens the disease is chronic. Additional signs of danger are if the vomit is bilious, malodorous, either varying in colour or black.
