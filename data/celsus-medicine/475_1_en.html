There are some in whom the four last, which generally come through late, do not make their appearance. Of these teeth the front ones are fixed by single roots, the molars at least by two, sometimes even by three or four; and generally the longer root produces the shorter teeth; the straight tooth has a straight root; a crooked tooth a crooked root. From the same root in children a new tooth grows which generally pushes out the former one, but sometimes shows itself behind or in front of it.</p>
<p>Now the spine is the support of the head. It is composed of twenty-four vertebrae, seven in the neck, twelve belonging to the ribs; the remaining five are below the ribs. The vertebrae are bones rounded off and short; from each side they thrust out a transverse process; they are perforated in the middle where the spinal marrow which is connected with the brain passes downwards, and at the sides also through the two transverse processes they are traversed by fine channels, through which little membranes pass down resembling the cerebral membrane; with the exception of the three highest all the vertebrae have slight depressions in their articular processes on the upper side, on the lower side other articular processes grow downwards. The highest vertebra<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL336_480_b" id="target_note_LCL336_480_b"><sup>b</sup></a> is therefore the immediate support of the head, receiving its small processes into two depressions, and this enables the head to move up and down. The second vertebra<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL336_480_c" id="target_note_LCL336_480_c"><sup>c</sup></a> is made irregular by a protuberance and is attached to the lower side of the one above. To secure the rotation of the head the top of it ends in a narrower round process, so that the first vertebra
