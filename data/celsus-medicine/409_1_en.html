membrane which comes over it from the interior. In front of these is a drop of humour like white of egg, from which comes the faculty of seeing; it is named by the Greeks crystalloides.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL336_348_a" id="target_note_LCL336_348_a"><sup>a</sup></a></p>
<p>Now either from disease or from a blow, a humour forms underneath the two tunics in what I have stated to be an empty space;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL336_348_b" id="target_note_LCL336_348_b"><sup>b</sup></a> and this as it gradually hardens is an obstacle to the visual power within. And there are several species of this lesion; some curable, some which do not admit of treatment. For there is hope if the cataract is small, and immobile, if it has also the colour of sea water or of glistening steel, and if at the side there persists some sensation to a flash of light. If large, if the black part of the eye has lost its natural configuration and is changed to another form, if the colour of the suffusion is sky blue or golden, if it shakes and moves this way and that, then it is scarcely ever to be remedied. Generally too the case is worse when the cataract has arisen from a severe disease, from severe pains<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL336_349_c" id="target_note_LCL336_349_c"><sup>c</sup></a> in the head or from a blow of a violent kind. Old age is not favourable for treatment, since apart from this lesion, sharpness of vision is naturally dulled; neither is childhood favourable, but rather intermediate ages. Neither a small nor a sunken eye is satisfactory for treatment. And in the cataract itself, there is a certain development. Therefore we must wait until it is no longer fluid, but appears to have coalesced to some sort of hardness. Before
