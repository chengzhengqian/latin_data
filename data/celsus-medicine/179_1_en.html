part. Now the foregoing are joined together. The kidneys on the other hand are different; they adhere to the loins above the hips, being concave on one surface, on the other convex; they are both vascular, have ventricles,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL292_359_a" id="target_note_LCL292_359_a"><sup>a</sup></a> and are covered by coats.</p>
<p>These then are the situations of the viscera. Now the gullet, which is the commencement of the intestines, is sinewy; beginning at the seventh spinal vertebra, it makes a junction in the region of the praecordia with the stomach. And the stomach, which is the receptacle of the food, consists of two coats; and it is placed between the spleen and liver, both overlapping it a little. There are also fine membranes by which these three are interconnected, and they are joined to that partition, which I have described above as transverse.</p>
<p>Thence the lowest part of the stomach, after being directed a little to the right, is narrowed into the top of the intestine. This juncture the Greeks call pylorus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL292_359_b" id="target_note_LCL292_359_b"><sup>b</sup></a> because, like a gateway, it lets through into the parts below whatever we are to excrete.</p>
<p>From this point begins the fasting intestine, not so much infolded; it has this name because it does not hold what it has received, but forthwith passes it on into the parts below.</p>
<p>Beyond is the thinner intestine, infolded into many loops, its several coils too being connected with the more internal parts by fine membranes;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL292_359_c" id="target_note_LCL292_359_c"><sup>c</sup></a> these coils are directed rather to the right side, to end in the region of the right hip; however, they occupy mostly the upper parts.</p>
<p>After that spot this intestine makes a junction crosswise with another, the thicker intestine; which, beginning on the right side, is long and pervious
