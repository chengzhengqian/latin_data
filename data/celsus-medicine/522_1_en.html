extension by two hands, at times aided by straps, is sufficient; then some round object is to be put in front of the biceps<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL336_574_a" id="target_note_LCL336_574_a"><sup>a</sup></a> and the ulna suddenly flexed over it towards the upper arm. But in other forms of displacement, it is best to stretch the forearm as described above for fracture of the elbow<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL336_574_b" id="target_note_LCL336_574_b"><sup>b</sup></a> and then to replace the bones. The rest of the treatment is the same as in all other cases; only the dressing must be taken off more quickly and more often and there must be more plentiful fomentations with hot water, and more prolonged rubbing with oil, nitre and salt. For whether the elbow remains out of place or is put back again, callus forms more quickly round it than round any other joint, and if this callus has grown through resting the joint it prevents flexion afterwards.</p>
<p>17. The hand<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL336_574_ca" id="target_note_LCL336_574_ca"><sup>c</sup></a> also may be dislocated in all four directions. If it has slipped out backwards, the fingers cannot be stretched out; if forwards, they do not bend; if to either side, the hand is turned in the opposite direction [either towards the thumb or towards the little finger]. It can be replaced without difficulty. The hand, supported on a hard and resistant object, must be stretched one way, the forearm the other, in such a way that the hand is palm downwards if the bone has slipped out backwards, palm upwards if forwards; if the displacement is inwards or outwards, upon the side. When the sinews are sufficiently stretched, the surgeonâ€™s hands push back the bone, in the opposite direction to the side to which it has slipped. Where
