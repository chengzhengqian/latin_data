<p>But that one which is pervious being widespread and winding, and less sinewy<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL292_361_a" id="target_note_LCL292_361_a"><sup>a</sup></a> than the upper intestines, has a flexure<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL292_361_b" id="target_note_LCL292_361_b"><sup>b</sup></a> on both sides, right and left, especially on the left side and in the lower parts and touches the liver and stomach, next it is joined to some fine membranes coming from the left kidney, and thence bending backwards and to the right, it is directed straight downwards to the place where it excretes; and so it is there named the straight intestine.</p>
<p>The omentum too, which overlies all these, is at its lower part smooth and compact, softer at its upper part; fat also is produced in it, which like the brain and marrow is without feeling.</p>
<p>Again from the kidneys, two veins, white in colour, lead to the bladder; the Greeks call them ureters, because they believe that through them the urine descending drops into the bladder.</p>
<p>Now the bladder, sinewy and in two layers at its bag, is at its neck bulky and fleshy; it is connected by blood-vessels with the intestine, and with that bone which underlies the pubes. The bladder itself is loose and rather free, and situated differently in men and women: for in men it is close to the straight intestine, being inclined rather to the left<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL292_361_c" id="target_note_LCL292_361_c"><sup>c</sup></a> side; in women it is situated over the genitals, and whilst free above, is supported actually by the womb.</p>
