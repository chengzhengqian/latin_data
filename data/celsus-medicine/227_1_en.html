The ultimate measure and the most efficacious in cases of old standing, is to set up issues in three or four places over the hip by burning the skin with cauteries. But rubbing is also to be employed, particularly in the sun and often each day, in order that the materials of the disease, which have been doing harm by collecting, may be the more readily dispersed; and the rubbing is applied actually over the hips in the absence of ulceration; if there is any, then to other parts.
