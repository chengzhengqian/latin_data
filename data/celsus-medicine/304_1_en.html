And &lt;it is more favourable&gt; when it does not become harder on a sudden, and although it does not redden, nevertheless changes somewhat in colour. Such are the signs which arise when pus is already forming; the swelling and redness begin long before. But if the place is soft, the gathering of the diseased matter is to be diverted by poultices which are at the same time repressant and cooling; such as I have mentioned elsewhere, and just above under erysipelas:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL304_146_a" id="target_note_LCL304_146_a"><sup>a</sup></a> if it has become already hard, recourse must be had to poultices for dispersing and resolving; such as a dried and crushed fig, or wine-lees mixed with cerate, made up with hog’s lard, or cucumber-root to which has been added twice the quantity of flour, previously boiled in honey wine. Again, we may mix equal part by weight of ammoniacum, galbanum, propolis, mistletoe-juice, and of myrrh half as much by weight as of the other ingredients. And the plasters and emollients which I have described above<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL304_146_b" id="target_note_LCL304_146_b"><sup>b</sup></a> have the same effect. A swelling which has not been dispersed by such measures must needs mature; that it may do so more quickly, barley-meal should be put on boiled in water &lt;with which also some herb&gt; should be mixed. The same applications are appropriate also for the smaller abscesses, the names and peculiarities of which I have referred to above; treatment is the same for all, only differing in degree.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL304_147_c" id="target_note_LCL304_147_c"><sup>c</sup></a></p>
<p>Now a swelling is immature when the blood-vessels throb more as if they were bubbling and there is weight and heat and tension and pain and redness and hardening and, if the abscess is larger, shivering or even persistent feverishness; and a
