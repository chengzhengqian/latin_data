forwards, backwards, inwards, outwards, some in all directions, some in certain only. And there are some signs which are common to all, some special to each: there is always a swelling in the part into which the bone has ruptured, and a hollow whence the bone has receded. These signs are found in all, but others only in some cases; these I will describe when speaking of each separately. But while it is possible for all joints to slip out, yet not all can be replaced. For the head is never forced back into position,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL336_560_a" id="target_note_LCL336_560_a"><sup>a</sup></a> nor is a spinal vertebra, nor a jawbone which has been dislocated forwards on both sides, and has become inflamed before it has been replaced. Again, any joints which have slipped owing to a lesion of their sinews, even when forced back into position slip out again. Also when joints have been dislocated in childhood, and have not been replaced, there is less growth than elsewhere.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL336_560_b" id="target_note_LCL336_560_b"><sup>b</sup></a> The flesh of all which are out of place wastes, and in the near more than in the distant part of the limb; for instance, if the upper arm-bone is not in its place, the wasting is more there than in the forearm, more in the forearm than in the hand. Again, according to the site and character of the accidents, more or less use of the limb is retained; and the more use is retained, the less does it waste. Now every dislocation ought to be replaced before there is inflammation; but if this has set in already, the limb is not to be disturbed until after it subsides: only when it has ended should replacement be attempted in the limbs which allow of it. But for this much depends upon the general constitution of the patient and his sinews. For if his body is slender, and humid, if sinews are weak, the bone is readily replaced; but
