<p>19. Among the plasters none render greater service than those for immediate application to bleeding wounds, which the Greeks call enhaema.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL304_32_a" id="target_note_LCL304_32_a"><sup>a</sup></a> For these repress inflammation, unless a severe cause excites it, and even then they lessen its attack; further, they agglutinate wounds which allow of it, and induce a scar in them. But as the plasters consist of medicaments which are not greasy, they are named alipe.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL304_32_b" id="target_note_LCL304_32_b"><sup>b</sup></a></p>
<p>The best of these is the plaster called barbarum.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL304_32_c" id="target_note_LCL304_32_c"><sup>c</sup></a> It contains scraped verdigris 48 grms., litharge 80 grms., alum, dried pitch, dried pine-resin, 4 grms. each, to which is added oil and vinegar 250 c.cm. each.</p>
<p>Another one called Coacon,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL304_33_d" id="target_note_LCL304_33_d"><sup>d</sup></a> used for the same purpose, consists of litharge 400 grms., dried resin the same, but the litharge should be first boiled in three-quarters of a litre of oil. In these two plasters the colour is black, which is the colour generally produced by the pitch-resin, but the blackest is from bitumen, green from verdigris or copper scales, red from minium, white from white-lead.</p>
<p>There are very few compositions in which diversity of ingredients makes any change.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL304_33_e" id="target_note_LCL304_33_e"><sup>e</sup></a> Hence that plaster which is called basilicon is also black. It consists of all-heal 4 grms., galbanum 8 grms., pitch and resin, 40 grms. each, oil 20 c.cm.</p>
<p>But, because it is bright green, a plaster is called emerald-like which contains pine-resin 12 grms., wax 4 grms., verdigris 168 grms., frankincense soot 56 grms., oil the same, and vinegar enough to combine into one the soot and verdigris.</p>
