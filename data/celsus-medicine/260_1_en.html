round rush, aspalathus and balsam wood, 112 grms. each, suet 4 grms., iris ointment 42 c.cm.</p>
<p>Another called euodes is prepared as follows: wax 84 grms., oil the same quantity, and turpentine-resin, the size of a walnut, are boiled together, then pounded in a mortar, and into this is gradually dropped 63 c.cm. of the best honey, and then iris ointment and rose-oil, 125 c.cm. of each.</p>
<p>Now enchrista is the Greek name for liquid applications.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL304_58_a" id="target_note_LCL304_58_a"><sup>a</sup></a> Of these one is used for cleaning and filling up ulcers, especially those about sinews. It is composed of a mixture of equal parts of butter, calf’s marrow, calf’s suet, goose-fat, wax, honey, turpentine-resin, rose-oil and castor-oil. These are all liquefied separately, then the liquids are mixed and stirred up together. And the above is more for cleaning up wounds; it is more of an emollient if instead of the rose-oil, cyprus-oil is poured in.</p>
<p>And for ignis sacer<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL304_58_b" id="target_note_LCL304_58_b"><sup>b</sup></a> take litharge 24 grms., burnt ox-horn 48 grms., are rubbed up together, adding by turns wine, especially that which is called sil,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL304_59_c" id="target_note_LCL304_59_c"><sup>c</sup></a> and myrtle-oil until 125 c.cm. of each is mixed in.</p>
<p>25. Pills are also numerous, and are made for various purposes. Those which relieve pain through sleep are called anodynes; unless there is over-whelming necessity, it is improper to use them; for they are composed of medicaments which are very active and alien to the stomach. There is one, however, which actually promotes digestion; it is composed of poppy-tears and galbanum, 4 grms. each, myrrh, castory, and pepper, 8 grms. each. Of this it is enough to swallow an amount the size of a vetch.</p>
