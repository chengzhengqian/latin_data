for dim vision and previously for thinning<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL304_222_a" id="target_note_LCL304_222_a"><sup>a</sup></a> scars. If anyone finds his eyes becoming dim he must walk and exercise a great deal; also bathe frequently, and in the bath he is to be rubbed all over, especially, however, on his head, with iris unguent, until he sweats; and he should then be wrapped up, and not uncover, until after reaching home the sweating and heat have passed off. Then he should take acrid foods which will make him thin and some days afterwards gargle with mustard.</p>
<p>Cataract<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL304_222_b" id="target_note_LCL304_222_b"><sup>b</sup></a> also, which the Greeks call hypochysis, sometimes interferes with the vision of the eye. When it has become long established it is to be treated surgically. In its earliest stages it may be dispersed occasionally by certain measures: it is useful to let blood from the forehead or nostrils, to cauterize the temporal blood vessels, to bring out phlegm by gargling, to inhale smoke, to anoint the eyes with acrid medicaments. That regimen is best which makes phlegm thin.</p>
<p>Again, even the relaxation of the eyes which the Greeks call paralysis<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL304_223_c" id="target_note_LCL304_223_c"><sup>c</sup></a> is not to be treated by any different regimen or by any different medicaments. It is sufficient to explain just the kind of lesion it is. It happens then sometimes in the case of one eye, sometimes of both, from some blow, or from epilepsy, or from a spasm, by which the eyeball itself is violently shaken, that it cannot be directed at any object, or be held at all steady, but with no reason it turns now this way, now that, and so does not even afford a view of objects.</p>
