Pain in the lung again, when not terminated by expectoration or by blood-letting, or by regulation of the diet, may excite some abscesses<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL292_131_aa" id="target_note_LCL292_131_aa"><sup>a</sup></a> in it about the twentieth, thirtieth, fortieth, occasionally sixtieth day.
