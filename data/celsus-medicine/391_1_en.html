make one. Meanwhile the patient can do his business, walk, bathe, and take food as if in the best of health. Only this thread is to be moved twice a day, but without undoing the knot, the part of the thread outside being drawn within the fistula, and the thread must not be left until it becomes foul, but every third day the knot is to be undone, and to one end that of another fresh thread is tied, and the old thread being withdrawn the new one is to be left in the fistula after being similarly knotted. For thus the thread cuts through the skin overlying the fistula slowly, and whilst the skin released from the thread undergoes healing, that which is still gripped is being cut through. This method of treatment is lengthy but causes no pain. Those in a hurry should constrict the skin with the thread, so that they may cut through more quickly; and at night they should insert into the fistula some fine pledglets of wool, in order that its overlying skin, being put on the stretch, may be thinned out; but these measures cause pain. More speed may be added, but more pain as well, if both the thread and the pledglets are smeared with some one of the medicaments, which I have noted for the eating away of callus.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL336_312_a" id="target_note_LCL336_312_a"><sup>a</sup></a> Even here, however, the knife must be used, if the fistula extends inwards, or is multiple. In these kinds of fistulae, therefore, when the probe has been inserted, the skin is to be cut through along two lines so that between them a very fine strip of skin may be taken out, in order that the margins may not unite at once, and that there may be room for the smallest possible quantity of lint to be inserted; all the rest is done in the way described for abscesses.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL336_312_b" id="target_note_LCL336_312_b"><sup>b</sup></a> If, however, from one
