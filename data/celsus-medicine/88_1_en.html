relaxes; if much, it diminishes, if moderate, fills out.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL292_177_a" id="target_note_LCL292_177_a"><sup>a</sup></a> It follows, therefore, that in the following cases rubbing should be employed, when either a feeble body has to be toned up, or one indurated has to be softened, or a harmful superfluity is to be dispersed, or a thin and infirm body has to be nourished. Yet when examined with attention (although this no longer concerns the medical man) the various species of rubbing may be easily recognized as all dependent on causing one thing, depletion. For an object is toned up when that is removed, which, by its presence was the cause of the laxness; and is softened when that which has been producing induration is abstracted; and it is filled up, not by the rubbing itself, but by the nutriment, which subsequently penetrates by some sort of dispersal to the very skin itself after it has become relaxed.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL292_177_b" id="target_note_LCL292_177_b"><sup>b</sup></a> The cause of the different results lies in the degree.</p>
<p>Now there is a great difference between anointing and rubbing. For it is desirable that even in acute and recent diseases the body should be anointed and then gently stroked, but only during remissions and before food. But prolonged rubbing is unsuitable in acute and increasing diseases, unless it be in madness to procure sleep. Yet a prolonged illness and one declining from its primary vehemence loves this aid. I am quite aware that some say that the need for any aid is during the increase of diseases, not when diseases are tending to end of themselves. But this is not the case. For a disorder, even although it will end of itself, may be expelled yet more speedily by adopting the aid. An aid is necessary on two accounts, both that health may be regained at the earliest possible
