<p>11. So much for the discussion of fractured bones. Turning to dislocations,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL336_558_aa" id="target_note_LCL336_558_aa"><sup>a</sup></a> these are of two kinds: for at times bones which are conjoined gape asunder, as when the shoulder-bone recedes from the clavicle, and, in the forearm, the radius from the ulna, or in the leg the tibia from the fibula; sometimes [after a jump] the heel-bone from the ankle, though this is rare; at times joints slip out of position. I will speak of the former first.</p>
<p>Now when anything of this sort happens, there is a depression at once on the spot, and when the finger is put into this a gap is felt; after this severe inflammation arises, particularly at the ankle; indeed this is often a cause of fevers also and gangrene and spasms of the sinews or rigors, which bend back the head to the shoulder-blade.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL336_559_b" id="target_note_LCL336_559_b"><sup>b</sup></a> To avoid these things the same is to be done as was laid down for bone injuries in general,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL336_559_c" id="target_note_LCL336_559_c"><sup>c</sup></a> so that pain and swelling may be thereby relieved. For bones so separated never again unite, and even if the appearance of the limb is somewhat impaired its usefulness is not.</p>
<p>Since all joints, including the jawbone and vertebrae, are held in place by strong sinews, they are displaced either by force or after some accident which has ruptured or weakened the sinews, and this occurs more readily in boys and youths, than in the more robust. And these joints slip out
