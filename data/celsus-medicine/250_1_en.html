40 grms., soda, wax, dried pitch, laurel-berries, 80 grms. each, with a little oil. But whenever I mention a berry or nut or the like, it should be understood that the outer husk is to be removed before weighing.</p>
<p>Another of the same name which also promotes suppuration, contains calf-suet, ammoniacum for fumigation, pitch, wax, soda, laurel-berries, dried resin, aristolochia and pellitory, equal parts.</p>
<p>There is also that of Philocrates, which consists of ammoniac salt 28 grms., aristolochia 32 grms., wax, turpentine resin, frankincense soot, 60 grms. each, litharge 128 grms., to which is added, in order to promote suppuration, iris 16 grms., and galbanum 24 grms.</p>
<p>The best as an extractive, however, is that called by the Greeks rhypodes, from its resemblance to dirt. It contains myrrh, crocus, iris, propolis, bdellium, pomegranate heads, alum both split and round, antimony sulphide, copper ore, boiled blacking, all-heal, ammoniacum salt, mistletoe juice, 16 grms. each, aristolochia 32 grms., copper scales 56 grms., turpentine resin 300 grms., wax and ox or he-goat’s suet, 400 grms. each.</p>
<p>The plaster invented by Hecataeus is of the same class, and is composed of galbanum 8 grms., frankincense soot 16 grms., pitch 24 grms., wax and turpentine-resin, 32 grms. each, with which is mixed a little iris ointment.</p>
<p>Efficacious for the same purpose is the green Alexandrian plaster. It consists of split alum 32 grms., ammoniac salt 32·66 grms., copper scales 64 grms., myrrh and frankincense 72 grms., wax 600 grms., Colophon or pine resin 800 grms., oil 250 c.cm., vinegar half a litre.</p>
