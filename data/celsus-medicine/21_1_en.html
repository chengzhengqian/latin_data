<p><span class="bold">1.</span> A <span class="sc">man</span> in health, who is both vigorous and his own master, should be under no obligatory rules, and have no need, either for a medical attendant, or for a rubber and anointer.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL292_43_a" id="target_note_LCL292_43_a"><sup>a</sup></a> His kind of life should afford him variety; he should be now in the country, now in town, and more often about the farm; he should sail, hunt, rest sometimes, but more often take exercise; for whilst inaction<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL292_43_b" id="target_note_LCL292_43_b"><sup>b</sup></a> weakens the body, work strengthens it; the former brings on premature old age, the latter prolongs youth.</p>
<p>It is well also at times to go to the bath, at times to make use of cold waters;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL292_43_c" id="target_note_LCL292_43_c"><sup>c</sup></a> to undergo sometimes inunction, sometimes to neglect that same; to avoid no kind of food in common use; to attend at times a banquet, at times to hold aloof; to eat more than sufficient at one time, at another no more; to take food twice rather than once a day, and always as much as one wants provided one digests it. But whilst exercise and food of this sort are necessaries, those of the athletes are redundant; for in the one class any break in the routine of exercise, owing to necessities of civil life, affects the body injuriously, and in the other, bodies thus fed up in their fashion age very quickly and become infirm.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL292_43_d" id="target_note_LCL292_43_d"><sup>d</sup></a></p>
<p>Concubitus indeed is neither to be desired overmuch, nor overmuch to be feared; seldom used it
