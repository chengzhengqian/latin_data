<p>There is also one, almost red in colour, which is found to bring wounds rapidly to a scar. It contains incense 4 grms., resin 8 grms., copper scales 16 grms., litharge 80 grms., wax 400 grms, oil 250 c.cm.</p>
<p>As well, there is one called rhaptousa,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL304_34_a" id="target_note_LCL304_34_a"><sup>a</sup></a> because it agglutinates, consisting of bitumen and split alum 16 grms., litharge 160 grms., and 250 c.cm. of old oil.</p>
<p>There are also some plasters of the same class, called by the Greeks cephalica, because they are especially suitable for broken heads. That of Philotas<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL304_34_b" id="target_note_LCL304_34_b"><sup>b</sup></a> has the following composition: Eretrian earth and chalcitis, 16 grms. each, myrrh and calcined copper 40 grms. each, isinglass 24 grms. [each], scraped verdigris, round alum, crude antimony sulphide and aristolochia, 32 grms. each, copper scales 40 grms., male frankincense 8 grms., wax 336 grms., rose-oil and bitter olive-oil, 125 c.cm. each, and sufficient vinegar to rub up the ingredients while keeping them dry.</p>
<p>A green plaster for the same purpose consists of calcined copper, copper scales, myrrh and isinglass 24 grms. each, crude antimony sulphide, scraped verdigris, aristolochia and round alum, 32 grms. each, wax 4 grms., oil 250 c.cm., and as much vinegar as is required.</p>
<p>But for promoting suppuration there is nothing better than the plaster called by the Greeks tetrapharmacon, which acts very quickly. It contains wax, pitch, resin and bullâ€™s suet, or, if that is not at hand, veal-suet, in equal proportions.</p>
<p>Another for the same purpose is named enneapharmacum, which is more for cleaning wounds. It has nine ingredients: wax, honey, suet, resin, myrrh.
