with shears after it has mortified and there is no other safe way of removing it, no precedent can be drawn from that for this case. As to the treatment of the wound when the omentum has been replaced, it should be stitched; if the quantity was large, and has been left outside to mortify, the margins should be pared as described above.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL336_414_a" id="target_note_LCL336_414_a"><sup>a</sup></a></p>

Then flour which has been steeped in cold water is put on and over this the bandage I have described as suitable after anal operations.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL336_414_d" id="target_note_LCL336_414_d"><sup>d</sup></a> On the third day lentil meal with honey is applied: after the crusts have separated the ulcers are to be cleaned with honey, filled with rose oil, and cicatrized with dry lint.
