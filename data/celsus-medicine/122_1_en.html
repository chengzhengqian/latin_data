tertian is to be apprehended; and when the time for such a paroxysm has passed, food is to be given, but in small amount, because a quartan may yet be apprehended; and not until the fourth day, if the body is still free, may it be used with confidence. But if on the second, or third, or fourth day fever has recurred, the disease can be recognized. But tertian and quartan fever in which there is both a definite cycle ending in freedom from fever, and ample periods of quiet, are more quickly dealt with, and of these I will speak in their proper place (III. <span class="bold">14, 15</span>). Now, however, I will explain the treatment of those fevers which cause trouble every day. Food, therefore, is more suitably given to the patient upon alternate days, in order one day to diminish the fever, the other to recruit his strength. But if it be that sort of quotidian fever in which there is a complete intermission, food should be given immediately upon the body becoming fever-free: if, although there are no paroxysms, the fever is nevertheless continuous and daily increasing, but with remissions that are not complete, food should be given when the system is in that state that no major remission is expected; if the paroxysm on one day is more severe, on the next day milder, food is to be given after the more severe paroxysm.

But if the fever continues without ever becoming milder, and it is necessary to give food, there is a great controversy as to the time when it should be given. Some, because patients generally have more of a remission early in the morning, think that food should be given then. But if this answers, the
