<p>There is another similar one which consists of copper scales and frankincense soot, each 16 grms., galbanum 24 grms., ammoniac salt 48·66 grms., wax 100 grms., olive-oil 750 c.cm. These plasters, however, may be also usefully applied to more recent wounds.</p>
<p>There are also soothing white plasters, called by the Greeks leuca, fitted in general for wounds which are not severe, especially in old people. Such is that containing white-lead 128 grms., prepared calf’s suet, and wax, each 192 grms., olive-oil 750 c.cm., with which the white-lead is boiled.</p>
<p>Another consists of white-lead 80 grms., wax 140 grms., olive-oil 250 c.cm., water half a litre. Whenever these liquids are added to white lead or litharge, it is understood that those drugs are to be boiled up in the liquids. But the above composition being of a glistening white appearance is called ivory plaster.</p>
<p>There are also some soothing plasters, commonly called liparae<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL304_43_a" id="target_note_LCL304_43_a"><sup>a</sup></a> by the Greeks, such as that containing minium 16 grms., litharge 100 grms., wax and lard, each 148 grms., with the yolk of 4 eggs.</p>
<p>Another composition of the same sort contains wax and turpentine-resin, each 24 grms., white-lead 32 grms., litharge and lead-slag, called by the Greeks σκωρία μολύβδου, each 80 grms., castor-oil and myrtle-oil, each 250 c.cm.</p>
<p>A third, said to have been invented by Archagathus, contains boiled antimony sulphide and calcined copper, each 16 grms., boiled white-lead 32 grms., turpentine-resin 40 grms., litharge 24 grms.</p>
