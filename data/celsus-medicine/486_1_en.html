When the outer table has been removed, and the inner table left, it is not only the margins but also all the bone<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL336_502_a" id="target_note_LCL336_502_a"><sup>a</sup></a> which is to be smoothed down, in order that skin may grow over it subsequently without harm; for when it grows over rough bone there is never sound healing, but it causes new pains. What is to be done when the brain is exposed, I will describe when I come to fractures.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL336_502_b" id="target_note_LCL336_502_b"><sup>b</sup></a> If some of the inner table has been preserved, medicaments which are not greasy, such as are fitted for recent wounds, are to be applied, and over that, unscoured wool soaked in oil and vinegar. In course of time flesh grows up from the bone and fills up the hollow made by the surgery. Also if any bone has been cauterized it separates from the healthy part, and between the sound and dead bone granulations form to throw off what has separated; and this is usually a thin and small splinter, which the Greeks call a scale.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL336_502_c" id="target_note_LCL336_502_c"><sup>c</sup></a></p>
<p>It may possibly even happen as the result of an injury, that bone, although neither fissured nor fractured, yet has its surface indented and roughened; when this happens scraping and smoothing suffice. These conditions, although mostly occurring in the head, are found also in the other bones, so that whenever the same thing happens the same procedure is to be followed. But for bones which are fractured, fissured, perforated or crushed, some special treatment is required, suited for particular cases, and some general measures which apply to the majority; of these I will proceed to treat, beginning with the said cranium.</p>
