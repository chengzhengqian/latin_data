is forced up into the wound; then the thumb and forefinger of the right hand separate the vein, the artery and cord, and their tunic<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL336_412_a" id="target_note_LCL336_412_a"><sup>a</sup></a> from the one above them. Any little membranes in the way are divided with a scalpel until now the entire tunic comes into view. After cutting away what has to be excised, and replacing the testicle, a rather broad strip is to be pared off from the edges of the wound in the groin, so that by making the wound broader it may form more flesh.</p>
<p>21. But if omentum comes down, the groin is to be cut into as described above, and the tunics<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL336_412_b" id="target_note_LCL336_412_b"><sup>b</sup></a> drawn down. Then it must be considered whether the mass is rather large or only small. For when quite small the omentum may be pushed back beyond the groin into the abdominal cavity, either with the finger, or with the opposite end of a probe; if the mass is larger what has prolapsed from the belly should be left hanging out of the wound, and smeared with caustic medicaments until it mortifies and falls off. In this condition too some transfix the tumour with a doubly threaded needle, and tie the two ends of each thread on opposite sides, under which treatment it mortifies, but more slowly. This may, however, be hastened by smearing the omentum beyond the ligature with medicaments which eat it away but do not erode; the Greeks call them septa.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL336_412_ca" id="target_note_LCL336_412_ca"><sup>c</sup></a> Some have cut away the omentum with shears. If it is quite small, this is unnecessary; if larger, bleeding may follow, because the omentum itself is connected with blood vessels, some rather large. And although in the case of an abdominal wound, prolapsed omentum is cut away
