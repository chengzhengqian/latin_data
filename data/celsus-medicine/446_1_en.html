very painful, for once the margin has been freed, it can be stripped up by hand as far back as the pubes, nor in so doing is there any bleeding. The prepuce thus freed is again stretched forwards beyond the glans; next cold water affusions are freely used, and a plaster<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL336_422_a" id="target_note_LCL336_422_a"><sup>a</sup></a> is applied round to repress severe inflammation. And for the following days the patient is to fast until nearly overcome by hunger lest satiety excite that part. When the inflammation has ceased, the penis should be bandaged from the pubes to the corona; over the glans the plaster is applied with the other end of the probe. This is done in order that the lower part<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL336_422_b" id="target_note_LCL336_422_b"><sup>b</sup></a> may agglutinate, whilst the upper part<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL336_422_c" id="target_note_LCL336_422_c"><sup>c</sup></a> heals without adhering.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if the glans has become so covered that it cannot be bared, a lesion which the Greeks call phimosis,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL336_422_d" id="target_note_LCL336_422_d"><sup>d</sup></a> it must be opened out, which is done as follows: underneath the foreskin is to be divided from its free margin in a straight line back as far as the frenum, and thus the skin above is relaxed and can be retracted. But if this is not successful, either on account of constriction or of hardness of the skin, a triangular piece of the foreskin is cut out from underneath, having its apex at the frenum, and its base at the edge of the prepuce. Then lint dressing and other medicaments to induce healing are put on. But it is necessary that the patient should lie up until the wound heals, for walking rubs the wound and makes it foul.</p>
<p>Some have been accustomed to pin up the prepuce in adolescents either for the sake of the voice, or for healthâ€™s sake. This is the method: the foreskin covering the glans is stretched forwards and
