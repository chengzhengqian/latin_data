towards the intact bone. Then if there are any detached fragments which can be easily removed, they are to be seized with forceps made for the purpose and particularly the pointed fragments which are irritating the membrane. If this cannot be done easily, the plate which I have suggested as a guard of this membrane is to be passed underneath<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL336_514_a" id="target_note_LCL336_514_a"><sup>a</sup></a> in order that all pointed fragments which project inwards may be cut away over the plate, and any depressed bone is to be raised by means of the same plate. This method of treatment ensures that fragments still attached become consolidated; and detached fragments come away in course of time under the dressing without any pain; and by that treatment there is left a gap in the skull large enough for the extraction of matter; and the brain is better protected by leaving the bone than if it had been excised. After this, that membrane should be sprinkled with strong vinegar, in order that any bleeding from it may be checked, or any collection of clot which remains inside may be broken up. Then the same plaster, softened as described above, should be put on the membrane itself; and the rest of the dressing as before, ointment on lint, and unscoured wool; the patient should be kept in a warm room; the wound dressed daily, even twice a day in summer.</p>
<p>But if the membrane<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL336_514_b" id="target_note_LCL336_514_b"><sup>b</sup></a> swells up through inflammation, it is to be bathed with tepid rose oil; if it swells so as to project even above the level of the skull, well-ground lentils or crushed vine leaves, mixed either with fresh butter or goose-grease, will control it; and the neck should be anointed with liquid cerate containing iris oil. But if it shall appear
