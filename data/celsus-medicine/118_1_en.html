when it was needed by the body, showed sufficiently that food should not be given while the strength was in excess, but that care should be taken not to let it become deficient. Hence it can be understood that it is not possible for many patients to be cared for by one practitioner, and provided that he is skilled in the art, he is a suitable one who does not much absent himself from the patient. But they who are slaves to gain, since more is to be got out of a crowd, are glad to adopt those precepts which do not exact a sedulous attendance, as in this very instance. For even those who see the patient but seldom find it easy to count days or paroxysms; a physician must be always at hand, if he is to see the one thing that matters, the point when the patient is about to become too weak unless he gets food. The fourth day, however, is generally the most suitable date for beginning to give food.</p>
<p>But there is another uncertainty which concerns even the days themselves, since the ancients chiefly preferred the odd days and termed them critical,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL292_237_aa" id="target_note_LCL292_237_aa"><sup>a</sup></a> as though then the fate of the sick man was decided. These were the third, fifth, seventh, ninth, eleventh, fourteenth and twenty-first days, the most importance being attached to the seventh, next to the fourteenth and then to the twenty-first. Therefore they administered food to their patients as follows: they awaited paroxysms on odd days, and after that they gave food, as though slighter paroxysms were impending, insomuch that Hippocrates, when the fever desisted on any other than an odd day, was accustomed to fear a recurrence. Asclepiades has justly repudiated this as false, and he said that no day was more or less dangerous

predominance of numbers in the rhythm of life and of Nature and of the heavens, as exemplified in the doctrine of the Sevens.<span class="linebreak"></span>
The doctrine of Crisis and of Critical days constituted an early attempt to coordinate medical opinion on the course of periodic fevers in malarial countries. We now explain that the origin of the doctrine was related to the cycles in the life-history
of the malarial parasites. Benign tertian fever is set up by the Plasmodium vivax, which has a cycle of 48 hours and which occasions a recurrence of the fever every third day; quartan fever is due to the Plasmodium malariae, with a cycle of 72 hours, the fever recurring every fourth day; subtertian fever in hot countries is an infection by Plasmodium
falciforme with a cycle of 48 hours; besides there are a variety of permutations, whether owing to a repetition of inoculation by the same parasite, or to a mixed infection, fourth series would begin with 10 instead of the important 11. In order to avoid this he started a new series beginning with 11 (11, 12, 13, 14). However, Celsus points out that even so no rational system can be arrived at, and that the attempt to connect the Pythagorean numbers, especially 7 and 11, with the course of fevers is absurd. etc. Thus two generations of the tertian parasite, maturing on succeeding days, produce a quotidian fever; two generations of the quartan parasite cause a fever on two successive days, with one day of freedom from fever.<span class="linebreak"></span>
Celsus argues against the theory of critical days by quoting irreconcilable statements in the <span class="italic">Aphorisms</span> (cf. Hipp. IV. 112, 144, 150, 154, <span class="italic">Aphorisms</span> II. 23, IV. 36, IV. 61, and IV. 71. See also II. 42, Prog. 20).<span class="linebreak"></span>
Hippocrates had used an ancient system of counting a continued series which repeated the last figure at the beginning of the next (1, 2, 3, 4—4, 5, 6, 7—7, 8, 9, 10); but this resulted in some series beginning with even numbers; the</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL292_237_aa').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
