the bones must be examined again, and if the fractured ends are not in place, they are reset; after which the bandaging should not be dispensed with until two-thirds of the time has elapsed which such bones take to unite.

The reason is that the bone has no independent movement, but moves with the shoulder, while the part attached to the breast is immovable; therefore while this remains stationary, the shoulder-fragment is displaced below it by the movement of the shoulder. But so seldom does the clavicle<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL336_527_b" id="target_note_LCL336_527_b"><sup>b</sup></a> incline forwards that great teachers have recorded that they have
