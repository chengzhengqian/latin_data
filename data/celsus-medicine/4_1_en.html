one which heals diseases, as it is the most difficult, is also the most famous, we must speak about it first. And because there is a primary difference of opinion, some holding that the sole knowledge necessary is derived from experience, others propounding that practice is not efficient enough except after acquiring a reasoned knowledge of human bodies and of nature, I must indicate which are the principal statements on either side, so that I may the more easily interpose my own opinion also.</p>
<p>They, then, who profess a reasoned theory of medicine propound as requisites, first, a knowledge of hidden causes involving diseases, next, of evident causes, after these of natural actions also, and lastly of the internal parts.</p>
<p>They term hidden, the causes concerning which inquiry is made into the principles composing our bodies, what makes for and what against health. For they believe it impossible for one who is ignorant of the origin of diseases to learn how to treat them suitably. They say that it does not admit of doubt that there is need for differences in treatment, if, as certain of the professors of philosophy have stated, some excess, or some deficiency, among the four elements,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL292_9_a" id="target_note_LCL292_9_a"><sup>a</sup></a> creates adverse health; or, if all the fault is in the humours,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL292_9_b" id="target_note_LCL292_9_b"><sup>b</sup></a> as was the view of Herophilus; or in the breath, according to Hippocrates; or if blood is transfused into those blood-vessels which are fitted for pneuma,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL292_9_c" id="target_note_LCL292_9_c"><sup>c</sup></a> and excites inflammation
