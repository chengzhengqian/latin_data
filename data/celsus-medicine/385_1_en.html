third day until every indication of inflammation has gone. It may be, however, that the cupping has no effect; for at times, although seldom, it happens that the abscess is enclosed in a covering of its own, which the ancients named a coat. Meges, because every such coat is sinew-like, said that no sinew could be produced under a lesion by which flesh is eaten away; but that when pus has been there for a long time, a callus forms round it. This has no bearing upon the mode of treatment, for the same thing ought to be done, whether it be a coat, or a callus. There is nothing to prevent a callus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL336_300_a" id="target_note_LCL336_300_a"><sup>a</sup></a> being called a coat, since it covers. Moreover at times the coat has formed after the pus has become more matured; so that what is under it cannot be drawn out by cupping. But this is readily recognized when the application of a cup causes no change. Therefore when that happens, or there is already hardening, there is no help from cupping, but as I have said elsewhere<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL336_300_b" id="target_note_LCL336_300_b"><sup>b</sup></a> it is whilst matter is collecting that it has to be diverted or dispersed, or else matured. In the two former contingencies no further treatment is needed. When pus has matured, if in the armpits or groins it will not often have to be cut into. The same is true when the abscess is of moderate extent, so also when it is in the skin, or even in the flesh, unless the patientâ€™s weakness forces us to hurry; it is sufficient to poultice in order to make the pus come out of its own accord. For the place which has not felt the knife may generally escape without a scar. But if the abscess is more deeply seated, we must consider whether the part has sinews or not. For if it is free from sinews, it should be laid open with a red-hot cautery-knife;
