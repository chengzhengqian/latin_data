seem very remarkableâ€”a fistula which forms over the liver, spleen, or stomach, is safer than one right over the intestine, not because a fistula there is more harmful, but because it opens the way to another danger.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL336_310_a" id="target_note_LCL336_310_a"><sup>a</sup></a> Some writers who have had experience of this have shown little perception of the true facts. For often the abdomen is actually penetrated by a weapon, and prolapsed intestines are replaced, and sutures bring the margins of the wound together and how this is done I will presently point out.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL336_310_b" id="target_note_LCL336_310_b"><sup>b</sup></a> Therefore also when a fine fistula breaks through the abdominal wall, it is possible to cut it out, and to join its margins by suture. But if such a fistula widens out inside, its excision necessarily leaves a wide gap which cannot be sutured without applying great force especially in the deeper part where the abdomen is enclosed by a kind of membrane which the Greeks call peritoneum.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL336_310_c" id="target_note_LCL336_310_c"><sup>c</sup></a> Therefore, when the patient begins to get up and move about, the sutures break, and intestines prolapse; which causes his death. But these cases are not altogether desperate, and so for the finer fistulae, treatment is to be adopted.</p>
<p>Special consideration is required in the case of those in the anus.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL336_310_d" id="target_note_LCL336_310_d"><sup>d</sup></a> In these, where a probe has been passed up to its end, the skin should be cut through, next through this new orifice the probe is to be drawn out, followed by a linen thread which has been passed through the eye made for the purpose in the other end of the probe. Then the two ends of the linen thread are taken and knotted together so as to grip loosely the skin overlying the fistula. The linen thread should be made up of two or three strands of raw flax, twisted up so as to
