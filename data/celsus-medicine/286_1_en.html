My next task is to speak of those which are caused by the bite, at times of a man, at times of an ape, often of a dog, not infrequently of wild animals or of snakes. For almost every bite has in it poison of some sort. Therefore if the wound is severe, a cup should be applied straightway over it; if slighter a plaster, especially that of Diogenes.

Salt is also a remedy for bites, especially dog-bite, if a hand is then placed over the bite and struck by two
