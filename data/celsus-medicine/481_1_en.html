heel-bone is without marrow, is hard, and projects somewhat backwards where it presents a rounded outline. The other bones of the feet are constructed in a similar way to the bones of the hand; the sole corresponds to the palm, digits to digits, nails to nails.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL336_492_a" id="target_note_LCL336_492_a"><sup>a</sup></a></p>

<p>A diseased bone generally first becomes fatty, next either blackened or rotten; and this occurs in cases of severe ulceration or fistula, when these have become chronic or even gangrenous. And it is necessary in the first place to expose the diseased bone by cutting out the ulcer, and if the bone disease extends beyond the margins of the ulcer to cut away the flesh until sound bone is exposed all round. Then if the diseased bone appears merely fatty, it is enough to apply a cautery once or twice until a scale of bone comes away; or to scrape it away until there is bleeding, which is a sign of sound bone; for diseased bone is necessarily dry. The same is also to be done for diseased cartilage: it too must be scraped away with a scalpel until what remains is sound. Then, whether bone or cartilage has been scraped, finely powdered soda must be dusted on; and nothing different is to be done when the surface of the bone is black or carious, except that the treatment by cautery or scraping must be continued for a longer time. In these cases if the surgeon scrapes he should press boldly upon the instrument that he may effect more and finish sooner. The end is when white or hard bone is reached. White bone instead of black or hard
