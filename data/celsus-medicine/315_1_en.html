of sulphur 1·16 grm., wax 4·65 grms., liquid pitch 250 c.cm., oil one litre; these are heated together until they are of the consistency of honey.

Also a suitable mixture is saffron, lycium, verdigris, myrrh, and charcoal in equal proportions boiled in raisin wine; this checks everywhere all discharge of phlegm. And when there is nothing else at hand, lees of olive-oil boiled down to one-third, or sulphur mixed with liquid pitch, as I have suggested for cattle<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL304_168_b" id="target_note_LCL304_168_b"><sup>b</sup></a> is also of service for men suffering from scabies.</p>

But it is distinguished from scabies because there is more ulceration and there are pustules like pimples, and in it is seen an appearance as of small bubbles from which after a time little scales are detached; and this recurs at fixed seasons. The second kind is worse, almost like a pimple, but rougher and redder; it has various shapes; small scales are detached from the skin surface; there is more erosion; it spreads more rapidly and widely, and both comes and goes at fixed seasons even more markedly than the previous sort; it is called <span class="italic">rubrica.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL304_169_d" id="target_note_LCL304_169_d"><sup>d</sup></a></span> The third kind is worse still: for it is thicker, harder and there is more swelling; there are cracks in the skin and more active erosion.
