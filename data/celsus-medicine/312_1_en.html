and they scarcely ever exceed the size of a lupin. These also grow either on the palms or soles of the feet. The clavus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL304_162_a" id="target_note_LCL304_162_a"><sup>a</sup></a> again, though occasionally found elsewhere, occurs mostly on the feet, and especially after contusions, although sometimes from other causes; it causes pain when walking, though not at other times.</p>
<p>Of these the acrochordon and thymion often end of themselves, and the more so the smaller they are. The myrmecia and corns scarcely ever subside without treatment. The acrochordon, if cut off, leaves no trace of a root behind, and so does not sprout again. When the thymion and clavus have been cut off, a small rounded root is formed underneath, which penetrates right down into the flesh, and if this is left behind it sprouts up again. The myrmecia are held by very broad roots, and so cannot be excised without causing a large wound. A corn is best scraped down from time to time; for thus, without any violence, it softens, and if also a little blood is let out, it often dies away. It is also removed if we clean the part round it and then put on resin mixed with a little powdered millstone. All the other varieties are to be burnt away by medicaments: for some the ash of wine-lees is best; for myrmecia the application made of alum and sandarach. But the skin all round should be covered with leaves that it also may not become ulcerated; afterwards lentil meal is put on. Even a fig in boiled water removes a thymium.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL304_162_b" id="target_note_LCL304_162_b"><sup>b</sup></a></p>
<p>Pustules arise chiefly in the spring; there are many kinds. For at times a sort of roughness comes all over the body, or a part of it, resembling the pustules which are set up by nettles or by sweating; exanthemata<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL304_162_c" id="target_note_LCL304_162_c"><sup>c</sup></a> the Greeks call them.
