pain, and never during the rise of a fever, but only during its remissions. But there are many sorts of rocking, and they are to be regulated both by the patient’s strength and by his resources, lest either a weak patient undergo overmuch depletion, or a poor man come short. The gentlest rocking is that on board ship either in harbour or in a river, more severe is that aboard ship on the high seas, or in a litter,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL292_183_a" id="target_note_LCL292_183_a"><sup>a</sup></a> even severer still in a carriage: but each of these can either be intensified or mitigated. Failing any of the above, the bed should be so slung<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL292_183_b" id="target_note_LCL292_183_b"><sup>b</sup></a> as to be swayed; if not even that, at any rate a rocker<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL292_183_c" id="target_note_LCL292_183_c"><sup>c</sup></a> should be put under its foot so that the bed may be moved from side to side by hand.</p>
<p>And this sort of exercise of the lighter kinds suits the infirm, the stronger kinds again those who have already become free from fever for several days, or those who, whilst feeling the commencement of grave disorders, as yet are free from fever (which happens in the case both of phthisis and of stomach disease, and of dropsy, also, at times, of jaundice), or when certain diseases such as epilepsy and madness persist without fever, for however long. In which affections also those kinds of exercises are necessary, which we have included in the passage where we prescribed what healthy, yet not strong, men should carry out.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL292_183_d" id="target_note_LCL292_183_d"><sup>d</sup></a></p>

The beginnings of diseases require at first hunger and thirst, the actual diseases then moderation, so that nothing but what is expedient, and not too much of that, may be consumed; for it is not at all proper to have surfeit at once after a fast.
