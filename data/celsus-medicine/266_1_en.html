<p>The above wounds are severer or slighter according to their situations. Still, whenever it is large, a wound makes for danger.</p>
<p>The class of wound and its shape are also important. For a contused wound is worse than one simply incised, hence it is better to be wounded by a sharp weapon than by a blunt one. A wound is worse also if a piece is cut out, or if the flesh is cut away in one part and hanging free in another.

And the most opportune time for healing is the spring, or at any rate when the weather is neither cold nor hot, for wounds are harmed by excessive heat and excessive cold, but most of all by variations of these; hence autumn is the most pernicious season.</p>
<p>Now most wounds are open to view; some are inferred from their situation,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL304_70_a" id="target_note_LCL304_70_a"><sup>a</sup></a> which we have pointed out elsewhere when indicating the positions of the internal parts. Since, however, some of these wounds are near at hand, and it is of importance whether the wound is superficial or has penetrated inwards,
