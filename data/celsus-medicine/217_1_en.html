If for several days other remedies have done no good, and the disease is now of long standing, drinking of very cold water acts as an astringent upon the ulcerations and starts recovery. But as soon as the movement of the bowels is under control, there should forthwith be a return to warm drinks. Sometimes also there is discharged a putrid sanies having a foul odour, sometimes unmixed blood escapes. If the former occurs, a hydromel clyster should be given, and then the other things mentioned above injected. [An effective remedy even for intestinal canker is a lump of minium rubbed up with 250 grms. of salt, dissolved in water, and administered as a clyster.] But if there is a flux of blood, food and drink should be astringent.</p>

Nevertheless, care should be taken lest with all these remedies there be an opposite trouble
