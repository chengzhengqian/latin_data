<p>Now suppurations<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL292_351_a" id="target_note_LCL292_351_a"><sup>a</sup></a> which arise in some interior part, when they become noticeable, first should be acted upon by those poultices which repress, lest there is produced a harmful collection of the material of disease; next if these remedies are unsuccessful, the suppurations may be dissipated by dispersive poultices. If we are not successful in that, it follows that the suppuration should be drawn outwards, next that it should mature. The ending of every abscess is to rupture; the indication is pus discharged either from the bowels or mouth. But nothing ought to be done to diminish the discharge of the pus. Broth and hot water are chiefly to be given. When pus ceases to be discharged, then there should be a transition to digestible yet nutritious food consumed cold, also cold water for drink, commencing, however, with lukewarm. To begin with, things such as pine kernels, or almonds, or hazel nuts, may be eaten along with honey; afterwards these make way for whatever can make the scar form earlier. At this stage as a medicament for the ulceration there is to be taken either leek or horehound juice, and whatever the food, leeks should be added. Rubbing is required also for parts unaffected, so also gentle walks; to be avoided are wrestling and running and other things tending to irritate healing ulcerations, for in this malady the vomiting of blood is most pernicious and to be guarded against in every way.</p>
