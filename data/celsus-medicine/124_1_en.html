two causes most distress, the former by its severity, or the latter by its length, and food must be given after the one which causes most distress. But what matters almost more than anything is, how long and of what kind are the remissions between them: for if after one paroxysm shivering persists, after another the body is free from this, the more suitable time for food is when the body is free. If a slight feverishness persists all the time, but a longer period of remission occurs at one time than at another, that is the time to be selected; so that, when paroxysms are continuous, straightway, when the first one has begun to pass off, food may be given. For it is the general rule<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL292_249_a" id="target_note_LCL292_249_a"><sup>a</sup></a> to which every plan of treatment should be directed, to give food always as long as possible before the next ensuing paroxysm, and while keeping this rule, to give the food when the body is most free from fever. This should be observed not merely with two paroxysms but also with several. But although it is most proper to give food on alternate days, yet if the system is weak, it should be given every day; and far more so if the fevers continue without remissions, inasmuch as they distress the patient more; or when two or more paroxysms occur on the same day. This occurrence renders it necessary that immediately from the first day, food must be administered daily if the pulse has immediately become weak, and several times on the same day, if in the course of several paroxysms there is progressive diminution of the bodily strength. However, in these cases we must keep to this rule, that less food is to be given after paroxysms of such a kind that no food at all would be given after them if the bodily condition allowed it. When, however, a fever threatens, begins,
