When it is expected, the patient is to be prohibited from drinking anything: for this, given a little while beforehand, adds much to the illness. Likewise he is to be covered up quite soon with a quantity of bed-clothes; to the parts about which we feel concern there are to be applied such dry and hot foments as will not immediately set up a very vehement heat, but gradually increase it. The said parts are also to be rubbed by hands anointed with old olive oil, to which has been added one of the heating agents.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL292_275_a" id="target_note_LCL292_275_a"><sup>a</sup></a> And some practitioners are satisfied with one rubbing of any kind of oil.

Some degree of trust must be placed in that remission which is prolonged, and diminishes restlessness and the foulness of the mouth which the Greeks term ozaena.
