<p>When Adrastus hears that the pair are going to battle with open taunts and that no shame any longer hinders the crime, he hastens to the spot and drives his chariot between them. He himself is right venerable in royalty and years, but what is alien dignity to such as these, who care not for their own kith and kin?
