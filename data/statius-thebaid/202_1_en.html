Grim was the flight of the horses through the fields, until Aconteus, whose valour was wont to lay wild beasts low (he was an Arcadian), inflamed at the sight of slaughtered men, pursues them as they turn toward their trusty walls with showers of darts and picking up spear after spear drives weapons three times and four through their backs and flanks. With a long trail of streaming blood they bring bolts standing out on either side to the gates, but half alive, and uttering groans that sounded human lean their wounded breasts against the walls they love.

Moreover in 612–14 Tydeus implies that Eteocles knew of Jocasta’s mission and that the attack was a violation of good faith; in 613 he calls it an atrocity (<span class="italic">nefas</span>); cf. 505f.
