The slumber of the sentinels was disturbed; Sleep himself gave them images of woe. Straightway soldiers rush in, ranging over all in sight with an armed net. Only the old man fears them as they come on; but the women openly admit before the pyre to having flouted cruel Creon’s orders, admit the theft, loudly lamenting, carefree, for they see that the corpse has all dissolved. They are ambitious of a cruel end, courageous hope for death maddens within them. Against each other they claim to have stolen the body, she her brother’s, she her husband’s, and win credence in turn. ‘I took the body’: ‘I lit the fire.’ ‘Affection made me’: ‘Me love.’ They demand cruel punishment and rejoice to put their hands in chains. Gone the mutual respect in their exchanges, you might think it anger and hate, so loudly they both shout at each other and drag their captors to the king.</p>
<p>But far away at the Actaean walls (Pallas is now benevolent) Juno goes ahead to introduce the distraught Phoronean matrons, herself no less distraught, and bespeaks the people’s favour for the sorrowing company, lending dignity to their tears. She herself gives them olive branches and suppliant fillets, instructing them to lower their eyes and cover them with their mantles and to hold up urns empty without their dead. All ages pour from the Erecthean homes, filling roofs and streets: whence this swarm, they ask, so many sad women all together? Not yet apprised of the cause of the distress, they are already groaning. The goddess mingles with both assemblies, telling all, what race they come from, what deaths they are mourning, what their petition. And the women themselves talk to this one and that, everywhere denouncing Ogygian laws and ruthless Creon at large. The Getic birds make no greater moan </p></section><notes></notes></section>
