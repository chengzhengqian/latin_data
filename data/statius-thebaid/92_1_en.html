</a> himself nurtures the warriors in the raw dust, implanting the fashions and furies of naked valour. Hence vigour to their spirit and the sweet rite of an honourable death. Parents rejoice at their children’s fate and urge them to die; for all the multitude weep for a youth, while his mother is content with his wreathed corpse. Reins they hold and two javelins knotted together; their massive shoulders are bare, a rough cloak hangs down and Leda’s crest<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL207_223_35" id="target_note_LCL207_223_35">

Sloping Elis swells your troops and the folk of lowlying Pisa come forward who swim in yellow Alpheos—arrival in Sicanian lands, never tainted by the long seaway.

Here too it is out of place. The conjecture <span class="italic">Helos</span> (in Laconia, distinct from Messenian Helos in 181) is supported by a mention after Amyclae in the Homeric catalogue (<span class="italic">Iliad</span> 2.584) and by the context here. On the other hand the Pylians are in Amphiaraus’ following in 8.365. Adding to the embarrassment is the absence of a verb (like <span class="italic">nutrit</span> in 179) to govern <span class="italic">quos</span>, leading Lachmann to suggest that a line has fallen out after 225.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL207_223_32a').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL207_223_33"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL207_223_33" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">33</sup>Diana had a temple there with annual dances in her honour.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL207_223_33').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL207_223_34"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL207_223_34" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">34</sup>Mercury, patron of gymnastics.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL207_223_34').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL207_223_35"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL207_223_35" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">35</sup>Of swan’s feathers.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL207_223_35').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
