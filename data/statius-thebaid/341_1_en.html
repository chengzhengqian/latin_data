I pray, whatever we are. The boon I ask is not for long, Creon. Pity an old man and give me leave to lay here, I pray, my parent’s sad remains, ay, here. Thebans at least may be given burial.’ So she entreats grovelling. Her father leads her away, savagely threatening, scorning pardon: like to a lion under a high crag, at whom in his prime forest and mountain once trembled; now he lies inactive, disarmed by length of years, yet his face is grand and his old age best left alone; and if a sound of lowing come to his drooping ears, he rises up and remembers himself, groaning for his strength decayed and that other lions bear lordship in the plains.</p>
<p>The ruler is swayed by her appeal, but grants not the suppliant’s tears all she asks, paring back part of his bounty: ‘You shall not be banished far from your country’s bounds, so long as you do not sully her sacred shrines and homes by your presence. Let the wilds have you, and your own Cithaeron. And see, this earth where the war was and two peoples lie in their blood can be habitation to your shade.’ So says he, and haughtily returns to his regal threshold amid the feigned assent of his attendants and the sorrowing populace.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the vanquished Pelasgi leave by stealth their fatal rampart. None have their own standard and their own leader. They go silently, pell-mell, embracing an inglorious life and shameful return instead of an honourable death. Night favours them and welcome darkness shrouds the fugitives.</p>
