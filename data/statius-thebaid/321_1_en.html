hide deep the wound and respect your son-in-law’s afflicted shame: I am he that, while you ruled in peace and righteousness (an ill-starred guest, would I had been bestowed on other cities!), banished from country and throne<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL498_209_10a" id="target_note_LCL498_209_10a">

</a>—but at long last exact the punishment: my brother to mortal combat (why do you shudder, ’tis decreed and fixed) I challenge. Think not to hold me back, nor will it be in your power. No, if my mother in black and my unhappy sisters were to fall betwixt the arms, if my father himself were to block me as I rush to fight and cast his perished orbs upon my helmet, not so should I fail. Or should I drink what is left of Inachian blood and still use your deaths? I saw the earth gape and yawn on my account and went not in. I saw Tydeus lifeless and made him guilty. Tegea undefended claims back her king from me and his bereaved mother keens at me in Parrhasian glens. Myself I could not climb Ismenos’ bank while Hippomedon’s blood stained the water nor scale the Tyrian tower amid the thunder and mingle madness, Capaneus, with you. Why so much fear for life? But I shall make due recompense. Let the Pelasgian wives and mothers and aged fathers whom I have robbed of so many joys, whose homes I have made desolate, assemble wherever they be. I fight my brother. What more is there? Let them watch and pray for Eteocles’ victory. And now farewell my wife and farewell sweet Mycenae. But you, dear sire (for not all the blame for our calamities is mine, the High Ones too and the Parcae are guilty with me), be kind to my ashes and after this battle seize me and protect me from the birds and my brother
