<p>Some too come forward to fight with the naked sword. Already Epidaurian Agreus and the Dircaean exile, whose doom is not yet upon him, stood in arms. The royal scion of Iasus forbids: ‘Young sirs, great plenty of death remains. Keep your high hearts and mad greed for adversary blood. And you, on whose account we have left desolate our ancestral acres and beloved cities, do not, I pray, before the fray let chance and your brother’s vows (the gods forfend!) have so much power.’ So he spoke and enriches both with a gilded helm.

<p>The leaders urge him also to dignify the festal contests with a feat of his own, adding this final honour to the tomb. And lest one victory be lacking to the number of the chiefs, they ask him to shoot Lyctian arrows from a bow or cross the clouds with a light spear. Happily he complies and from the green mound descends to the level surrounded by the foremost warriors. His armour-bearer at orders carries behind light quivers and bows. He plans to cross the great circus from a distance with a shot and wound a designated ash tree.</p>

So of omens we have made chance, and Fortune has drawn power to harm.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL207_395_96" id="target_note_LCL207_395_96">

But Polynices had not in fact defeated his adversary and that too might be ominous, foreshadowing his duel with Eteocles.
