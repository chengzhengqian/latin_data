the favour of the wonted deity: ‘Almighty Jupiter (for we are taught that you give wisdom to fleet wings, filling birds with the future, and bring down from heaven omens and hidden causes), not Cirrha could send forth the god from her cavern more surely or those Chaonian leaves that are famed to make sounds at your behest in Molossian groves: though parched Hammon envy and the Lycian oracle<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL207_185_29" id="target_note_LCL207_185_29">

If ’tis granted and the harsh Parcae so resolve that we loosen the Echionian gates with Lerna’s spear, bring a sign, thunder on the left; then let every flying creature among the stars utter good sounds in unison with secret tongue.
