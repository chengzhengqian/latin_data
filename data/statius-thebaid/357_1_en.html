unhappy women seek fire. But the ashes around are cold and lifeless in the rotting pits and all the pyres are at rest. One still stood, whether by chance or the will of the gods, to which had been given the burning of Eteocles’ fierce limbs; was Fortune preparing another occasion for a prodigy or had the Fury preserved the fire for discord? Here equally eager they saw that a thin flame still lived in the blackened logs and together tearfully rejoiced. Not yet had they learned whose fire it was, but they ask him, whosoever he be, to admit in peace and mercy one to share his last ashes and mingle their shades.</p>
<p>See, once more the brothers! As soon as the consuming fire touched the limbs, the pile shook and the new arrival is driven from the pyre. The flames gush up divided at the top, flashing two tips in broken light. As though pale Orcus had set the torches of the Furies in conflict, each mass of fire threatens and tries to outstrip the other. The very logs shifted their weight and moved a little way apart. The maiden cries in terror: ‘We are lost, we have stirred up dead anger. It was his brother. Who else would be savage enough to repel the approach of a stranger shade? See, I recognize the fragment of shield and this charred belt. It was his brother. Do you see how the flame pulls back and yet runs at the other? It lives, the monstrous hate, it lives! War has achieved nothing. Wretches, as thus you fight, Creon has conquered, has he not? Your kingdom is gone. Wherefore the passion? For whom do you rage? Calm your threats. And you, everywhere the exile, always denied justice, yield now. This your wife begs, this your sister; or we shall come into the fierce flames to part you.’</p>
<p>Scarce spoken when a sudden tremor shook the fields and tall buildings, adding to the rift in the discordant pyre.
