you by your Argive home, my brother (for you care naught for the Tyrians any more), if in that dwelling anything is dear to you, abate your pride. See, a throng of either people and both armies beg you. Your Antigone begs, faithful to the ills of her loved ones and suspect to the king, sister only to you, O hard of heart! At least relax your frowning look. Let me recognize, it may be for the last time, the face I love and see whether you weep at my lament. Him our mother already softens with her suppliant tears and he is said to be letting go his drawn sword. Are you still strong of purpose to me? To me, who bewail your exile and wanderings night and day, who have often calmed our father’s wrath against you as it swelled? Why do you free your brother of blame? It was he, was it not, who broke faith and covenant agreed, he is guilty and cruel to his kin; yet see, he is challenged and does not come.’ At these words his rage began to weaken a little, though the Fury loudly resists. Already his hand is falling, already he wheels his mount less rapidly, already he keeps silent. His groans break through, his helmet confesses his tears. Anger abates and he is ashamed both to depart and to have come in guilt; when suddenly the Fury repulses the mother and hurls forth Eteocles from the broken gates shouting: ‘Here I come and envy you one thing only, that you challenged first. Chide not the delay, my mother’s weight was holding my arms. My country, land most doubtful of your kings, now surely you will belong to the victor.’ No gentler is the other: ‘At length, bully,’ he says, ‘do you know the meaning of good faith and come down onto the level? Now for the first time in so long you are my brother: fight me. These are the only terms, the only covenants that remain.’ Thus he speaks, eying his brother in en­mity.
