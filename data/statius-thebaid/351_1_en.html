And now the slopes of Pentheus’ ridge incline downwards before the weary wayfarers in a broad declivity, when with panting breath, now almost past his strength, Menoetes so begins to speak: ‘Argia, I think that not far away, if the hope of toil performed does not flatter, lie Ogygian dwellings and bodies in need of burial. Close at hand the pulsing air is heavy and unclean, great birds return through the void. This is that cruel ground, and the city is not far. See you how the field stretches out the vast shadow of the walls and dying fires flicker here and there from the watchtowers? The city is nearby. Just now the night itself was more silent and only the stars relaxed the black darkness.’ Argia shuddered, and stretching her right hand toward the walls: ‘City of Thebes, once my desire, now enemy abode, and yet, if you return my husband’s shade unharmed, soil dear to me even so, do you see what pomp attends me, what company surrounds me, as for the first time I come near your gates, I, daughter-in-law of great Oedipus? My prayer is not inordinate. A stranger, I ask a pyre, a lament, a corpse. Him, I beg, exiled from his realm and routed in war, him whom you did not judge worthy of his father’s throne, give him back to me. And you, I beg, come, if the dead have any shape and ghosts wander free when bodies are gone, show the way, yourself conduct me to your corpse, if I have so deserved.’ She spoke and entering the shelter of a shepherd’s hut nearby, she rekindles the breath of her flagging torch and breaks wildly into the dread field. </p></section><notes></notes></section>
