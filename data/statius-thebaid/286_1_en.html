They stand everywhere in arms, indignant at the night’s shame and the haughty watchmen. Lo, a sudden thrill comes upon Thiodamas as the High Ones drive his mind to madness and command him in terrifying tumult to reveal the fates—whether Saturnia so inspired him or kindly Apollo was inciting his new attendant. He leaps into the midst, terrible to see and to hear, unable to bear the deity—too much for the frail receiving mind to contain. His pangs flow over and naked frenzy stands in his face, swelling and draining his quivering cheeks with uncertain blood. His eyes wander hither and thither, and tossing his neck he flails the garland entwined with his hair.

About him are grouped the new leaders, as each stood next to the slain, protecting the places left empty by the great kings, not joyfully but grieving to have risen so high. Even as when a ship has lost her skipper and stopped in mid voyage, there comes to guide the doubtful helm either the guardian of the sides or he whose care was the prow that fronts the main; the vessel herself is stunned.
