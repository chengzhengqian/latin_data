shield is dragged and the earth ploughed by the smoking wheels, and, a third furrow, the spear. The lolling head follows in a long trail of dust and the broad track of his backstreaming hair shows plain.</p>
<p>But the trumpet’s mournful clangour smites the city, breaking through blocked doors with bitter bray. They divide the approaches and at each threshold stands a fierce ensign-bearer, leading in front of all their losses and their joys.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL498_167_45a" id="target_note_LCL498_167_45a">

</a> Dire is the spectacle within. Mavors himself would scarce take pleasure in the sight. The city is in frenzy, horrorstruck; Mourning, Madness, Panic, and Flight encompassed by blind darkness rend it in various discord. You might think War had come inside. The high places are astir with runnings to and fro, the streets a medley of shouts, from all directions in their minds they see sword and fire and are loaded with cruel chains.
