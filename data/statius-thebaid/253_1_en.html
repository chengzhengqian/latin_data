A little while the hero stood, anxiously balancing his fears. The harsh maiden urges: ‘Why do you hesitate? Do we go? Or does this corpse detain you and is he that still lives of less account?’ He hands over his sad work and his own battles to his comrades and leaves, deserting his bosom friend, yet looking back and ready if haply they should recall him. Thence following in the tangled footsteps of the ferocious goddess, he rushes this way and that without a path, until the impious Eumenis casting away her shield disappears darkling from his sight and countless asps burst her helmet. The cloud is dispersed and the unlucky hero sees the sons of Inachus at rest and the chariot of Adrastus, who is in no danger.</p>
<p>And now the Tyrians have the body. Loud cries attest their joy and yells of victory stray to his ears and strike his heart with secret grief. Ah, harsh power of Fate! Tydeus is dragged over hostile soil, Tydeus, for whom lately a great space was left on either side as he pursued the ranks of Thebes, whether with feet unchecked or with reins. His arms are gone, his hands are quiet, his savagery is no more. They were glad to vex the features rigid in death, the dreaded countenance, with impunity. This is their craving, this cowards and brave alike pursue, to ennoble their hands, and they keep the bloodstained weapons to show their wives and little children. So when a lion that has long ravaged the Moorish countryside, on whose account flocks are shut in and their masters keep vigil, has been warred down by weary troops of shepherds, the land is glad, the husbandmen come with loud clamour, plucking at his mane, opening his monstrous jaws, telling of their losses, whether he now keeps watch impaled under a roof or hangs the glory of an ancient grove.</p>
