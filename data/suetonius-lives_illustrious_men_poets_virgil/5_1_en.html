in seven, the “Aeneid” in eleven. The success of the “Bucolics” on their first appearance was such that they were even frequently rendered by singers on the stage. When Augustus was returning after his victory at Actium and lingered at Atella to treat his throat, Virgil read the “Georgics” to him for four days in succession, Maecenas taking his turn at the reading whenever the poet was interrupted by the failure of his voice. His own delivery, however, was sweet and wonderfully effective. In fact, Seneca has said that the poet Julius Montanus used to declare that he would have purloined some of Virgil’s work, if he could also have stolen his voice, expression, and dramatic power; for the same verses sounded well when Virgil read them, which on another’s lips were flat and toneless.
