part passages about which he was in doubt, in order to get the benefit of criticism. They say that Eros, his amanuensis and freedman, used to report, when he was an old man, that Virgil once completed two half-verses off-hand in the course of a reading. For having before him merely the words “Misenum Aeoliden,” he added “quo non praestantior alter,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL038_458_22" id="target_note_LCL038_458_22"><sup>22</sup></a> and again to “aere ciere viros” he joined “Martemque accendere cantu,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL038_458_23" id="target_note_LCL038_458_23"><sup>23</sup></a> thrown off with like inspiration, and he immediately ordered Eros to add both half-lines to his manuscript.</p>
<p>In the fifty-second year of his age, wishing to give the final touch to the “Aeneid,” he determined to go away to Greece and Asia, and after devoting three entire years to the sole work of improving his poem, to give up the rest of his life wholly to philosophy. But having begun his journey, and at Athens meeting Augustus, who was on his way back to Rome from the Orient, he resolved not to part from the emperor and even to return with him; but in the course of a visit to the neighbouring town of Megara in a very hot sun, he was taken with a fever, and added to his disorder by continuing his journey; hence on his arrival at Brundisium he was considerably worse, and died there on the eleventh day before the Kalends of October, in the consulship of Gnaeus Sentius and Quintus Lucretius.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL038_458_24" id="target_note_LCL038_458_24"><sup>24</sup></a> His ashes were taken to Naples and laid to rest on the via Puteolana less than two miles from the city, in a tomb for which he himself composed this couplet:</p>
