<h1><span class="ac">The Life of Virgil</span></h1>
<p>Publius Vergilius Maro, a native of Mantua, had parents of humble origin, especially his father, who according to some was a potter, although the general opinion is that he was at first the hired man of a certain Magus, an attendant on the magistrates, later became his son-in-law because of his diligence, and greatly increased his little property by buying up woodlands and raising bees. He was born in the first consulship of Gnaeus Pompeius the Great and Marcus Licinius Crassus, on the Ides of October,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL038_448_15" id="target_note_LCL038_448_15"><sup>15</sup></a> in a district called Andes, not far distant from Mantua. While he was in his mother’s womb, she dreamt that she gave birth to a laurel-branch, which on touching the earth took root and grew at once to the size of a full-grown tree, covered with fruits and flowers of various kinds; and on the following day, when she was on the way to a neighbouring part of the country with her husband, she turned aside and gave birth to her child in a ditch beside the road. They say that the infant did not cry at its birth, and had such a gentle expression as even then to give assurance of an unusually happy destiny. There was added another omen; for a poplar branch, which, as was usual in that region on such occasions, was at once planted where the birth occurred, grew so fast in a short time that it equalled in size poplars planted long before. It was called from him “Virgil’s tree” and was besides worshipped with great veneration by pregnant and newly delivered women, who made and paid vows beneath it.</p>
<p>Virgil spent his early life at Cremona until he assumed the gown of manhood, upon his fifteenth birthday, in the consulship<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL038_448_16" id="target_note_LCL038_448_16"><sup>16</sup></a> of the same two men who had been consuls
