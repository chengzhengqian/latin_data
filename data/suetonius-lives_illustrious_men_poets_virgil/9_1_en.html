Herennius made selections confined to his defects, and Perellius Fausta to his pilferings. More than that, the eight volumes of Quintus Octavius Avitus, entitled “Resemblances,” contain the verses which he borrowed, with their sources. Asconius Pedianus, in a book which he wrote “Against the Detractors of Virgil,” sets forth a very few of the charges against him, and those for the most part dealing with history and with the accusation that he borrowed a great deal from Homer; but he says that Virgil used to meet this latter accusation with these words: “Why don’t my critics also attempt the same thefts? If they do, they will realize that it is easier to filch his club from Hercules than a line from Homer.” Yet Asconius says that Vergil had intended to go into retirement, in order to prune down everything to the satisfaction of carping critics.</p>
