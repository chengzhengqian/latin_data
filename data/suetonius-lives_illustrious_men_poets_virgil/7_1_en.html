<p>He named as his heirs Valerius Proculus, his half-brother, to one-half of his estate, Augustus to one-fourth, Maecenas to one-twelfth; the rest he left to Lucius Varius and Plotius Tucca, who revised the “Aeneid” after his death by order of Augustus. With regard to this matter we have the following verses of Sulpicius of Carthage:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">Virgil had bidden these songs by swift flame be</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">turned into ashes,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Songs which sang of thy fates, Phrygia’s leader</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">renowned.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Varius and Tucca forbade, and thou, too, greatest of</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">Caesars,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Adding your veto to theirs, Latium’s story preserved.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">All but twice in the flames unhappy Pergamum</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">perished</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Troy on a second pyre narrowly failed of her doom.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>

Therefore in his mortal illness Virgil constantly called for his book-boxes, intending to burn the poem himself; but when no one brought them to him, he made no specific request about the matter, but left his writings jointly to the above mentioned Varius and to Tucca, with the stipulation that they should publish nothing which he himself would not have given to the world. However, Varius published the “Aeneid” at Augustus’ request, making only a few slight corrections, and even leaving the incomplete lines just as they were. These last many afterwards tried to finish, but failed owing to the difficulty that nearly all the half-lines in Virgil are complete in sense
