He would hesitate, I am sure, this absolute madman, whose every move is an erratic plunge, to bring war upon us not only with his army but with all the savagery of a barbarous land. Even with the rampart of the Alps we would be powerless to contain his fury. For this, then, we have Decimus Brutus to thank, who, prior to the confirmation by your authority, exercising his own initiative and judgment, did not admit Antonius as a consul but barred him from Gaul as an enemy and preferred to have himself, rather than this city, besieged.

Which of us can forget his great moderation in the national crisis that followed Caesar’s death? These are great merits, but my words hasten on to others greater still.
