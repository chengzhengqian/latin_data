<p>For what does not apply to a man who subverts the laws of the very person whose acts he claims to be defending, those laws that we could most approve of? Caesar wanted to drain marshes: Antonius gave all Italy over to that man of moderation, Lucius Antonius, to be parceled out.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL189_251_4" id="target_note_LCL189_251_4"><sup>4</sup></a> Did the Roman people accept this law? Could it be carried according to the auspices? But this augur is diffident concerning auspices without his colleagues. Not that those auspices have any need for augurs to interpret them. Who does not know that it is contrary to the dictates of religion to transact business with the people when Jupiter thunders? The tribunes of the plebs proposed a law concerning provinces which ran contrary to the acts of Gaius Caesar: he fixed a two-year term, they a six-year.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL189_251_5a" id="target_note_LCL189_251_5a"><sup>5</sup></a> Did the Roman people accept this law too?
