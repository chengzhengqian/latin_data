Great honors were accorded to Gnaeus Pompeius when he was a young man, and rightly so; for he came to the aid of the Republic, but he was much stronger in years, had a better basis in the soldiers’ zeal in looking for a leader, and it was a different sort of war.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL189_287_33" id="target_note_LCL189_287_33"><sup>33</sup></a> Sulla’s cause was not universally favored: witness the multitude of the proscribed and the terrible disasters that befell so many townships. Caesar, many years <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">44</span><span class="br"></span>younger, armed veterans who now wanted peace and quiet; and he embraced a cause most highly favored by the senate, by the people, by all Italy, by gods and men. Also Pompeius joined Lucius Sulla’s mighty command and victorious army: Caesar attached himself to nobody, was himself the first to form an army and to create a defense. Pompeius held the territory of Picenum, hostile to the opposing party: Caesar raised an army against Antonius from Antonius’ friends—but better friends of freedom.
