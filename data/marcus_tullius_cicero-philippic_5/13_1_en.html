<p>And, good gods, is this the man to whom it is decided to send envoys? Do those fellows know the structure of the Republic, the laws of war, the precedents set by our ancestors? Have they any thought for what the majesty of the Roman people and the gravity of the senate require? You<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL189_269_22" id="target_note_LCL189_269_22"><sup>22</sup></a> propose envoys? If your purpose is to plead with him, he will despise you; if it is to give him orders, he will not listen. Finally, however stern a commission we give the envoys, the very term “envoys” will quench the ardor of the Roman people, of which we see the evidence around us, will break the spirit of the townships and Italy. To leave aside these considerations, important as they are, such an embassy will at least mean delay and retardation for the war. Though people may say, as I hear some are going to say: <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">26</span><span class="br"></span>“Let the envoys set out, and let preparations for war go on just the same,” nevertheless, the very term “envoys” will both soften men’s minds and slow the pace of the war.

Nobody will ask what commission we have given the envoys to deliver: the very notion of an embassy dispatched of our own volition will be taken as a sign of fear. Let Antonius retire from Mutina, let him cease attacking Brutus, let him withdraw from Gaul; he is not to be asked in words, he is to be compelled by force of arms.</p>
