<p>I wish that all of them were asked for their views ahead of me—not that I do not have an inkling of what some of those who will be asked after me are going to say—; it would be easier to speak in opposition, if anything seemed appropriate. For there is a notion that somebody will propose for Marcus Antonius the assignment of that Outer Gaul, which is now being governed by Plancus. That would simply be presenting the enemy with all the weapons required for civil war: first, the sinews of war, a limitless supply of money, of which he now stands in need; then, cavalry, all he wants. I say “cavalry,” but will he hesitate to bring up barbarous nations? Anyone who does not see this is a fool; anyone who does and makes the proposal all the same is a traitor. Are you going to furnish an abandoned <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">6</span><span class="br"></span>criminal with Gallic and German money, infantry, cavalry, resources generally? Those excuses of yours amount to nothing: “He is my friend.” Let him be a friend to his native land first. “He is my relative.” Can any relationship be closer than that to your native land, in which parents also are comprised? “He has given me money.” I am eager to see who has the boldness to say that.</p>
<p>Moreover, when I make plain what is at issue, it will be easy then for you to decide what proposal to put forward or what to support.</p>
