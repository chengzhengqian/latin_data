And your decisions on that day, Members of the Senate, mean that you now have no choice except an honorable peace or a necessary war.</p>
<p>Does Marcus Antonius want peace? Let him lay down <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span>his arms, make his petition, ask our pardon. Nobody will give him a fairer hearing than I, though in recommending himself to treacherous citizens he has preferred my enmity to my friendship. Obviously no concessions are possible while he is making war; if he petitions us, perhaps there will be something we can concede. But to send envoys to a man on whom twelve days ago you passed a judgment of the weightiest and sternest character is—not levity but, to speak my mind, stark lunacy.</p>

<p>[2] First you commended those commanders who had started a war against him on their private initiative, then the veteran soldiers who, after having been settled in colonies by Antonius, preferred the freedom of the Roman people to his benefaction. What of <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span>the Martian Legion and the Fourth? Why are they commended? For if it was their consul whom they abandoned, they are blameworthy; if it was an enemy of the Republic, they are rightly commended. But when you did not yet have any consuls,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL189_247_3" id="target_note_LCL189_247_3"><sup>3</sup></a> you passed a decree providing that discussion be opened at the first opportunity concerning both rewards for the soldiers and honors for their commanders. Are you in favor of determining rewards for those who took up arms against Antonius and at the same time of sending envoys to Antonius? In that case we will have cause to be ashamed that the decrees of the legions are more honorable than those of the senate, if actually the legions decreed to defend the senate against Antonius, while the senate decrees to send envoys to Antonius. Is that fortifying </p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL189_247_3"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL189_247_3" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">3</sup>The consuls-elect for 43, A.
