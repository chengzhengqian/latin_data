He who has not even put our fortunes into a lottery, but has given us over to every individual’s desires, so as not even to leave something uncommitted for himself, since everything has already been promised to somebody. With this man, Members of the Senate, we must fight it out. It must be war, I repeat, war, and that right away: no drawn-out business of envoys!</p>
<p>Therefore, to spare ourselves the necessity of many decrees <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">34</span><span class="br"></span>day after day, I propose that the whole Republic be committed to the consuls and that they be given full discretion to defend the Republic and take measures to ensure that the Republic suffer no harm.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL189_277_27" id="target_note_LCL189_277_27"><sup>27</sup></a> I further propose that men now in the army of Marcus Antonius be subject to no penalty on that account provided that they leave him before the first of February. If you so decide, Members of the Senate, you will soon recover the liberty of the Roman people and your own authority. If, on the other hand, you take a milder course, you will nonetheless eventually pass the same decrees, but perhaps too late. So far as the question you<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL189_277_28" id="target_note_LCL189_277_28"><sup>28</sup></a> wished to be discussed concerns the state of the Republic, I think it is sufficiently covered by my motion.</p>
