It seems contrary to nature that so vast a sum belonging to the Roman people could have vanished in so short a time. Well, can we tolerate the monstrous profits that M. Antonius’ house as a whole has absorbed? He sold false decrees, caused kingdoms, grants of citizenship, exemptions from taxation to be inscribed on bronze tablets in return for bribes. These things he claimed to do in execution of Gaius Caesar’s memoranda, which were vouched for by himself. A roaring trade involving the whole Republic was carried on in the inner part of the dwelling; a woman who has brought more luck to herself than to her husbands<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL189_255_11" id="target_note_LCL189_255_11"><sup>11</sup></a> put up provinces and kingdoms for auction; exiles were restored illegally under the pretense of law. If these proceedings are not rescinded by authority of the senate, since we are now in hopes of reestablishing the Republic, no semblance of a free community will be left. And <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">12</span><span class="br"></span>besides the money piled up beyond counting in that house from forged memoranda and handwritten notes put up for sale—Antonius all the while claiming these transactions to be in execution of Caesar’s acts—he even used to place on record false senatorial decrees in return for bribes; bonds were sealed; senatorial decrees which the senate never made were deposited in the treasury. Even foreign nations were witnesses of this scandal. Meanwhile, treaties were made, kingdoms granted, freedom conferred on peoples and provinces, and lying notices of those proceedings were posted up all over the Capitol amid the groans of the Roman people. So much money from these activities was heaped up in a single house that, if this sort of profit were to be collected at the treasury, the Republic would not be short of funds in days to come.</p>
