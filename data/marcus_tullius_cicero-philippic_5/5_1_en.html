So will he hesitate to admit that a law that he, an augur, says he carried not only while Jupiter was thundering but almost with the heavens clamoring to forbid it, was carried in violation of the auspices? Add the fact that he <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">9</span><span class="br"></span>carried it jointly with a colleague whose status he caused to be flawed by his own announcement:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL189_253_8" id="target_note_LCL189_253_8"><sup>8</sup></a> did the adept augur not think that relevant to the auspices?</p>

<p>[4] However, perhaps we who are his colleagues will interpret the auspices: do we require interpreters for the weapons too? Firstly, all approaches to the Forum were barricaded, so that even if no armed guard blocked entry, it was in no way possible to get into the Forum without tearing down the barricades. But furthermore, guards were posted, and the people and the tribunes of the plebs might be seen being thrust back from the entrances to the Forum, just as an approaching enemy is denied access to a town by outposts and fortifications. For these reasons it is my judgment that the laws <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">10</span><span class="br"></span>which Marcus Antonius is said to have carried were all carried by violence and in contravention of the auspices, and that the people are not bound by those laws. If Marcus Antonius is said to have carried a law confirming Caesar’s acts or abolishing the dictatorship in perpetuity or founding colonies on lands,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL189_253_9" id="target_note_LCL189_253_9"><sup>9</sup></a> I think it proper that the same laws be carried afresh with due observance of auspices so that they may bind the people. For however good in themselves may be the measures he carried improperly and by violence, they are still not to be considered laws. And the crazy gladiator’s insolence is to be repudiated in its entirety by our authority.</p>
