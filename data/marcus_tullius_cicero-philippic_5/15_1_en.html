What, <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">29</span><span class="br"></span>then, was your purpose that day but to declare Antonius a public enemy? After those decrees of yours will he be able to look at you calmly, or will you see him without fierce indignation? His own crime and also, as it seems to me, a stroke of good fortune for the Republic has shut him out, separated, segregated from the Republic. If he obeys the envoys and returns to Rome, do you imagine that abandoned citizens will ever lack a banner to rally behind? This, however, is not my main apprehension: there are other dangers I fear more, have more in mind. He will never obey the envoys. I know this man’s madness, his arrogance; I know the desperate counsels of the friends to whom he has surrendered himself. His brother Lucius leads this <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">30</span><span class="br"></span>troop, with his experience of combat in foreign parts.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL189_273_24" id="target_note_LCL189_273_24"><sup>24</sup></a> Suppose Antonius is sane in himself, which he will never be: he will still not be allowed to be so by these fellows.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, time will be wasted; military preparations will cool off. Is not the protraction of the war till now due solely to hesitation and waiting? From the moment when the senate could be convened without intimidation, after the departure of the bandit, or rather after his desperate flight, I continually demanded that we be convoked. As soon as we were convoked, in the absence of the consuls-elect, I put forward a proposal by which I laid the foundations of the Republic, with your greatest assent.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL189_273_25" id="target_note_LCL189_273_25"><sup>25</sup></a> It is true that it was later than it should have been—for I had no earlier opportunity—; but if no day had been lost from that time forward, it is pretty clear that we should not have a war on our hands. Every evil is easily nipped in the bud; <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">31</span><span class="br"></span></p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL189_273_24"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL189_273_24" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">24</sup>Cf. §20 and n. 17.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL189_273_24').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note inline" id="note_LCL189_273_25"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL189_273_25" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">25</sup>On 20 Dec. 44, when Cicero’s motion was carried (3.37–39; cf. also §4).</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL189_273_25').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
