These laws came in many years later as a result of the struggle for offices, to create stages at which men of the same age should compete.

Neglecting to win that esteem, he squandered all his powers of mind, which were of the highest order, on the fickleness of the people. And so, paying no consideration to the senate and to decent men, he opened a path to his own aggrandizement </p></section><notes></notes></section>
