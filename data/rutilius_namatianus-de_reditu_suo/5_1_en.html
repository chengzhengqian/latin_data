honours amid crowded trophies were a task like endeavouring to reckon up the stars. The glittering temples dazzle the wandering eyes: I could well believe such are the dwelling-places of the very gods. What shall I say of streams suspended on airy arches,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL434_773_a" id="target_note_LCL434_773_a">

</a> where scarce the Rainbow-Goddess could raise her showery waters?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL434_773_b" id="target_note_LCL434_773_b">

</a> You might rather call them mountains grown up to the sky: such a structure Greece would praise, as giant-wrought. Rivers<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL434_773_c" id="target_note_LCL434_773_c">

</a> diverted are lost sight of within thy walls: the lofty baths consume whole lakes.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL434_773_d" id="target_note_LCL434_773_d">

</a> No less are thy dewy meads filled also with their own rivulets, and all thy walls are a-babble with springs from the soil. Hence a breath of coolness tempers the summer air, and the crystal well relieves a harmless thirst. Nay, once a sudden torrent of waters seething hot broke forth, when thine enemy<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL434_773_e" id="target_note_LCL434_773_e">

</a> trod the roads by the Capitol: had it lasted for ever, mayhap I had deemed this mere chance; but it was to save thee that it flowed; for it came only to vanish. Why speak of woods enclosed amid thy panelled palaces,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL434_773_f" id="target_note_LCL434_773_f">
<sup>f</sup>
</a> where native birds sport with varied song? In the spring that is thine never does the year fail in its mildness: baffled winter respects thy charms.</p>
