brings and withdraws the day: its eastern peaks beset the Dalmatian waves, and its western spurs cleave the blue Tuscan waters. If we acknowledge that the world was made on a definite plan and if this great fabric was a god’s design, then as a protective fringe for our Latin outposts he wove the Apennines, barriers scarce approachable by mountain paths. Nature feared men’s jealousy (of Italy) and thought it scant defence to put the Alps in Northern invaders’ way, just as she has fenced with many limbs our vital parts and placed more than one covering around the precious works she has produced.
