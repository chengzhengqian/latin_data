<p class="noindent">Behold<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL064_487_5a" id="target_note_LCL064_487_5a"><sup>5</sup></a> one whom, upborne on mighty authority, Glory had exalted even above the abodes of heaven! Earth’s great orb had he shaken in war; Asia’s kings and peoples had he crushed; now upon you, even you, Rome, was he bringing grievous slavery, when suddenly, in the midst of his bid for power, he fell headlong, driven from fatherland into exile. Such is the will of Fortune; with such a stroke, in a moment of time, has the deceitful hour dealt out the destiny of mortals.</p>

<p class="noindent">Wherever the seasons of our varied lives lead us to go, whatever lands to visit, whatever people to see, I’ll be damned if anyone else can be more precious to me than you! For who can be dearer than you, O Musa,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL064_487_6" id="target_note_LCL064_487_6">
<sup>6</sup>
</a> upon whom in your youth beyond others—and not unworthily—the gods and sisters of the gods<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL064_487_7" id="target_note_LCL064_487_7">
<sup>7</sup>
</a> have bestowed all blessings, all wherein the choir of Phoebus and Phoebus himself rejoice? O who can have been more skilled than you, O Musa? O who else in all the world speaks with more charm than you? Bright Clio speaks not so charmingly. Therefore it is enough if you allow yourself to be loved; for otherwise, how may I cause that love to be returned?</p>
