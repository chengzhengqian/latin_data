The likelihood of such a move had not escaped Caesar’s attention: in fact, the day before he had built a fort at this spot and left behind a force of three cohorts to hold it, while he himself with the rest of his forces established a crescent-shaped
camp and invested Thapsus with a ring of siege works. Meanwhile Scipio, foiled in his undertaking, by-passed the lagoon to the north by a march which he completed in the ensuing day and night,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL402_271_1" id="target_note_LCL402_271_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and then, at the first pale light of dawn, took up a position not far from the camp and the defence area I mentioned above,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL402_271_2" id="target_note_LCL402_271_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and a mile and a half from the sea coast;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL402_271_3" id="target_note_LCL402_271_3"><sup>3</sup></a> and there he began to fortify a camp. When this was reported to Caesar, the latter withdrew his troops from their work of fortification, left behind the pro-consul Asprenas to guard the camp with two legions, and hurriedly marched to that location with a force in light order. As for his fleet, part of it was left behind off Thapsus, while the remaining ships were ordered to advance as close as

The words <span class="italic">postero die et nocte</span> have been variously explained and amended. Scipio’s abortive attempt to penetrate the eastern corridor was made, as <span class="italic">pridie</span> shews, on April 5th: <span class="italic">postero die</span> is, I think, relative to <span class="italic">pridie</span> (April 4th) and denotes the remainder of April 5th, <span class="italic">nocte</span> being the night of April 5th/6th. The time involved—perhaps some eighteen hours is certainly long for the distance of about 20 miles; but, as R. Holmes has pointed out, Scipio may well have rested <span class="italic">en route</span> and timed his march so as to begin his entrenchments under cover of darkness.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL402_271_1').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL402_271_2"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL402_271_2" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">2</sup>See Map 5. The defence area here alluded to may well be that close to Thapsus mentioned in the previous chapter. If the allusion is to the fort mentioned earlier in this chapter, then the fort too must have been close to Thapsus. But the only place where the corridor to-day is not more than a mile and a half wide is at the S.E. corner of the lagoon.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL402_271_2').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL402_271_3"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL402_271_3" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">3</sup>The words <span class="italic">MD passibus</span> present a difficulty. Bouvet translates ‘à quinze cents pas du côté de la mer,’ though in a later note he refers to Scipio’s position as near Caesar (at 1500 paces), and in his map he marks Scipio’s camp only 1 km. distant from the sea. It seems possible to render the words <span class="italic">non longe . . . consedit</span> by ‘took up a position towards the sea, not far distant—a mile and a half—from the camp . . .’. According to this interpretation Scipio’s camp would appear on Map 5 not—as now marked—close to Bekalta, but some 11/4 Roman miles nearer the sea, behind the left wing of Scipio’s battle line. This is perhaps confirmed by the behaviour of the routed elephants described below in ch. 83.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL402_271_3').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
