Caesar waited till the tenth hour and then withdrew to his camp in battle order without any losses. In this engagement Pacideius was seriously wounded in the head by a heavy javelin which pierced his helmet; and several of the enemy leaders and all their bravest men were either killed or wounded.</p>

That same day he began to invest the town, seizing and manning several suitable strategic points to prevent the enemy’s being able to infiltrate and approach him, or capture any inner positions. Scipio had in the meantime got to know of Caesar’s plans; and being now reduced to the necessity of fighting, if he was to avoid the utter humiliation of losing Vergilius and those most staunch supporters of his cause—the men of Thapsus, he forthwith followed Caesar along the high ground and established himself in two camps at a distance of eight miles from Thapsus.</p>

I have assumed, with most editors, that Caesar approached Thapsus from the south, by way of the narrow coastal corridor east of the Marsh of Moknine; and that Scipio took the same route and encamped near its south-eastern fringe. The strategic points may well—as Veith suggested—have included El Faca and El Hafsa.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL402_269_2').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
