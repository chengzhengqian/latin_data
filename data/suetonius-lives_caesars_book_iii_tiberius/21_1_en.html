Fear of this possibility in particular led Tiberius to ask the senate for any part in the administration that it might please them to assign him, saying that no one man could bear the whole burden without a colleague, or even several colleagues.

He barely consented to allow his birthday, which came at the time of the Plebeian games in the Circus, to be recognized by the addition of a single two-horse chariot. He forbade the voting of temples, flamens, and priests in his honour, and even the setting up of statues and busts without his permission; and this he gave only with the understanding that they were not to be placed among the likenesses of the gods, but among the adorn­ments </p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL031_351_57"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL031_351_57" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">57</sup>The <span class="italic">secespita,</span> or sacrificial knife, had a long, sharp point and a double edge, with an ivory handle ornamented with gold and silver.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL031_351_57').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL031_351_58"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL031_351_58" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">58</sup><span class="italic">Civilis</span> means “suited to a citizen” (of the days of the Republic).
