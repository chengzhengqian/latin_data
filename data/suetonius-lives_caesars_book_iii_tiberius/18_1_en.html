<section class="div1 language" lang="en"><header><hgroup><h1>Tiberius</h1></hgroup></header><section class="div2"><p class="noindent">letters as a most able general and the sole defence of the Roman people. In illustration of both these points, I append a few extracts from these letters.</p>
<p>“Fare thee well, Tiberius, most charming of men, and success go with you, as you war for me and for the Muses.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL031_345_52" id="target_note_LCL031_345_52"><sup>52</sup></a> Fare thee well, most charming and valiant of men and most conscientious of generals, or may I never know happiness.”</p>
<p>“I have only praise for the conduct of your summer campaigns, dear Tiberius, and I am sure that no one could have acted with better judgment than you did amid so many difficulties and such apathy of your army. All who were with you agree that the well-known line could be applied to you:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line indent2">“One man alone by his foresight has saved our dear</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent4">country from ruin.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL031_345_53" id="target_note_LCL031_345_53"><sup>53</sup></a>”</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p></blockquote>
<p>“If anything comes up that calls for careful thought, or if I am vexed at anything, I long mightily, so help me Heaven,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL031_345_54" id="target_note_LCL031_345_54"><sup>54</sup></a> for my dear Tiberius, and the lines of Homer come to my mind:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line indent2">“If he but follow me, then we too, though flames</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent3">round about us be raging,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">may both return to our homes, since great are his</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent3">wisdom and knowledge.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL031_345_55" id="target_note_LCL031_345_55"><sup>55</sup></a>”</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p>“When I hear and read that you are worn out by constant hardships, may the Gods confound me if my own body does not wince in sympathy; and I beseech you to spare yourself, that the news of your illness may not kill your mother and me, and endanger the Roman people in the person of their future ruler.”</p>
