<p>[11] In Rome I take
precautions against this. It is easy to look around, to the
rear and to the front, right and left. Shall I be able to do the
same on the paths over the Apennines? Even if there is no
ambush, which can very easily take place, my mind will
nevertheless be distracted so that it will be unable to attend
to the duties of the mission. But imagine I have escaped
an attack, forced my way through the Apennines: I
must then presumably meet and talk with Antonius. What
venue, I ask you, will be chosen? If outside the camps, I
leave it to others: as for myself, I scarcely think I shall
be safe. I know the man’s fury, I know his unbridled violence.
His savage ways and natural cruelty are seldom tempered,
even when mingled with wine. Ablaze with wrath
and madness, with that horrible beast of a brother Lucius
at his elbow, he will surely never keep his impious, sacrilegious<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL507_213_25" id="target_note_LCL507_213_25"><sup>25</sup></a>
hands off my person.</p>
<p>I remember parleys both with Rome’s bitterest foreign<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">27</span><span class="br"></span>
foes and with fellow countrymen in open revolt. The
consul Gnaeus Pompeius, son of Sextus, conferred with
Publius Vettius Scato, the Marsian leader, between their
two camps in my presence, when I was a recruit in
Pompeius’ army.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL507_213_26" id="target_note_LCL507_213_26"><sup>26</sup></a> I remember that Sextus Pompeius, the
consul’s brother, a man of learning and good sense, came
down from Rome to take part in the parley. When Scato
had greeted him, he added: “What am I to call you?” And
the other replied: “‘Guest-friend’ by my choosing, ‘enemy’
by necessity.” There was fair play at that parley; no covert
fear, no suspicion; even the hostility was not extreme. Our
allies, after all, were not seeking to take our citizenship
