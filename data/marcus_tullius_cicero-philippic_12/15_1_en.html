away from us but to be admitted to a part in it. Sulla and
Scipio met between Cales and Teanum,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL507_215_27" id="target_note_LCL507_215_27"><sup>27</sup></a> one with the
flower of the nobility at his side, the other with his wartime
allies, to discuss terms and conditions relating to the authority
