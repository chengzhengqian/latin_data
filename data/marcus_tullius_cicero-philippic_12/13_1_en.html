main point: I, as I say and as I have always done, shall attend
to Rome and its affairs along with you gentlemen.</p>
<p>But at the same time, I am not refusing this commission,
though I perceive that the Roman people are refusing
it for me. No man is less timid than I, but no man is more
cautious. The facts declare it. For twenty years past, all
the villains have attacked me alone. Well, they themselves
paid their penalties, I will not say to me personally but to
the Republic, while the Republic has up to this time preserved
me for its service. I shall say this with hesitation—for
I know that anything can happen to mortal man—but
anyhow: I was never taken unawares, though on one occasion,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL507_211_24" id="target_note_LCL507_211_24"><sup>24</sup></a>
surrounded by the massed strength of some very
powerful people, I fell, deliberately, so that I could rise
again in triumph.</p>
<p>Can I, then, appear adequately cautious, adequately<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">25</span><span class="br"></span>
prudent, if I trust myself to this journey so fraught with
menace and peril? Those who take part in public affairs
should leave a legacy of glory when they die, not a legacy
of censure and reproach for shortcoming and folly. What
honest man does not mourn the death of Trebonius? Who
does not grieve for the destruction of such a man and such
a citizen? And yet there are those who say (unsympathetically,
indeed, but they say it) that our grief should be diminished
by the fact that he was not on his guard against a
villainous traitor. Wise men say that a person who sets himself
up as the guardian of many should first of all be the
guardian of his own life. When one is protected by laws
and the fear of the courts, there is no need to be afraid of
everything or to seek defenses against all manner of plots.
For who would dare to attack a well-known public figure
traveling well-attended by daylight on a military highway?
