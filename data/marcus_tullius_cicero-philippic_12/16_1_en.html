no wish to be <span class="italic">feared</span>—as to how they will take my hard
line? They have heard many untruths about me; unscrupulous
persons have told them many tales, though as you
are best able to testify, I have always upheld their benefits
by means of my proposals, my influence, and my speeches.
But they believe the unscrupulous persons, they believe
the troublemakers, they believe the members of their own
side. Moreover, they are brave men to be sure, but the
memory of what they have done for the freedom of the Roman
people and the survival of the Republic<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL507_217_29" id="target_note_LCL507_217_29"><sup>29</sup></a> makes them
overbearing and inclined to regard their force as arbiter in
all our decisions. I am not afraid of their considered views,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">30</span><span class="br"></span>
but I dread their impetuosity.</p>
<p>If I escape also these grave dangers, do you think my return
will be sufficiently safe? For when I have defended
your authority in my usual way and kept my faith resolutely
with the Republic, I shall have to fear not only those who
hate me but also those who are jealous of me.</p>
<p>Therefore let my life be safeguarded for the benefit
of the Republic and reserved for our native land, so long
as honor and nature allow. Let my death either come by
natural necessity,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL507_217_30" id="target_note_LCL507_217_30"><sup>30</sup></a> or, if it must be met sooner, let it be met
gloriously.</p>
<p>In these circumstances, although the Republic, to put it
very mildly, does not need this embassy, nevertheless I
shall go, if I shall be able to do so safely. In weighing this
whole question, Members of the Senate, I shall adopt as
my sole criterion the advantage of the Republic, not my
personal risk. And since I have plenty of time, I am of the
opinion that I must give much further consideration to
the matter and do most of all whatever I shall judge to be
in the best interest of the Republic.</p>
