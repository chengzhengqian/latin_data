<p>Well, Members of the Senate, if we have been led<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">7</span><span class="br"></span>
astray by a false, delusive hope, let us get back to our path.
The best recourse when experiencing regret is a change of
policy.</p>

<p>[3] For, in name of the immortal gods, what good
can our mission do the Republic? “What good,” do I say?
But supposing it is even going to do harm? <span class="italic">Going</span> to do
harm? Supposing it already <span class="italic">has</span> done harm and been detrimental?
Or do you imagine that the Roman people’s ardent,
courageous desire to recover its freedom has not
been diminished and enfeebled by the news of a peace
mission? How do you think the municipalities have been
affected, and the colonies, and the whole of Italy? Will the
enthusiasm that previously flamed up to fight the common
peril be the same? Must we not expect that those who have
promised money and arms, who have committed themselves
unreservedly body and soul to the survival of the Republic,
will regret having professed and declared their hatred
of Antonius? How will Capua, which is a second Rome
these days, approve this initiative of ours? She judged the
traitors, threw them out, kept them out.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL507_193_5" id="target_note_LCL507_193_5"><sup>5</sup></a> Yes, Antonius was
barely snatched from that city’s grasp as she bravely tried
to lay hold of him. What of our legions? Have we not hamstrung<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">8</span><span class="br"></span>
them by this peace initiative? What heart will burn
for war once the hope of peace has been held out? Even
that godlike, superhuman Martian legion will droop at the
news and soften and lose its splendid name; the swords will
fall, the shields will drop from their hands. They followed
the senate, and will not feel it right to show more hatred towards
Antonius than the senate does. One feels shame in
the sight of this legion and of the Fourth too, which with
equal courage approved our authority and abandoned Antonius,
not as their consul and imperator but as an enemy
