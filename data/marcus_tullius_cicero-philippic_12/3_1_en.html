dignity, which does not and cannot exist, so that he may recover
through you the dignity that he destroyed by his own
doing!</p>
<p>If he were prepared to negotiate with you on his knees,
perhaps I would listen, even though—but I prefer to say, I
would listen. Given, however, that he stands upright, we
must resist him or surrender freedom along with dignity.
But, it may be objected, the matter is closed; the delegation<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span>
has been appointed. Yet, to a man of sense everything
is open that can be corrected. Anyone can make a mistake,
but only a fool persists in error. Second thoughts, as they
say, are usually wiser.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL507_191_4" id="target_note_LCL507_191_4"><sup>4</sup></a> That fog of which I spoke a little earlier

would not be surprised to see you go to him as envoy? I
speak from my own experience. I took the same view as
you, and I see how strongly it is censured. Nor are the two
of us the only targets for criticism. Was it without good
cause that our gallant Pansa spoke just now in such detail
and at such length? What was his purpose except to free
himself from a false suspicion of treachery? And whence
arose that suspicion? From his sudden advocacy of peace,
which he launched on the spur of the moment, having
been deceived by the same error as ourselves.</p>
