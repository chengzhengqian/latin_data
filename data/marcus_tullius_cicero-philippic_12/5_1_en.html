and assailant of their native land. One feels shame in the
sight of that excellent army, made up of two armies,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL507_195_6" id="target_note_LCL507_195_6"><sup>6</sup></a> which
has already been reviewed<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL507_195_7" id="target_note_LCL507_195_7"><sup>7</sup></a> and has set out for Mutina. If
they hear the name of peace, that is, of our fear, they will
undoubtedly halt, if not turn around. Why should they hasten
to do battle, when the senate calls them back, sounding
the signal for retreat?</p>

<p>[4] And what can be more improper<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">9</span><span class="br"></span>
than for us to decide upon peace without the knowledge of
those who are fighting the war—and not only without their
knowledge but against their will? Or do you imagine that
Aulus Hirtius, our splendid consul, or Gaius Caesar, born
by the grace of the gods to match these times, whose letters
declaring their hope for victory I hold in my hand—do
you imagine they want peace? They aim at being victorious,
and they have set their hearts on peace, that sweetest
and most beautiful of words, through victory, not bargaining.
Again, how do you think Gaul will feel about this
news? She plays the leading role in repelling, conducting,
and sustaining this war. Gaul, following Decimus Brutus’
simple nod—I won’t say his order—strengthened the war’s
beginnings with arms, men, and money. That same province
put her whole body in the way of Marcus Antonius’
cruelty; she is being drained, ravaged, burned. She calmly
endures all the injuries of war, if only she can thrust back
the danger of slavery. And to say nothing of the other<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">10</span><span class="br"></span>
parts of Gaul—for they are all equal—the people of Patavium
kept out some of the men sent by Antonius and threw
out others, while helping our commanders with money,
troops, and what they needed most, weapons. The rest did
likewise, though formerly they were in the same cause as
Antonius and were believed to be alienated from the senate
