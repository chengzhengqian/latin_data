theirs? Shall we not have been defeated once and for all

consular. Add Lucius, aspirant to the consulship. Throw in
the rest, and not only those who are members of this body,
whose minds are on offices and commands. Don’t despise
even the likes of Tiro Numisius or Mustela Seius. Peace
made with them will be no peace, but a pact of slavery. Not
only in this body but also in a public meeting, Pansa, you
rightly praised a fine saying of Lucius Piso, a distinguished
gentleman. He declared that he would leave Italy, abandon
his household gods and his ancestral home, if—may
the gods avert the omen!—Antonius crushed the Republic.</p>

the Republic as crushed if so many who are so wicked, so
bold, and so vicious are taken back? We had all we could do
to put up with them before they had polluted themselves
with such atrocities against their country. Do you think the
community will find them tolerable now that they are
steeped in every crime? Believe me, we shall either have to
follow your plan to leave, retire, and lead the life of needy
wanderers, or we shall have to permit our throats to be slit
by the criminals and fall in our native land. Where now,
Gaius Pansa, are those noble exhortations of yours with
which you roused the senate and fired the people, as they
not only heard but also learned that to a Roman no fate is
more horrible than slavery? Did we put on military cloaks,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">16</span><span class="br"></span>
take up arms, rouse up all young men of military age from
all over Italy with a view to sending envoys on a peace mission
after we had raised a great and most splendid army?
