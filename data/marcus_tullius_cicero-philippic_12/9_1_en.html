<p>Am <span class="italic">I</span> to be a member of this delegation, or am I to be
added to that council in which even if I dissent from the
rest, the Roman people are not going to know it? The consequence
will be that if there should be any relaxation
or concession, Antonius will commit further wrongdoings
with my good name continually at risk, since it will appear
that the power to do wrong was conceded to him by me.
But even supposing peace with Marcus Antonius’ banditry<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">17</span><span class="br"></span>
was something to be considered, still, I was the last person
who should have been chosen to negotiate such a peace. I
was never in favor of sending envoys. Before the envoys returned,
I was bold enough to say that even if they brought
peace itself, it should be rejected, inasmuch as under the
name of peace war would lurk.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL507_203_14" id="target_note_LCL507_203_14"><sup>14</sup></a> I took the lead in the putting

public enemy, while others called him an adversary; I consistently
called this a war, while others called it a public
emergency. And this I did not in the senate only; I always
used the same language before the people. And I have
all along inveighed not only against Antonius but against
the partners and ministers of his crimes, both those present
and those who are with him, in fact against the whole
family circle of Marcus Antonius. And so, traitorous citizens,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">18</span><span class="br"></span>
when they were lively and cheerful at the prospect of
peace and were congratulating each other as though they
had triumphed, were for rejecting me as biased, were protesting
about me. Neither did they trust Servilius, remembering
how Antony had been impaled by his views expressed
in this body. Lucius Caesar, though a brave and
resolute senator, they bore in mind was nonetheless Antonius’
uncle, Calenus his agent, and Piso his close friend.
As for yourself, Pansa,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL507_203_15" id="target_note_LCL507_203_15"><sup>15</sup></a> our most energetic and valiant
