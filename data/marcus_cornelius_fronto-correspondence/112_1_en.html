<h3>Fronto to Marcus as Caesar.</h3>
<p>To my Lord. <span class="marginNote right">? 148–149 <span class="sc">a.d.</span></span></p>
<p>I have been seized with very severe pain in the groin. All the pain from the back and loins has concentrated itself there. Farewell, my Lord. Greet my Lady.</p>
<h3>Marcus Aurelius to Fronto.</h3>
<p>To my master, greeting. <span class="marginNote right">? 148–149 <span class="sc">a.d.</span></span></p>
<p>You tell me that you have pain in the groin, my master. Remembering what distress that pain generally causes you, I feel the most serious anxiety. But I comfort myself with the hope that in the interval required for bringing the news here, the intensity of the pain may have yielded to fomentations and remedies. We are still experiencing summer heat. But since our little girls<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL112_225_1" id="target_note_LCL112_225_1"><sup>1</sup></a>—we mustn’t boast—are quite well, we think that we are enjoying the healthiest of weather and the balmy temperature of spring. Farewell, my best of masters.</p>

<p>I have been seized with very severe pains again in the other side of the groin.</p>
