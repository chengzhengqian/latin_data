luncheon. What do you think I ate? A wee bit of bread, though I saw others devouring beans, onions, and herrings full of roe. We then worked hard at grape-gathering,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL112_183_1" id="target_note_LCL112_183_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and had a good sweat, and were merry and, as the poet says, <span class="italic">still left some clusters hanging high as gleanings of the vintage</span>.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL112_183_2" id="target_note_LCL112_183_2"><sup>2</sup></a> After six o’clock we came home.</p>
<p>2. I did but little work and that to no purpose. Then I had a long chat with my little mother as she sat on the bed. My talk was this: <span class="italic">What do you think my Fronto is now doing?</span> Then she: <span class="italic">And what do you think my Gratia is doing?</span> Then I: <span class="italic">And what do you think our little spairow, the wee Gratia</span>,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL112_183_3" id="target_note_LCL112_183_3"><sup>3</sup></a> <span class="italic">is doing?</span> Whilst we were chattering in this way and disputing which of us two loved the one or other of you two the better, the gong sounded, an intimation that my father had gone to his bath. So we had supper after we had bathed in the oil-press room; I do not mean bathed in the oil-press room, but when we had bathed, had supper there, and we enjoyed hearing the yokels chaffing one another. After coming back, before I turn over and snore, 1 get my task done and give my dearest of masters an account of the day’s doings, and if I could miss him more, I would not grudge wasting away a little more. Farewell, my Fronto, wherever you are, most honey-sweet, my love, my delight. How is it between you and me? I love you and you are away.</p>
