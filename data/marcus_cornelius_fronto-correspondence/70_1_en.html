dead and done with as far as I am concerned. Farewell, my dearest, my most beloved friend; farewell, my most honourable consul, my most sweet master, whom I have not seen these two years; for as to what some say, that two months<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL112_141_1" id="target_note_LCL112_141_1"><sup>1</sup></a> have intervened, they only count days.

<p>To the most honourable consul, his master, M. Caesar, greeting.</p>
<p>Three years ago I remember turning aside with my father to the estate of Pompeius Falco<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL112_141_2" id="target_note_LCL112_141_2"><sup>2</sup></a> when on our way home from the vintage; and that I saw there a tree with many branches, which he called by its proper name of <span class="italic">catachanna</span>.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL112_141_3" id="target_note_LCL112_141_3"><sup>3</sup></a> But it seemed to me a new and extraordinary tree, bearing as it did upon its single stem off-shoots of almost every kind of tree . . . .</p>

<p>M. <span class="sc">Aurelius Caesar</span> to his own consul and master, greeting.</p>
<p>1. Since my last letter to you nothing has happened worth writing of, or the knowledge of which would be of the slightest interest. For we have passed whole days more or less in the same occupations: the same theatre, the same dislike of it, the same longing for you—the same, do I say?
