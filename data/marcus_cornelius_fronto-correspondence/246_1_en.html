Have they all been and are they all senators, who up till now have ever been given the post of notary public at Concordia?</p>
<p>Was Volumnius elected notary and senator by a resolution of the local senate? and has he made as many as four payments in respect of his senatorship?</p>
<p>Has he enjoyed for five and forty years all the rewards and privileges attaching to senators, at public banquets, in the senate-house, at shows? Has he dined, has he sat, has he voted as a senator?</p>
<p>In the case of public deputations has Volumnius been often chosen to be a deputy? Have his expenses as deputy always been voted to Volumnius from the public chest?</p>
<p>Again is there in the municipal registers record of a deputation on the corn supply undertaken by Volumnius at his own charges?</p>
<p>4. If all this that I have mentioned above has been so decreed, so paid, so done, how can you be in doubt after five and forty years whether he is a senator, who has been a notary, has paid in money in respect of his being senator, has enjoyed the privileges of being senator, has discharged its duties? And what is there, my son, what is there that you would wish more plainly proved? Since ........ (has enjoyed) the privileges, paid-in moneys, discharged duties.</p>
<p>5. After these questions and answers of mine backwards and forwards, is it not also a begging of the question .... Volumnius has been accused of forcing his way into the senate illegally, since as a man temporarily banished he had no right to enter <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber"></span><span class="br"></span>
