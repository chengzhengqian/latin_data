<h3>Marcus Aurelius to Fronto</h3>
<p>To my master, greeting. <span class="marginNote right">145–147 <span class="sc">a.d.</span></span></p>
<p>If the pains in your neck get better, even in two days’ time, it will help on my convalescence more than anything, my master. I have had a bath and to-day even done a little walking and taken a little more food, but not as yet without discomfort. Farewell, my most delightful of masters. My mother greets you.</p>
<h3>Marcus Aurelius to Fronto</h3>
<p>To my master, greeting. <span class="marginNote right">145–147 <span class="sc">a.d.</span></span></p>
<p>I cannot but be distressed that at the very time when you were writing to me your neck was so painful, nor indeed do I wish to be, nor ought I to be, other than distressed. As for me, thanks be to the Gods and your prayers, I have bathed to-day, and taken sufficient food, and wine too I have used with relish. Farewell, my most delightful of masters. My mother greets you.</p>
<h3>Fronto to Marcus as Caesar</h3>
<p>To my Lord. <span class="marginNote right">145–147 <span class="sc">a.d.</span></span></p>
<p>The pains in my neck are no easier, but my mind was set at rest as soon as I knew that you had been able to take a bath and relish your wine. Farewell, my Lord. Greet your Lady.</p>
