This we may presume would have had considerable historical value. This preamble covered twenty-eight pages of the Codex. Fronto praises Lucius extravagantly, setting him even above the great Trajan. But much of the eulogy is mere rhetoric, and he seems to have had his eye on a rhetorical commonplace, Livy’s sketch of Hannibal. The piece is too mutilated for us to be able to judge Fronto’s performance fairly, out his account of the virtues and exploits of Lucius does not tally with what we learn of him elsewhere. Lucian may be referring to Fronto in his <span class="italic">Quom. Hist.
