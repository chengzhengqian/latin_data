<h3>Marcus Aurelius to Fronto</h3>
<p><span class="sc">Hail</span>, my best of masters. <span class="marginNote right">? 140–143 <span class="sc">a.d.</span></span></p>
<p>1. I know that on everyone’s birthday his friends undertake vows for him whose birthday it is. I, however, since I love you as myself, wish to offer up on this day, which is your birthday, hearty prayers for myself. I call, therefore, with my vows to hear me each one of all the Gods, who anywhere in the world provide present and prompt help for men; who anywhere give their aid and shew their power in dreams or mysteries, or healing, or oracles; and I place myself according to the nature of each vow in that spot where the God who is invested with that power may the more readily hear.</p>
<p>2. Therefore I now first climb the citadel of the God of Pergamum and beseech Aesculapius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL112_51_1" id="target_note_LCL112_51_1"><sup>1</sup></a> to bless my master’s health and mightily protect it. Thence I pass on to Athens and, clasping Minerva by her knees, I entreat and pray that, if ever I know aught of letters, this knowledge may find its way into my breast from the lips of none other than Fronto.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL112_51_2" id="target_note_LCL112_51_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Now I return to Rome and implore with vows the Gods that guard the roads and patrol the seas that in every journey of mine you may be with me, and I be not worn out with so constant, so consuming a desire for you. Lastly, I ask all the tutelary deities of all the nations, and the very grove, whose rustling fills the Capitoline Hill, to grant us this, that I may keep with you this day, on which you were born for me, with you in good health and spirits. Farewell, my sweetest and dearest of masters. I beseech you, take care of yourself, that when I come I may see you My Lady greets you.</p>
