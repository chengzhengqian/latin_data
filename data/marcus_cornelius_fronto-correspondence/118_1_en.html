civilities, which both honour and conscience permit a proconsul to shew his friends, so long as no one else is injured thereby—these I ask you freely to extend to Themistocles. Farewell, my most delightful of masters. No answer is required.</p>

<p>1. The facts testify, most reverend Emperor, that I have spared no pains and earnestly desired to discharge the duties of proconsul. For as long as the matter was undecided, I claimed my rights under the lot and, when by virtue of having more children another proved to have the prior claim, I was as satisfied, as if I had chosen it, with that most splendid province which was left to me. Then I took active steps to enlist the help of my friends in all that concerned the ordering of the province. Relations and friends of mine, of whose loyalty and integrity I was assured, I called from home<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL112_237_1" id="target_note_LCL112_237_1"><sup>1</sup></a> to assist me. I wrote to my intimates at Alexandria<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL112_237_2" id="target_note_LCL112_237_2"><sup>2</sup></a> to repair with all speed to Athens and await me there, and I deputed the management of my Greek correspondence to those most learned men. From Cilicia too I called upon eminent citizens to join me, for, owing to my always having advocated the public and private interests of Cilicians before you, I had hosts of friends in that province. From Mauretania also I summoned to my side Julius Senex, a man whose love for me was no less than mine for him, that I might avail myself not only of his loyalty and diligence, but also of his military activity in the hunting down and suppressing of brigands.</p>
