have come to us, if you could have walked even with difficulty. But you will come often and join us, if the Gods will, in keeping all our fêtes. Farewell, my most delightful of masters. My mother greets you.</p>
<h3>Fronto to Marcus as Caesar</h3>
<p>To my Lord. <span class="marginNote right">? 154–156 <span class="sc">a.d.</span></span></p>
<p>While my attendants were carrying me here as usual from the baths in a sedan-chair, they dashed me somewhat carelessly against the scorching entrance to the bath. So my knee was both scraped and scorched: afterwards, too, a swelling came up on the sore place. The doctors advised my keeping in bed. Should you think fit, please also give my Lord your father this reason, but only if you think fit. To-morrow too, I must support an intimate friend in court. So by to-day’s idleness and rest I shall get myself ready for to-morrow’s duties. Our Victorinus will do the pleading, for do not suppose that I shall plead. Farewell, sweetest of Lords. Greet my Lady.</p>
<h3>Marcus Aurelius to Fronto</h3>
<p>To my master, greeting. <span class="marginNote right">? 154–156 <span class="sc">a.d.</span></span></p>
<p>You have added to my anxieties, which I hope you will as soon as possible relieve by the subsidence of the pains in the knee and the swelling. As for me, my Lady mother’s illness gives me no rest. There is, besides, the near approach of Faustina’s lying-in. But we must have faith in the Gods. Farewell, my most delightful of masters. My mother greets you.</p>
