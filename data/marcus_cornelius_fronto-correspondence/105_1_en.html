<h3>Fronto to Marcus as Caesar</h3>
<p>To my Lord. <span class="marginNote right">145–147 <span class="sc">a.d.</span></span></p>
<p>I have slept late. I have sent you a theme: the case is a serious one. A consul of the Roman people, laying aside his robes, has donned a coat of mail and among the young men at the feast of Minerva<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL112_211_1a" id="target_note_LCL112_211_1a"><sup>1</sup></a> has slain a lion in the sight of the Roman people. He is denounced before the Censors. Put into shape and develop. Farewell, most sweet Lord. Greet your Lady.</p>

<p>When did it occur and was it at Rome? Do you mean that the event took place under Domitian at his Alban Villa?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL112_211_2" id="target_note_LCL112_211_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Besides in such a theme it will take longer labour to make the fact credible than to be angered at it. It seems to me an improbable subject. I certainly should have preferred one such as I asked for. Let me know the date by return.</p>
