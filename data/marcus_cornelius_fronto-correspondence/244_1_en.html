<p>I have had severe pain in the eyes .... No pain or lumbago in the side or back came on. The Greeks call the back-bone ίερὸν ὀστoῦν (the sacred bone): Suetonius Tranquillus calls it the <span class="italic">sacred spine</span>. For my part I would gladly not know the Greek or Latin name of a single member, if I could only live without pain in it.</p>

<p>........ He has been brought to my notice by learned men and close friends of my own, whose personal wishes rightly have the greatest weight with me. Therefore, if you love me, accord to Volumnius so much respect and opportunity of gaining your friendship, for very dear friends have enlisted my sympathy for him. Therefore I would ask you to welcome him with such kindly friendship as the great Achilles wished to shew, when he bid the son of Menoetius <span class="italic">mix the wine stronger</span>.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL113_175_3" id="target_note_LCL113_175_3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
