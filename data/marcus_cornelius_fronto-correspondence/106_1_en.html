<h3>Marcus Aurelius to Fronto</h3>
<p>To my master, greeting. <span class="marginNote right">145–147 <span class="sc">a.d.</span></span></p>
<p>That you should keep a happy vintage, and that in the best of health, is my wish, my master. I am much relieved by the news of my little lady<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL112_213_1" id="target_note_LCL112_213_1"><sup>1</sup></a> telling me, the Gods be praised, that she is better. Farewell, my most delightful of masters.</p>
<h3>Fronto to Marcus as Caesar</h3>

Every morning I pray the Gods for Faustina, for you know that by so doing I wish and pray for your health. Farewell, my most sweet Lord. Greet my Lady.</p>

<p>As far as I am concerned, the writing is finished—so send me something else to write—but my secretary was not at hand to copy out what I wrote.

Farewell, my sweetest of masters. The Lady my mother sends you greeting
