the whole word-population, so to speak, just as in war, when a legion has to be enrolled, we not only collect the volunteers but also search out the skulkers of military age, so when there is need of word-reinforcements, we must not only make use of the voluntary recruits that offer themselves, but fetch out the skulkers and hunt them up for service.</p>
<p>3. At this point too, as I think, we must seek skilfully to find out the methods by which words are sought for, that we may not wait gaping open-mouthed till such time as a word shall fall of itself upon our tongues like a god-send<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL113_55_1" id="target_note_LCL113_55_1"><sup>1</sup></a> from heaven; but that we should know their haunts and their coverts, so that, when we have need of choice words, we may follow them up along a beaten track rather than have no path to help us forward.</p>

The distinction of the two <span class="italic">genera</span> is not given in what we have. The three classes are (1) that of existence, that a man must exist and perform certain <span class="italic">munera, e.g</span>. eat, in order to live; (2) of quality, he must be such and such and have such and such habits and idiosyncrasies; (3) of objective or result, the two previous <span class="italic">officia</span>, enabling him to discharge the third. This third class is concerned wholly with <span class="italic">negotia</span>, work done, and is selfcontained. Under this comes <span class="italic">sapientia</span>. Since a man must live before he can be wise, a <span class="italic">munus</span>, like eating, is an <span class="italic">officium</span> of the wise man, though it has no direct connexion with his <span class="italic">negotium</span>, which is wisdom. Eating belongs to <span class="italic">species prima</span>, which is common to all men, but wisdom to <span class="italic">species tertia</span>. The pursuit of eloquence comes under <span class="italic">species secunda</span>, which varies with every man.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL113_55_2a').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note inline" id="note_LCL113_55_3"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL113_55_3" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">3</sup>See I. 219; n. 115.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL113_55_3').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
