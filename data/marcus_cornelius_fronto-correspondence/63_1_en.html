<p>As you remember, Caesar, when I returned thanks<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL112_127_1" id="target_note_LCL112_127_1"><sup>1</sup></a> to you in the Senate. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .Farewell.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Antoninus Caesar</span> to Marcus Fronto.</p>
<p>How great is your good-will towards myself I have long known well enough, by heaven, but what astonishes me . . . . best of orators, is that in a subject to you so hackneyed and thread-bare you can find anything to say that is new and worthy of your abilities. But no doubt the mere wish is an immense help towards what you can do so well. Nothing could be more effective than your thoughts, nothing more complimentary, yet without any sacrifice of good sense, than your expression of them. For I will not be guilty of defrauding you of your legitimate praise for fear of arrogantly praising the praise of myself. You have done your duty pleasingly and in unexceptionable fashion, for which, apart from all question of the subject, you deserve every credit. But as for shewing me your mind, it has not done much in that way, for I knew well enough that you always would put the most favourable construction on every word and act of mine. Farewell, my Fronto, my very dear friend.</p>
