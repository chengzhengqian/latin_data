when I praised Hadrian, ran for my master, but today I run for myself; for myself, I say, and write this speech to please myself. I shall compose it, therefore, at my ease, slowly, leisurely, placidly.</p>
<p>2. If you are very impatient for it, amuse yourself the while in other ways; kiss your father, embrace him, lastly, praise him yourself. But you may certainly look forward to hearing on August 13th what you would wish and expressed as you would wish. Farewell, Caesar, and prove worthy of your father, and if you wish to write anything, write slowly.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Marcus Aurelius to Fronto</span></h3>
<p><span class="sc">My</span> most honourable consul, Fronto. <span class="marginNote right">143 <span class="sc">a.d.</span></span></p>
<p>1. I give in, you have won: beyond question you have conquered in loving all lovers that have ever lived. Take the wreath and let the herald, too, proclaim in the ears of all before your tribunal this your victory—<span class="italic">M. Cornelius Fronto, consul, is the winner. He is crowned in the contest of the Great Friendship-Games.</span> Yet, though vanquished, will I not falter or fail in my devotion. Therefore shall you indeed my master, love me more than anyone of men loves any man, while I, who have less energy in loving, will love you more than anyone else loves you, more, in fact, than you love yourself. I see I shall have a competitor in Gratia,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL112_113_1" id="target_note_LCL112_113_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and I fear that I may not be able to surpass her. For, as Plautus says, in her case, “not only has the rain of love drenched her dress with its thunder-drops, but soaked into her very marrow.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL112_113_2" id="target_note_LCL112_113_2"><sup>2</sup></a> </p>
