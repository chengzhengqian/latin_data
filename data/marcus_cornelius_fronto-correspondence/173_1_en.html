day<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL113_33_1" id="target_note_LCL113_33_1"><sup>1</sup></a> for me, and I am assured that they will grant my prayer, for I commend to their bounty him whom the Gods themselves delight to aid and deem worthy of their help. You, my master, when other joyous thoughts pass through your mind on this your festal day, count over to yourself those who dearly love you: among the chief of these set this your pupil, set the Lord my brother there, both of us men that love you passionately.

Grant this to your Antoninus, who asks it with sincerity and concern.</p>
