<p><span class="sc">Fronto</span> to Arrius Antoninus, greeting.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL113_189_1" id="target_note_LCL113_189_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>I congratulate myself that for most men it is ............ that I am looked up to by you quite as a parent. Consequently very many who desire your favour have recourse to me. I do not give them a hearing at haphazard and without circumspection, but I lend my support to those whose petition is honest. To those, however, who wish to obtain some dishonest advantage from you, I say <span class="italic">Impossible</span>. That Baburiana should rather from me .................... men dear to me and I would most gladly oblige them, only so far however as is compatible above and before all with a regard for your justice .... It seemed in keeping with your humane disposition<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL113_189_2" id="target_note_LCL113_189_2"><sup>2</sup></a>; I took upon myself to commend Baburiana’s wish to you, and I do commend it most heartily ............ with regard to constructing the work ........................................</p>
<p>Baburiana bowed to your decision not resignedly only but even promptly and almost willingly .... What then does she ask which would not be worth your while to grant, and at the same time very much to Baburiana’s interest to obtain .... payment of interest in accordance with your decision
