my circulation failed and the pulse being imperceptible I became unconscious; in fact, I was given up by my family as dead and remained insensible for some time. The doctors were given no time or opportunity to revive or relieve me even with a warm bath or cold water or food, except that after nightfall I swallowed a few morsels of bread soaked in wine. Thus I was gradually brought quite round. For three whole days after I did not recover my voice. But now by God’s help I am getting on very comfortably. I walk with more ease and my voice is stronger and more distinct; in fine, I purpose, please God, to take a drive to-morrow. If I find I can stand the flint paving well, I will hasten to you as fast as I can. Only when I see you shall I live. I will set out from Rome, please God, on the 7th day before the Kalends. Farewell, my Lord, most sweet, most missed, my best reason for living. Greet your Lady.</p>

<p>To my master, greeting. <span class="marginNote right">? 154–156 <span class="sc">a.d.</span></span></p>
<p>After your absence I was longing to see you: what think you<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL112_243_1" id="target_note_LCL112_243_1"><sup>1</sup></a> after your danger? for your escape from which, my master, I thank the Gods a second time after reading your letter, which again, as it were, reassures me: it struck me with consternation when you gave me an account of your condition. But the Gods be thanked I have you still and, as you promise, shall see you again soon: and I have good hopes of your continued convalescence. My mother greets you. Farewell, my most delightful master.</p>
