to keep safe for me the sweetest of masters, in whom I find a greater solace for this life than you can find for your sorrow from any source.</p>
<p>I have not written with my own hand because after my bath in the evening even my hand was shaky. Farewell, my most delightful of masters.</p>

<p>1. With many sorrows of this kind has Fortune afflicted me all my life long. For, not to mention my other calamities, I have lost five children under the most distressing circumstances possible to myself. For I lost all five separately, in every case an only child, suffering this series of bereavements in such a way that I never had a child born to me except while bereaved of another. So I always lost children without any left to console me and with my grief fresh upon me I begat others.</p>
<p>2. But I bore with more fortitude those woes by which I myself alone was racked. For my mind, struggling with my own grief, matched as in a single combat man to man, equal with equal, made a stout resistance. But no longer do I withstand a single or solitary opponent, for grief upon bitter grief is multiplied and I can no longer bear the consummation of my woes, but as my Victorinus weeps, I waste away, I melt away along with him. Often I even find fault with the immortal Gods and upbraid the Fates with reproaches.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL113_223_2" id="target_note_LCL113_223_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
