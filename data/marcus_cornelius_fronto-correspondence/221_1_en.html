<h2>Marcus Antoninus to Fronto</h2>
<p>To my master greeting. <span class="marginNote right">163 <span class="sc">a.d.</span></span></p>
<p>.... since nothing is more to be counted upon and more readily given, my master, than the kindly construction you put upon our services in respect to yourself. Write then to my Lord,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL113_129_1" id="target_note_LCL113_129_1"><sup>1</sup></a> who promises you many letters in return, that you have received his message from me. Add also other tokens of your affection and good-nature, my master, for he rests on them, as he has every reason to do.</p>
<p>For the last two days I have had no respite except such sleep as I have got at night: consequently I have had no time as yet to read your lengthy letter to my Lord, but I greedily look forward to an opportunity of doing so to-morrow. Farewell, my most delightful of masters. Love to your grandson.</p>

Besides flattering Lucius on the military successes, he praises the eloquence of his despatch to the senate. The rest of the letter is a glorification of eloquence, in which he includes all good literature, shewing its essential importance to the ruler and the general in the field. Unfortunately the letter is much mutilated, and many interesting passages are only partially intelligible. The last part is taken up with a comparison between Luciusâ€™s despatch and other historical documents of a similar character. The picture of the demoralised army is given again in the <span class="italic">Principia Historiae</span>, but the restoration of discipline was the work of Avidius Cassius and Martius Verus and the other generals.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL113_129_2a').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
