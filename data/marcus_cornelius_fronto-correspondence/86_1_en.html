<p>To my Lord.</p>
<p>I am keeping my bed. If I should be fit for the journey when you go to Centumcellae<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL112_173_1" id="target_note_LCL112_173_1"><sup>1</sup></a> I shall see you, please God, at Lorium on the seventh day before the Ides.

Cato, in consequence, is of opinion that no one should bring into court his own or others’ children to excite pity, nor wives nor relations, nor any women at all. Greet my Lady your mother.</p>
