<h3>Fronto to Marcus as Caesar</h3>
<p>To my Lord. <span class="marginNote right">? 154–156 <span class="sc">a.d.</span></span></p>
<p>I love you ten times as much—I have seen your daughter!<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL112_251_1" id="target_note_LCL112_251_1"><sup>1</sup></a> I seem to have seen you as well as Faustina in your infancy: so much that is good in both your faces is blended in hers. I love you ten times as much. Farewell, sweetest of Lords. Greet your Lady.</p>
<h3>Marcus Aurelius to Fronto</h3>
<p>To my master. <span class="marginNote right">? 154–156 <span class="sc">a.d.</span></span></p>
<p>We too love Gratia the more for her likeness to you.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL112_251_2" id="target_note_LCL112_251_2"><sup>2</sup></a> So we can easily understand how our little girl’s likeness to both of us endears her to you, and in every way it is a delight to me that you have seen her. Farewell, my best of masters.</p>

<p>This is the third day that I have been troubled all night long with griping in the stomach and diarrhoea. Last night, indeed, I suffered so much that I have not been able to go out, but am keeping my bed. The doctors recommend a bath. I have prayed the Gods to give you many happy returns of the day.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL112_251_3" id="target_note_LCL112_251_3"><sup>3</sup></a> Farewell, my Lord.
