<h3>M. <span class="sc">Aurelius to Fronto</span></h3>
<p>To my master. <span class="marginNote right">145–147 <span class="sc">a.d.</span></span></p>
<p>. . . . . . . . in two days now, if that is best, let us clench our teeth all the same; and as you are just recovering from illness, to shorten the journey, wait for us at Caieta. I begin to be dainty,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL112_193_1" id="target_note_LCL112_193_1"><sup>1</sup></a> as generally happens with those who have at last in their grasp what they long for: they are carried away,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL112_193_2" id="target_note_LCL112_193_2"><sup>2</sup></a> they feel in affluence, they are exultant: for myself, however, I have even lost the taste for everything. My Lady mother greets you. I shall ask her to-day to bring Gratia to me—<span class="italic">even the smoke of one’s fatherland</span>, as the Greek poet<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL112_193_3" id="target_note_LCL112_193_3"><sup>3</sup></a> says. Farewell, my—all in all—master. I love myself at the thought of seeing you.</p>
<h3>Fronto to Marcus as Caesar</h3>
<p>To my Lord. <span class="marginNote right">145–147 <span class="sc">a.d.</span></span></p>
<p>After you had set out, I was seized with pain in the knee, but so slight that I could both walk slowly and use a carriage. To-night the pain has come on more violently, but so that I can easily bear it lying down, if it gets no worse. I hear that your Augusta is poorly. I pray the Gods, indeed, to have care of her health. Farewell, most sweet Lord. Greet my Lady.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL112_193_4" id="target_note_LCL112_193_4"><sup>4</sup></a> </p>
