How often have you supported me with your hands, lifted me up when scarcely able to rise, and well-nigh carried me when hardly able to walk from bodily weakness!<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL113_241_1" id="target_note_LCL113_241_1"><sup>1</sup></a> With what a cheerful and friendly countenance have you always accosted me! How readily engaged in conversation, how long continued it, how reluctantly concluded it! All which I value above measure. Just as in the inspection of entrails the smallest and most insignificant parts when laid open generally imply the greatest good-fortune, and by omens from ants and bees the greatest events are foretold, so by even the least and most trivial signs of deference and good-will, vouchsafed by the one and very Emperor, are signified, as I think, those things that are the most estimable and the most coveted among men, love and honour. Therefore all the favours I have had to ask from my Lord your brother I have preferred to ask and obtain through you.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Fronto</span> to Caelius Optatus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL113_241_2" id="target_note_LCL113_241_2"><sup>2</sup></a> greeting.</p>
<p>There is a bond of the closest intimacy between Sardius Saturninus and myself through his sons, young men of the highest culture, whom I have constantly under my roof. I recommend him to you most cordially, my brother, and ask that, if any business bring him to you, you should judge as worthy of all respect a man very dear to me, and should befriend him with all your power.</p>
