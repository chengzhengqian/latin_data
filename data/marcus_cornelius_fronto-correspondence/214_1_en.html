for myself a coin of Antoninus or Commodus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL113_115_1a" id="target_note_LCL113_115_1a"><sup>1</sup></a> or Pius? Those old words are stained and contaminated and discoloured and spotted, aye, more spotted than a nurse’s apron. There is need, therefore, of all your pains to render your language, if possible, current coin; be ever on the look-out for some word, not one coined by you, for that, indeed, is an absurdity, but used by you more elegantly or more aptly or more happily than by others.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL113_115_2" id="target_note_LCL113_115_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>13. Says Sallust: <span class="italic">Such reverent regard</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL113_115_3" id="target_note_LCL113_115_3"><sup>3</sup></a> <span class="italic">and affection did our ancestors have for the Italian race</span>. This word <span class="italic">antiquitas</span> is often used, but nowhere employed in that sense,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL113_115_4" id="target_note_LCL113_115_4"><sup>4</sup></a> and therefore is not properly correct. For it is commonly said that what is preferable is <span class="italic">anliquius</span>. Thence undoubtedly did Sallust derive his use of <span class="italic">antiquitas</span> itself; and, since a word that is less usual is also less clear, he interpreted it by means of the following word, <span class="italic">antiquitatis curaeque</span>.</p>
<p>In this way ........................................ In the mouths of the people words of this kind have hitherto always been in vogue; Accius, Plautus, Sallust very often, even occasionally Cicero, (use them) ....</p>
