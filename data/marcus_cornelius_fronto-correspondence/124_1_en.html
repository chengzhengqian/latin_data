<h3>Fronto to Marcus as Caesar</h3>
<p>To my Lord. <span class="marginNote right">? 154–156 <span class="sc">a.d.</span></span></p>
<p>The very day on which I proposed to start I felt a pain in my knee. I hope to be all right in a day or two. Farewell, my best of Lords. Greet my Lady.</p>
<h3>Marcus Aurelius to Fronto</h3>
<p>To my master, greeting. <span class="marginNote right">? 154–156 <span class="sc">a.d</span></span></p>
<p>By this time, at all events, my master, I hope you can send better news, for your letter says that you were in pain up to the time when you wrote. I have dictated this, walking about. For the state of my wretched body requires that exercise just now. But I shall only feel the full benefit of the vintage season when we find your health beginning to mend. Farewell, my most delightful of masters.</p>
<h3>Fronto to Marcus as Caesar</h3>
<p>To my Lord. <span class="marginNote right">? 154–156 <span class="sc">a.d.</span></span></p>
<p>I am laid up with pain in the sole of my foot. That is why I have not paid you my respects these past days. Farewell, best of Lords. Greet my Lady.</p>
<h3>Marcus Aurelius to Fronto</h3>
<p>To my master. <span class="marginNote right">? 154–156 <span class="sc">a.d.</span></span></p>
<p>When you are well enough to walk comfortably, then we also shall be delighted to see you. May the Gods bring that about as soon as possible, and the pain in your foot be better. Farewell, my best of masters.</p>
