.... a troop of Roman cavalry, a part of the senate is dishonoured in the person of one man .... scarcely ever have so many men lost their lives physically by lightning as will lose theirs civilly by your decision ....</p>
<p>7. He, who has preferred being to seeming good, has enjoyed far from prosperous fortune .... Certain it is that he who cares not to be thought virtuous does not care to be virtuous either .... Nor is there anyone who is greatly interested in acquiring the noble arts that is not interested to know whether he has acquired them ................ but if he can grant a divorce and Gnaeus can be bereavedâ€”that is what I doubt. For what is long can on occasion become longer, what is deep, deeper, what is numerous, more numerous. These and similar words I see admit of some latitude of increase, but nothing can become fuller than full. For surely if a cup be full, it would be useless to ask for it to be filled still more, unless you emptied some of it. For indeed, since in all business time is limited, and one time is closely associated with this business and another with that, consider in your own mind whether this case lacks the time for proving the point urged. Before that .... he ought to have been elected senator by the senate: he was elected; when elected he ought to have exercised his rights: he did exercise them in many ways; after exercising them he ought to have paid in money by fixed instalments: he did pay this in four times; he ought to have discharged the duties of senatorship: he did discharge them; ................ whatever is added to this will be a superfluity.
