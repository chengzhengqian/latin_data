Let me have the name of the people’s tribune against whom Acilius the censor, of whom I wrote, set a mark.</p>
<h3>Fronto to Marcus as Caesar</h3>
<p>To my Lord. <span class="marginNote right">145–147 <span class="sc">a.d.</span></span></p>
<p>My answer to you, my Lord, has been somewhat delayed, for I delayed to open your letter, as I was on my way to the forum to plead. I feel better, but the little sore is deeper. Farewell, my sweetest of Lords. Greet my Lady.</p>
<p>M. Lucilius,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL112_215_1a" id="target_note_LCL112_215_1a"><sup>1</sup></a> a tribune of the people, against the decision of his colleagues and with his own hand cast into prison by force a Roman citizen, though they ordered his discharge. For that action he was “marked” by the Censors. First divide the case, then try your hand on either side both as accuser and defender. Farewell, my Lord, the light of all your friends. Greet your lady mother.</p>
<h3>Marcus Aurelius to Fronto</h3>
<p>To my master. <span class="marginNote right">145–147 <span class="sc">a.d.</span></span></p>
<p>Gaius Aufidius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL112_215_2" id="target_note_LCL112_215_2"><sup>2</sup></a> gives himself airs, extols his own judgment to the skies, says that not another man more just than himself ever came from Umbria, for I must not exaggerate, to Rome. What need of more? He would rather win praise as a judge
