<h2>From Lucius Verus to Fronto</h2>
<p>To my master, greeting. <span class="marginNote right">163 <span class="sc">a.d.</span></span></p>
<p>.... I have refrained from relating to you myself all that had necessarily to be set right or provided for in good time, or quickly remedied or carefully arranged.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL113_117_1" id="target_note_LCL113_117_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Make allowance for my scrupulosity, if shackled with urgent cares I have dealt first with the business in. hand and, counting on your good-natured indulgence towards me, have meanwhile given up writing.
