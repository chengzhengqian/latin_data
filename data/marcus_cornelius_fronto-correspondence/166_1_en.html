their dreams; and wanderers come home—in their dreams. Such dreams generally turn out true.</p>
<p>12. So, Marcus, if you need a dream hereafter, I advise you to sleep with a will, until such time as what you desire and as you wish it may fall to your lot in your waking hours.</p>

<h2>Marcus Antoninus to Fronto</h2>
<p>To my master, greeting. <span class="marginNote right">162 A.D.</span></p>
<p>I have just received your letter, which I will enjoy presently. For at the moment I have duties hanging over me that can hardly be begged off. Meanwhile I will tell you, my master, shortly, as I am busy, what you want to hear, that our little daughter<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL113_19_1" id="target_note_LCL113_19_1"><sup>1</sup></a> is better and can run about the bedroom.</p>
<p>After dictating the above I read the Alsian letters, my master, at my leisure, while the others were dining and I was lying down at eight o’clock, satisfied with a light repast. <span class="italic">Much good has my advice done you</span>, you will say! Much, my master, for I have rested<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL113_19_2" id="target_note_LCL113_19_2"><sup>2</sup></a> upon your advice, and I shall read it the oftener that I may the oftener rest upon it. But who knows better than yourself how exacting a thing is obedience to duty? But what I beseech you is that which you say at the close of your letter, that your hand pained you. If the Gods are kind, my master, and grant my prayers, you will not have suffered pain since. Farewell, my best of masters, man of the warm heart.</p>
