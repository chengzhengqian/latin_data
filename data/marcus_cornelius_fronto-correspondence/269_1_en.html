<p>3. Victorinus, a man of entire affection, gentleness, sincerity, and blamelessness,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL113_225_1" id="target_note_LCL113_225_1"><sup>1</sup></a> a man, further, conspicuous for the noblest accomplishments to be thus afflicted by his son’s most untimely death, was this in any sense just or fair? If Providence does govern the world, was this too rightly provided? If all human things are determined by Destiny, ought this to have been determined by Destiny? Shall there, then, be no distinction of fortunes between the good and the bad? Have the Gods, have the Destinies no power of discrimination as to what sort of man shall be robbed of his son?

Why Providence—out upon it!—if it provides unfairly? The Destinies, they say, are called so from the word “to destine”: is this to destine rightly.? Now the poets assign to the Destinies distaffs and threads. Surely no spinner would be so perverse and unskilful as to spin for her master’s toga a heavy and knotty yarn, but for a slave’s dress a fine and delicate one. For good men to be stricken with sorrow while the bad enjoy every domestic felicity—such a spinning performance by the Destinies I hold to be neither by weight nor rate.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL113_225_3" id="target_note_LCL113_225_3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
