<h3>Marcus Aurelius to Fronto</h3>
<p><span class="sc">Hail</span> my best of masters. <span class="marginNote right">? 139 <span class="sc">a.d.</span></span></p>
<p>If any sleep comes back to you after the wakeful nights of which you complain, I beseech you write to me and, above all, I beseech you take care of your health. Then hide somewhere and bury that “axe of Tenedos,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL112_19_1" id="target_note_LCL112_19_1"><sup>1</sup></a> which you hold over us, and do not, whatever you do, give up your intention of pleading cases, or along with yours let all lips be dumb.</p>

Now, if never before, I find what a task it is to round and shape<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL112_19_4" id="target_note_LCL112_19_4"><sup>4</sup></a> three or five lines and to take time over writing.
