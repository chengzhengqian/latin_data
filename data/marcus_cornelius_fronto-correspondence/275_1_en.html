<p>Although for a long while past with this ill-health of mine it has been pain and grief for me to live on, yet when I see you return with such great glory gained by your valour, I shall not have lived in vain, nor shall I be loth to live, whatever span of life remains for me. Farewell, my Lord, whom I miss so much. Greet your mother-in-law<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL113_237_1" id="target_note_LCL113_237_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and your children.</p>

Faustina must therefore have been with Verus and her daughter Lucilla, but whether in Asia or in Italy is not clear. As Lucius married Lucilla in 164, he is not likely to have had more than one child yet, and in any case the children would have been too young to have a message sent them. Therefore Faustinaâ€™s other children must be included in <span class="italic">liberos</span>. as <span class="italic">vestros</span> also seems to shew.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL113_237_1').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
