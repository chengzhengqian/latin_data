<h2>Fronto to Lucius Verus</h2>

You gave me your approval and applauded my advice, and yet for more than three or four days you could not prevail on yourself to answer me with the word <span class="italic">greeting</span>†; but you thought out this plan: first you bid me be admitted into your chamber: so you were able to give me a kiss without exciting anyone’s jealousy, with this thought I suppose in your mind, that the privilege also of a kiss should belong to me, to whom you had entrusted the care and cultivation of your voice and speech, and that all masters of eloquence by innate right are wont to reap the reward lodged in the portals of the voice.

The latter seems to have suggested some plan for obviating this, which Verus had not fallen in with, but followed another course.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL113_239_1a').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL113_239_2"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL113_239_2" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">2</sup>Savages rub foreheads and noses.
