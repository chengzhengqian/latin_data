stolen fire from heaven, would not the sun suffice you for your judicial duties? Do realise in your conscience that you are tied to a daily falsehood, for, when you say that you “appoint the day” for trial of cases and yet try by night,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL113_13_1" id="target_note_LCL113_13_1"><sup>1</sup></a> then you are bound to be untruthful, whether you condemn or acquit.
