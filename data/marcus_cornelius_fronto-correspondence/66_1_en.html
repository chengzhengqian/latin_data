I labour under much the same defect as the animal called by the Romans a hyena, whose neck, they say, can be stretched out straight forward but cannot be bent to either side.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL112_133_1" id="target_note_LCL112_133_1"><sup>1</sup></a> So I, when I am putting together anything with more than usual care, am, in a way, immovable, and, giving up all else, aim at that alone, like the hyena not turning to the right hand or to the left. Again, they say that the snakes called “darters”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL112_133_2" id="target_note_LCL112_133_2"><sup>2</sup></a> in much the same way project themselves straight forwards, but never move sideways; and spears and arrows are then most likely to hit the mark when they are propelled straight, neither made to swerve by the wind, nor foiled by Athene’s hand or Apollo’s, as were the arrows shot by Teucer or the suitors.</p>
