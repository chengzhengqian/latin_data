Good colours are bay and grey; the worst, white and dun. Again, should he but hear afar the clash of arms, he cannot keep his place; he pricks up his ears, quivers in his limbs, and snorting rolls beneath his nostrils the gathered fire. His mane is thick and, as he tosses it, falls back on his right shoulder. A double ridge runs along his loins; his hoof scoops out the ground, and the solid horn gives it a deep ring.

<p>Yet even such a steed do you shut up in the stalls when he begins to fail, worn with disease or burdened with years; and pity not his inglorious old age, though oft he has driven the foe in flight and claims Epirus or valiant Mycenae for his birthplace, and traces his line to Neptune himself for founder.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL063_183_12" id="target_note_LCL063_183_12">

</a> The aged stallion is cold to passion, and he vainly struggles with a thankless task; when he comes to the fray his ardour is futile—as when a great fire rages in the stubble, but there is no strength in it.
