No common herbage grew within that grove: white lilies set off its bright-hued flowers. The earth gives adornment to the woodland: now the mild lotus casts its shade, now the laurel, now the myrtle. The boughs have their own gifts; for here mid leafage fragrant apples shine out. Here the rose is neighbour to violets, here is every charm of scent, here among the violets are the joyous bells of the delicate hyacinth. Meet for love is a place which hath such wealth of boons. Still, gold there is none in all the grove, no gleam of purple<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL434_529_a" id="target_note_LCL434_529_a">

</a>: flowers are the bed, flowers the frame of the couch, flowers the support beneath. Rich Nature toils for Venus’ luxury.

</a> Even as her finger culls the bright-hued bloom, let her draw long sighs as she drinks in its fragrance. But for thyself let a caressing hand store the flowers beneath thy bosom! Then, lest a thorn of the bright-hued rose-bush hurt thee, strip off the leaves ere thou bind together the tender buds!<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL434_529_d" id="target_note_LCL434_529_d">

</a> Even thus ’tis seemly that maids rejoice within the grove of Venus: yet that ye may preserve amours uninjured for the Paphian,
