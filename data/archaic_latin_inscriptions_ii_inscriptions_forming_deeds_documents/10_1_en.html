<p>Lucius Cornelius, praetor, son of Gnaeus, consulted the Senate on the 5th day of May in the Temple of Castor. Present as witnesses<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL359_261_2" id="target_note_LCL359_261_2">

</a> to the record: Aulus Manlius son of Aulus; Sextus Julius . . .; Lucius Postumius son of Spurius.</p>
<p>The Senate took due and proper notice, people of Tibur, of the matter whereof you made verbal report and of the matters whereof you set forth a justification of yourselves, and we had heard beforehand the details as you say they were reported to you. We were not able to bring our minds to believe that such acts were performed as you said, for the reason that we knew our merits could not have deserved that you should perform the same, and that it was not worthy of you to perform them, and that it would be of no advantage to you or to your State to perform them. And now that the Senate has heard what you reported verbally, so much the more do we bring our minds to believe, as was our opinion heretofore, that on those matters no wrong has been done by you. And now that you are cleared of the said matters in the minds of the Senate, we believe, and you also may rightfully bring your minds to believe, that you will be cleared in the minds of the Roman people likewise.</p>
