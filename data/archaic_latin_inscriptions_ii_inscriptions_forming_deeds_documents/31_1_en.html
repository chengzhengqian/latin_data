The heading of this law is supplied from the Lex Quinctia given by Frontinus <span class="italic">de Aquis Urbis Romae</span>, 129. In the case of Sulla’s law, which covered more than eight tablets, the heading ran along the top of all the tablets, the words <span class="italic">principium fuit pro tribu</span> running along the top of this one. After this tablet, there followed probably a ninth, the last of this law.
