In 200 <span class="sc">b.c.</span> the praetor L. Furius Purpureo vowed a temple
to Vediovis; it was built on Tiber Island and dedicated on
Jan. lst, 194 (this calendar for Jan. 1st has <span class="italic">Vediove</span> = dative
Vediovi); when consul in 196, Furius vowed another which
was built between the Capitol and the Arx Capitolina,
and dedicated in 192. This second is here meant. 19th:

</figure> Minervae. Fifth-day Festival.
No business; public holiday. To Minerva. Minerva
was protectress of artists. The date of her Temple
is unknown. The Quinquatrūs (5th day after the Ides)
lasted five days in the later Republic and under the Empire.
The festival was sacred to Mars, then to Minerva, and included
a review of the <span class="italic">ancilia</span> or sacred shields. 23rd: Tubil(<span class="italic">ustrium</span>).

</figure> Review of trumpets; <span class="italic">etc.</span> The trumpets used in
sacrificial ceremonies and in calling the assemblies were purified.
This was the last day of the Quinquatrus. 24th:
Q(uando) r(ex) c(omitiavit), f(as). When the king
has finished in the Meeting-place, Business in Court.
May 25th: For[<span class="italic">t</span>](unae) P(opuli) R(omani) Q(uiritium).
To Fortune of the Roman Commonwealth of Quirites.
This refers to another of Fortune’s 3 temples on the Quirinal—see
above. Dedication or rededication of the temple of
Fortuna Primigenia (see below) is recorded for this day;
but on this calendar it was not shown. June 1st: E K(alendae)
Iun(iae). [<span class="italic">N</span>](efastus). | Marti in cl[<span class="italic">ivo Iuno</span>]n(i)
in [<span class="italic">arce</span>(?)]. Fifth week-day. Kalends of June.
No business. To Mars on the Slope. To Juno on the
Stronghold. There was a temple of Mars on the rising
ground beyond the first milestone on the Appian Way, probably
the one vowed in 388 <span class="sc">b.c.</span> On the <span class="italic">arx</span> was a very old
altar or shrine of Juno, which is doubtless the one here alluded
to; but the temple of Juno Moneta was finally dedicated in
344 <span class="sc">b.c.</span> probably on Oct. 10th, as mentioned in this calendar
under that day; though sometimes the lst of June was given
as Juno Moneta’s birthday. 15th: Q(uando) st(ercus)
d(elatum), Q[<span class="italic">f</span>](as). When refuse has been carried off,
legal business. July 7th: Palibus II. To the two
Paleses. Two temples of Pales, doubtless close together,
