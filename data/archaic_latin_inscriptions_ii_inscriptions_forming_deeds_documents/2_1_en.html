<span class="italic">i.e.</span> the trespasser; cp. <span class="italic">Twelve Tables</span>, <span class="italic">Remains</span>, III, pp. 482, 502 <span class="italic">im</span> for <span class="italic">eum</span>); but it is clear that the line must be read from right to left. The reader must not be confused here; in the printed Latin text the words are put as though they
did read from left to right. So in all cases where ← is
used. The interpunctuation being so vague, I think we might well read <span class="italic">iteris</span>, old gen. of <span class="italic">iter</span> ‘walk,’ ‘way,’
‘path.’ <span class="italic">Lines</span> 13–14: <span class="italic">havelod</span> is probably, however, one word. <span class="italic">Line</span> 15: <span class="italic">iovestod</span> seems to mean <span class="italic">iusto</span> ‘regular,’
‘permitted,’ ‘legitimate.’ But perhaps there should be a space: <span class="italic">Iovei estod.</span> Note Paulus, from Festus, ‘iovistae’ compositum a love et iustae.’ <span class="italic">Line</span> 16: If we have the letters right (and this is doubtful), this line reads the same either way, if we ignore the uncertain separating point. But some insist that the letters are <span class="italic">loivquiod</span>; von Grienberger read <span class="italic">louquiod</span> and thinks it means’ appertaining to a grove’ (<span class="italic">lucus</span>). For various studies of this inscription, see Comparetti,
<span class="italic">Iscrizione arcaica del Foro Romano</span> (1900): <span class="italic">C.I.L.</span>, I, 2, pp. 367, 717; <span class="italic">Rivista di sloria antica</span>, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII. Bursian’s <span class="italic">Jahrcsbericht</span>, CXXVII, 257–280; CXLIV, 162 ff.; Ribezzo, <span class="italic">R.I.-G.-I.,</span> XIV, 89; Stroux, <span class="italic">Philologus</span>, LXXXVI, 460 ff. There is also an interesting study by Warren, in <span class="italic">A.J.P.</span>, XXVIII, 249 ff., 373 ff. He thinks the inscription protects a sacred grove or tree, and fills in the gaps by conjecture. Von Grienberger, <span class="italic">Indog. Forsch.</span>, XXX, 210; XXXVII, 122, from a rubbing may have discovered a few more letters. Cf. also V. Pisani, <span class="italic">Rendiconti dell</span>’ <span class="italic">Acc. dei Lincei</span>, <span class="italic">Sc. Morali</span>, 1932, 735–744; and <span class="italic">C.I.L.</span>, I, 2, 2, Fasc. III, 1943, page 831, where further studies are referred to. There are casts of the block in the British Museum, the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, the Mus. of Arch., Cambridge, and at Harvard and Johns Hopkins Universities.</p>
