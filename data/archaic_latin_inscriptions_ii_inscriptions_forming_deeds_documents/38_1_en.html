The method was first applied by C. Klenze, <span class="italic">Fragm. Legis Serviliae</span> (which this law was often thought to be), Berlin 1925 to this law, and by A. Rudorff to the <span class="italic">Lex Agraria</span> on the other side of the plate; the later work of Mommsen is now usually accepted. Nevertheless there is much that is irrecoverable. Other attempts have been recently made, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> M. A. Levi, <span class="italic">Riv. d. Fil.</span>, LVII. 383. Carcopino, <span class="italic">Autour des Gracques</span>, 228 ff. holds that this ‘Acilian’ Law is Glaucia’s <span class="italic">Lex de Rep.</span>, to be dated 108 <span class="sc">b.c</span>.; but see Balsdon, <span class="italic">op. cit.</span>; cf. also Gelzer, <span class="italic">Gnomon</span>, V, 653; Judeich, <span class="italic">Hist.
