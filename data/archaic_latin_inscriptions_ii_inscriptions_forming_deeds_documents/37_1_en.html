It has occurred to me that the words ‘two letters or none or one only’ refer not to name-ballots but to voting-tickets issued to the jurymen for the voting on the case itself. By the <span class="italic">Lex Acilia</span> each juryman received one ticket only, which had inscribed in wax, on one side letter A = <span class="italic">absolvo</span> I acquit, on the other side letter C = <span class="italic">condemno</span> ‘I condemn’, the juryman in voting to leave on his ticket only that letter which recorded his opinion or to leave nothing if he wished (see <span class="italic">Lex Acilia,</span> pp. 348 ff.). In Cicero’s time each juryman received usually 3 tickets, one inscribed with A, one with C, and one with NL = <span class="italic">non liquet</span>, ‘not proven’. But we have <span class="italic">pilae</span> mentioned again in lines 14 and 15; which would mean either that clauses about the final voting on the case were inserted in this law amongst clauses about <span class="italic">pilae</span>, or that in lines 13 onwards the meaning of the name <span class="italic">pila</span> has changed from name-ballot to <span class="italic">tabella</span> = voting-ticket (called <span class="italic">sorticula</span>
          in the <span class="italic">Lex Acilia</span>, pp. 348 ff.), which is possible but unlikely. If these clauses do refer to voting tickets, they deal with accidental deletions or errors discovered on them before the voting, or with the condition of the tickets when inspected after the voting.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL359_315_4a').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL359_315_5"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL359_315_5" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">5</sup>I supply <span class="italic">au</span>[<span class="italic">t una</span> . . .]</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL359_315_5').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL359_315_6"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL359_315_6" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">6</sup>The plate seems to have EI, though some read LI = <span class="italic">literae.</span> Klenze took LI to mean 51, but this number at this period would probably be XI or the like.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL359_315_6').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
