called <span class="italic">Menologia rustica.</span> The urban calendars are each a
list of <span class="italic">Fasti sacri</span> or <span class="italic">F. Kalendares;</span> their object was to ensure
due observance of religious ceremonies by reminding people
(i) of the days which were <span class="italic">dies fasti</span> on which it was religiously
right or harmless to do business in assembly or law-courts by
word of mouth (<span class="italic">fari,</span> to speak) and of the <span class="italic">dies nefasti</span> on which
it was not right; (ii) of the fixed festivals (<span class="italic">feriae stativae</span>) of
which some (the name ending normally in -<span class="italic">alia</span>) were the
very old festivals having no specific reference to the dedications
of temples, because their origins took place at undateable
periods much earlier than the building of temples proper,
others (shown by the deity’s name in the dative case) celebrated
‘<span class="italic">dies natales</span>’ ‘birthdays’ commemorating the anniversary
of the dedication of a later temple. The building of
temples had begun not long before the end of the monarchic
period near the end of the sixth century <span class="sc">b.c.</span> The latter,
the temple-<span class="italic">feriae,</span> lasted always one day only; probably all
the old festivals also lasted one day, not excepting even the
Saturnalia and such as were marked by <span class="italic">ludi</span> or games; some
were ceasing to have much meaning even in Cicero’s time. All
older festivals, except one or two, and most of the dedications
of later temples for superstitious reasons took place on oddnumbered
days. Again, in these calenders each day (<span class="italic">dies
nundinalis</span>) of the eight-day week (<span class="italic">nundinum</span>) received
letters A to H repeated in succession (so that the first day
of each month did not necessarily begin with
A); the Kalends,
Nones, and Ides are always named; some calendars also date
fully every day. Every day received also an epithet shown
by one or other of the following initials. F = ‘<span class="italic">fas est ius
dicere</span>’ ‘it is permitted to pronounce justice’; and a day so
marked is <span class="italic">fastus,</span> a ‘speechable’ day (if I may so put it) on
which at any hour the praetor urbanus may decide legal
cases in his court; but assemblies of the people (<span class="italic">comitia</span>)
must not be held on it. FP = (Aug. 19th only) probably
<span class="italic">fastus principio,</span> a day on which legal business was allowed
only in the morning (<span class="italic">principium</span> ‘beginning’). C = <span class="italic">comitialis,</span>
an ‘assembly-day’ on which the <span class="italic">comitia</span> may meet;
if no <span class="italic">comitia</span> met, the day was <span class="italic">fastus.</span> N = <span class="italic">nefas,</span> and a
day so marked is a ‘not-speechable’ day; on it, because of
some bad omen associated with the day, neither could legal
business be done nor could the <span class="italic">comilia</span> meet. <figure id="fig_LCL359.452.1">
