The temples to Diana and Juno here meant were vowed by
Aemilius Lepidus in 187 and dedicated in 179. A temple to
the goddesses of weather was vowed by L. Scipio son of
Barbatus during a storm on his return from Sardinia in
259 <span class="sc">b.c.</span> See the inscription on his tomb, pp. 4–5. The
temple was built by the Via Appia outside the porta Capena.
<span class="italic">Intercalary month.</span> This is placed after December in this
calendar; but when this month was actually inserted into
the year, it was put between February and March—see p. 108.
So little of it has survived in this calendar that we cannot
tell whether the alleged name <span class="italic">Mercedonius,</span> ‘pay-month,’
supposed to rest on a mistake in Plutarch, is true or not,
because the part giving the month’s name is lost.</p>
