the text for April and for August (which of course are not adjacent in the calendar), and add a translation which will make clearer the nature of the reminders given to any who consulted the calendar. It should be noted that up to a point it was a matter of arbitrary taste as to what notices of celebrations should be shown on any calendar, so that our extant examples are not alike, but vary in their completeness. In the commentary on pp. 460 ff. I have not given any details of deliberate omissions by this calendar.</p>
