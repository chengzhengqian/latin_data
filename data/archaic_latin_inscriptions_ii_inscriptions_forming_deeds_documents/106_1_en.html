<span class="italic">publicae,</span> ‘not-speechable; public holiday,’ <span class="italic">nefastus</span> indeed, but of a cheerful nature, when freemen were exempt from public work and slaves had relief. EN = <span class="italic">endotercisus,</span> old Latin for <span class="italic">intercisus,</span> ‘midsplit day,’ ‘day cut into two parts,’ a day which was <span class="italic">fastus</span> in the middle hours, <span class="italic">nefastus</span> in the early morning and in the evening. There were only a few of such days. QRCF = (March 24th, May 24th only) <span class="italic">quando rex comitiavit, fas</span> ‘when the king (of the sacrifices) has finished his duties in the meeting-place, the day is speechable’. These duties were performed before and at meetings of the <span class="italic">comitia curiata</span> in the <span class="italic">comitium</span> in the Forum for the sacred purpose of giving sanction to wills. QSDF = (June 15th only) <span class="italic">quando stercus delatum, fas</span> ‘when refuse has been carried off, the day is speechable,’ that is when, at the end of Vesta’s festival beginning on the 7th of June, her temple has been cleaned and all sweepings have been carried away. Note that days marked EN or QRCF or QSDF are all <span class="italic">dies fissi</span> ‘cleft days.’</p>

But citizens even in remote regions of Italy might like to travel to Rome when it suited them or to take local notice of Roman celebrations; so we have a calendar of Venusia (known from copies only) and even of a place in Cisalpine Gaul. After 89 <span class="sc">b.c.</span> all adults in Italy were Roman citizens. As regards this particular calendar, Antium was a Roman colony on the coast of Latium and after the Marian troubles was also a place of resort for the rich. This calendar belongs further to the kind in which, though all the days of each month are marked A to H according to the Roman eight-day week, the date is not otherwise marked except Kalends, Nones, and Ides. The ‘week’-days (except each A-day), the Kalends, Nones and Ides, and the fixed festivals not connected with dedication of temples, are written in black; A-days (each of which the Romans called <span class="italic">nundinae</span>)—that is, market-days, the character-signs of days placed after the abbreviations for Kalends, Nones and Ides, and after any festivals mentioned, are written in red; so are the notices of temple-birthdays. All other characterisations of days are in black. The sum-
