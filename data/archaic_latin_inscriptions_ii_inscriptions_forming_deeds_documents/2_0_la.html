<p>From the meagre scraps of writing which remain, it appears
that the pillar recorded for public information some laws, or
one law protecting a sacred piece of ground or a sacred object
or building, and served as a boundary-stone for the same.
Separate laws or clauses may be distinguished as follows:
Lines 1–4 (no apparent points between words); 6–9 (which
a passer-by could read without changing his position—Huelsen, <span class="italic">Beiträge,</span> II, 231); 10–11?; 12–16? Note the
following: <span class="italic">Line</span> 1: There is doubtless to be read a space
between <span class="italic">quoi</span> and <span class="italic">hoi,</span> but there is no trace here, or in lines
2 and 3, of separating points. <span class="italic">hok</span>[<span class="italic">e</span>] von Grienberger.
<span class="italic">Lines</span> 2–3: <span class="italic">esed</span> is probably the later <span class="italic">esset</span> rather than <span class="italic">sit</span> or
<span class="italic">erit.</span> I accept Thurneysen’s supplement <span class="italic">Sora</span>[<span class="italic">no</span>] (Warren,
<span class="italic">A.J.P.,</span> XXVIII, 387), though even the <span class="italic">a</span> is doubtful; <span class="italic">sorde</span>
von Grienberger. Soranus was a Sabine god connected with
the lower world. <span class="italic">Line</span> 4: [<span class="italic">n</span>]<span class="italic">oxagias</span> von Grienberger;
which suggests ‘damage(s).’ <span class="italic">Line</span> 5: <span class="italic">recei</span> (<span class="italic">regei</span> v. Grienberger)
is probably dative of <span class="italic">rex.</span> The person meant would be the
<span class="italic">rex sacrorum</span> (<span class="italic">rex sacrificulus</span>), or, if the inscription belongs to
the monarchic period, the King of Rome. <span class="italic">Line</span> 8: the
<span class="italic">kalator</span> would be a servant of or attendant on priests. <span class="italic">Line</span> 9:
I conjecture <span class="italic">har</span>[<span class="italic">uspex</span>]; <span class="italic">hap</span>[<span class="italic">ead</span>] = <span class="italic">habeat</span> v. Grienberger.
<span class="italic">Line</span> 10: [<span class="italic">q</span>]<span class="italic">uod</span> v. Grienberger. <span class="italic">iouxmenta</span> is certain; cp.
<span class="italic">iugum, iungo. Line</span> 11: perhaps the four points ⁞ should
have been put after the next letter—<span class="italic">kapiad</span>⁞. But I believe
that, as occurs elsewhere with other consonants, a <span class="italic">d</span> has
been dropped before another <span class="italic">d</span>, and combine this suggestion
with another (Warren, op. cit., 387)—that <span class="italic">dota</span> is an error of
the inscriber for <span class="italic">dato.</span> Read therefore perhaps <span class="italic">kapiad
datov</span>[<span class="italic">e</span>] (<span class="italic">dotaq</span> v. Grienberger). <span class="italic">Line</span> 12 looks as hopeless
as line 4; if this could be read from left to right, and we could
assume that <figure id="fig_LCL359.244.1">
<a class="imageLink" href="/view/LCL359/figures/LCL359-p244-f1.png" target="_blank" title="q (= R) and special character"><img alt="q (= R) and special character" src="/view/LCL359/figures/LCL359-p244-f1.png"/></a>
</figure> are put wrong-side-forward, then
perhaps . . . <span class="italic">ir et im</span>= . . . <span class="italic">ir et eum</span> (‘and him . . .’,</p>
