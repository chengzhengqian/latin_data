Langenses shall be required to pay into the public treasury at Genua every year one twentieth part of the corn and one sixth part of the wine which shall have been produced on the said land.</p>
<p>Any Genuan or Veturian who has come into possession of land within the said boundaries, if he held possession on the first day of August in the consulship of Lucius Caecilius and Quintus Mucius, may thus remain in possession and till the land. Those who shall<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL359_269_1" id="target_note_LCL359_269_1">
<sup>1</sup>
</a> possess a holding must pay to the Langenses a charge in the same proportion as the remaining Langenses such of them as shall possess and enjoy any area within the said land. Furthermore within the said land no one must possess a holding unless it be by a majority<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL359_269_2" id="target_note_LCL359_269_2">
<sup>2</sup>
</a>-vote of the Langensian Veturii, and on condition that he admits no other onto his holding for the purpose of tilling unless he be a Genuan or a Veturian. If any of the said persons shall not appear to obey this condition (by a majority-vote of the Langensian Veturii), he shall not keep the land or enjoy it.</p>
<p>No man shall hinder the Genuans and the Veturii from pasturing cattle, on such of the said land as is associate pasture-land,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL359_269_3" id="target_note_LCL359_269_3">
<sup>3</sup>
</a> in the way in which it is allowed on the remaining associate pasture-land of Genua, and no man shall use force or hinder them from taking from the said land firewood and building-timber
and using the same.</p>
<p>The Langensian Veturii are required to pay into the public treasury at Genua a first yearâ€™s rent on the first day of January next but one. For such land as the Langenses have enjoyed and shall enjoy before and up to the first day of January next they are not required to pay against their will.</p>
