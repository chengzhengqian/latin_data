<p>‘Let none of them be minded to keep a lodge of Bacchus. Should there be some who say that they must needs keep a lodge of Bacchus, they must come to the praetor of the city at Rome, and our Senate, when it has heard what they have to say, shall make decision on those matters, provided that not fewer senators than 100 be present when the matter is deliberated. Let no man, whether Roman citizen or person of the Latin name or one of the allies, be minded to attend a meeting of Bacchant women<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL359_257_2" id="target_note_LCL359_257_2">

Let no one be minded to hold ceremonies in secret; nor let anyone be minded to hold ceremonies in public capacity or in private or outside the city, unless he have first approached the praetor of the city and he have authorised them, by a vote of the Senate, to do so,
