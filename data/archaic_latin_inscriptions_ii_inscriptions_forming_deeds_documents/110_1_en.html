<p>an important part. Of Hercules Victor there was a temple near the Circus Maximus and another near the Porta Trigemina;
the latter is the one alluded to here. The Camenae were prophetic nymphs of the country and were identified by the Romans with the Greek Muses. They had a small shrine at the foot of the Aventine. 17th: <span class="italic">Port</span>(<span class="italic">unalia</span>). Portunus was perhaps protector of the port of Ostia, and the mercantile stores of Rome and Ostia. His festival was held at the Pons Aemilius of unknown site. 19th: <span class="italic">Vina(lia),</span> that is <span class="italic">V. rustica.</span> Most probably marked by offering of unripe grapes in hopes of a good ripe crop after a month had gone by. See also April 23rd. <span class="italic">Venere</span> is a dative for <span class="italic">Veneri.</span> The temple here meant was dedicated in 295 <span class="sc">b.c.</span> near the Circus Maximus. 21st: <span class="italic">Cons(ualia),</span> festival of Consus, the god of ‘stored up harvest.’ 23rd: <span class="italic">Volk(analia). Vol(kano) Horae Qui(rino) Maiae supr(a) comi(tium).</span> Vulcan had a temple of unknown date before 215 <span class="sc">b.c.</span> in the Circus Flaminius.
After Romulus had become the god Quirinus, his bereaved wife Hersilia according to one story was allowed to become the goddess Hora. It looks as though <span class="italic">Hora Quirini</span> ‘Hora consort of Quirinus’ might be the meaning here, especially since the dedication of Quirinus’ own temple was celebrated on 17th Feb. But the Arval records give Aug. 23rd, as a day for Quirinus himself <span class="italic">in colle.</span> This latter would probably refer to a reconstruction and rededication. Maia was closely connected with Vulcan. 25th: <span class="italic">Opic(onsivia)</span> a festival of <span class="italic">Ops Consiva</span> ‘Lady bountiful of Seed-sowing’ (but she is so closely related to Consus as well as to Saturnus, that it may mean ‘of stored harvest’), to whom sacrifices were made in her shrine in the Regia or ‘King’s House.’ 27th: <span class="italic">Voltu(rnalia).</span> This festival was sacred to the god Volturnus, perhaps an old name (‘Winding’) of the Tiber as it was the permanent name of a river in Campania. Of course, on the 1st of both months K = <span class="italic">Kalendae,</span> on the 5th <span class="italic">Non. = Nonae.</span>

<p>Other than the usual single signs, and other than single names, the remaining months include the following: February 5th: Concord(iae) in Capit(olio). To Concord on the Capitol. Her temple was begun in 216 <span class="sc">b.c.</span> March 7th: [<span class="italic">N</span>]on(ae). F. Vedi(ovi) in Ca[<span class="italic">p</span>]itol(io.) Nones. Business in Court. To Vediovis on the Capitol.
