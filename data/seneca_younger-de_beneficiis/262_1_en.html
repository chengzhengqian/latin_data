who are doubtful about the source of benefits, but distribute their blessings among the nations and peoples with unbroken uniformity. Possessing only the power of doing good, they sprinkle the lands with timely rains, they stir the seas with their blasts, they mark off the seasons by the course of the stars, they modify the extremes of summer and winter by interposing periods of milder temperature, and, ever gentle and kindly, bear with the errors of our feeble spirits. Let us imitate them; let us give, even if many of our gifts have been given in vain; none the less, let us give to still others, nay, even to those at whose hands we have suffered loss. The destruction of one house deters no one from erecting another, and, when fire has swept away our household gods, we lay new foundations while the ground is still hot, and over and over we entrust new cities to the same spot that has swallowed up others; so persistently does the mind foster fair hopes. Men would cease their operations on land and sea unless they had been willing to renew the attempts that had failed.</p>
<p>“If a man is ungrateful, he has done, not me, but himself, an injury; I had the fruit of my benefit when I gave it. And the experience will make me, not slower to give, but more careful in giving; what I have lost in the case of one man, I shall recover from others. But even to him I shall give a second benefit, and, even as a good farmer overcomes the sterility of his ground by care and cultivation, I shall be victor; my benefit is lost to me, he is lost to mankind. It is no proof of a fine spirit to give a benefit and lose it; the proof of a fine spirit is to lose and still to give!”</p>
