to be worried over how soon we can repay, nor should we rush to do so at an unseemly time, for he who hastens to return gratitude at the wrong time is as much at fault as he who is remiss in returning it at the proper time. He has placed his gift in my hands; I have no fear on his account or on my own. He has good security; he cannot lose his benefit unless he loses me, nay, not even if he loses me. I have paid him my thanksâ€”that is, I have made return. He who thinks too much about returning a benefit must suppose that the other thinks too much about having it returned. One should lend himself to both points of view. If a man wishes his benefit to be returned, let us repay and return it cheerfully; if he prefers that it should remain in our custody, why do we dig up his treasure? Why do we refuse to guard it? He deserves to be allowed to do whichever he pleases. As for rumour and reputation, let us consider them as matters that must, not guide, but follow, our actions.</p>
