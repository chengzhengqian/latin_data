their father and mother, who, if they have two, do not each claim one, but they each claim two.</p>
<p>First of all, I shall now proceed to show that every man who invites me to enter into partnership with him, knows well that he possesses nothing in common with me. And why? Because this community of goods can exist between wise men only, who alone are capable of knowing friendship; the rest are just as little friends as they are partners.</p>
<p>In the second place, there are many ways of owning things in common. The seats reserved<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL310_485_a" id="target_note_LCL310_485_a"><sup>a</sup></a> for the knights belong to all the Roman knights; yet of these the seat that I have occupied becomes my own property, and, if I surrender it to anyone, I am supposed to have given him something although I have only surrendered to him what was common property. Certain things belong to certain persons under particular conditions. I have a seat among the knights, not to sell, not to let, not to dwell in, but to use only for the purpose of viewing the spectacle. Therefore I am not speaking an untruth when I say that I have a seat in the equestrian rows. But, if the equestrian rows are full when I enter the theatre, I both have a right to a seat there, because I have the privilege of sitting there, and have not a right, because the seat is occupied by those who have with me a common right to the space. Consider that the same relation exists between friends. Whatever our friend possesses is common to us, but it is the property of the one who holds it; I cannot use the things against his will. “You are making fun of me,” you say; “if what belongs to my friend is mine, I have a right to sell it.” Not so; for you have no right to sell the equestrians’ seats, and yet they belong to you
