reward of virtuous acts lies in the acts themselves. If a virtuous act is in itself a desirable end, if, further, a benefit is a virtuous act, it follows that, since they bear the same nature, they cannot be subject to a different condition. But that the virtuous course is in itself a desirable end has been often and abundantly proved.</p>
<p>On this point we Stoics are in arms against the Epicureans, an effeminate, sheltered<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL310_207_a" id="target_note_LCL310_207_a"><sup>a</sup></a> set, who philosophize over their cups, and hold that Virtue is but the handmaid of Pleasures, that she obeys them, that she is their slave, and sees them enthroned above herself. “There can be no pleasure,” you say, “without virtue.” But why does it come before virtue?
