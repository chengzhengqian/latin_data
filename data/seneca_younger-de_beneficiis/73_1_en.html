upon ingratitude for these? One smaller than the benefit? That would be unjust! One that is its equal—death? But what could be more inhuman than that benefits should end in bloodshed!</p>
<p>“Certain prerogatives,” it is argued, “have been accorded to parents; and, in the same way in which the case of these has been considered to be exceptional, the case of other benefactors must also be considered to be so.” But we have given sanctity to the position of parents because it was expedient that they should rear children; it was necessary to encourage them to the task because they were going to face an uncertain hazard. You could not say to them what you say to those who give benefits: “Choose the one to whom you will give; you have only yourself to blame if you have been deceived; help the deserving man.” In the rearing of children nothing is left to the choice of those who rear them—it is wholly a matter of hope. And so, in order that parents might be more content to run the risk, it was necessary to give to them a certain authority.</p>
<p>Then, too, the situation of parents is very different; for to those to whom they have already given they none the less give, and will continue to give, benefits, nor is there any danger of their making false claims about having given them. In the case of other benefactors there must be the question not only of whether they have received a return, but also of whether they have actually given, while in the case of parents their services are unquestionable, and, because it is expedient that the young should be controlled, we have placed over them household magistrates, as it were, under whose custody they may be held in check.</p>
