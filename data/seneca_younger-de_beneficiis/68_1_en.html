With the exception of the people of Macedonia,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL310_137_a" id="target_note_LCL310_137_a"><sup>a</sup></a> in no state has the ungrateful man become liable to prosecution. And ample proof that there ought not to have been any such liability is shown by the fact that we are in full accord in opposing all crime; the penalty for homicide, for poisoning, for parricide, and for the desecration of religion is different in different places, but they have some penalty everywhere, whereas this crime that is the commonest of all is nowhere punished, but is everywhere denounced.
