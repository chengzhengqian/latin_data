it may, shall remain fixed and unaltered.” There is nothing wrong in changing a plan when the situation is changed. Tell me, if Philip had left the soldier in possession of the shores that he had obtained by shipwreck, is it not true that he would thereby have cut off all unfortunates from fire and water<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL310_285_a" id="target_note_LCL310_285_a"><sup>a</sup></a>? “Rather do you,” he said, “within the bounds of my kingdom carry everywhere upon your most brazen brow these letters that ought to be stamped upon all men’s eyes. Go, show how sacred a thing is the table of hospitality; display upon your countenance that decree, for all to read, which keeps it from being a capital crime to shelter the unfortunate beneath one’s roof! This ordinance will thus have more authority than if I had engraved it upon bronze.”</p>
<p>“Why, then,” you say, “did your master Zeno, when he had promised a loan of five hundred denarii to a man, and had himself discovered that he was an altogether unsuitable person, persist in making the loan because he had promised it, although his friends advised him not to give it?” In the first place, one set of terms applies to a loan, another to a benefit. It is possible to recall money even if it has been badly placed; I can summon a debtor to pay on a given date, and, if he has gone bankrupt, I shall get my share; but a benefit is lost wholly and immediately. Besides, the one is the act of a bad man, the other of a bad manager. Again, if the sum had been a larger one, not even Zeno would have persisted in lending it. It was only five hundred denarii,—an amount, as we say, “one can spend on an illness,”—and not to break his promise was worth that much. I will go out to dinner because I have promised, even if the weather is cold; but not so if there is a snowstorm.
