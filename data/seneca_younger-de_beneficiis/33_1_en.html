you will not save a man’s life in the dark? I do not deny that, whenever circumstances permit, we should have regard for the pleasure we get from the willingness of the recipient; but, if he needs, and yet is ashamed, to be helped, if what we bestow gives offence unless it is concealed—then I do not put my good deed into the gazette<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL310_67_a" id="target_note_LCL310_67_a"><sup>a</sup></a>! Of course I am careful not to reveal to him that the gift came from me, since it is a first and indispensable requirement, never to reproach a man with a benefit, nay, even to remind him of it. For, in the case of a benefit, this is a binding rule for the two who are concerned—the one should straightway forget that it was given, the other should never forget that it was received.</p>
<p>Repeated reference to our services wounds and crushes the spirit of the other. He wants to cry out like the man who, after being saved from the proscription of the triumvirs by one of Caesar’s friends, because he could not endure his benefactor’s arrogance, cried “Give me back to Caesar!” How long will you keep repeating: “It is I who saved you, it is I who snatched you from death”? Your service, if I remember it of my own will, is truly life; if I remember it at yours, it is death. I owe nothing to you if you saved me in order that you might have someone to exhibit. How long will you parade me? How long will you refuse to let me forget my misfortune? In a triumph, I should have had to march but once! No mention should be made of what we have bestowed; to remind a man of it is to ask him to return it. It must not be dwelt upon, it must not be recalled to memory—the only way to remind a man of an earlier gift is to give him another.</p>
