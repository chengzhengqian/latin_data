reply to me: “Pardon me; upon my word, I did not know that you missed the money, or I would have offered it of my own accord; I beg you not to think me ungrateful; I am mindful of your favour to me.” Why should I hesitate to make such as these better men both in their own eyes and in mine? If I can keep anyone from doing wrong, I shall; much more a friend—both from doing wrong and, most of all, from doing wrong to me. I bestow a second benefit upon him by not permitting him to be ungrateful; nor will I reproach him harshly with what I had bestowed, but as gently as I can. In order to give him an opportunity to show his gratitude, I shall refresh his memory, and ask for a benefit; he will himself understand that I am asking repayment. Sometimes, if I have hope of being able to correct his fault, I shall use harsher words; yet, if he is beyond hope, I shall not exasperate him as well, for fear that I may turn an ingrate into an enemy. But if we spare ungrateful men even the affront of an admonition, we shall make them more dilatory in returning benefits. Some, indeed, who are curable, if conscience pricks them, and might become good men will be left to go to ruin if we withhold the admonition by which a father at times reclaims his son, by which a wife brings back to her arms an erring husband, and a friend stimulates the flagging loyalty of a friend.</p>
<p>In order to awaken some men, it is necessary only to shake, not to strike, them; in the same way, in the case of some men, their sense of honour about returning gratitude is, not extinct, but only asleep. Let us arouse it. “Do not,” they might say, “turn your gift into an injury; for injury it will be if you fail to ask repayment for the express purpose of leaving me ungrateful. What if I do not know what you desire?
