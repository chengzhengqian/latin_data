I shall return to him the benefit that I have received. It is not right that I should profit by his wickedness; let me return what is not mine to its owner. What difference does it make whether he is good or bad? But I would sift out that matter most carefully if I were giving, not returning, a benefit.</p>
<p>This point calls up a story. A certain Pythagorean once bought some white shoes<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL310_507_a" id="target_note_LCL310_507_a"><sup>a</sup></a> from a cobbler, a fine pair, without paying for them in cash. Some days later he returned to the shop in order to make payment, and, after he had been knocking for a long time at the closed door, someone appeared, and said: “Why do you waste your time? The cobbler you are looking for passed away, and has been cremated; this is, perhaps, a grief to us, who believe that we lose our friends for ever, but not to you, who know that they will be reborn,” jeering at the Pythagorean.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL310_507_b" id="target_note_LCL310_507_b"><sup>b</sup></a> But our philosopher, not unwillingly, carried his three or four denarii back home, shaking them now and then in his hand. Later, after blaming himself for the secret pleasure he had had from not paying the money, and perceiving that he had derived satisfaction from his trifling gain, he returned to the same shop, saying to himself: “For you the man is alive, pay him what you owe.” Thereupon, he dropped the four coins into the shop, thrusting them through the closed door by means of a crack in the joining, and exacted punishment of himself for his unconscionable greed in order that he might not form the habit of being in debt.</p>
<p>Try to find someone to whom you can pay what you owe, and, if no one demands it, do you dun yourself. It is no concern of yours whether the man is good or bad; first pay, then accuse. You have forgotten how
