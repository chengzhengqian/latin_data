if a son has attained the wisdom of philosophy and has transmitted it to his father, shall we still be able to argue as to whether he gave something greater than he received, though the gift he returned to his father was the Happy Life,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL310_195_a" id="target_note_LCL310_195_a"><sup>a</sup></a> and that which he received was merely life?</p>
<p>“But,” you say, “whatever you do, whatever you are able to bestow on your father, is a part of his benefit to you.” Yes, and the progress I have made in liberal studies is a benefit from my teacher; nevertheless we leave behind the very teachers who have transmitted their knowledge, particularly those who have taught us the alphabet, and, although no one could have accomplished anything without them, it is, nevertheless, not true that, no matter how much anyone has accomplished, he is still their inferior. There is a great deal of difference between what is first in time and what is first in importance, and it does not follow that what is first in time is the equivalent of what is first in importance on the ground that without the first in time there could be no first in importance.</p>

Again, if a man who has given life to another has been freed, time and again, from the peril of death, he has received a greater benefit than he gave. Now, a father has given life; if, therefore, he should be repeatedly freed from the peril of death by his son, it is possible
