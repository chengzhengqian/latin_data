two-thirds of it remained in his own family,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL310_337_a" id="target_note_LCL310_337_a"><sup>a</sup></a> he reduced the Roman people to such a plight that only by the acceptance of slavery were they able to survive.</p>
<p>The foe and conqueror<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL310_337_b" id="target_note_LCL310_337_b"><sup>b</sup></a> of Pompeius was himself ungrateful. From Gaul and Germany he whirled war to Rome, and that friend of the people, that democrat, pitched his camp in the Circus Flaminius, even nearer to the city than Porsina’s had been. It is true that he used the cruel privileges of victory with moderation; the promise that he was fond of making he kept—he killed no man who was not in arms. But what of it? The others used their arms more cruelly, yet, once glutted, flung them aside; he quickly sheathed his sword, but never laid it down.</p>

His country, torn as it had been by proscriptions, invasions, and wars, after all her ills, he wished to make subject to kings, who were not even Roman, in order that a city that had restored sovereign rights, autonomy, and immunity to the Achaeans, the Rhodians, and many famous cities, might herself pay tribute to eunuchs!<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL310_337_d" id="target_note_LCL310_337_d"><sup>d</sup></a></p>
<p>The day will fail me to enumerate those whose ingratitude resulted in the ruin of their country. Equally endless will be the task if I attempt a survey of how ungrateful the commonwealth herself has been to its best and most devoted servants, and how it has sinned not less often than it has been sinned against.</p>
