your several duties have been divided—for him forgetfulness is enjoined, for you we have decreed remembrance. Yet it is a mistake to suppose that, when we say that the man who has given a benefit ought to forget, we would rob him of all memory of his act, especially if it was a very honourable one. We overstate some rules in order that in the end they may reach their true value. When we say: “He must not remember,” we really mean: “He must not babble, nor boast, nor give offence.” For some men in all gatherings tell of a benefit that they have given; talk of it when they are sober, make no secret of it when they are drunk, force it upon strangers, confide it to friends. It is to quell this excessive and reproachful consciousness of it that we have said that the man who gives must forget, and, by ordering something more than he is able to accomplish, have commended to him silence.</p>
<p>Whenever you lack confidence in those to whom you are giving orders, you should demand of them more than is necessary in order that they may perform all that is necessary. The set purpose of all hyperbole is to arrive at the truth by falsehood. And so when the poet said:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">Whose whiteness shamed the snow, their speed the winds,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL310_509_a" id="target_note_LCL310_509_a"><sup>a</sup></a></span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">he stated what could not possibly be true in order to give credence to all that could be true. And the other who said:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">Firmer than a rock, more headlong than the stream,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL310_509_b" id="target_note_LCL310_509_b"><sup>b</sup></a></span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">did not suppose that he could convince anyone by this that any person was as immovable as a rock. Hyperbole never expects to attain all that it
