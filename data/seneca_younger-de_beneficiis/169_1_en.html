<p>it exiled Cicero, even after the conspiracy of Catiline, destroyed his home, plundered his property, did everything that a victorious Catiline would have done; Rutilius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL310_339_a" id="target_note_LCL310_339_a"><sup>a</sup></a> found his blamelessness rewarded with a hiding-place in Asia; to Cato the Roman people refused the praetorship, and persisted in refusing the consulship.</p>
<p>We are universally ungrateful. Let each one question himself—everyone will find someone to complain of for being ungrateful. But it is impossible that all men should complain, unless all men gave cause for complaint—all men, therefore, are ungrateful. Are they ungrateful only? They are also covetous and spiteful and cowardly—especially those who appear to be bold. Besides, all are self-seeking, all are ungodly. But you have no need to be angry with them; pardon them—they are all mad.</p>
<p>To refer you to uncertain instances is not my desire, so I say: “See how ungrateful is youth! What young man does not long for his father’s last day though his hands are clean? Does not look forward to it though he curbs his desire? Does not ponder it though he is dutiful? How few there are who dread so much the death of their best of wives that they do not even calculate the probabilities? What litigant, I ask you, after he has been defended, retains the memory of so great a benefit beyond the hour it happened?”</p>
<p>And all agree in asking who dies without complaint! Who on his last day ventures to say:</p>
<blockquote><p>

</p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">Who does not shrink from departure? Who does not mourn it? Yet not to be satisfied with the time
