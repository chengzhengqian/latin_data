much your peer as naked or lightly armed soldiers are the peers of the many who are fully armed. No one, therefore, is outdone in benefits because each man’s gratitude is to be measured by his desire. For, if it is disgraceful to be outdone in benefits, it is not right to accept a benefit from most powerful men whose kindness you are unable to return—I mean princes and kings, who have been placed by Fortune in a position that enables them to bestow many gifts, and are likely to receive very few and very inadequate returns for what they have given. I have spoken of kings and princes, to whom, nevertheless, it is possible for us to render assistance, and whose pre-eminent power rests upon the consent and service of their inferiors. But there are some men who, withdrawn beyond the reach of every lust, are scarcely touched at all by any human desires; upon whom Fortune herself has nothing that she can bestow. In benefits I must of necessity be outdone by Socrates, of necessity by Diogenes,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL310_299_a" id="target_note_LCL310_299_a"><sup>a</sup></a> who marched naked through the midst of the treasures of the Macedonians, treading under foot the wealth of a king. O! in very truth, how rightly did he seem then, both to himself and to all others who had not been rendered blind to the perception of truth, to tower above the man beneath whose feet lay the whole world! Far more powerful, far richer was he than Alexander, who then was master of the whole world; for what Diogenes refused to receive was even more than Alexander was able to give.</p>
<p>It is not disgraceful to be outdone by such as these; for it is not proved that I am the less brave if you pit me against an enemy that is invulnerable, nor that fire is the less able to burn if it falls upon a substance
