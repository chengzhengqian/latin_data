one has had is to be ungrateful. Your days will always seem few if you stop to count them. Reflect that your greatest blessing does not lie in mere length of time; make the best of it however short it may be. Though the day of your death should be postponed, your happiness is in no whit enhanced, since life becomes, not more blissful, but merely longer, by the delay. How much better it is to be grateful for the pleasures that have been enjoyed, not to reckon up the years of others, but to set a generous value on one’s own, and to score them down as gain! “God deemed me worthy of this, this is enough; he might have given more, but even this is a benefit.” Let us be grateful to the gods, grateful to mankind, grateful to those who have bestowed anything upon ourselves, grateful also to those who have bestowed anything upon our dear ones.</p>
<p>“You render me liable,” you retort, “to infinite obligation when you say ‘also upon our dear ones’; so do set some limit. According to you, he who gives a benefit to a son, gives it also to his father. This is the first question I raise. Secondly, I should like particularly to have this point settled. If the benefit is given also to your friend’s father, is it given also to his brother? Also to his uncle? Also to his grandfather? Also to his wife? Also to his father-in-law? Tell me, where must I stop, how far am I to pursue the list of relatives?”</p>
<p>If I cultivate your field, I shall give you a benefit; if your house is on fire and I shall put it out, or if I keep it from tumbling down, I shall give you a benefit; if I heal your slave, I shall charge the service to you; if I save the life of your son, will you not have a benefit from me?</p>
