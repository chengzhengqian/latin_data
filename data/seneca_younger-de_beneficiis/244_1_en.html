pleader, if he has used all the power of his eloquence, fulfils his duty even if his client is convicted; praise for his generalship is bestowed even upon a vanquished commander if he has performed his duties with prudence, with diligence, and with bravery.

<p>“Tell me,” you say: “if he had returned the benefit, you would say that he has shown gratitude; are both, therefore, in the same position—the one who returned it, and the one who did not return it?”</p>
