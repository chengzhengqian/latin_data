for instance, in the competition for public office some of the most disreputable men are preferred to others who are industrious, but of no family, by reason of their noble birth, and not without reason. For sacred is the memory of great virtues, and more people find pleasure in being good, if the influence of good men does not end with their lives. To what did Cicero’s son owe the consulship if not to his father? What recently took Cinna<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL310_267_a" id="target_note_LCL310_267_a"><sup>a</sup></a> from the camp of the enemy, and raised him to the consulship, what Sextus Pompeius and the other Pompeii, unless it was the greatness of one man, who once reached such a height that even his downfall sufficed to exalt all his descendants? What recently made Fabius Persicus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL310_267_b" id="target_note_LCL310_267_b"><sup>b</sup></a> a priest in more than one college, a man whose kiss even the shameless counted an insult? What but a Verrucosus and an Allobrogicus and the famous three hundred,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL310_267_c" id="target_note_LCL310_267_c"><sup>c</sup></a> who, to save their country, blocked the invasion of the enemy with their single family? This is the duty we owe to the virtuous—to honour them, not only when they are present with us, but even when they have been taken from our sight; as they have made it their aim, not to confine their services to one age alone, but to leave behind their benefits even after they themselves have passed away, so let us not confine our gratitude to one age alone. So-and-so was the father of great men: whatever he may be, he is worthy of our benefits; he has given us worthy sons. So-and-so is descended from glorious ancestors: whatever he may be, let him find refuge under the shadow of his ancestry. As filthy places become bright from the radiance of the sun, so let the degenerate shine in the light of their forefathers.</p>
