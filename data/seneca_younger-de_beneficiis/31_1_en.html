Yet Tiberius had his purpose; he wished to prevent others, I suppose, from rushing to him in order to make the same request. That, perhaps, may have been an effective way to check, through a sense of shame, the extravagant desires of men, but a wholly different method must be followed by one who is giving a benefit. In order that what you give may become the more acceptable, you should enhance its value by every possible means. Tiberius was really not giving a benefit—he was finding fault.</p>
<p>And—to say in passing what I think about this other point—it is not quite proper even for a prince to bestow a gift in order to humiliate. “Yet,” it may be said, “Tiberius was not able even in this way to escape what he was trying to avoid; for after this a goodly number were found to make the same request, and he ordered them all to explain to the senate why they were in debt, and under this condition he granted to them specific sums.” But liberality that is not, it is censorship; I get succour, I get a subsidy from the prince—that is no benefit which I am not able to think of without a blush. It was a judge before whom I was summoned; I had to plead a case in order to obtain my request.</p>
