affection for the benefit, to which, even though it has been unfortunately placed, we show indulgence as naturally as we might to children who misbehave.</p>
<p>These same opponents<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL310_237_a" id="target_note_LCL310_237_a"><sup>a</sup></a> admit that they themselves return gratitude, yet not because it is right, but because it is expedient. But to prove that this is false is an easier task, because the same arguments by which we have established that to give a benefit is something that is desirable in itself establish this also. The one fixed principle from which we proceed to the proof of other points is that the honourable is cherished for no other reason than because it is honourable. Who, therefore, will dare to raise the question whether it is honourable to be grateful? Who does not loathe the ungrateful man, a person who is unprofitable even to himself? And tell me, when you hear it said of someone: “He is ungrateful for very great benefits,” what are your feelings? Is it as though he had done something base, or as though he had omitted to do something that was expedient and likely to be profitable to himself? I imagine you count him a worthless fellow, who should have, not a guardian, but punishment; but this would not be the case unless to be grateful were something that is desirable in itself and honourable. Other qualities, perhaps, manifest their worth less clearly, and, in order to decide whether they are honourable, we need an interpreter. This one is open to the view, and is too beautiful to have its glory dimmed or obscured. What is so praiseworthy, upon what are all our minds so uniformly agreed, as the repayment of good services with gratitude?</p>
<p>Tell me, what is the motive that leads to this? Gain? But he who does not scorn gain is ungrateful.
