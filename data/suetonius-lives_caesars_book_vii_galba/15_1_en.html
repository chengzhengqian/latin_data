Again, as he entered the city, and later the Palace, he was met by a shock of earthquake and a sound like the lowing of kine. There followed even clearer signs. He had set apart from all the treasure a necklace fashioned of pearls and precious stones, for the adornment of his image of Fortune at Tusculum.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL038_210_54" id="target_note_LCL038_210_54"><sup>54</sup></a> This on a sudden impulse he consecrated to the Capitoline Venus, thinking it worthy of a more august position.

As he was on the point of addressing the soldiers on the day of the adoption,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL038_210_56" id="target_note_LCL038_210_56"><sup>56</sup></a> his camp chair, through the forgetfulness of his attendants, was not placed on the tribunal, as is customary, and in the senate his curule chair was set wrong side foremost.</p>
