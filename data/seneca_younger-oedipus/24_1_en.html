<p class="noindent">There lies at a distance from the city a grove dark with holm oaks, on the sides of the well-watered Vale of Dirce. Cypresses thrust their heads above the high trees and encircle the wood with their evergreen trunks; ancient oaks stretch out bent branches, rotten and crumbling. One of these has its side torn away by devouring time, while a second, already tilting with weakened roots, hangs propped on another tree’s trunk. The bitter-berried laurel is there, slight linden trees, the Paphian myrtle, the alder destined to drive oars<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL078_65_33" id="target_note_LCL078_65_33"><sup>33</sup></a> through the boundless sea, and the pine fronting the sun, setting its straight-grained bole against the westerlies. In the midst stands a massive tree that crowds lesser trees with its heavy shade, and with its great circle of spreading branches serves by itself as protector of the woodland. In gloom beneath it, untouched by Phoebus’ light, lies a pool chilled by perpetual cold; a muddy swamp surrounds the sluggish spring.</p>
