<p class="noindent">The flame was changeable, with more than one appearance. As Iris the shower-bringer weaves various colors into herself, when she spans a great section of sky and heralds storm clouds with her variegated bow (you would hesitate to say what color is or is not there), so it shimmered, its bluish color mottled with yellow, and then blood red; at the end it trailed into blackness.</p>
<p>But oh! The combative flame is separating into two halves, the embers of a single ritual dividing in hostility. Father, I shudder to watch! The libation of wine changes into blood; dense smoke surrounds the king’s head, and settles even thicker around his very eyes, blocking the light in the murk of a dense cloud. What is it, father? Tell us.</p>
