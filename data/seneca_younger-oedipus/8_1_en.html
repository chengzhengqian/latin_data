<span class="line indent3">O strange and dreadful form of death,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">more grievous than death!</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">Heavy languor binds the torpid limbs,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">a flush appears on the sick face,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">and small spots spread across the skin.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">Then a fiery heat burns in the very</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">zenith of the body,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">and distends the eyes with copious blood;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">the gaze is fixed, </span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">the ears ring,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">dark blood drips from the curving nostrils</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">and breaks out of the gaping veins;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">strident groans</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">repeatedly shake the body to its core,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">and a cursed fire feeds on the limbs.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">Now they burden cooling rocks</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">with a tight embrace;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">those whose homes, emptied of guardians,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">allow them freedom, </span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">seek out springs,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">and feed their thirst with gulps of water.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">Crowds lie prostrate among the altars</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">and pray to dieâ€”</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">the one thing granted readily by the gods.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">They head for the shrines,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">not to appease the deities with vows,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">but from pleasure at sating the very gods.</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></div><notes></notes></section>
