<span class="line indent3">Then after the rending of Pentheus’ limbs</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent3">the Thyads, their bodies relieved of frenzy,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent3">looked on the atrocity as something unknown.</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p><p class="lineGroup">
<span class="line">The realm of the sea is held by the aunt of shining Bacchus,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Ino daughter of Cadmus, with Nereid choruses round her;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">and a boy, newcomer, sways the waves of the mighty sea,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">kin to Bacchus, a godhead of no slight power, Palaemon.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">(<span class="italic">to</span> <span class="italic">Bacchus</span>) You were seized as a boy by a Tyrrhene crew.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">Nereus calmed the swollen seas,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">and changed the deep-blue waters to meadows;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">so there were plane trees verdant with spring foliage,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">and laurels whose groves are dear to Phoebus;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">birds vied in chattering among the branches,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">the oars were covered with vigorous ivy,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">grapevines twined at the mastheads;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">a lion from Ida roared at the prow,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">a tiger from Ganges sat in the stern.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">Then the frightened pirates swim in the sea,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">and as they sink take on new forms:</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">first the robbers’ arms fall away,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">their chests are squashed to join their bellies,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">little hands hang down at their sides,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">they dive in the waves with curving backs,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">cut through the sea with crescent tails:</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">and the sails of the fleeing ship are chased</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent5">by humpbacked dolphins.</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p><p class="lineGroup">
<span class="line">The Lydian river Pactolus bore you on its rich waves,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">carrying golden currents down its swirling stream.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
