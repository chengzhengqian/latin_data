drove me from my father’s kingdom, it was on this account that I left my hearth for exile. Distrusting myself, I safeguarded the laws of Nature. When you dread some great evil, you must fear even what you think impossible. I take fright at everything, and do not place my trust even in myself.</p>
<p>At this very moment fate is preparing some device against me. What else am I to think, when this pestilence destroys the race of Cadmus with such widespread havoc, but spares me alone? What evil am I being saved for? Amid the city’s ruins, amid deaths constantly demanding new tears, amid the nation’s piles of bodies <span class="italic">I</span> stand unscathed—the man accused by Phoebus! Could you expect that a healthy kingdom would be accorded to such crimes? I have made the heavens baneful.</p>
<p>No gentle breeze with its cooling breath soothes our hearts that pant with heat, no light westerlies breathe, but the Titan, hard by the back of the Nemean lion, augments the fires of the scorching dog star. Rivers are devoid of moisture, grasses of color; the Dirce is dry; Ismenos’ meager flow scarcely wets the bare channel with its scanty water. Phoebus’ sister glides obscured through the heavens, and the overcast daylight discolors the gloomy world. There are no stars glittering in clear night skies: a heavy black vapor blankets the earth. The citadels of the heavenly gods, their high homes, are concealed behind a hellish vista. The mature grain refuses its harvest: though the golden field trembles with tall ears, the crop is barren, and dies on its parched stalks.</p>
