The powers above and below declare that Laius died through a crime of mine, but on the other hand my mind, which is innocent and better known to itself than to the gods, denies it. Yet a memory returns along a faint track, of someone felled by a blow from my staff when he blocked my way, and sent to Dis—an old man, who first forced me arrogantly aside with his chariot when I was young—at a distance from Thebes, where the region of Phocis splits the road three ways.</p>
