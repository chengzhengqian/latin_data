<span class="line indent2">Always a new group files toward Death,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">a long, sad column hastening in sequence</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">to the shades; but the gloomy line is stopped,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">since the seven gates do not open wide</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">enough for the crowd seeking graves; the heavy</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">carnage is clogged, a funeral is crowded</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent5">by a funeral close by.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">The scourge first touched the slow sacrificial</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">sheep, which hardly grazed the lush grass.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">A priest stood poised to smite a bull,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">but while his raised hand aimed the stroke,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">the beast with his gleaming gold-red horns<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL078_29_5" id="target_note_LCL078_29_5"><sup>5</sup></a></span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">sank down limply. His drooping neck</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">was opened under the weighty blow:</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">no blood, but a foul gore poured</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">from the dark gash and stained the blade.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">A steed slowed in his running and fell</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">on the very track, throwing his master</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent5">over his sinking shoulder.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">Livestock lie abandoned in the fields;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">the bull weakens as the cattle perish;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">the herdsman fails, his herd diminished,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">dying among the wasting bullocks.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">Deer do not fear predatory wolves,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">the angry lionâ€™s roar ceases,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">there is no savagery in shaggy bears;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">the lurking snake has lost his poison,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">he dies parched, his venom dried up.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent3">No forests graced by their own foliage</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent3">cast shadows on the shaded hills,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
