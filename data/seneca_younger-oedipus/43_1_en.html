who encompass crimes, accursed Cithaeron, send beasts against me from your forests, send ravening hounds—now send back Agave.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL078_103_48" id="target_note_LCL078_103_48"><sup>48</sup></a> My spirit, why fear death? Death alone can rescue the innocent from Fortune.”</p>
<p>With these words he fitted his impious hand round the hilt of his sword and drew it. “Is this the way? You pay for such great crimes with so brief a penalty, compensate for them all with a single blow? You die: this is enough for your father. What then will you offer your mother, or your children, so wrongly brought into the light? What will you offer her who pays for your crimes with utter ruin—your pitiful fatherland? You cannot pay! That Nature who altered her fixed laws in regard to Oedipus alone, by inventing novel births, must innovate once more for my punishment. You must be allowed to live once more and die once more, to be reborn repeatedly so you can pay a new penalty each time. Wretched man, use your cleverness! What cannot happen often must happen slowly; pick out a lingering death. Search for a way to wander without mixing with the dead, and yet removed from the living. Die, but stop short of your father. Do you hesitate, my spirit? See, a sudden flurry of tears burdens my face and wets my cheeks with weeping. And is it enough to weep? No longer shall my eyes pour out this paltry moisture: they must be driven from their seats and follow their tears.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL078_103_49" id="target_note_LCL078_103_49"><sup>49</sup></a> Let them be dug out straightway, these eyes of a married man!”</p>
