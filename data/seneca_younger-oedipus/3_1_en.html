<p>No quarter is immune or exempt from destruction. Each age and sex perishes equally; the young are joined to the old, fathers to sons by the deadly plague. A single torch cremates married couples, and funerals are unaccompanied by bitter tears and laments. Indeed, this great disaster’s unremitting carnage has dried people’s eyes: as happens in extremes of misery, their very tears have died. There an ailing father carries his son to the final fire, here a crazed mother brings hers, and rushes back to fetch another son to the same pyre. Even in the midst of grief new grief arises, and mourners fall around the corpse they are following. Then people cremate the bodies of their kin on flames belonging to strangers; fire is stolen—the wretched have no shame. There are no individual grave mounds covering revered bones: no, to have burned the body is enough—yet how small a portion is turned to ash! There is no land for graves, the forests no longer yield pyres. No prayer, no skill relieves those stricken; healers fall, the disease drags down all succor.</p>
<p>Prostrate at the altar, stretching out hands in supplication, I demand an early fate, so as to be ahead of the fatherland’s collapse, not fall after everyone and become the last death in my own kingdom. The gods are too cruel, fate too harsh! Apparently death, so readily available, is denied me alone out of the whole nation! Spurn the kingdom infected by your deadly hand, leave behind the tears, the deaths, the corruptive maladies in the sky which you bring with you as a fateful stranger. Quickly, make your belated escape—even to your parents!</p>
