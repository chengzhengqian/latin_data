<p>Come, then, let us begin and consider each several point, as far as it can be grasped and understood; for as has been wisely said,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL074_9_a" id="target_note_LCL074_9_a"><sup>a</sup></a> in my opinion, it is a scholar’s duty to try to formulate his belief about each thing according as it actually is.</p>
<p>Speculative Science may be divided into three kinds<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL074_9_b" id="target_note_LCL074_9_b"><sup>b</sup></a>: Physics, Mathematics, and Theology.

Mathematics does not deal with motion and is not abstract, for it investigates forms of bodies apart from matter, and therefore apart from motion, which forms, however, being connected with matter cannot be really separated from bodies. Theology does not deal with motion and is abstract and separable, for the Divine Substance is without either matter or motion.</p>
<p>In Physics, then, we shall be bound to use scientific, in Mathematics, systematical, in Theology, intellectual concepts; and in Theology we should not be diverted to play with imaginations, but rather apprehend that form which is pure form and no image, which is very being and the source of being.
