otherness of persons. For there is indeed great truth in the rule that distinctions in incorporeal things are established by differences and not by spatial separation. It cannot be said that any accident was added to God, that he might become the Father; for he never began to be Father, since the begetting of the Son belongs to his very substance; however, the predication of father, as such, is relative. And if we bear in mind all the propositions made concerning God in the previous discussion, let us consider that God the Son proceeded from God the Father, and the Holy Ghost from both, and that they cannot possibly be spatially different, since they are incorporeal. But since the Father is God, the Son is God, and the Holy Spirit is God, but God has no differences distinguishing him from God, he differs from none of the others. But where there are no differences there is no plurality; where there is no plurality there is unity. Again, nothing but God could be begotten of God, and lastly, in concrete enumerations the repetition of units does not in any way produce plurality. Thus the Unity of the Three is suitably established.</p>

<p>But since no relation can be related to itself, inasmuch as one which makes a predicate by itself is a predication which lacks relation, the manifoldness of the Trinity is produced in the fact that it is predication of a relation, and the unity is preserved through the fact that there is no difference of substance, or operation, or generally of that kind of predication which is made on its own. So then, the substance preserves the unity, the relation makes
