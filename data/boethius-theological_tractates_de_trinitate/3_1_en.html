through which the authority of that same religion is perceived, and because its form of worship has spread throughout almost all the world, is called catholic or universal. The belief of this faith concerning the Unity of the Trinity is as follows: “the Father” they say “is God, the Son is God, the Holy Spirit is God.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL074_7_a" id="target_note_LCL074_7_a"><sup>a</sup></a> Therefore Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are one God, not three Gods. The cause of this union is absence of difference<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL074_7_b" id="target_note_LCL074_7_b"><sup>b</sup></a>: difference cannot be avoided by those who add to or take from the Unity, as for instance the Arians, who, by graduating the Trinity according to merit, break it up and convert it to Plurality. For the principle of plurality is otherness; for apart from otherness plurality is unintelligible. In fact, the diversity of three or more things lies in genus or species or number; for as often as “same” is said, so often is “diverse” also predicated. Now sameness is predicated in three ways. By genus; <span class="italic">e.g</span>. a man is the same as a horse, because they have the same genus, animal. By species; <span class="italic">e.g</span>. Cato is the same as Cicero, because they have the same species, man. By number; <span class="italic">e.g</span>. Tully and Cicero, because he is one in number. Similarly diversity is expressed by genus, species, and number. Now numerical difference is caused by variety of accidents; for three men differ neither by genus nor species but by their accidents, for even if we mentally remove from them all other accidents,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL074_7_c" id="target_note_LCL074_7_c"><sup>c</sup></a> still the places for each are diverse, which we cannot by any means make into one place, since two bodies will not occupy one place, and place
