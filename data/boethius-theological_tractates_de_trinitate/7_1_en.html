kinds of number: one with which we count and the other which consists in numerable things. For indeed, “one” is a thing; “unity” is that by which we call a thing one. Again “two” belongs to the class of things, as men or stones; but not so duality; duality is merely that whereby two men or two stones are denoted; and similarly for the rest. Therefore in the case of that number by which we number, the repetition of ones makes plurality; but in the number consisting in things the repetition of ones does not make plurality, as, for example, if I say of one and the same thing, “one sword, one brand, one blade.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL074_15_a" id="target_note_LCL074_15_a"><sup>a</sup></a> For one sword can be recognized in so many words; for this is rather the iteration of ones, not their numeration, just as if we were to say “sword, brand, blade,” this is a sort of repetition of the same thing not a numeration of different things, just as if I were to say “sun sun sun” I should not have produced three suns, but I should have spoken that many times of one thing.</p>
<p>So then if God be predicated thrice, of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, the threefold predication does not result in plural number. The risk of that, as has been said, attends only on those who distinguish them according to merit. But Catholic Christians, allowing no difference of merit in God, and positing that form to be as it really is, nor thinking his essence to be other than it is, rightly regard the statement “the Father is God, the Son is God, the Holy Spirit is God, and this Trinity is one God,” not as an enumeration of different things but as a reiteration of one and the same thing, like the statement, “blade and brand are one sword” or “sun, sun, and sun are one sun.”</p>
