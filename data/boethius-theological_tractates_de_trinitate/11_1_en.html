between the present of our affairs, which is now, and the divine present: our “now” connotes changing time and sempiternity; but God’s “now,” abiding, unmoved, and immovable, connotes eternity. If you add <span class="italic">semper</span> to <span class="italic">eternity</span>, you will get the flowing, incessant and thereby perpetual course of our present time, that is to say, sempiternity.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL074_23_aa" id="target_note_LCL074_23_aa"><sup>a</sup></a></p>
<p>It is just the same with the categories of condition and activity. For example, we say of a man, “He runs, clothed,” of God, “He rules, possessing all things.” Here again nothing substantial is asserted of either subject; in fact all this kind of predication arises from what lies outside substance, and all of these predicates refer, so to speak, to something other than substance. And we easily distinguish the difference of this sort of predication in this way: the terms “man” and “God” refer to the substance in virtue of which the subject is—man or God. The term “just” refers to the quality in virtue of which the subject is something, viz. just; the term “great” to the quantity in virtue of which he is something, viz. great. Now in other kinds of predication there is nothing like this. For he who says that someone is in the market or everywhere, is surely referring to the category of place, but not to anything by reason of which he is something, as he is just in virtue of justice. So when I say, “he runs, he rules, he is now, he is ever,” reference is surely made to activity or time—if indeed God’s “ever” can be described as time—but not to anything in virtue of which he is something, as he is great in virtue of greatness.</p>
