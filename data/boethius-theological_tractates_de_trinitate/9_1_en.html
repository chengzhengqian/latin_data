substance; but it is such as is supersubstantial. When we say of him, “He is just,” we do indeed mention a quality, but not an accidental quality—rather such as is substantial and, in fact, supersubstantial.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL074_19_a" id="target_note_LCL074_19_a"><sup>a</sup></a> For God is not one thing because he is, and another thing because he is just; with him to be just and to be God are one and the same. So when we say, “He is great or the greatest,” we seem indeed to predicate quantity, but it is such as to be the same as this substance which we have declared to be supersubstantial; for with him to be great and to be God are all one. Again, concerning his form, we have already shown that he is form, and truly one without any plurality. Now the categories we have mentioned are such that they give to the thing to which they are applied the character which they express, in a divided manner in other things, but in God in a conjoined and united manner, in the following way. When we name a substance, as man or God, it is named as though that of which the predication is made were itself substance, as if man or God were substance. But there is a difference: since man is not simply and entirely man, and therefore is not substance after all. For what he is he owes to other things which are not man. But God is simply and entirely God, for he is nothing else than what he is, and therefore is simply God. Again just, which is a quality, is said as though it were that of which it is predicated; that is, if we were to say “a just man or just God,” we are asserting that man or God is just. But there is a difference, for man is one thing, and a just man another. But God himself is identical with the just. So a man or God is said to be great, and it would appear that man himself is great
