<p>Finally, we must not look for the categories of situation and passivity in God, for they simply are not to be found in him.</p>

<p>Let us now consider relationships to which all the foregoing remarks have been preliminary; for these especially, which are clearly seen to exist because of something else coming in, do not seem to produce predication by themselves. For instance, since master and slave<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL074_25_a" id="target_note_LCL074_25_a"><sup>a</sup></a> are relative terms, let us see whether either of them is such that it is a predication by itself or not. But if you suppressed the term slave, you would simultaneously suppress the term master. On the other hand, though you suppressed the term whiteness, you would not suppress some white thing, though the fact is important that whiteness belongs as an accident to a white thing, and when it is removed, obviously the white thing ceases to be a white thing. But in the case of master, if you suppress
