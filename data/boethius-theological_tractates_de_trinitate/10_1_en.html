or that God is great. But man is merely great; God himself <span class="italic">is</span> essentially great.</p>
<p>The remaining categories are not predicated of God nor yet of other things.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL074_21_a" id="target_note_LCL074_21_a"><sup>a</sup></a> For place can be predicated of man or of God—of man as “in the market-place”; of God as “everywhere”—but in neither case is the predicate identical with that of which it is predicated. For “in the market-place” is not said of a man in the same way as “white” or “tall” nor so to speak, is he encompassed and determined by some property which enables him to be described in terms of his substance; this predicate of place simply declares how far his substance is given a particular setting amid other things.</p>
<p>It is otherwise, of course, with God. “He is everywhere” seems to mean not that he is in every place, for he cannot be in any place at all—but that every place is present to him for him to occupy, although he himself is not received by any place, and therefore he is said to be nowhere in place, since he is everywhere but not in any place. Now time is predicated in the same way, as, of a man, “He came yesterday,” of God, “He ever is.” Here again it is not as if “he of whom yesterday’s coming is predicated” is said actually to be something, but what is added to him in terms of time is predicated. But what is said of God, “ever is,” signifies only one thing, that he was, as it were, in all the past, is in all the present—however that term be used—and will be in all the future. According to the philosophers this may be said of the heavens and of other immortal bodies, but of God it is said in a different way. He is ever, because “ever” is with him a term of present time, and there is this great difference
