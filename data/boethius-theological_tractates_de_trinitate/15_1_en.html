up the Trinity. Hence only terms belonging to relation may be applied singly and separately. For the Father is not the same as the Son, nor is either of them the same as the Holy Spirit. Yet Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are the same God, the same in justice, in goodness, in greatness, and in everything that can be predicated by itself. One must not forget that relative predication is not always such that it is always predicated with reference to something different, as slave is with reference to master; for they are different. For equals are equal, likes are like, identicals are identical, each with other; and the relation in the Trinity of Father to Son, and of both to Holy Spirit is like a relation of identicals. But if a relation of this kind cannot be found in all other things, this is because of the otherness natural to all perishable, transitory objects. But we ought not to be led astray by any imagination, but raised up by pure understanding and, so far as anything can be understood, thus far also we should approach it with our understanding.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL074_31_a" id="target_note_LCL074_31_a"><sup>a</sup></a></p>
<p>But enough has now been said of the question which was proposed. The subtle reasoning of the argument awaits the standard of your judgement; the authority of your verdict will decide whether it has been run through on a straight course or not. If, the grace of God helping me, I have furnished some fitting support in argument to an article which stands quite firmly by itself on the foundation of Faith, the joy felt for the finished work will flow back to the source whence its effecting came. But if human nature has failed to reach beyond its limits, whatever my weakness takes away, my prayers will make up.</p>
