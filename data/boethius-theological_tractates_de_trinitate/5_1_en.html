being is dependent on form. For a statue is not called a likeness of a living thing on account of the bronze which is its matter, but on account of the form whereby that likeness is impressed upon it: and the bronze itself is not called bronze because of the earth which is its matter, but because of the form of bronze. Likewise earth itself is not called earth by reason of unqualified matter,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL074_11_a" id="target_note_LCL074_11_a"><sup>a</sup></a> but by reason of dryness and weight, which are forms. So nothing is said to be because of its matter, but because of its distinctive form. But the Divine Substance is form without matter, and is therefore one, and is its own essence. But other things are not their own essences, for each thing has its being from the things of which it is composed, that is, from its parts. It is This <span class="italic">and</span> That, <span class="italic">i.e</span>. it is its parts in conjunction; it is not This <span class="italic">or</span> That taken apart. Earthly man, for instance, since he consists of soul and body, is body <span class="italic">and</span> soul, not body <span class="italic">or</span> soul, separately; therefore he is not his own essence. That on the other hand which does not consist of This and That, but is only This, is really its own essence, and is altogether beautiful and stable because it does not depend upon anything. Wherefore that is truly one in which is no number, in which nothing is present except its own essence. Nor can it become the substrate of anything, for it is form, and forms cannot be substrates.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL074_11_ba" id="target_note_LCL074_11_ba"><sup>b</sup></a> For if humanity, like
