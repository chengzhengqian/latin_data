I asked him for a Tribunate for M. Curtius (if I had asked
Domitius he would have thought I was making game of
him; it’s his daily grumble that he can’t even appoint a Military
Tribune; he even made a joke in the Senate to the
effect that his colleague Appius had gone to Caesar for the
gift of a Tribune’s commission), but for next year. That is
how Curtius himself wanted it.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_135_3" id="target_note_LCL462_135_3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>Rest assured that in public life and in my personal feuds
I am and shall be just what you recommend, softer than the

<p>This time it will be quality pen and well-mixed ink and
ivory-finished paper, since you say you could hardly read
my last letter. No, my dear fellow, it was for none of the
reasons you suppose. I was neither busy nor upset nor
annoyed with anybody. It’s just that I always take the first
pen that comes to hand as though it was a good one.</p>
