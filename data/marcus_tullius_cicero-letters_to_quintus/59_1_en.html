<p class="noindent">—that is, the intermediaries in our reconciliation.</p>
<p>I shall do my best for Theopompus. As for Caesar, I forgot
to tell you—yes, I understand what kind of a letter you
have been waiting for. But he wrote to Balbus that the parcel
containing Balbus’ letter and mine was delivered to
him completely waterlogged so that he doesn’t even know
that a letter from me was inside. But he had made out a few
words in Balbus’ letter, to which he replies as follows: ‘I see
you have written something about Cicero which I cannot
make out. But so far as I could follow it by guesswork, it
looked like something I should have wished rather than
hoped for.’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_123_6" id="target_note_LCL462_123_6"><sup>6</sup></a> So I proceeded to send Caesar a copy of my
letter. And don’t be put off by his joke about being hard up.
I replied that he had better not spend his last penny depending
on <span class="italic">my</span> strongbox, and some more banter on the
same lines—familiar but not undignified. All reports speak
of his special regard for me. The letter replying to the point
you have in mind should just about coincide with your return
to Rome.</p>
<p>I shall write you day-by-day newsletters always provided
you supply the couriers. But there’s a hard frost

the laws of hospitality. Cicero may be thought to have in mind the
feasts which doubtless celebrated his and Appius’ reconciliation.
As for the Greeks, they are not, as some commentators naively
suppose, actual Greeks; rather, as Cicero expressly says, they
stand for the intermediaries who had recently brought about the reconciliation, principally Pompey; cf. <span class="italic">Letters to Atticus</span> 124
(VII.1).4, where, likewise in quotations, the ‘Trojan men and
