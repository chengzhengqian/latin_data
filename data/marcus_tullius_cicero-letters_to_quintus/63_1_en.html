some practice in this employment in bringing our younger
boy<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_131_3" id="target_note_LCL462_131_3"><sup>3</sup></a> forward during this holiday season.</p>
<p>On your side, as you say in your letter (though even if
you did not say so I know you are doing it most conscientiously),
you will of course take care to sort out my commissions
and follow them up and polish them off. When I get
back to Rome I shall not let a single courier of Caesar’s
leave without a letter for you. As for these present days you
will forgive me; there was nobody to take a letter until this
M. Orfius, a Roman Knight who is connected with me both
on personal grounds and because he comes from the town
of Atella, which you know to be under my patronage. So I
recommend him to you warmly. He is a man of distinction
in his own community and of influence even outside it. Be
sure to treat him handsomely and so attach him to yourself.
He is a Military Tribune in your army. You will find him
grateful and attentive.</p>
<p>Let me earnestly beg you to be very fond of Trebatius.</p>

<p>On 2 June, the day I got back to Rome, I received your
letter dispatched from Placentia, and then another dispatched
the following day from Blandeno,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_131_1" id="target_note_LCL462_131_1"><sup>1</sup></a> together with a
letter of Caesar’s full of all manner of friendly attention,
thoughtfulness, and charm. The things you speak of are indeed
important, or rather <span class="italic">most</span> important, tending powerfully,
as they do, to great kudos and the highest prestige.
But take the word of one you know: what I value most in
