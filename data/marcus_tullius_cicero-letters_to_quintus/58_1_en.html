in person and through Pomponius. He sees that if I take
the same tone in other matters he will have a lean February.

out of his grip but raising a storm of laughter by my jibes at
the purple-bordered gown he got during Caesar’s Consulship:
‘Now as for his request for the renewal of the honours
accorded to him, far be it from me to suggest that this
House should gainsay his right to give the purplebordered
gown an annual touching up. But I appeal to
members of the nobility here present: you gentlemen
drew the line at Oxnose; are you going to accept Commagene
ointment?’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_121_4a" id="target_note_LCL462_121_4a"><sup>4</sup></a> You perceive the genre and the
theme. I cut so many jokes at this inglorious monarch’s expense
that he was totally exploded. Appius, as I say, was
alarmed by this procedure and is smothering me in courtesies.

wear the purple-bordered gown (<span class="italic">toga praetexta</span>) worn by Roman

a lowborn person named or nicknamed Burrhinus, whose election
to a magistracy was resented or ridiculed by the nobility—or
rather, as suggested by T. P. Wiseman and as I think likely, to one
Burrienus (or Burrenus), City Praetor in 83. But the chasing of
phantoms has continued; cf. G. W. Bowersock, <span class="italic">Roman Arabia,</span>
