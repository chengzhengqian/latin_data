Cato is ill. Pompey is putting a lot of pressure on me for a
reconciliation, but so far he has got nowhere, nor ever will
if I keep a scrap of personal independence. I am waiting
impatiently for a letter from you. It is untrue that I had
anything to do with the coalition between the consular
candidates, as you say you have heard. In view of the nature
of the bargains struck in that coalition, which were
subsequently made public by Memmius, no honest man
could decently have had a hand in it. Besides, it would not

your letter: First, once again I approve of your staying on,
especially as you have discussed it, as you say, with Caesar.
I am surprised that Oppius has had any dealings with
Publius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_159_19" id="target_note_LCL462_159_19"><sup>19</sup></a>—I did not want it. Further on in your letter you
say that I am to be appointed Pompey’s Legate on the Ides
of September.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_159_20a" id="target_note_LCL462_159_20a"><sup>20</sup></a> That is news to me. I have written to
