friend Pompey spoils the sport to the disgust of gods and
men.</p>
<p>Now let me tell you about the fellow’s insolence—something
to give you a little pleasure in this twilight of the
commonwealth. After giving out wherever he went that he
was claiming a Triumph and then (good general that he
is) suddenly bursting into the enemy capital<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_167_2a" id="target_note_LCL462_167_2a"><sup>2</sup></a> at night, he
didn’t trust himself inside the Senate. Not until<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_167_3" id="target_note_LCL462_167_3"><sup>3</sup></a> the statutory
tenth day, on which he was required to report the

into a very thin House.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_167_4" id="target_note_LCL462_167_4"><sup>4</sup></a> As he was about to leave, he was
detained by the Consuls and the tax farmers brought in.
Harassed from all sides as he was, I hit him hardest. Unable
to stand it, he called out ‘exile’ in a quavering voice.
Thereupon (gods above, it was the most flattering thing
that ever happened to me) the Senate rose like one man,

Triumphator had to swear before the City Quaestors within ten
days (inclusive reckoning) of his triumphal entry to the truth of his

Maximus 2.8.1). As here appears (if the text is sound; see my Commentary),
he was also required to report the number of immolated
victims and of soldiers taking part. Gabinius, says Cicero,
had talked of claiming a Triumph, but actually had entered Rome by stealth and slunk into the Senate ten days later, the very day by
which had he triumphed he would have had to take the oath.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL462_167_2a').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL462_167_3"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL462_167_3" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">3</sup>Translating <span class="italic">inde primum</span> for <span class="italic">interim.</span></a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL462_167_3').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL462_167_4"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL462_167_4" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">4</sup>By entering Rome Gabinius had forfeited his claim to a Triumph,
