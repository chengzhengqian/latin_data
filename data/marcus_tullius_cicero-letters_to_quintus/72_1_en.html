the little bridge at Furrina’s<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_149_5" id="target_note_LCL462_149_5"><sup>5</sup></a> chapel leading to Satricum.
In that stretch powdered earth has been used instead of
gravel (that will be altered), and that part of the road has a
steep uphill gradient. But I saw that no other direction was
possible, especially as you did not want to take it through
either Lucusta’s land or Varro’s. Varro had made the road in
front of his property in good style, whereas Lucusta has
not touched his section. I shall tackle him in Rome and
think I shall get him moving. At the same time I shall ask
M. Taurus, who is now in Rome, about taking a conduit
through his farm—I hear he has made you a promise.</p>
<p>Your bailiff Nicephorus impressed me very favourably.
I asked him whether you had given him any instructions
about that little bit of building at Laterium of which you
had spoken to me. He answered that he had contracted to
do the job himself for HS 16,000, but that you had later
made considerable additions to the work and none to the
price, so he had done nothing about it. For my part, I am
really strongly in favour of making the additions you proposed.
True, the house at present has an air of high thinking
which rebukes the wild extravagance of other country
houses; but still that addition will be pleasant. I commended
the gardener. He has covered everything with ivy,
the foundation wall of the house and the intervals between
the columns in the promenade, so that the statues in their
Greek cloaks look as though they were doing ornamental
gardening and advertising their ivy. Then there is the little
undressing room which is cool and mossy to a degree.</p>
<p>That’s about all from the country. Philotimus and
Cincius are pushing on with the finishing touches to your
house, but I often put in an appearance myself, which is
easy to do. So please set your mind at rest on that score.</p>
