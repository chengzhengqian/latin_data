falling-off in moral standards and in a province so rich
in temptations, it must surely appear superhuman.</p>
<p>With these principles and this discipline you can safely
practise in your decisions and judgements the severity
which you have shown in certain matters, by which we
have made ourselves some enemies—and very glad I am of
it. For you are not to suppose that I pay attention to the
grumblings of a fellow called Paconius (not a Greek even,
but a Mysian, or rather Phrygian) or the talk of a crazy
money-grubber like Tuscenius, whose unsavoury plums
you most justly plucked from his disgusting jaws. These
and other markedly strict decisions in your province could
not easily be sustained against criticism without the highest
integrity. So let your judicial rulings be of the strictest,
provided that strictness be consistently maintained and
never modified by partiality. And yet it is of no great importance
that you yourself dispense justice consistently and
conscientiously if those to whom you grant some share in
this function do not do the like. As it seems to me, the administration
of Asia presents no great variety of business; it
all rests in the main on the dispensation of justice. The actual
knowledge involved in that, especially in a province, is
no problem, but there is need of consistency and firmness
to resist even the suspicion of partiality.</p>
<p>Other requisites are readiness to listen, mildness of
manner in delivering judgement, conscientiousness in
arguing with suitors and answering their complaints. C.
Octavius recently gained much public regard by these
means.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_23_5" id="target_note_LCL462_23_5"><sup>5</sup></a> The First<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_23_6" id="target_note_LCL462_23_6"><sup>6</sup></a> Lictor in his court had nothing to do,
