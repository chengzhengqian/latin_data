knew nothing about this escort and I laughed till I cried
when he suddenly opened the curtains and we both almost
collapsed—he with fright and I with laughter). Well, as I
say, I should certainly have taken him along to sample after
so long the subtlety of his old-time wit and civilized conversation,
but I did not like to invite an invalid to a drafty
house, still not even roughly finished. It will be a special
treat for me to enjoy his company here too—I can tell you
that Marius as my neighbour is the pride and glory of my
property at Pompeii. I shall take care that Anicius’ place is
ready for him. As for me, bookworm though I be, I can live
with the carpenters, a philosophy which I get, not from Mt
Hymettus, but from our native Peak.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_113_4" id="target_note_LCL462_113_4"><sup>4</sup></a> Marius is not so
tough, either in health or nature. As for interruptions, I
shall borrow from you people just so much time for writing
as you allow, and I hope you don’t allow any; that way, if I
do nothing, you will be to blame instead of my own laziness.</p>
<p>I am sorry you take the political situation overmuch to
heart and that you are a better citizen than Philoctetes,
who being wronged wanted to see such sights as are evidently
painful to you.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_113_5" id="target_note_LCL462_113_5"><sup>5</sup></a> Be a good fellow, and hurry over. I
shall comfort you and wipe away all sorrows. And bring
Marius, if you love me. But make haste, both of you.</p>
