brotherly affection for us will prompt concern for our reputation
along with the concern he feels for his own. You
have a Quaestor<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_15_3" id="target_note_LCL462_15_3"><sup>3</sup></a> whom you did not choose of your own
judgement but acquired by the luck of the draw. It behoves
him to exercise discretion of his own accord and to defer to
your rules and advice. If it were by any chance the case that
the moral standards of one or other of these gentlemen left
something to be desired, you would put up with his disregard
of regulations which apply to him as an individual, but
not allow him to use for profit the authority which you confer
upon him as conducive to his standing. Now that our
modern ways have leaned so far in the direction of excessive
lenity and popularity-mongering, I would not really
have you examine every dark patch and search their pockets
man by man; better to assign to each one an amount of
responsibility commensurate with the trust he inspires.</p>
<p>Very well, you will answer for the officers whom the
commonwealth itself gives you as your companions and
assistants in public business within the limits I have just
laid down, and no further. What of those whom you have
chosen to be with you from your household entourage or
necessary staff—members of the Governor’s Cohort, as
they are usually called? In their case we have to answer not
only for everything they do but for everything they say.
However, the people with you are people of whom you can
easily be fond if they behave well and whom you can even
more easily check if they don’t pay enough regard to your
reputation. When you were new to the job, they could perhaps
have taken advantage of your generous instincts—the
better a man is, the harder he finds it to suspect rascality in
others. Now a third year is opening; let it show the same integrity
as the two that preceded it with a greater measure
