Lupus’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_81_2" id="target_note_LCL462_81_2"><sup>2</sup></a> speech was awaited with interest. He dealt with
the Campanian Land question very fully, to an extremely
attentive House. You know the material. He covered all
my own contributions. There were some barbs to Caesar’s
address, some insults to Gellius’, some complaints to Pompey’s—who
was not present. It was getting late when he
wound up, and he said he would not ask for a debate since
he did not wish to put any pressure on us to make ourselves
enemies. The high words of days gone by and the present
silence told him the feeling of the House. He began to dismiss
the meeting. Marcellinus observed: ‘I must ask you,
sir, not to draw any conclusions as to what we now approve
or disapprove of from the fact that we have nothing to say.
So far as I myself am concerned, and I imagine the same
applies to the rest of the House, I am holding my peace because
I do not think the question of the Campanian Land
can properly be handled in Pompey’s absence.’ Lupus then
said that he would not detain the House.</p>
<p>Racilius then rose and laid the question of the trials before
the House, calling on Marcellinus to open the debate.
After a powerful indictment of Clodius’ arsons, killings,
and stonings he proposed that the City Praetor should personally
appoint a jury by lot, and that when this process
was complete elections should be held; any person obstructing
the trials to be regarded as acting contrary to
public order. This proposal was warmly approved. C. Cato
spoke against it, as did Cassius,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_81_3" id="target_note_LCL462_81_3"><sup>3</sup></a> amid loud cries of protest
