<p>I pardon your continual enquiries about young Quintus,
but I hope you on your side will pardon me if I refuse
to admit that you love him any more than I do myself.
I only wish he could have been with me these days at
Arpinum, which he wanted and I no less. So I’d like you to
write to Pomponia, if you see fit, and ask her to come with
me when I make an excursion and bring the boy. I shall do
wonders if I have him by me on vacation—in Rome there
isn’t a moment to get one’s breath. You know I gave you my
word earlier gratis, so you can imagine what will happen
now that you have offered me such a splendid fee.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_151_6" id="target_note_LCL462_151_6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>I come now to the letter which I received at Arpinum in
several instalments—three letters were delivered to me
in one day, apparently dispatched by you simultaneously.
One, which was rather long, began by noting that my
letter to you bore an earlier date than the one to Caesar. It
sometimes happens unavoidably that when Oppius has
arranged to send couriers and been given a letter from me,
he is held up by something unexpected and dispatches it
unavoidably later than he had arranged; and once the
letters are handed in, I don’t trouble about getting the date
changed.</p>
<p>You write about Caesar’s warm affection for us. You will
cherish that, and I shall do everything in my power to increase
it. As regards Pompey, I am and shall be careful to
do what you advise. You say you are grateful for my licence
to stay on; I miss you very sorely indeed, but still I am partially
glad of it. I don’t understand your purpose in sending
for Hippodamus and certain others. Every one of these
gentry expects a present from you to the value of a property
