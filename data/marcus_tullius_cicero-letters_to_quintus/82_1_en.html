there are no juries any more. I’m afraid of a fiasco. And
then people are so malicious—I’m nervous that he might
gain some advantage with myself as prosecutor. And I don’t
despair of seeing the thing go through without me, and in
some degree with my assistance.</p>
<p>All the candidates for the Consulship have been
charged with bribery: Domitius by Memmius,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_169_5" id="target_note_LCL462_169_5"><sup>5</sup></a> Memmius
by Q. Acutius (a good, well-instructed young man), Messalla
by Q. Pompeius, Scaurus by Triarius. Something big
is on the way, for it looks like the end of either the men or
the laws. Efforts are being made to prevent the trials, and
there’s the prospect of an Interregnum. The Consuls are
eager to hold elections, but the defendants don’t want
them, especially Memmius, because he hopes that when
Caesar arrives he will be elected. But he is in remarkably
low water. It seems a certainty for Domitius and Messalla.
Scaurus has gone flat. Appius says definitely that he will
take over from our friend Lentulus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_169_6" id="target_note_LCL462_169_6"><sup>6</sup></a> without a curiate law.
I almost forgot to say that he was magnificent that day
against Gabinius—charged him with lese majesty. Members
volunteered (?),<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_169_7" id="target_note_LCL462_169_7"><sup>7</sup></a> while Gabinius never said a word.</p>
<p>So much for public affairs. At home all is well. As to the
home itself, the contractors are making reasonably good
progress.</p>
