courses with regard to Gabinius which you, in the warmth
of your affection to be sure, have been considering. ‘Then
let the earth yawn wide for me.’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_195_1" id="target_note_LCL462_195_1"><sup>1</sup></a> What I did I did, as everybody
feels, with the utmost responsibility and moderation.
I have neither borne hard on him nor lent a helping hand. I
spoke forcibly on the witness stand but otherwise held my
peace. As for the outcome of the trial, shocking and detrimental
as it was, I took it with complete composure. Now
at long last I have gained this much: the evils in our public
life and the licence of bold, bad men, which used to make
me boil with rage, now leave me quite unmoved. For the
men and the times could not be worse than they are; so,
since public affairs can no longer yield any pleasure, I don’t
know why I should get my temper up. I have sources of joy
in my writings and studies, my leisure, my country houses,
and above all else in our children. Milo is my only worry,
but I hope his Consulship will put an end to that. I shall
make as big an effort in that as I made for my own, and you
will help from over there, as you are doing. In this matter,
unless sheer violence breaks loose, everything is in good
shape with one exception—his pocket. That alarms me.
‘Mad he is, past all bearing’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_195_2" id="target_note_LCL462_195_2"><sup>2</sup></a>—planning a show to cost HS
*. His unwisdom in this one particular I shall restrain as
best I can, and your force of character<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_195_3a" id="target_note_LCL462_195_3a"><sup>3</sup></a> should enable you
tao do the like with effect.</p>
<p>As for the changes in the coming year, I did not mean
you to understand anything in the nature of private alarm,
I was referring to the general state of the commonwealth.
Even though I have no responsibility, I can hardly be indifferent.
