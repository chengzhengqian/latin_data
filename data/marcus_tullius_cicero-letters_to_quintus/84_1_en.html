brother Caecilius,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_173_2" id="target_note_LCL462_173_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and his son Sulla as assistant prosecutors.
L. Torquatus put in a rival claim to prosecute and
everyone was glad it failed. You will want to know what is
happening about Gabinius. We shall know about the lese
majesty in three days’ time. In that trial he is weighed
down by his unpopularity with all classes, and the witnesses
are most damaging; the prosecutors are extremely
ineffective, the jury is a mixed bag, the President, Alfius, is
responsible and firm, Pompey is urgently trying to influence
the jurors. I don’t know what will happen, but I don’t
see any place for him in the community. I take a moderate
attitude as to his ruin, and a very easy one as to the outcome
of events.</p>
<p>That is about all my news. I will add one thing: your
(our) boy Quintus is greatly devoted to his tutor in rhetoric,
Paeonius, a very good experienced man, I think; but, as
you are aware, my method of instruction is a little more
scholarly and abstract. Accordingly, I don’t want Quintus’
progress and the teaching he is getting held up; and the
boy himself seems to find the declamatory mode more attractive
and agreeable. We have been through it ourselves,
so let us allow him to follow in our footsteps. I am confident
he will reach the same goal. All the same, when I
take him away with me somewhere in the country, I shall
introduce him to my method and practice. You have offered
me a big fee, and it won’t be my fault if I don’t earn it.</p>
<p>Do write to me in full detail where you will be spending
the winter and with what prospects.</p>
