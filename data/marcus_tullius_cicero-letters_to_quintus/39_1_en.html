when they put the elections before the trials. Philippus
concurred with Lentulus. Then Racilius called upon me
first of the private members. I spoke at length on the whole
issue of P. Clodius’ sedition and banditry, arraigning him
like a man in the dock with frequent murmurs of approval
from the whole House. Vetus Antistius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_83_4" id="target_note_LCL462_83_4"><sup>4</sup></a> praised my speech
at some length—his was not at all a bad performance. He
also took up the question of the trials and said that he
would regard it as of primary importance. A vote to that
effect was about to take place, when Clodius was called
and proceeded to talk out the motion. Racilius’ insulting
and witty attack had infuriated him. Then his roughs suddenly
set up quite a formidable shouting from Ambassadors’
Lodge<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_83_5" id="target_note_LCL462_83_5"><sup>5</sup></a> and the steps. I believe they had been stirred
up against Q. Sextilius and Milo’s friends. On that alarm we
broke up in haste, amid loud and general protest.</p>
<p>There you have one day’s proceedings. The sequel, I
suppose, will be deferred till January. Racilius is much
the best of the Tribunes, but I think Antistius too will be
friendly to us. Plancius, of course, is completely devoted.</p>
<p>If you love me, be sure to be cautious and careful about
putting to sea in December.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_83_6" id="target_note_LCL462_83_6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
