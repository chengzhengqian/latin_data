<p>And then what a boon you conferred on Asia in relieving
her from the iniquitous, oppressive Aediles’ Tax,
thereby making us some powerful enemies. One noble
personage is openly complaining that your edict forbidding
the voting of public money for shows has picked his
pocket of HS 200,000. That gives an idea of the sum that
would be involved if money were paid out for the benefit of
everybody who gave shows in Rome, as had become the
practice. However, I found a means of stifling our fellow
countrymen’s grumblings on this point—I don’t know
about Asia, but in Rome my action has been greeted with
no little surprise and commendation. I have declined
money voted by the communes for a temple and memorial
to myself. They had voted it enthusiastically in recognition
of their great indebtedness to me and the signal benefits of
your government; and the taking of money for a temple
and memorial is specifically permitted by law. Moreover,
the sum contributed would not have vanished into thin air,
but would have remained in the form of temple ornaments,
presented, as might well be thought, to the Roman
People and the Immortal Gods quite as much as to me.
This gift—honourable to myself, legally sanctioned, and
made with the good will of the givers—I thought proper to
decline, in order, among other reasons, to mitigate the annoyance
of those who had lost what nobody owed them

and heart into continuing upon the lines you have followed
hitherto; love those whom the Senate and People of Rome
have committed to your charge and authority, protect
