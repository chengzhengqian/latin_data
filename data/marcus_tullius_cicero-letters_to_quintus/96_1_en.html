How cautious I want you to be in what you write
you may infer from the fact that in writing to you I don’t
mention even overt political disorders, for fear of the letters
getting intercepted and giving offence in any quarter.
So I want you to ease your mind of private concern. I know
how anxious you are apt to be about public affairs.</p>
<p>I expect to see our friend Messalla Consul; if by an
Interrex he will not be on trial, if by a Dictator he will still
be in no danger.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_197_4" id="target_note_LCL462_197_4"><sup>4</sup></a> Nobody hates him, Hortensius’ ardour<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_197_5" id="target_note_LCL462_197_5"><sup>5</sup></a>
will have a powerful effect, and Gabinius’ acquittal is regarded
as a statute of impunity. <span class="italic">En passant</span>, nothing has so
far been done about a Dictator after all. Pompey is away,
Appius is stirring the pot, Hirrus making ready, many veto
casters are being counted, the public is indifferent, the
leaders are opposed, I lie low.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for your promise of slaves.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_197_6" id="target_note_LCL462_197_6"><sup>6</sup></a> As
you say, I am indeed understaffed, both in Rome and on
my estates. But, my dear fellow, please don’t consider anything
to do with my convenience unless it is absolutely convenient
and easy for you.</p>
<p>I was amused to hear about Vatinius’ letter,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_197_7" id="target_note_LCL462_197_7"><sup>7</sup></a> but I may
tell you that he is so attentive to me that I not only swallow
those nastinesses of his but digest them too.</p>
<p>The epic to Caesar which you urge me to finish, finished
I have, a delectable piece, so it seems to <span class="italic">me.</span> But I am
looking for a trustworthy courier for fear it share the fate of
your <span class="italic">Erigona</span>, the only traveller from Gaul under Caesar’s

happened), Messalla would take office immediately the result was
declared and so become immune from prosecution until the end
of his term. But even if they were held before the year end, Cicero
thought he was not likely to be convicted.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL462_197_4').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL462_197_5"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL462_197_5" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">5</sup>Hortensius was Messalla’s uncle.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL462_197_5').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL462_197_6"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL462_197_6" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">6</sup>From Gaul or Britain.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL462_197_6').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL462_197_7"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL462_197_7" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">7</sup>Probably a letter to Caesar which had been shown to
