take your soundings, and write me the truth; that is
what our situation, though not your affection, requires. I
shall hold on to life as long as I think that it is in your interest
for me to do so or that it should be preserved in hope
of better things. You will find Sestius very friendly to us.
I think Lentulus, who will be Consul, wishes you well.
But actions are not so easy as words. You will see what is
needed and how things are.</p>
<p>If nobody scorns your loneliness and our common calamity,
something will be achievable through you or not at
all. But if our enemies start persecuting you too, don’t take
it lying down. In your case the weapons will be lawsuits,
not swords. But I hope there will be none of that. I beg you
to write back to me on all matters and to believe that, however
much I may have lost in spirit, or rather in judgement,
my affection and family feeling remain the same.</p>

<p>I dispatched a letter this morning which you will have
already read. But Licinius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_79_1" id="target_note_LCL462_79_1"><sup>1</sup></a> was kind enough to call on
me this evening after the Senate had risen to give me the
opportunity of writing to you an account of the day’s proceedings.</p>
<p>The House met in larger numbers than I thought possible
in December just before the holiday. Of the Consulars,
there were, besides myself and the two Consuls-Elect, P.
Servilius, M. Lucullus, Lepidus, Volcacius, Glabrio. The
ex-Praetors were in good force. In all we were about 200.
