sixteen days; and are <span class="italic">you</span> trying to borrow anything from
someone else? And are you asking for <span class="italic">Sailors</span> (?) when you
have written an <span class="italic">Electra</span> and a *?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_187_7a" id="target_note_LCL462_187_7a"><sup>7</sup></a> Don’t be so lazy. And
don’t suppose that the old maxim ‘know thyself’ was made
only to reduce conceit; it also tells us to know our strong
points. But please send me these new ones and <span class="italic">Erigona.</span>
There are your two last letters answered.</p>
<p>In Rome and especially on the Appian Way near the
temple of Mars we are having extraordinarily heavy floods.
Crassipes’ promenade has been swept away along with a
great number of residences and shops. The vast expanse of
water stretches as far as the public fish pond. Homer’s lines
are much quoted:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">An autumn day, when Zeus most mightily</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Doth rain, in ire against unrighteous men,</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">pat as they are to Gabinius’ acquittal:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">Who, rendering crooked judgements openly,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Drive justice out nor reck of wrath divine.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_187_8" id="target_note_LCL462_187_8"><sup>8</sup></a></span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">But I am resolved not to trouble myself about such matters.
When I get back to Rome I shall write to you what I
observe, especially about the Dictatorship, and shall send
letters to Labienus and Ligurius.</p>
<p>I am writing this before dawn by the light of a little
lamp with a wooden stand, which delights me because they
say you had it made when you were in Samos.</p>
<p>Good-bye, my sweetest and best of brothers.</p>
