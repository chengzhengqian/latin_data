<p>Would that you had seen me or heard of me dead before
this happened! Would that I had left you as the survivor
not of my life only but of my standing! But I call all the
gods to witness that one saying called me back from death:
everyone told me that some part of your life was bound up
in mine. I was wrong, criminally wrong. If I had died, my
death itself would easily defend my brotherly love for you.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_67_2" id="target_note_LCL462_67_2"><sup>2</sup></a>

a father in wisdom. What pleasure did I ever take apart
from you or you apart from me? And then at the same time
I miss my daughter, the most loving, modest, and clever
daughter a man ever had, the image of my face and speech
and mind.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_67_5" id="target_note_LCL462_67_5"><sup>5</sup></a> Likewise my charming, darling little boy, whom
