<p>So I think big things are on the way. Pompey has information
(and talks about it to me) that a plot against his life
is on foot, that Crassus is backing C. Cato and supplying
Clodius with funds, and that both are getting support both
from Crassus and from Curio, Bibulus, and his other detractors.
He says he must take very good care not to be
caught napping, with the meeting-going public pretty well
alienated, the nobility hostile, the Senate ill-disposed, and
the younger generation ill-conditioned. So he is getting
ready and bringing up men from the country. Clodius on
his side is reinforcing his gang in readiness for Quirinus’
Day. With the same date in view we have much the advantage
even with Milo’s own forces, but a large contingent is
expected from Picenum and Gaul, which should further
enable us to make a stand against Cato’s bills concerning
Milo and Lentulus.</p>
<p>On 10 Febr uary Sestius was charged with bribery by an
informer, Cn. Nerius of the tribe Pupinia, and on the same
day with breach of the peace by a certain M. Tullius. He
was unwell, so, as was only proper, I called on him immediately
and promised him my services without reservation.
And I did this contrary to what people were expecting in
the belief that I was justifiably annoyed with him.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_93_3" id="target_note_LCL462_93_3"><sup>3</sup></a> So I
figure in his eyes and everyone else’s as an eminently forgiving
and grateful character. And I shall so continue. The
same informer Nerius has produced as tied witnesses<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_93_4" id="target_note_LCL462_93_4"><sup>4</sup></a> Cn.
Lentulus Vatia and C. Cornelius of the tribe Stellatina. The
same day the Senate passed a decree to the effect that the
political clubs and caucuses should be dissolved and a bill
put through providing that persons not complying with
this ordinance be liable to the same penalty as those guilty
of breach of peace.</p>
