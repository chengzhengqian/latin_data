those Nervii of yours live and how far they are away from
us I don’t know.</p>
<p>It gave me much pleasure to learn from your letter of
the courage and dignity of Caesar’s bearing in his great
sorrow.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_191_1" id="target_note_LCL462_191_1"><sup>1</sup></a> As for your command that I finish that poem
addressed to him which I had begun, my time is much distracted
and my mind far more so, but since Caesar knows
from my letter to you that I have started on something, I
shall go back to what I began and finish it during these
leisure days of Supplications. I am very glad that thanks to
them our friend Messalla and the others have been relieved
of annoyance, and when you folk reckon him as certain
of election along with Domitius you don’t at all run
counter to our opinion. I make myself responsible to
Caesar for Messalla’s behaviour. But Memmius pins hopes
on Caesar’s return to Italy, wherein I fancy he is making a
mistake. Here at any rate he is in the cold. Scaurus was
thrown over by Pompey some time ago.</p>
<p>Business has been adjourned and the elections brought
to an Interregnum. There is talk of a Dictator, disagreeable
to the honest men; what they are saying is to me still less
agreeable. But the whole idea is viewed with alarm, and at
the same time it’s falling flat. Pompey categorically denies
any desire for it. Talking to me himself earlier on he did not
use to deny it. It looks as though Hirrus will make the proposal.
(Gods, what an ass he is! How he loves himself—in
which regard he has no competitor!) He got me to
frighten off Crassus Junianus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_191_2" id="target_note_LCL462_191_2"><sup>2</sup></a> who is at my service. Does
he want it or doesn’t he? Hard to tell, but if Hirrus is the
mover, he will never persuade the world that he doesn’t. At
present they are talking of nothing else in the way of politics;
certainly nothing is a-doing.</p>
