Consuls<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_65_13" id="target_note_LCL462_65_13"><sup>13</sup></a> show every sign of good will. Among the Praetors

<p>My brother, my brother, my brother! Were you really
afraid that I was angry with you for some reason and on
that account sent boys to you without a letter, or even did
not want to see you?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_65_1" id="target_note_LCL462_65_1"><sup>1</sup></a><span class="italic"> I</span> angry with <span class="italic">you</span>? How could I be? As
though it was <span class="italic">you</span> who struck me down, <span class="italic">your</span> enemies,
<span class="italic">your</span> unpopularity, and not I who have lamentably caused
<span class="italic">your</span> downfall! That much-lauded Consulship of mine has
robbed me of you, and my children, and my country, and
my possessions; I only hope it has robbed you of nothing
but myself. Sure it is that you have never given me
cause for anything but pride and pleasure, whereas I have
brought you sorrow for my calamity, fear of your own, loss,
grief, loneliness. <span class="italic">I</span> not want to see <span class="italic">you</span>? No, it was rather
that I did not want to be seen by you! You would not have
seen your brother, the man you left in Rome, the man you
knew, the man who saw you off and said good-bye with mutual
tears—you would not have seen any trace or shadow of
<span class="italic">him</span>; only the likeness of a breathing corpse.</p>
