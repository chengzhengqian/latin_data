these matters I already have, and that is, first, yourself so
dedicated to the support of our common standing, and
second, such affection for me on Caesar’s part. That means
more to me than all the distinctions he wants me to expect
at his hands. The letter he sent along with yours pleased
me beyond words. He begins by saying how delighted he
was at your arrival and the memory of old affection, then
goes on to promise that, knowing how sorely I shall miss
you, he will make me glad that in your absence from me
you are with him rather than anywhere else.</p>
<p>It is good brotherly advice you give me to make Caesar
the one man I exert myself to please, but <span class="italic">now</span> upon my
word the horse is willing. Yes, that I shall do enthusiastically.
It often happens to travellers in a hurry that after getting
up rather later than they intended they put on speed
and thus arrive at their destinations faster even than if they
had been astir in the middle of the night. So perhaps with
me. In cultivating this man’s friendship I have been asleep
a long while, though I must admit that you often tried to
wake me up. Now I shall compensate my slowness by putting
my horse to a gallop—and not just my horse but my
poetic chariot, since you say my poem<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_133_2" id="target_note_LCL462_133_2"><sup>2</sup></a> meets with his approval.
All you have to do is to give me Britain to paint. I’ll
use your colours with my brush. But what am I about?
Where can I spy the spare time, especially if I stay in
Rome, as he asks me to do? Well, I’ll see. Perhaps love
alone will conquer all obstacles. It often does.</p>
<p>He actually thanks me for sending him Trebatius, very
wittily and kindly, saying that in all his multitudinous entourage
there wasn’t a man who could draw up a bail bond.
