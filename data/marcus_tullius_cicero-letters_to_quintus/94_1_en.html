<p>The funeral of Serranus, Domitius’ son,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_193_3" id="target_note_LCL462_193_3"><sup>3</sup></a> took place on
23 November, a very sad occasion. His father spoke a eulogy

<p>Now about Milo: Pompey does nothing to help him and

Caesar throws his weight that way. This appalls Milo, as
well it may, and he is almost in despair should Pompey become
Dictator. If he assists anyone vetoing the Dictatorship
with his organized band he fears Pompey’s hostility,
whereas if he doesn’t give such assistance he’s afraid it will
be carried through by force. He is preparing some most
magnificent Games, in fact they will cost as much as any
that ever were—which is double and triple folly, for (a) nobody,
asked him, (b) he had previously given a splendid
show, (c) he can’t afford it; or rather more than triple because
(d) he could have seen himself as a President,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_193_5" id="target_note_LCL462_193_5"><sup>5</sup></a> not
an Aedile.</p>
<p>That’s about all. Take care of your health, my dearest
brother.</p>
