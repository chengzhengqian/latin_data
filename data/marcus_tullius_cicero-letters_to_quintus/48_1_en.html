who was not a crony of his own and so could do it without
arousing suspicion. No sooner had they been led off than
Racilius (the only Tribune worth the name at present) gave
the show away, announcing by prearrangement with Milo
that these men had been bought for himself and putting
out an advertisement that he was going to sell ‘Cato’s
troupe’ by auction. There was great amusement over that
advertisement.</p>
<p>Well, Lentulus has kept this fellow Cato away from
legislation, as also some others who have given notice of
bills about Caesar—monstrous things, and nobody to veto
them. As for Caninius’ campaign regarding Pompey, it has
fallen quite flat. The proposal finds little favour in itself,

the custodians of the Sibylline prophecies produced an oracle forbidding
the employment of a host. This was no doubt also a move
against Pompey, who came more and more to be suspected of wanting to handle the restoration himself. The business dragged
