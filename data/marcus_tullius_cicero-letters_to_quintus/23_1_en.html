dividual who beyond a shadow of doubt murdered his
mother. As to that, and to the whole topic, let me tell you
one or two things, in case you are surprised that I have become
so anxious to curry favour with Greeks. I found that
the complaints of these people carried more weight than I
liked because of their natural talent for deception;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_51_3" id="target_note_LCL462_51_3"><sup>3</sup></a> and so
I tried in whatever way I could to appease whichever of
them I heard complaining about you. First I smoothed
down the group from Dionysopolis, who were extremely
hostile, and made a friend of their leader, Hermippus,
by talking to him and even associating with him on familiar
terms. I have showered courtesies on Hephaestius of
Apamea, on that little fribble Megaristus of Antandros, on
Nicias of Smyrna, on the most arrant good-for-nothings,
including Nympho of Colophon. All this I did not do because
I have any taste for these specimens or for their
whole tribe. On the contrary I am sick and tired of their
fribbling, fawning ways and their minds always fixed on
present advantage, never on the right thing to do.</p>
<p>But to return to Zeuxis: He was talking about his conversation
with M. Cascellius, just the same points as in
your letter. So I set myself to stop his gossip and took him
into my familiar circle. I don’t quite understand this ambition
of yours: you write that having sewn up two Mysians in
a sack<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_51_4" id="target_note_LCL462_51_4"><sup>4</sup></a> at Smyrna you wanted to show a similar example
of your severity in the interior of the province, and for
that reason to entice Zeuxis by any means available. Once
brought to trial it would not perhaps have been right to let
him go, but it was hardly necessary to have him searched
for and wheedled into court with soft words, as you put it;
