dispensation of justice, to be diligent in looking into people’s
problems and ready to listen to them and see them—all
that is admirable rather than difficult. It is not a matter
of work but of a certain set of mind and purpose. How
much bitterness the tax farmer question creates in the
provinces has been illustrated for us by the attitude of
some of our countrymen over the abolition of Italian customs.
It was not the duty they complained of so much as
certain maltreatments at the hands of customs officers.
Having heard the complaints of Roman citizens in Italy I
do not need to be told what happens to provincials at the
ends of the earth. So to manage that you satisfy the tax

to Rome instead of to Rhodes. And so I say that people who
