<p>Let all else be kept for talk in person, as you say, but one

applauded. To me it is agreeable in itself, and the more so
because it was done in my absence—an unbiased judgement,
without any aggressive action or influence on my
part. I did not attend because it had been reported that the
Campanian Land would be debated on the Ides and the
day following, as indeed it was. On this question I am up

and hurry you home. Our boys make the same plea of you.</p>
<p>Oh, and of course you will come to dinner when you
arrive.</p>
