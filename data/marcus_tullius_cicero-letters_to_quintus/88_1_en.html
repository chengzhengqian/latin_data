<p>You ask what has become of the work<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_181_1" id="target_note_LCL462_181_1"><sup>1</sup></a> which I started to
write when I was at Cumae.Well, I have not been and am
not idle, but several times already I have changed the
whole plan and framework. I had two Books in which I presented
a conversation held during the nine-day holiday in
the Consulship of Tuditanus and Aquillius,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_181_2" id="target_note_LCL462_181_2"><sup>2</sup></a> the speakers
being Africanus (shortly before his death), Laelius, Philus,
Manilius, P. Rutilius, Q. Tubero, and Laelius’ sons-in-law,
Fannius and Scaevola. The conversation, distributed over
nine days and nine Books, concerned the ideal constitution
and the ideal citizen. The composition of the work was going
forward very nicely and the high rank of the participants
lent weight to their words. But when these two
Books were read to me at Tusculum in Sallustius’ hearing,
he pointed out that these matters could be treated with
much more authority if I spoke of the commonwealth in
my own person. After all, he said, I was no Heraclides of
Pontus but a Consular, one who had been involved in most
important state affairs. Speeches attributed to persons so
remote in time would appear fictitious. In my earlier work
on the theory of oratory, he said, I had tactfully separated
the conversation of the orators from myself, but I had put
it into the mouths of men whom I had personally seen.
Finally, Aristotle’s writings on the state and the preeminent
individual are in his own person.</p>
<p>This shook me, all the more so as I was debarred from
touching upon the greatest upheavals in our community
because they took place after the lifetimes of the interlocutors.
