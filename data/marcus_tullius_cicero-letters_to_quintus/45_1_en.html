<p>On 11 February I defended Bestia on a bribery charge
before Praetor Cn. Domitius in mid Forum: There was a
large crowd in court. In the course of my speech I came to
the occasion on which Bestia saved Sestius’ life when he
was lying covered with wounds in the temple of Castor. I
took the favourable opportunity to lay down a foundation
for my defence of Sestius against the charges which are being
got up against him and pronounced a well-deserved
eulogy, which was received with great approval by all.
Sestius was highly pleased. I tell you all this because you
have often referred in your letters to the desirability of
preserving good relations with him.</p>
<p>I am writing this before dawn on 12 February. This evening
I shall be dining with Pomponius at his wedding.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_95_5" id="target_note_LCL462_95_5"><sup>5</sup></a>
In the rest of my affairs it is as you foretold when I was
far from hopeful—my prestige and influence flourishes.
This restitution, in which we both share, is due, my dear
brother, to your patience, courage, devotion, and, let me
add, your personal charm.</p>
<p>A house (the Liciniana<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_95_6" id="target_note_LCL462_95_6"><sup>6</sup></a>) at Piso’s Pond has been rented
for you, but I hope you will be moving into your own in a
few months’ time, after the Kalends of July. The Lamiae
have taken your house in Carinae—nice, clean tenants.</p>
<p>Since your letter from Olbia I have heard nothing, from
you. I am anxious to know how you are and how you amuse
yourself, and above all to see you as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Take care of your health, my dear brother, and don’t
forget that it’s Sardinia where you are, winter time though
it be.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_95_7" id="target_note_LCL462_95_7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
