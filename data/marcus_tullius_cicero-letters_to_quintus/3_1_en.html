very wise men; they could not overcome Fortuneâ€™s onset
any more than the best of seamen can master a violent
storm. <span class="italic">Your</span> portion is perfect peace and calm; and yet if
the helmsman falls asleep he could go to the bottom in
such weather, while if he keeps wide awake he may actually
enjoy it.</p>
<p>Your province consists of a native population the most
highly civilized in the world and of Romans who are either
tax farmers, and thus very closely connected with us, or
wealthy businessmen who think they owe the safety of
their money to my Consulship. Ah, but they get into serious
disputes among themselves, often do each other harm
leading to mighty contentions. Well, I am not under the
impression that you have no responsibilities at all! I do realize
that you have a very great responsibility, calling for
the highest qualities of judgement. But remember that in
my opinion it is a good deal more a matter of judgement
than of luck. After all, it is not too difficult to control the
people under you if you control yourself. Self-control may
be a great and difficult achievement for others, is so indeed,
most difficult; but for you it has always been quite
easy, and why not? You have a nature which would surely
have tended to gentleness even without instruction; and
instruction such as yours might lend some grace even to
the most faulty of natures. In the future, as now, you will
resist the temptations of money, pleasure, and every sort of
appetite. Small fear then of your finding yourself unable to
restrain a crooked businessman or an over-acquisitive tax
farmer! As for the Greeks, when they look at you leading
the life you do, they will think you are a character from history
or a divine being come down from heaven into the
province.</p>
