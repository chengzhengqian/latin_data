<p>I thought you would like Canto II,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_115_1" id="target_note_LCL462_115_1"><sup>1</sup></a> but I’m very glad
you liked it so very much as you say in your letter. You remind
me of Indifference<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_115_2" id="target_note_LCL462_115_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and advise me to remember Jupiter’s

thought I could gain my point without a fight. I put the
whole business in his hands and said I would do just as he
thought fit. Young P. Crassus, who is devoted to me as you
know, was present during our talk. As for what Clodius
wants, it’s a Free Commissionership (if not through the
Senate, then through the Assembly) either to Byzantium
or to Brogitarus or both.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_115_5" id="target_note_LCL462_115_5"><sup>5</sup></a> There’s plenty of money in it, but
