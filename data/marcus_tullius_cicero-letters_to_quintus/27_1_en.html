Flavius’ agents about touching the estate, and not to give
any further directions to Apollonis against Flavius’ interests.
I am sure you will do all you can both for Flavius’ sake
and, no doubt, for Pompey’s. Upon my word, I don’t wish
to appear as obliging Flavius in consequence of your unfairness.
On the contrary, I beg you yourself to leave behind
you an official declaration in writing in the form of a
ruling or a letter which will help Flavius’ interests and
case. Being most attentive to me and careful of his own
rights and dignity, he is greatly put out to find that neither
friendship nor justice have counted with you in his favour.
I believe that both Pompey and Caesar at one time or other
recommended Flavius’ interests to you; Flavius himself
had written to you, and certainly I did so. So if there is anything
you would think proper to do at my request, let this
be it. If you love me, spare no pains to ensure that Flavius
thanks both you and me as heartily as may be. I could not
ask anything of you more urgently.</p>
<p>What you write about Hermia has really vexed me a lot.
I had written you a not very brotherly letter—I was annoyed
by what Lucullus’ freedman Diodotus said, and
wrote in some irritation immediately after hearing about
the agreement.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_59_9" id="target_note_LCL462_59_9"><sup>9</sup></a> I wanted to recall it. This unbrotherly letter
you must like a good brother forgive.</p>
<p>As for Censorinus, Antonius, the Cassii, and Scaevola, I
am very pleased to hear that they are so friendly to you.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_59_10" id="target_note_LCL462_59_10"><sup>10</sup></a>
The remainder of your letter took a graver tone than I
could have wished: ‘I’ll go down with my flag flying,’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_59_11" id="target_note_LCL462_59_11"><sup>11</sup></a>
