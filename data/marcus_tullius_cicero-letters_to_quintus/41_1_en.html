a madman<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_87_6" id="target_note_LCL462_87_6"><sup>6</sup></a> as Aedile. For it looks as though elections will
be held without delay—they have been announced for 20
January. However, I don’t want you to be anxious. I shall
take all manner of precautions.</p>
<p>As for his Alexandrian majesty,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_87_7" id="target_note_LCL462_87_7"><sup>7</sup></a> the Senate has passed a
decree pronouncing it dangerous to the commonwealth
for him to be restored ‘with a host.’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_87_8" id="target_note_LCL462_87_8"><sup>8</sup></a> That left a tussle in the
Senate as to whether Lentulus or Pompey should restore
him, and Lentulus appeared to be winning his point. In
that affair I performed my duty to Lentulus to a marvel,
at the same time meeting Pompey’s wishes<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_87_9" id="target_note_LCL462_87_9"><sup>9</sup></a> in fine style,
but the matter was dragged out by the maneuvring of
Lentulus’ ill-wishers. Then followed the comitial days during
which the House could not meet. What will come of
the Tribunes’ freebooting I can’t prophesy, but I suspect
that Caninius will carry his bill by violence. I can’t fathom
Pompey’s wishes in the matter; but everyone sees what his
friends want, and the king’s creditors are openly putting up
money against Lentulus. He certainly seems to have lost
the assignment, which I am very sorry for, though he has
given me many good reasons to feel annoyed with him<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_87_10" id="target_note_LCL462_87_10"><sup>10</sup></a> if
that were not against my conscience.</p>
<p>When you have sorted matters out over there, I hope
you will board ship at the first spell of fair, settled weather
and join me. There are numberless things in which I miss
you, every day and in every way. Your folk and mine are
well.</p>
<p>17 January.</p>
