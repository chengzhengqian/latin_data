my record, I shall feel I have achieved nothing by those
toils and hazards of mine, in all of which you took your
part. More than any other you have helped me to gain so
great a name; assuredly you will work harder than any
other to let me keep it. You should not think only of the esteem
and judgement of contemporaries but of posterity
too; its judgement, to be sure, will be fairer, freed of detraction
and malice. Finally, you ought to reflect that you
are not seeking glory only for yourself, though even if you
were you would not think lightly of it, especially as you
have desired to immortalize your name by your splendid
works.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_45_16" id="target_note_LCL462_45_16"><sup>16</sup></a> But you must share that glory with me and hand it
on to our children. If you make too light of it, you will run
the risk of seeming to begrudge it to your family as well as
of caring too little for yourself.</p>
<p>Now I do not wish it to appear as though my words were
meant to wake a sleeper; rather, to spur a runner. As in the
past, so to the end you will make all men praise your justice,
temperance, strictness, and integrity. But my deep
affection inspires me with an almost infinite appetite for
your glory. However, after all, you should now know Asia as
well as a man knows his own house; you now have a mass of
experience to back your excellent judgement. I suppose
then that there is nothing tending to credit which you do
not best perceive and which does not enter your mind
every day without anybody’s prompting. But when I read
your letters I seem to hear you talk, and when I write to you
it is as though I were talking to you. That is why the longer
your letters the better I like them, and why I myself often
write rather lengthily.</p>
