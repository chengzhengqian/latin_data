sums you had mentioned. As for me, what I have is enough
for my present purposes. Whether I am restored or given
up for lost, no more is needed.</p>
<p>If you have any trouble, I advise you to go to Crassus
and Calidius. How much faith you should put in Hortensius
I don’t know. He behaved to <span class="italic">me</span> most villainously
and treacherously, while pretending the warmest affection
and sedulously keeping up our daily intercourse. Q. Arrius
joined him in this. Through their policies and promises
and advice I was left in the lurch and fell into my present
plight. But you will keep all this under cover, lest it tell
against you. Be careful of one thing (and for that reason I
think you should conciliate Hortensius himself through
Pomponius): that epigram about the lex Aurelia which
was attributed to you when you were standing for the
Aedileship,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_73_10" id="target_note_LCL462_73_10"><sup>10</sup></a> mind it doesn’t get established by false evidence.
<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_73_11a" id="target_note_LCL462_73_11a"><sup>11</sup></a> My principal fear is that when people realize how
much pity your entreaties and your escape from a prosecution
is going to arouse for us, they will attack you the more
vigorously. I think Messalla<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_73_12" id="target_note_LCL462_73_12"><sup>12</sup></a> is on your side. Pompey, I
think, is still pretending. If only you don’t have to put all
this to the test! I should pray to the gods for that if they had
not given up listening to my prayers. None the less, I do
pray that they may be content with these boundless afflictions
of ours, which, however, are free from any stigma of
wrongdoing. The whole tragedy is that fine actions have
been cruelly penalized.</p>

Cicero seems to have been afraid that Hortensius might con- firm Quintus’ authorship out of spite. As an opponent of the law he
would be a credible witness.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL462_73_11a').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL462_73_12"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL462_73_12" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">12</sup>The Consul of 61, as generally supposed.
