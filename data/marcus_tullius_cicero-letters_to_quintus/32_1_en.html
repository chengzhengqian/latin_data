going on. Likewise your son, your image, whom my boy
loved like a brother and had begun to respect like an elder
brother. As for my loyalest of wives, poor, unhappy soul, I
did not let her come with me so that there should be someone
to protect the remnants of our common disaster, the
children we have in common.</p>
<p>However, I did write to you as best I could and gave the
letter to your freedman Philogonus. I expect it was delivered
to you later. In it I urge and ask of you, as in the verbal
message brought you by my boys, to go straight on to Rome
and make haste. To begin with, I wanted you to stand
guard in case there may be enemies whose cruelty is not
yet satisfied by our downfall. Secondly, I was afraid of the
outburst of grief which our meeting would have brought
on. As for parting, I could not have borne it, and I feared
the very thing you say in your letter, that you might not endure
to be separated from me. For these reasons the heavy
affliction of not seeing you, which seems the bitterest, saddest
thing that could happen to brothers so affectionate
and close as we are, was less bitter and sad than our meeting
would have been, and still more our parting.</p>
<p>Now if you can do what I, whom you always thought a
strong man, am unable to do, then stand up and brace
yourself for the struggle you may have to sustain. I should
hope (if any hope of mine counts for anything) that your
integrity, the affection in which you are held in the community,
and in some degree also the pity felt for myself will
bring you protection. If, however, it turns out that you are
clear of that danger, you will doubtless do what you think
can be done, if anything, about me. I get many letters from
many people on the subject and they make themselves out
to be hopeful. But for my own part I canâ€™t see any grounds
