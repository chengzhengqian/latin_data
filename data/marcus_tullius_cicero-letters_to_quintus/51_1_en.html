myself carried to Pompey’s,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_107_4" id="target_note_LCL462_107_4"><sup>4</sup></a> not having been able to meet
him during the day because he had been away—I wanted
to see him because I was leaving Rome next day and he had
a trip to Sardinia in view. So I met him and asked him to
send you back to us as soon as possible. ‘Straight away,’ said
he. He would be leaving, he said, on 11 April and taking
ship from Salebro<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_107_5" id="target_note_LCL462_107_5"><sup>5</sup></a> or Pisae. Now as soon as he arrives, my
dear fellow, be sure to take the next boat, provided the
weather is suitable.</p>
<p>On 9 April I dictated this letter before daylight and am
writing the rest on the road, expecting to stay the night
with T. Titius near Anagnia. Tomorrow I intend to stay at
Laterium, and then, after five days in the Arpinum area, go
on to Pompeii. I shall have a look at my Cumae place on the
way back, and so to Rome (since Milo’s trial has been
scheduled for the Nones of May) on the 6th, then, as I
hope, to see you, my dearest and sweetest of brothers. I
thought it best to hold up the building at Arcanum pending
your arrival.</p>
<p>Be sure to keep well, my dear fellow, and come as soon
as you can.</p>
