without anxiety about next year, though I have
no fear. And furthermore, truly without false modesty, I
recognize you as my superior in that line of authorship.</p>
<p>As regards filling the gaps in your Greek library and exchanging
books and acquiring Latin ones, I should very
much like all this done, especially as I too stand to benefit.
But I have nobody I can employ on such business, not even
for myself. Books, at least such as one would like to have,
are not on the market and they can’t be obtained except
through an expert who is willing to take trouble. However,
I’ll give an order to Chrysippus and talk to Tyrannio. I shall
enquire what Scipio has done about the Treasury,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_179_3" id="target_note_LCL462_179_3"><sup>3</sup></a> and
shall pay what appears proper. As to Ascanio, you will do
what you wish—I don’t interfere. You are wise to be in no
hurry about a suburban property, though I do encourage
you to get one.</p>
<p>I am writing this on 24 October, the opening day of the
Games, as I leave for Tusculum. I am taking my son with
me, to work, not to play. The reason I go no further away, as
I should have liked to do, is that I want to put in an appearance
for Pomptinus, whose Triumph is on 2 November.</p>
<p>And there will be some little trouble, for Praetors Cato and
Servilius are threatening to forbid it. I don’t know what
they can do (he will have Consul Appius with him and most
of the Praetors and Tribunes), but threaten they do, especially
Q. Scaevola, ‘breathing war.’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_179_4" id="target_note_LCL462_179_4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>Take care of your health, my sweetest and dearest of
brothers.</p>
