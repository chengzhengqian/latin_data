‘Who’s starving the people to death?’ ‘Pompey,’ answered
the gang. ‘Who wants to go to Alexandria?’ Answer: ‘Pompey.’
‘Whom do you want to go?’ Answer: ‘Crassus’ (who
was present as a supporter of Milo, wishing him no good).
About 2:15 the Clodians started spitting at us, as though
on a signal. Sharp rise in temperature! They made a push
to dislodge us, our side countercharged. Flight of gang.
Clodius was hurled from the Rostra, at which point I too
made off for fear of what might happen in the free-for-all.
The Senate was convened in its House, and Pompey went
home. I did not attend, however, not wishing to keep mum
about so remarkable an incident nor yet to offend honest
men by standing up for Pompey, who was under fire from
Bibulus, Curio, Favonius, and Servilius junior. The debate
was adjourned to the following day. Clodius had the trial
postponed to Quirinus’ Day.</p>
<p>On 8 February the Senate met in the temple of Apollo<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_91_1" id="target_note_LCL462_91_1"><sup>1</sup></a>
in order that Pompey could be present. Pompey spoke
strongly—nothing concluded that day. 9 February, Senate
in temple of Apollo. A decree was passed pronouncing
the doings of 7 February contrary to public interest. That
day C. Cato delivered a broadside against Pompey—a set
speech like a prosecuting counsel’s with Pompey in the
dock. He said many highly laudatory things about me,
which I could have done without, denouncing Pompey’s
treachery towards me. He was heard in rapt silence. Pompey
replied warmly, making oblique allusion to Crassus
and saying plainly that he intended to take better care of
his life than Africanus had done, whom C. Carbo
murdered.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_91_2" id="target_note_LCL462_91_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
