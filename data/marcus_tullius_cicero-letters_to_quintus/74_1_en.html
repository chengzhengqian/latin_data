in the suburbs. But you don’t have to mix up my friend
Trebatius in that category. I sent him to Caesar, who has already
done all I expected of him. If he has not done all that
Trebatius expected, I am not obliged to answer for anything
and I likewise absolve and acquit you of all responsibility
for him. I am tremendously pleased that you say
you are rising in Caesar’s good graces every day. Balbus,
who you say is your helper in this, is the apple of my eye. I
am glad that you and my friend Trebonius are such good
friends.</p>
<p>As for what you write about the Tribunate, I did request
one for Curtius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_153_7" id="target_note_LCL462_153_7"><sup>7</sup></a> and Caesar himself wrote back to me personally
that one was waiting for Curtius, mentioning his
name; and he took me to task for my backwardness in making
such requests. If I make one for anybody else (and I
have told Oppius to write to Caesar accordingly), I shall
not mind a refusal, seeing that the people who pester me
<span class="italic">do</span> mind <span class="italic">my</span> refusing them. I have a regard for Curtius, as I
told him, not only because you ask me but because of your
testimonial, for your letter made it clear to me how zealous
he was for my restoration.</p>
<p>As to British matters, I see from your letter that we have
no cause for alarm nor for rejoicing either. On public
affairs, which you want Tiro to write up for you, I have
hitherto written rather perfunctorily because I know that
everything, from greatest to least, is reported to Caesar.</p>
<p>I have answered the big letter, now for the little one:
First you tell me about Clodius’ letter to Caesar. I think
Caesar was right to say no to the request you so affectionately
made of him and not to write a single word to that
