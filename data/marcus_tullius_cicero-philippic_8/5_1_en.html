In this quite different conception of war by the two<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">9</span><span class="br"></span>
sides, the most deplorable aspect is the promises he is
making to his cutthroats: first our town houses—for he assures
them that he will divide up the city—then that he will
lead them out of all the city gates and settle them wherever
they wish. Cafo, Saxa, and their kind, all the evil creatures
in Antonius’ train, are earmarking the best houses,
suburban estates, and properties at Tusculum and Alba.
And these uncouth fellows, if they are human beings and
not rather cattle, even let their idle hopes carry them as far
as the Waters<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL507_43_9" id="target_note_LCL507_43_9"><sup>9</sup></a> and Puteoli. Well, Antonius has something
to promise his followers. What about us? Do we have anything
of the sort? May the gods forbid it! Our purpose is
precisely to make sure that nobody can promise anything
of this kind in the future. I say it with reluctance, but say it
I must: Caesar’s lance,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL507_43_10" id="target_note_LCL507_43_10"><sup>10</sup></a> Members of the Senate, brings
both hope and daring to many a criminal. For they saw
beggars suddenly become rich; and so those who menace
our property, to whom Antonius is promising everything,
are always eager to see such a lance. What about us? What<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">10</span><span class="br"></span>
do we promise our armies? Far better and greater things.
The promise of crimes spells ruin both for those who
expect and for those who promise. We promise our soldiers
freedom, laws, justice, law courts, dominion over the
world, dignity, peace, and tranquillity. Antonius’ promises
are bloody, sinister, criminal, hateful to gods and men; they
will not last nor bring any good. Ours by contrast are honorable,
fair, glorious, full of joy, and full of patriotism.</p>

could not do it as well as himself. Have I defended peace
