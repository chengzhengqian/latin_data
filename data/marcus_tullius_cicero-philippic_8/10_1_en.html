<p>[7] I come now to the other consulars, among whom<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">20</span><span class="br"></span>
there is no one—I am entitled to say this—who does not
have some personal tie with me, very close in some cases,
not so close in others, but in every case something. What a
day of dishonor yesterday dawned for us, I mean, for us
consulars! Envoys once again? As if that man were entering
into a truce? But he pounded Mutina with his artillery
before the envoys’ very eyes; he showed the envoys his
works and fortifications; there was not a moment’s respite
in the assault while the envoys were present. Envoys to
him? Why? To make you even more frightened than ever
upon their return? Although previously I had opposed authorizing<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">21</span><span class="br"></span>
envoys, nevertheless I had this consolation, that
when they returned despised and rejected by Antonius,
when they reported to the senate that not merely had
Antonius failed to evacuate Gaul, as we had decreed, but
he had not even withdrawn from Mutina, and that they had
not been permitted to meet Decimus Brutus—after such
reports, all of us would be aflame with hatred, spurred by
indignation, and would go with weapons, cavalry, and infantry
to Decimus Brutus’ assistance. But we have become
even more languid, now that we have seen not only the insolent
wickedness of Marcus Antonius but also his arrogant
audacity. If only Lucius Caesar were well and Servius<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">22</span><span class="br"></span>
