Nasica, who killed Tiberius Gracchus, holding the view
that Nasica’s courage, judgment, and greatness of spirit
had brought freedom to the Republic. Well? Surely we<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">14</span><span class="br"></span>
have not heard any differently from our fathers? So, if you
had been alive in those days, you would not have approved
of Nasica as a citizen because, in your view, he had not
wanted everyone to survive. “Whereas the consul Lucius
Opimius spoke concerning the Republic, the senate decreed
on this matter that the consul Lucius Opimius
should defend the Republic.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL507_47_12" id="target_note_LCL507_47_12"><sup>12</sup></a> So did the senate intervene
with words, Opimius with weapons. Would you have
deemed him a rash or cruel citizen, if you had lived then,
and held the same view of Quintus Metellus, who had four
consular sons, or Publius Lentulus, leader of the senate,
or a number of other eminent men who chased Gaius
Gracchus to the Aventine with weapons in their hands
along with the consul Opimius? In that battle Lentulus was
seriously wounded, Gracchus was killed, as was the consular
Marcus Fulvius and his two young sons. So, those
men ought to be censured, for they did not want all citizens
to survive.</p>

<p>[5] Let us come to events closer to our own time. The<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">15</span><span class="br"></span>
senate committed the defense of the Republic to the consuls
Gaius Marius and Lucius Valerius; the tribune of the
plebs Lucius Saturninus and the praetor Gaius Glaucia
were killed. That day all the Scauri, Metelli, Claudii,
Catuli, Scaevolae, and Crassi took up arms. Surely you do
not think that either those consuls or those illustrious men
ought to be censured? I wanted Catilina destroyed. Surely
you, who want everyone to survive, did not want Catilina to
survive? The difference between my professed view and
yours, Calenus, is this: I want no citizen to act in such a way
