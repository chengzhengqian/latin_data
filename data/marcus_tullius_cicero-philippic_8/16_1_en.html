cloaks, I have decided not to dress differently from
you and the rest of the community in so dire a situation and
with the Republic in such a state of turmoil. For in this war
we consulars are not conducting ourselves in such a way
that the Roman people are likely to view the outward signs
of our rank with complacency since some of us are so fainthearted
that they have cast away all recollection of the Roman
people’s favors, while others are so averse to the Republic
that they openly admit to supporting the enemy, are
quite happy to see our envoys despised and ridiculed by
Antonius, want to ease matters for Antonius’ envoy.</p>
<p>They said he should not be prevented from rejoining
Antonius and wished to correct my proposal by making an
exception of him. I shall humor them. Let Varius go back
to his imperator, but on condition that he never return to
Rome. As for the rest, if they put their error aside and are
reconciled with the Republic, my view is that they should
be granted pardon and immunity.</p>
<p>Therefore I propose as follows: “That of the persons<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">33</span><span class="br"></span>
now with Marcus Antonius, those who leave his army and
go over to either the consul Gaius Pansa, or the consul
Aulus Hirtius, or the imperator and consul-elect Decimus
Brutus, or to the propraetor Gaius Caesar, before this fifteenth
of March,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL507_65_37" id="target_note_LCL507_65_37"><sup>37</sup></a> shall suffer no penalty because they
were with Marcus Antonius. Further that if anyone of
those now with Marcus Antonius performs some action
deemed worthy of honor or reward, that the consuls Gaius
Pansa and Aulus Hirtius, either or both, if they see fit, shall
consult the senate concerning an honor or reward for that
