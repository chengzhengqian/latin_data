pleaded by three than it is now being pleaded by one. I
shall say this in sorrow rather than with any wish to cause
offense: we are deserted, I repeat, deserted, Members of
the Senate, by the leading men. But—I have often said it
already—in so dangerous a situation all right-minded and
courageous persons will be consulars. The envoys ought
to have brought us courage, but instead, they brought
alarm—though none to me for sure—, however much they
entertain a favorable opinion of the person to whom they
were sent, from whom they even accepted instructions.</p>

<p>[8] By the immortal gods! Where is that customary
courage of our ancestors? In the days of our ancestors,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">23</span><span class="br"></span>
when Gaius Popilius was sent as envoy to king Antiochus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL507_55_19" id="target_note_LCL507_55_19"><sup>19</sup></a>
and conveyed verbatim the senate’s demand that the king
retire from Alexandria, which he was besieging, when the
king kept introducing delays, Popilius used a stick to draw
a line around him where he stood, and said he would convey
a negative report back to the senate unless the king
gave him an answer as to his intentions before he left that
circle. Admirable! He had brought with him the appearance
and authority of the senate, and if a man does not
obey it, no directives should be accepted from him, but he
himself should be repudiated. Or was I to accept directives<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">24</span><span class="br"></span>
from one who was defying the senate’s instructions? Was I
to think that a man who was besieging an imperator of the
Roman people against the senate’s orders had anything in
common with the senate? And what directives! What arrogance,
what obtuseness, what haughtiness they show! And
why was he giving them to our envoys when he was sending
us Cotyla, an ornament and strong refuge of his friends, an
ex-aedile—if indeed he <span class="italic">was</span> an aedile on that occasion
when public slaves beat him with leather straps at a dinner
party on Antonius’ orders?</p>
