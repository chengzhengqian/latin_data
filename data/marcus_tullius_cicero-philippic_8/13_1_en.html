Antonius wants to protect those who are with him, as to any
breach of law they have committed. He is looking out for
Mustela and Tiro; he has no concern on his own account.
After all, what law did he ever break? Did he lay hands on<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">27</span><span class="br"></span>
public funds or kill somebody or have armed men about
him? But why should he be concerned about these things,
since he demands that his judiciary law not be repealed? If
he gets that, what has he to fear? That one of his associates
be found guilty by Cydas, Lysiades, and Curius?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL507_59_27" id="target_note_LCL507_59_27"><sup>27</sup></a> However,

his brother Gaius—for it is Gaius’ year—has already been

by Cicero as an alternative to the one mentioned first, at the beginning
of §25, since the two are mutually exclusive and come

that Antony offered to limit himself to just one province, and (2) in that Antony would free himself from the exertions of besieging D.
Brutus in Mutina (in Hither Gaul). Elsewhere (5.37; 7.3; cf. 12.13;
13.37), however, Cicero had commented on the danger of Outer
(<span class="italic">comate</span>) Gaul serving as a base for waging war against the Roman
people, and the emphasis on Antony’s request for an army here
recalls this warning.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL507_59_29a').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL507_59_30"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL507_59_30" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">30</sup>According to Cicero, Antony accepts that M.
