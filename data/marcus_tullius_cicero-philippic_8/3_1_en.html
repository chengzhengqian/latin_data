soldiers without compulsion or fines but from spontaneous
zeal? What authority to promise financial resources in aid
of the Republic? If the name of war is removed, the zeal of
the municipalities will be removed as well; the united impulse
of the Roman people, who have already come down
on our side, must inevitably be weakened if we falter. But<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span>
why waste words? Decimus Brutus is under attack: but it is
not a war! Mutina is under siege: but not even that is a war!
Gaul is being laid waste: can any peace be more assured?
Who can indeed call that action a war to which we have dispatched
a consul, a very brave man, at the head of an army?
Ill as he was from a serious and longstanding ailment,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL507_39_4" id="target_note_LCL507_39_4"><sup>4</sup></a> he
thought there should be no excuse for him when summoned
to defend the Republic. Gaius Caesar did not wait
for your decrees, even though he was so young: he went to
war with Antonius of his own accord. The time for decrees
had not yet arrived; but he saw that if he let the time for
military action pass, the Republic would be crushed and
nothing could be decreed. Well, those commanders and<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">6</span><span class="br"></span>
their armies are now at peace. It is no enemy whose garrison
was thrown out of Claterna by Hirtius; it is no enemy
who is in armed opposition to a consul, attacking a consulelect.
Those were not hostile or warlike words that Pansa
has just read out from his colleague’s dispatch: “I threw out
the garrison; I took possession of Claterna; the cavalry was
put to flight; battle was joined; some were killed.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL507_39_5" id="target_note_LCL507_39_5"><sup>5</sup></a> What
peace can be greater? Levies have been decreed throughout
the whole of Italy with the cancellation of exemptions
from military service; military cloaks will be donned tomorrow;
the consul has stated that he will appear in public
with an armed escort.</p>
