that he has to be punished with death; you think a citizen
should be preserved even if he has so acted. If something
in the body is of the sort to cause harm to the rest,
we allow it to be cauterized or cut so that this or that part
may perish rather than the whole body. Likewise in the
body politic: let whatever is noxious be amputated so that
the whole may be saved. A harsh saying! This one is far<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">16</span><span class="br"></span>
harsher: “Let the criminals, the wicked, the traitors be
saved; let the innocent, the respectable, the decent, the
entire Republic be wiped out!” I do admit, Quintus Fufius,
that in the case of one person your perception was better

I can differ from you without using offensive expressions,
though not without mental anguish. For is it a
minor disagreement I have with you; is it about a minor issue,
a matter of my backing this man and your backing that

your backing Marcus Antonius: I am anxious to see a Roman
colony saved, you are eager for it to be taken by storm.</p>
