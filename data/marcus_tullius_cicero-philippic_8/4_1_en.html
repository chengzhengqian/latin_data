<p>Is this not a war, or even a war on a scale such as never<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">7</span><span class="br"></span>
before existed? In other wars, and particularly civil wars,
the conflict originated from a political issue: Sulla fought
Sulpicius about the validity of laws which according to
Sulla had been passed by violence. Cinna fought Octavius
about voting rights for the new citizens.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL507_41_6" id="target_note_LCL507_41_6"><sup>6</sup></a> Sulla again fought
Marius and Carbo to put an end to the rule of the unworthy
and to avenge the terribly cruel deaths of illustrious men.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL507_41_7a" id="target_note_LCL507_41_7a"><sup>7</sup></a>
All these wars had their origins in political disputes. As for
the last civil war,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL507_41_8" id="target_note_LCL507_41_8"><sup>8</sup></a> I would rather not speak of it: I do not
know its cause, and I abominate its outcome.</p>

<section class="div2">
<p>[3] The fifth<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">8</span><span class="br"></span>
civil war is now being fought—and they all occurred in my
lifetime—, and for the first time there is no division or discord
among citizens, but on the contrary the utmost consensus
and extraordinary unity. All men have one desire,
one cause, one sentiment. When I say “all,” I mean all but
those whom nobody thinks worthy to be citizens. What
then is the avowed reason for this war? We are defending
the temples of the immortal gods, the city walls, the
dwellings and houses of the Roman people, the altars, the
hearths, the tombs of our ancestors; we are defending
laws, courts of law, freedom, wives, children, and our native
land. Marcus Antonius, on the contrary, is devising
and fighting to throw into confusion and overturn everything
I have just mentioned, to regard the plunder of the
Republic as a cause for war, to squander one part of our
possessions and to parcel out the other among traitors.
