only once? Have I not always favored tranquillity? Peace is
advantageous for all decent men, but particularly for me.
Where would my activity have found scope without court
cases, without laws, without law courts? These cannot exist
if internal peace is taken away. But I ask you, Calenus,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">12</span><span class="br"></span>
what do <span class="italic">you</span> say: do you call slavery peace? Our ancestors
took up arms not only to be free but also to rule. Do you
think we should throw our arms away in order to be slaves?
Is there any more justifiable reason for waging war than to
ward off slavery? In slavery, even if the master is not oppressive,
the sorry thing still is that he can be if he wishes.
Indeed, other reasons are justifiable, but this one is compelling.
Or do you think perhaps that this does not concern
you because you expect to be a partner in Antoniusâ€™ despotism?
You make two mistakes there: first, because you mix
up your personal interests with the interests of the community;
second, because you think that anything can be
stable or agreeable in a tyranny. Even if it may have worked
to your advantage previously,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL507_45_11" id="target_note_LCL507_45_11"><sup>11</sup></a> it will not always work to
your advantage. After all, you were accustomed to grumble<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">13</span><span class="br"></span>
about that person, a human being; what do you think
you will you do in reaction to a monster?</p>
<p>And you describe yourself as one who has always
wished for peace, always wanted all citizens to survive.
That is an honorable sentiment, but only if you mean decent
citizens, men of use and benefit to the Republic. But
should you want the survival of people who are citizens by
birth but public enemies by choice, where, I ask, would
be the difference between you and them? Your father, at
any rate, a strict and wise man, who was a model for me
when I was young and he was old, was in the habit of
giving the place of honor among all citizens to Publius
