if he had not been hampered by family ties. Very good,
he is the uncle. What about you who supported him: are
you uncles too?</p>
<p>But what was the argument about? Certain persons
thought that the name of war ought not to be used in the
motion: they preferred to use the term “public emergency,”
showing their ignorance not only of facts but also
of terminology. For while a war can exist without a public
emergency, a public emergency cannot exist without a war.
For what else is a public emergency but a disturbance so<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span>
serious that fear beyond the ordinary arises from it? And
it is from this fact that the word “public emergency” has
its origin.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL507_37_2" id="target_note_LCL507_37_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Accordingly, our ancestors spoke of a “public
emergency in Italy” (because it took place within our borders)
and a “public emergency in Gaul” (because it was
next door to Italy), but of no other public emergency besides.
And that a public emergency is something more serious
than a war can be inferred from the fact that exemptions
from military service are valid in a war but are not
valid in a public emergency.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL507_37_3" id="target_note_LCL507_37_3"><sup>3</sup></a> Hence, as I have just observed,
war can exist without a public emergency, but a
public emergency cannot exist without war. After all, since<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span>
there is no halfway house between war and peace, if a public
emergency does not come under the heading of war, it
must come under the heading of peace. And what more
absurd than this can be said or thought? But I have dwelt
too long upon terminology. Let us rather look at substance,
Members of the Senate, which indeed I realize is sometimes
apt to be made worse by terminology.</p>
