As soon as they arrived in the forest, where there were many divergent ways, and night was approaching, the king left the road with a very few of his most trusty men. The cavalry, left without a commander, took various routes in dispersing to their own cities; a very few went on to Pella more rapidly than the king, since they had gone by the direct and clear way. The king was bothered till about midnight by losing his way and by various difficulties of the route. At the palace Perseus was waited upon by the commanders of Pella, Euctus, and Eulaeus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL396_233_1" id="target_note_LCL396_233_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and the royal pages.
