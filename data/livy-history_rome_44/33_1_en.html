army is quickly sent him or his present force is extricated. As to the fleet, we heard after we left the camp that some of the sailors have been lost by disease, and some, especially the Sicilians, have gone home, so that the ships lack crews. Those who are there have not received their pay and are insufficiently clothed. Eumenes and his fleet have come and gone for no good reason, as if his ships were drifting before the wind; and there is no good evidence that the spirit of this king is unwavering.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL396_155_2" id="target_note_LCL396_155_2"><sup>2</sup></a> The envoys reported that Attalus was as gallantly unswerving as Eumenes was entirely undependable.</p>
