inconveniences from this war because of the interruption of commerce; their island was poor, and could not be inhabited without the assistance of sea-borne supplies. Since therefore they could no longer endure this privation, they had sent other envoys to Perseus in Macedonia, to inform him that it was the Rhodians’ wish that he should arrange a peace with the Romans, and that they had sent a similar announcement to Rome. If either party was responsible for preventing the ending of the war, the Rhodians would deliberate as to what action they ought to take against this party.</p>
<p>I feel sure that even now these statements cannot be read or heard without indignation; from this one can judge what the senate’s state of mind was as they listened.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL396_137_1a" id="target_note_LCL396_137_1a"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>XV.

XLII. xlvi. 6. According to Polybius XXVIII. 16, relations between Rome and Rhodes were entirely cordial this year; in 168 <span class="sc">b.c.</span> the consul Marcius suggested to an embassy of the Rhodians that they aet as mediators; the only result was to encourage the pro-Macedonians in Rhodes (cf. below, xxxv. 4, where Livy still saddles the Rhodians with the onus in this matter; also XLV. iii. 3, with which cf. Polybius XXIX. 10). Polybius suspects Marcius of planning to have the Rhodians annoy the Romans and so justify Rome’s overriding their independence; in view of Marcius’ liking for intrigue (XLII. xlvii. 1–4), this is quite probable. In XLV. xxii. 2, Livy suggests that Roman suspicion of Rhodes was something new in 167 <span class="sc">b.c.</span> ; in XLV. xxv. 6, the “freeing” of Lycia and Caria seems to have been ordered in that year. Claudius (see below) or some other annalist seems to have misled Livy by anticipating developments. Cassius Dio XX. fr. 66, 2 = Zonaras 9. 22 says that Perseus would have been granted peace but for the tactlessness of the Rhodians. Livy certainly had no suspicion that the Romans might have continued to tolerate Perseus.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL396_137_1a').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL396_137_2"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL396_137_2" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">2</sup>Previous friction between these peoples and the Rhodians was noted in XLI. vi. 8–12, cf. the note, and XLII. xiv. 8.
