This was founded by King Cassander precisely in the <span class="marginNote right"><span class="sc">b.c.</span> 169</span>narrows which connect the peninsula of Pallene with the rest of Macedonia and are bounded on the one side by the Gulf of Macedonia, and on the other by that of Torone. For the peninsula on which this city is situated rises high and projects into the sea quite as far as Mount Athos, which is noted for its size; it forms, opposite to the district of Magnesia, two unequal promontories, the larger named Posideum and the smaller Canastraeum.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL396_125_1" id="target_note_LCL396_125_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>The siege was begun in separate divisions. The Roman commander constructed works, including <span class="italic">chevaux-de-frise</span>, extending from the Macedonian to the Toronaic gulf, in the quarter called Clitae, in order to cut off the highway. On the other side is a narrow strait<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL396_125_2" id="target_note_LCL396_125_2"><sup>2</sup></a>; there Eumenes was attacking. The Romans found that their greatest task was filling the moat which Perseus had lately built as a defence. When the praetor inquired why there were no mounds to be seen, where the earth dug from the moat would be, he was shown certain arches.3 These, he heard, were built up not to the same strength as the old wall, but only to the thickness of a single brick. He therefore adopted the plan of opening a path into the city by piercing the brickwork. He further expected to effect surprise in this move if he attacked the walls elsewhere with scaling ladders and, by raising confusion, drew off the defenders of the city to the protection of this second spot.</p>
