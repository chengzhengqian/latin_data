all suspected that a Macedonian fleet was at large in that sea; now they thought them to be Romans, now Attalus, or some men sent back by Attalus from the Roman camp and on their way to Pergamum. But when the shape of the approaching scout-ships was unmistakable and the rapid motion of the oars and the pointing of the prows head-on revealed that enemies were approaching, then panic fell upon them. Since there was no hope of resistance, both because of the unwieldly type of vessel and because the Galatians could hardly withstand an undisturbed voyage, some of them, who were nearer to the mainland, swam ashore at Erythrae and some set sail for Chios, ran their ships aground, and abandoning their horses fled in rout to the city. But as the scout-ships
put troops ashore nearer the city at a more convenient landing-place, the Macedonians overtook the Galatians and cut them down, partly as they fled along the road and partly when they were shut out of the city gates.

The exact course of the action described is not clear from the account in Livy’s usual impressionistic manner; but the Macedonian ships seem to have let the transports pass Subota, wherever that was, and then pursued, overtaking them between Phanae, the cape and harbour at the south end of Chios (of. above, XXXVI. xliii. 11 and Strabo XIV. 1. 35) and Chios city. The Chians were allies of Rome.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL396_183_1a').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
