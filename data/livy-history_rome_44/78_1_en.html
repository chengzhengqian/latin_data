<h3><span class="ac">Summary of Book XLIV</span></h3>
<p><span class="sc">Quintets Marcius Philippus</span> entered Macedonia over trackless passes and seized a number of cities. The Rhodians sent envoys to Rome threatening to help Perseus unless the Roman People established peace and friendship with him. This was regarded as an insult. When the campaign in Macedonia was put in charge of Lucius Aemilius Paulus, consul for the second time in the following year, Paulus prayed before an assembly that any disaster which threatened the Roman People might be turned against his own household,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL396_245_1" id="target_note_LCL396_245_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and after setting out for Macedonia, he conquered Perseus and brought all Macedonia under control. Before the battle, he<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL396_245_2" id="target_note_LCL396_245_2"><sup>2</sup></a> announced beforehand to the army, to forestall surprise, that the moon was to be eclipsed on the following night. Gentius also, the king of Illyria, broke the peace with Rome and after being beaten by Lucius Anicius the praetor offered his submission and was sent to Rome with his wife, his children, and his relatives. Envoys from Alexandria came from Queen Cleopatra and King Ptolemy complaining of Antiochus, the king of Syria, because he was attacking them. Although Perseus had urged Eumenes, king of Pergamum, and Gentius, king of Illyria, to help him, he was abandoned by them because he withheld the money which he had promised them.</p>
