upon these posts, planks, each thirty feet long, were <span class="marginNote right"><span class="sc">b.c.</span> 169</span>fastened together to form a runway, and earth thrown on top of them.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL396_105_1a" id="target_note_LCL396_105_1a"><sup>1</sup></a> Next, at a slight interval below, a second runway of the same sort was built, then a third, and others one after the other, where the cliffs were sheer. From firm ground an elephant would advance on to the runway; before he could proceed to its end, the posts were cut and the tilting of the runway forced the animal to slide gently to the head of the next runway. Some of the elephants would slide standing erect, others would squat on their haunches. Whenever they were met with the level expanse of another runway, they were again carried down by a like collapse of the lower structure, until they arrived at the more passable valley.</p>
<p>The Romans advanced on that day hardly more than seven miles. Very little of the journey did they accomplish on their feet. Usually they advanced by casting themselves down, arms, baggage, and all, while meeting with every kind of difficulty, so that even the leader who had chosen the route could not deny that a small force could have destroyed the whole army. By nightfall they reached a scant level area, nor did men who had unexpectedly at long last found a place which offered sure footing, have the leisure to observe the unfriendly nature of the place, hemmed in as it was on all sides. For the next day as well they were compelled to wait in the depths of this valley for Popilius and the troops left behind

We can say that either Livy or a copyist left out of the account of the runway a mention of the stringers which would be necessary; the “thirty-foot planks” somehow have replaced these stringers and the transverse planks which presumably would provide the flooring.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL396_105_1a').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
