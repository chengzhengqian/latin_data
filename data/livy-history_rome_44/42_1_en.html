attempted to secure some sort of down payment. And so having tried vainly to overreach each other, the kings got themselves nothing but a bad reputation.</p>
<p>XXVI. This was not the only failure incurred by Perseus because of miserliness, when by payment of money he could either through Eumenes’ efforts have secured peace, which he should have bought even at the price of part of his kingdom, or had he been deceived, he could have exposed his enemy with the booty on him and aroused just hostility toward him on the part of the Romans. But a previous parallel case was that of the alliance with King Gentius, ready for the taking; and at this same time Perseus lost through miserliness the tremendous assistance of the Gauls who were scattered through the region of Illyria.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL396_173_1a" id="target_note_LCL396_173_1a"><sup>1</sup></a> There were on their way ten thousand cavalry and an equal number of infantry who matched their pace to that of the horses, and in turn seized the riderless horses of fallen cavalrymen for further fighting.

In Polybius XXV. 6 (XXVI. 9), there is a reference to the Bastarnae joining Perseus and the Gauls (Paton’s interpretation),
which has led some scholars to think that Polybius was referring to the Bastarnae as Gauls (Galatai) here.
