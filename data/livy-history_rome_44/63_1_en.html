formation stood its ground at the front of the battle-line,
in case the enemy should make a move; last of all he withdrew the forward formation, taking the soldiers of one maniple at a time, starting with the right wing. In this way, while the cavalry and the light-armed troops faced the enemy from in front of the battle-line, the infantry were withdrawn without confusion, and the cavalry were not called away from their posts until the facade of the rampart and the ditch facing the enemy had been completed. Although the king would have been prepared to fight that day without reluctance, he was satisfied to let it be seen that the delay was due to the enemy, and he too withdrew his forces into camp.</p>
<p>After the fortification of the camp was complete, Gaius Sulpicius Gallus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL396_215_1a" id="target_note_LCL396_215_1a"><sup>1</sup></a> tribune of the soldiers with the second legion, who had been praetor the year before, summoned the soldiers to an assembly, by permission of the consul, and announced that no one should regard it as a bad omen when on the following night an eclipse of the moon would take place from the second to the fourth hour of the night. Since this occurred in the regular order of nature at certain times, said Sulpicius, it could be calculated ahead of time and foretold.

they saw the moon shining now full, now during its wane with a narrow arc, no more ought they to count it a prodigy that the moon is darkened

Modern reckoning sets the date of the eclipse as June 21, which would mean that the calendar was at least 70 days ahead of time, cf. p. 87, Appendix.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL396_215_1a').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
