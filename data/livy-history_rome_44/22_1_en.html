<p>The historians give highly different accounts of King Eumenes. If you trust Valerius Antias,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL396_133_1" id="target_note_LCL396_133_1"><sup>1</sup></a> his account is that although the praetor summoned the king with frequent despatches, he did not even receive naval assistance from him, nor did Eumenes on his way to Asia part on good terms with the consul, being indignant because he was not permitted to encamp in the Roman area; Eumenes, says Valerius, could not even be persuaded to leave behind the Galatian cavalry he had brought with him. His brother Attalus, continues Valerius, not only remained with the consul, but displayed genuine and unwavering good faith and notable exploits in this campaign.</p>

name is given as Balanos, but there is no record of his tribe—came to Rome promising aid for the Macedonian campaign. Thanks were expressed by the senate and gifts sent the envoys, a twisted necklace of two pounds of gold and golden bowls of four pounds, a horse with ornamental trappings, and cavalry weapons.

it paralleled an earlier issue from Philippi, which began as a colony of Thasos three years before its capture by Philip, and which had an Athenian adviser. Philip continued the coinage of this town.
