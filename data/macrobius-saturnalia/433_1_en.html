<span class="line">Zeus entrusts these oracles to Loxias,</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">and elsewhere (<span class="italic">Eum</span>. 19),</p>

the sound of Latin and the person who has not drained the
fullest possible draught of Greek learning are both equally
incapable of understanding Virgil?</p>
<p>15. If I didn’t fear repelling
you with still more, I could fill great volumes with
the things he borrowed from the most arcane sources of
Greek learning. But what I’ve said will be sufficient to convince
you of my original thesis.’</p>
