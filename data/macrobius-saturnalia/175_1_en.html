<p>13. ‘After being entertained by some fellow with a spare
and undistinguished meal (for he almost never turned
down an invitation), he set out for home, without bodyguard
or entourage, and whispered in his host’s ear as he
was saying goodbye, “I didn’t think that I was such a close
friend of yours” (<span class="italic">dicta</span> 57 Malc.).</p>
<p>14. When he was complaining
about the dull color of some Tyrian purple he had
ordered, and the merchant said, “Hold it up higher in the
light and look at it,” he wittily replied, “You mean I need to
stroll about on my balcony so the Roman people can say
I’m well dressed?” (<span class="italic">dicta</span> 58 Malc.)<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_351_59" id="target_note_LCL510_351_59"><sup>59</sup></a></p>

whose forgetfulness gave him cause to complain:
when the man asked, “Is there anything for me to take to
the forum?,” Augustus said, “Here, take some letters of introduction,
since you know no one there” (<span class="italic">dicta</span> 59 Malc.).</p>

substances Augustus associates with them; the point, presumably,
is that pearls from the Tiber (e.g.) would be all the more
precious for their rarity. “Cilnii” and “Porsenna,” like “Etruria”
and “Arretium,” glance at Maecenas’ Etrurian background: the
Cilnii were a great family of Arretium, perhaps related to Maecenas
on his mother’s side (Tac. Ann. 6.11 mistakenly applies the
name Cilnius to Maecenas himself); Lars Porsenna, the king of Clusium, tried to compel the Romans to reinstate Tarquin the
Proud after his expulsion. The connection of potters (the MSS’
<span class="italic">figulorum</span>) with jasper is obscure, and Jahn’s <span class="italic">Iguviorum</span> (“of the
[Umbrian] Iguvii”) has found favor with editors. If <span class="italic">allagma</span> (for
the MSS’ <span class="italic">malagma</span>, “poultice”) is correct at the end of the catalog,
the point is that Maecenas embodies all the precious gifts that a
mistress could hope to be given. Augustus perhaps was glancing at
one of Maecenas’ own poems, addressed to Horace, which mentions
emeralds, beryls, pearls, and jasper (fr. 2 <span class="italic">FPL</span><sup>3</sup>).</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL510_351_58a').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL510_351_59"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL510_351_59" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">59</sup>Contrast Augustus’ preference for home-spun garments reported
