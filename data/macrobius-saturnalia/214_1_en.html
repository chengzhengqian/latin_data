[<span class="italic">anima</span>], by itself, is consecrated to the god—whence
soothsayers, too, call these “spirit victims” [<span class="italic">animals</span>]. Virgil
shows both kinds of victim in the <span class="italic">Aeneid</span>.</p>
<p>2. First, the
case in which the gods’ will is shown by the entrails (<span class="italic">A.</span>
4.57):</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">She slaughters the two-year-old sheep chosen</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">according to custom.</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">and soon thereafter (A. 4.63–64),</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line indent4">. . . with the animals’ chests split open</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">she pores, open-mouthed, over the still-pulsing</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">entrails.</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p>3. He shows the second sort of case—where the animal is
called a “spirit victim” because only its life-spirit is offered
up—when he has Entellus slaughter a bull to Eryx in victory.
To make fully apparent why the victim is so called, he
uses the precise term (<span class="italic">A</span>. 5.483*):</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">This life-spirit [<span class="italic">anima</span>] to you, Eryx, a better one, in</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">place of Dares’ death . . .</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">and to show that this was a formal vow, he says, “I pay out”
[<span class="italic">persolvo</span>], the verb properly used of a vow, and to show
that the payment to the gods was accomplished, he made
the point explicit, saying (<span class="italic">A.</span> 5.481),</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">The bull falls to the ground, laid low and quivering,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">its life-spirit gone [<span class="italic">exanimis</span>].</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p>4. ‘We must consider, too, whether the following passage
also shows us a spirit-victim (<span class="italic">A.</span> 2.116–19†):
