<p>5. ‘At that the people turned as one to look at Caesar
alone, making plain that this caustic remark had scored a
direct hit on his high-handedness, and this caused him to
shift his support to Publilius.</p>
<p>6. ‘Publilius, a Syrian by birth, was brought to his master’s
patron as a boy and won him over by his wit and talent
as much as by his beauty: for when the patron happened to
see a slave of his who suffered from dropsy lying in the
courtyard, he scolded him, asking what he thought he was
doing out there in the sun—and Publilius said, “He’s heating
water.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_373_87" id="target_note_LCL510_373_87"><sup>87</sup></a> And when the question arose over dinner as
to what counted as a disagreeable way of taking one’s ease,
with now one man, now another venturing an opinion,
he said, “Having the gout.”</p>
<p>7. By such displays of wit he
earned his freedom and received a superior education.
When he was composing and performing mimes and his
shows had begun to find great favor in the towns of Italy, he
took the stage at Rome during Caesar’s games<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_373_88" id="target_note_LCL510_373_88"><sup>88</sup></a> and challenged
all those who had hired out their scripts or acting
skills to compete with him in improvised performances,
one on one, taking turns setting the themes. They all took
up the challenge, and they all lost, including Laberius.</p>
<p>8. Thereupon Caesar declared with a laugh:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">Though I’m your fan, Laberius, you were beaten by</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">the Syrian;</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">and at once he awarded the palm of victory to Publilius and
a gold ring<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_373_89" id="target_note_LCL510_373_89"><sup>89</sup></a> with 500,000 sesterces to Laberius. Then
Publilius said to Laberius, as he withdrew,</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">Support as a spectator the man with whom you competed</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">as a writer.</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
