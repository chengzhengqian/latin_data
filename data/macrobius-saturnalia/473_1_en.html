<p>9. Let no one form a low opinion of the ancient
poets because their verses strike us as rough. That’s
the only style that pleased Ennius’ contemporaries, and
succeeding generations labored long to acclimatize themselves
to the more finely spun style we know. But I don’t
want to keep Caecina waiting any longer to present his own
recollections of Maro’s borrowings from antiquity.’</p>
<p>Then Caecina said, ‘Rufius has shown, with the knowledge<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span>
of the full range of ancient and more recent texts,
how much Maro profited from antiquity both in writing
specific lines and in treating whole topics. I will try to show
that this most scholarly bard formed very apt judgments
about individual words the ancient authors used and inserted
in his work some choice elements of diction that our
own disregard for antiquity causes us to think his own devising.

“inflicted” [<span class="italic">addita</span>] in the sense of “inimical” and “hostile”
the poet wanted to craft a new usage? But that’s not
the case: his saying (<span class="italic">A</span>. 6.90*–91),</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">. . . nor will Juno at anywhere cease</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">to be inflicted on the Trojans—</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
