what the mythographers and physical scientists have to say
about the latter: now I’ll present what both groups claim
about Janus.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_93_132" id="target_note_LCL510_93_132"><sup>132</sup></a></p>
<p>2. The mythographers report that under Janus’
rule everyone’s homes were well fortified by an aura of
holiness and religious scruple: for that reason it was decreed
that he be worshipped as a god, and because of his
benefactions the entrances and exits of buildings were
consecrated to him.</p>
<p>3. Xenon<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_93_133" id="target_note_LCL510_93_133"><sup>133</sup></a> too, in the first book of his
<span class="italic">Italica</span>, relates (no. 824 fr. 1 <span class="italic">FGrH</span>) that Janus was the first
to build temples to the gods in Italy and to establish sacred
rites, and for that reason he earned the right always to be
named first when rituals are performed.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_93_134" id="target_note_LCL510_93_134"><sup>134</sup></a></p>
<p>4. Some think
that he is said to have had two faces because he both knew
past events and foresaw the future.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_93_135" id="target_note_LCL510_93_135"><sup>135</sup></a></p>
<p>5. But the physical
scientists marshal substantial proofs of his divinity: for
some say that Janus is the same as Apollo and Diana and assert
that he represents the divine essence of both all by
himself.</p>
<p>6. Indeed, as Nigidius also relates (fr. 73), the
Greeks worship Apollo under the name Thyraios [= ‘of
the doorway’] and tend his altars in front of their doors,
thereby showing that entrances and exits are under his
power. The Greeks also call Apollo Agyieus, as if he oversaw
the city’s streets; for they call the roads inside their
cities’ sacred boundaries <span class="italic">agyiai</span>, whereas they assign the
power over all roadways to Diana as Trivia.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_93_136" id="target_note_LCL510_93_136"><sup>136</sup></a></p>
