In short, we must affirm that the action of the sun that stirs
us, making our minds boil and our blood run hot, is called
Mars.</p>
<p>7. ‘A proof that Mercury is the sun is supported by what
I’ve said so far. The fact that many nations refer to the
planet Mercury with the name of Apollo makes plain that
Apollo is the same as Mercury,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_263_500" id="target_note_LCL510_263_500"><sup>500</sup></a> as does the fact that
Apollo is in charge of the Muses and Mercury gives us
speech, which is the gift of the Muses.</p>
<p>8. There is much evidence
besides that Mercury is judged to be the sun. First,
there’s the fact that images of Mercury are equipped with
feathered wings, representing the speed of the sun.</p>
<p>9. For
since we believe that Mercury is the god of thought and
understand that he takes his name from “interpreting”

order, while nothing is swifter than the mind,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_263_502" id="target_note_LCL510_263_502"><sup>502</sup></a> as
Homer says (<span class="italic">Od</span>. 7.36),
<q>
<span class="line">as if a winged thing or a thought,</span><span class="linebreak"></span></q>
Mercury is equipped with wings, as if with the sun’s very
nature.</p>
<p>10. The Egyptians provide more straightforward
proof in fashioning winged images of the sun in more than
one color, one dark, one bright.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_263_503a" id="target_note_LCL510_263_503a"><sup>503</sup></a> They call the bright one
“of the upper world,” the dark one “of the lower world”:
the latter name is given to the sun when it follows its course
in the lower hemisphere—that is, through the signs of the
zodiac in winter—the former, when it makes its circuit

echo imagery found in the “Litany of Re”: “Homage to thee, Re,
