<p>11. The same tale is
told of Mercury in a different form, when he is conceived
as an attendant carrying messages between the gods below
and the gods above.</p>
<p>12. He is, furthermore, called Argiphontes,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_265_504" id="target_note_LCL510_265_504"><sup>504</sup></a>
not because he killed Argus, who (the story
goes) was equipped with many eyes all around his head
and was therefore ordered by Juno to keep watch over Io,
daughter of Inachus, whom Juno turned into a cow because
she was her rival for Jupiter’s affections;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_265_505" id="target_note_LCL510_265_505"><sup>505</sup></a> but rather
according to a version of the story in which Argus is the sky
above, marked out by the light of stars that look like heavenly
eyes.</p>
<p>13. It was decided that heaven be called Argus
[Gk. <span class="italic">argos</span> = ‘white’] because it is white (<span class="italic">leukon</span>) and swift
(<span class="italic">tachy</span>)<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_265_506" id="target_note_LCL510_265_506"><sup>506</sup></a> and seems to keep watch upon the earth from
above: when the Egyptians wish to represent the earth in
hieroglyphics, they use the figure of a cow.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_265_507" id="target_note_LCL510_265_507"><sup>507</sup></a> That heavenly
circuit, then, with its starlight, is conceived of as slain
by Mercury when the sun in the daytime blots out the stars
and, as it were, slays them, removing them from mortal
sight with its own strong light.</p>
<p>14. ‘Very often, too, images of Mercury are fashioned
with a square base, showing only the god’s head and erect
penis,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_265_508" id="target_note_LCL510_265_508"><sup>508</sup></a> a figure signifying that the sun is the head of the
cosmic order and world’s begetter, and that all his strength
does not somehow serve a set of different limbs but is concentrated
in thought alone, which has its seat in the head.</p>
