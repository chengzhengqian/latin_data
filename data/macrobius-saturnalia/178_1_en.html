<p>25. ‘As censor Augustus displayed a striking and praiseworthy
forbearance.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_357_66" id="target_note_LCL510_357_66"><sup>66</sup></a> He was upbraiding a Roman knight
for having squandered his resources, but the man demonstrated
in his presence that he had actually increased
them. Soon after he reproached the same man for not
obeying the laws prescribing marriage, but the man said he
had a wife and three children,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_357_67" id="target_note_LCL510_357_67"><sup>67</sup></a> and added, “From now on,
Caesar, give honorable men the job of investigating honorable
men.”</p>
<p>26. In the case of a soldier, he tolerated speech
that was not merely free but brazen: when he was passing
some restless nights at a villa where an owl’s hooting was
disturbing his sleep, a soldier who was also a skilled bird-catcher
caught the bird and brought it to Augustus, expecting
a huge reward. The emperor praised him and ordered
that he be given 1,000 sesterces—at which point the soldier
dared to say, “I’d rather see it live,” and let the bird go.
Who could not amazed that Caesar took no offense and let
the defiant soldier off scot-free?</p>
<p>27. When an army veteran
was facing a trial and had his court-date set, he approached
Caesar in public and asked him to support him at his trial.
Caesar immediately chose someone from his entourage to
serve as his advocate and introduced the man to the soldier:
thereupon the veteran cried out in a loud voice, “But
<span class="italic">I</span> did not look for someone to serve in my place when you
were in danger at the battle of Actium [31 <span class="sc">bce</span>]: I fought
for you myself,” and he uncovered his scars. Caesar
blushed and came to support him, for fear of appearing not
just arrogant but also ungrateful.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_357_68" id="target_note_LCL510_357_68"><sup>68</sup></a></p>
