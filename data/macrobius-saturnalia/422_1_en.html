as the name of a town at that mountain’s foot, Virgil is
speaking not about the former but about the latter. Now,
though, let’s investigate why he named Gargara as a productive
place for crops.</p>
<p>10. ‘And indeed, we can take it as settled that all of
Mysia is thought to have excellent harvests, no doubt because
the soil is moist. That’s also why when Virgil used the
phrase “damp solstices” in the lines quoted above he adduced
the statement, “Mysia can make no such boast about
its tillage,” as if to say that every region that has a ready
supply of moisture will match the fertility of Mysia’s fields.</p>
<p>11. But when Homer says that Ida is <span class="italic">polypîdax</span> [“rich in
springs”] (<span class="italic">Il.</span> 8.47 <span class="italic">et al.</span>), he indicates that the land lying
at the mountain’s foot is damp. Accordingly, this city of
Gargara had such abundant crops that someone who
wanted to convey a large number of any sort of objects
would use the named “Gargara” to mean “an immeasurable
number.”</p>
<p>12. Alcaeus gives evidence of this, when he
says in his <span class="italic">Comic-tragedy</span> (fr. 19 <span class="italic">PCG</span> 2:9),</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">I happened to be carrying . . . from the country</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">to the festival . . . twenty,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">when I see from on high a heap [<span class="italic">gargara</span>] of people</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">in a circle.</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">As you see, he plainly used <span class="italic">gargara</span> to denote a large number,
just as Aristomenes does in his <span class="italic">Myths</span> (fr. 1 <span class="italic">PCG</span>
1:415):</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">For we have within a heap [<span class="italic">gargara</span>] of men.</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
