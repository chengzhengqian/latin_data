<span class="line">Arcadian Atalantê, whom the Cyprian goddess hates,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>

<span class="line">an axe’s two-edged bite. The children of Thestios</span><span class="linebreak"></span>

<p>18. Do you see how carefully Maro followed Euripides’
wording? The latter says,</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">. . . had the left foot’s track unshod,</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">and Virgil too said that the left foot is bare:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line indent6">. . . they plant the tracks</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">of their left feet unshod.</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p>19. To show you more plainly still how attentive he was to
Greek practice in this matter, I will tell you something that
very few know: Euripides was criticized by Aristotle, who
claimed that Euripides statement, quoted above, was uninformed,
since the Aetolians have their right foot bare,
not their left. To demonstrate this, and not merely assert it,
I shall quote Aristotle’s exact words, from Book 2 of his <span class="italic">On
Poets</span>, where he says, with reference to Euripides (fr. 74
Rose):</p>
<span class="line">20. Euripides claims that the sons of Thestios advance</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
