<p>4. Then Avienus, turning to face Servius, said,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL512_115_60" id="target_note_LCL512_115_60"><sup>60</sup></a> ‘Please
tell me, best of teachers, why Virgil, who was ever finicky
and careful in weighing his words to suit the merits of his
subject or their lack, used a word carelessly, just tossing it
off, in these lines (<span class="italic">E.</span> 6.75–76*†),
<q><span class="line">girt round her fair groin with baying monsters,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">she harried the ships of Ulysses.</span><span class="linebreak"></span></q>
For “harried” is a verb appropriate to a slight and trivial
discomfiture, not the horrendous misfortune entailed
when people are suddenly seized and torn to bits by an utterly
dreadful monster.</p>
<p>5. But there’s also another instance
of this sort that I’ve come upon (<span class="italic">G</span>. 3.4–5*):
<q>
<span class="line">Who does not know of cruel</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Eurystheus or the altars of Busiris, whom none can</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">praise?</span><span class="linebreak"></span></q>
For saying “whom none can praise” isn’t suited to expressing
the loathing appropriately felt for the worst sort of
criminal, who—seeing that he used to sacrifice people of
all nations—was not just unworthy of praise, but worthy of
being hated and cursed by the whole human race.</p>
<p>6. For
that matter, this word, too, seems inconsistent with Virgil’s
exacting care (<span class="italic">A.</span> 10.314*†),
<q><span class="line">. . . through his tunic caked with gold:</span><span class="linebreak"></span></q>
“caked with gold” is inappropriate, since the filthiness associated
with “caking” is the opposite of gold’s gleaming
splendor.’</p>
