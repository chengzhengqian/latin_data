worship the sun with very great ceremony under the name
of Jupiter, whom they call “Zeus of Heliupolis.” The god’s
image was taken from an Egyptian town that is itself also
called Heliupolis,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_301_580" id="target_note_LCL510_301_580"><sup>580</sup></a> when Senemuris ruled Egypt (or perhaps
he was named Senepos), and was first brought to
Heliupolis by Opias, a lieutenant of the Assyrian king
Delobor, and by Egyptian priests led by Partemetis; after
the Assyrians had held it for a long time, it was transferred
to Heliupolis.</p>
<p>11. Why that happened, how it left Egypt
and later came to the place where it now is, why it is paid
cult in the Assyrian, not Egyptian, manner—all this I’ve
thought it superfluous to relate, since it has no bearing on
the topic at hand.</p>
<p>12. That this Jupiter is the same as the
sun is evident both from the very nature of his cult and
from his appearance. For his statue is of gold, beardless,
with its right hand raised and holding a whip, like a charioteer,
its left hand holding a lightning bolt and ears of grain,
all of which point to the conjoined power of Jupiter and the
sun.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_301_581a" id="target_note_LCL510_301_581a"><sup>581</sup></a></p>
<p>13. Divination, too, plays a preponderant role in the
temple’s cult, and that is related to the power of Apollo,
who is identified with the sun. The image of the god of
Heliupolis is carried on a litter, like the images of the gods
in the procession at our Circus Games,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_301_582" id="target_note_LCL510_301_582"><sup>582</sup></a> and the leading
men of the province usually bear the load, their heads
shaved, their bodies kept ritually pure by long sexual abstinence:
they are borne along by the god’s spirit, carrying the
image not where they choose but where the god moves
