fattened fowl roasted, gruel, and bread of Picenum.</p>
<p>13. Where could there have been greater scope for denouncing
luxury when a pontiffs’ meal was stuffed with
such things! How disgusting just to list the sorts of food!
Indeed, Titius, in his speech supporting the law of Fannius
(fr. 3 <span class="italic">ORF<sup>2</sup></span>),<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL511_95_107a" id="target_note_LCL511_95_107a"><sup>107</sup></a> reproaches his contemporaries for serving
Trojan pig, so-called because it is “pregnant” with other
animals enclosed within, just as the famous Trojan horse
was “pregnant with armed men.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL511_95_108" id="target_note_LCL511_95_108"><sup>108</sup></a></p>

to force-feed even hares, as Varro reports when he speaks
about hares in his third book on agriculture (3.12.5): “The
practice of force-feeding, too, has recently been established:
they take the hares from the hutch, shut them up in
cages, and make them fat in the confined space.”</p>
<p>15. If anyone’s
surprised at Varro’s report that they used to force-feed

Titius spoke in support of the law at the time of its passage,
