<p>3. ‘Virtually everyone agrees that the “profane” is that
which lies beyond the concerns of a holy precinct, that is to
say, “set farther (<span class="italic">porro</span>) apart from a holy precinct (<span class="italic">fanum</span>)
and religious scruple.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL511_19_19" id="target_note_LCL511_19_19"><sup>19</sup></a> Virgil succeeded in providing an
example of this meaning in speaking about a grove and the
entrance to the underworld, each of which was “sacred”
(<span class="italic">A.</span> 6.258–59):</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line indent6">“. . . Away, profane ones, be ye far away,”</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">the seer cries out, “and stand apart wholly from this</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">grove.”</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p>4. Note also that Trebatius says (<span class="italic">ibid.</span>) the term “profane”
is used precisely of something that has ceased to be “sacred”
and “filled with religious scruple” and has passed
into the use and ownership of human beings—and our
poet very plainly preserved this sense in saying (<span class="italic">A.</span> 12.777–79†),
<q><span class="line">“Take pity, Faunus, I pray,” he said, “and you, fairest</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">Earth, hold tight</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">That weapon, if I have always carefully tended your</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">honors,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Which Aeneas’ men in contrast have profaned.”</span><span class="linebreak"></span></q>
For the poet had just previously said (<span class="italic">A.</span> 12. 770–71),
