<p>8. He said “at a thousand of paces” [<span class="italic">milli passum</span>] instead
of “at a thousand paces” [<span class="italic">mille passibus</span>] and “with a thousand
of sesterces” [<span class="italic">milli nummum</span>] instead “with a thousand
sesterces” [<span class="italic">mille nummis</span>], demonstrating plainly both
that <span class="italic">mille</span> is a noun and that it is used in the singular and
that it takes the ablative case, and that its plural is <span class="italic">milia.</span></p>
<p>9. For <span class="italic">mille</span> is used to express what <span class="italic">khilias</span> does in Greek,

“two <span class="italic">khiliades,</span>” so the ancient Roman used to say “one
<span class="italic">mille</span>” and “two <span class="italic">milia</span>,” according to a fixed and straightforward

men, whom Marcus Cicero and Varro are pleased to say
they imitate—do you want to strip them of the right to vote

ancestors the custom of “hurling sexagenarians from the
bridge”?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_49_65" id="target_note_LCL510_49_65"><sup>65</sup></a></p>
<p>11. I would expand on this subject, were not the
hour compelling you to depart, unwilling though we are
all around. But tomorrow is a day that most people waste
on board games: do you want to spend it in the sorts of
serious discussions you’ve been having, from first light to
dinner-time—yes, and have a dinner that is itself not a riotous
heap of cups and platters but modestly engaged with
learned questions and mutual give-and-take based on our

<p>12. That’s how we might experience a religious
festival that brings profit beyond all our business engagements,
not “relaxing the mind” (in the common phrase)—for as Musonius says (fr. 52), “relaxing the mind is the same
