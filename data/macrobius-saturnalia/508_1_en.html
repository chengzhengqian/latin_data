authors, we are ignorant of many things that would
not lie hidden if the ancients’ texts were our constant companions.
<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL512_139_79" id="target_note_LCL512_139_79"><sup>79</sup></a> For all ancient writers applied the word <span class="italic">eques</span>
as often to the horse when it carried a rider as to the person
riding upon the horse, and they said that not only the
person but also the horse “played the <span class="italic">eques</span>” [<span class="italic">equitare</span>].</p>
<p>10. Ennius, in Book 7 of the <span class="italic">Annals</span>, says (236–7 Sk.):
<q><span class="line">And then the four-footed ones, <span class="italic">eques</span> and elephants,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">Violently</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">hurl themselves forward.</span><span class="linebreak"></span></q>
There can be no doubt, can there, that he used <span class="italic">eques</span> in
place of the horse itself, since he applied the epithet “four-footed”
to it?</p>
<p>11. So also <span class="italic">equitare,</span> a verb derived from
the noun <span class="italic">eques</span>, used to be used both of a person riding a
horse and of a horse walking along with a person astride it.
Lucilius, a man second to none in his knowledge of Latin,
uses <span class="italic">equitare</span> of a horse in this verse (1301):</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">We see, of course, this horse in its course playing the</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2"><span class="italic">eques.</span></span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p>12. So too in Maro, who was an attentive student of ancient
Latin, the usage should be understood in those terms:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">and they taught the <span class="italic">eques</span> under arms—</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">that is, they taught the horse, in the process of carrying the
man—</p>

since his commentary on the <span class="italic">Aeneid</span> omits many citations of old
Republican poetry that were included in his main source (Aelius
Donatus) and includes many new citations from more recent poets
(Lucan, Statius, Juvenal).</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL512_139_79').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
