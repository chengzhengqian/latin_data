<p>21. Cornelius Labeo sought out this oracle’s meaning, developing
an interpretation of the godhead and his name
that identifies father Liber and the sun as Iaô, in his book
titled <span class="italic">On the Oracle of Apollo of Claros</span> (fr. 18 Mast.).</p>
<p>22. Similarly, in showing that Liber and the sun are one and
the same god, Orpheus describes the god’s garments and
paraphernalia in the rites of the Liberalia<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_257_493" id="target_note_LCL510_257_493"><sup>493</sup></a> as follows
(<span class="italic">PEGr</span> fr. 538, 541):</p>

<span class="line">In the morning complete all these things, decking out</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">the god’s body as a likeness of the far-famed sun:</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">first, then, clothe him in a crimson cloak,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">flame-like, an image of his blazing rays;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">then on top of that fasten from his right shoulder a</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">fawn’s</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">broad hide, many-colored, the dappled skin of the</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">Beast</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">to represent the intricate stars and the holy vault of</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">heaven.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Next place a golden belt on top of the fawn skin,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">all radiant, to wear round his chest, a great sign,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">just as when he leaps up gleaming from the earth’s</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">rim</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">and strikes the flood of Ôkean with his golden rays,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">and a glow, indescribable, that mingles with the dew</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
