<p>32. ‘Others think that candles are exchanged precisely
because it was under Saturn’s guidance that we passed out
from a dark and uncultured way of life to the light cast by
the knowledge of beneficial skills.</p>
<p>33. I also find it recorded
that when many men used the occasion of the Saturnalia
to extort gifts from clients out greedy self-interest,
so that the less well off were burdened, Publicius, a tribune
of the plebs, carried a measure forbidding anything
but candles to be sent to the wealthy.’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_83_111" id="target_note_LCL510_83_111"><sup>111</sup></a></p>
<p>34. Here Caecina Albinus interposed: ‘The sort of
change in sacrifice that you mentioned just now, Praetextatus,
I find to have been observed later in the case of

consul Junius Brutus decided that the sacrifice should be
celebrated differently, ordering that the gods’ favor be
sought with heads of garlic and poppy: that way the terms
of Apollo’s oracle stipulating “heads” could be satisfied,
while the crime attaching to the ill-omened sacrifice would
