<p>8. So then, as it descends entirely to its hiding place,
it draws along the blood that’s always carrying it along as
though in a chariot: once it has hit bottom, the skin retains
a thinner sort of humor, and that’s the source of its pallor.
That’s the reason people also tremble in fear: by fleeing inward
the soul’s strength abandons the sinews that keep the
limbs sturdy, and so they’re shaken by the jumpiness of
fear.</p>
<p>9. And it is also why fear is accompanied by a loosening

<p>3. Dysarius said, ‘Every body is naturally liable to dissolution
and rot and it quickly melts away if there is no bond
to hold it together. However, as long as the soul is resident,
