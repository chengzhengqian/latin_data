<blockquote><p><span class="line">10. Following her lead her companions left</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">their mounts and flowed down [<span class="italic">defluxit</span>] to the</span><span class="linebreak"></span>

<p class="noindent">Thus Furius in Book 1 (fr. 8 <span class="italic">FPL<sup>3</sup></span>):</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">That one there, suddenly subjugated<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL512_77_33" id="target_note_LCL512_77_33"><sup>33</sup></a> by a weighty</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">wound,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">let go the horse’s reins and, tottering, flowed down to</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">the ground,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">and raised a crash with his brazen arms.</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">11. The earth then began to harden and confine</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">Nereus</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">in the sea. (<span class="italic">E</span>. 6.35–36)</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">This word “confine” [<span class="italic">discludere</span>] strikes our ears as a
new coinage, but Lucretius used it previously in Book 5
(437–38):</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">From that point segments of space began to separate</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">and like things began to be joined with like, confining</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">the firmament.</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">12. A shepherd, Tityrus, should feed</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">his flock ’til they’re fat but keep his song fine-spun.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">(<span class="italic">E.</span> 6.4–5)</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">“Fine-spun” [<span class="italic">deductum</span>] for “thin and delicate” is a nice
usage—but Afranius uses it too, in his <span class="italic">Maiden</span> (339–41
<span class="italic">SRPF<sup>3</sup></span> 2:249):</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">With a few little words</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">she answered me sadly, her tone fine-spun,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">and said she wished she had not fallen asleep;</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
