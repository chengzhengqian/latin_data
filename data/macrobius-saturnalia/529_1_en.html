what could cram such gross matter through the throat’s
narrow passage were not a more hidden force of nature
drawing it in?</p>
<p>15. But to prevent the food that’s swallowed
from gliding uninterruptedly through the series of bodily
openings that provide a passageway, to keep it from reaching
bottom and being passed out in the same state in which
it was taken in, and to allow it to receive the healthful ministry
of digestion—all this is the concern of the second
power, which the Greeks call the <span class="italic">kathektikê</span>, that is, the
power of retention.</p>
<p>16. The third power is called the
<span class="italic">alloiôtikê</span> [“transformative”], because it changes the food
from one thing into another: all the other powers are subordinate

of digestion.</p>
<p>17. For the belly has two openings. The
upper one, which is perpendicular to the belly, receives
the food that’s been swallowed and deposits it in the belly’s
sac: this is the stomach, which has deservedly come to be
called the “head of the household,” on the ground that it
governs the whole creature all by itself—for if it falls ill,
the creature’s life is at risk, as the nutrients’ path becomes
insecure—and to it nature has assigned the power to signal
“stop” or “go” as though it were capable of reason. The
lower opening extends downward and into the neighboring
intestines and provides the pathway for the matter that
is to be expelled.</p>
<p>18. The first digestion, then, takes place
in the belly, where the transformative power turns whatever
has been ingested into juice: the dregs are the waste
products that pass through the intestines by way of the
belly’s lower opening, and their expulsion is seen to by the
good offices of the fourth power, called the <span class="italic">apokritikê</span> [“secretive”].</p>
