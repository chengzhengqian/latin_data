plundering his goods, one slave—a tattoo on his forehead and
shackles on his feet, until someone took pity and released
him after his master was condemned—followed after him

not his master. Then he hid Restio and ministered to
his needs.</p>
<p>20. When he realized that their pursuers were
upon them, he killed an old man whom chance brought
their way, built a pyre, and put the corpse upon it. After
lighting the pyre he ran up to the men looking for Restio,
saying that he had exacted the penalty himself and had got
the better of it when it came to handing out abuse. He was
believed, and Restio was rescued.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_121_188a" id="target_note_LCL510_121_188a"><sup>188</sup></a></p>

him to the Tiber in a chest, conveyed him to Ostia, and
from there escorted him to his father’s villa in the territory
of Laurentum, traveling at night. Next, he accompanied
his master by boat, was cast ashore with him in a shipwreck,
and then concealed him in Naples. Though he was
caught by a centurion, neither a reward nor threats could
bring him to betray his master.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_121_189" id="target_note_LCL510_121_189"><sup>189</sup></a></p>
<p>22. When Asinius Pollio,
too, was harshly pressuring the people of Padua to contribute
money and weapons, the masters took to hiding, and a
reward, including freedom, was promised to slaves who
betrayed their masters: it is an established fact none of the
slaves yielded to the reward and betrayed his master.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_121_190" id="target_note_LCL510_121_190"><sup>190</sup></a></p>
