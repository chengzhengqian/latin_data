some respects fell short of the weighty effect that Homer
achieved.</p>
<p>2. To start with, Homer bypassed Athens and
Sparta and even Mycenae, home of the army’s general, and

because of some special prestige attaching to the place but
because he chose the best known headland to start off his
list.</p>

settlements, now the neighboring coastal areas, then
moves on to the inland and coastal sites of the adjacent
territories, providing a description as systematic as he
would were he making the journey. He makes no sudden
jumps and allows no gaps to open in the territorial continuity
of his book but progresses in the manner of a wayfarer
until he comes back to the point where he began. That is
how he rounds off all that his list comprises.</p>
<p>4. By contrast,

(<span class="italic">A.</span> 10.166*–212) but jumps around and cuts the sequence
