Tutilina used to keep a day of rest;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_191_354" id="target_note_LCL510_191_354"><sup>354</sup></a> so too, whenever the
wife of a flamen<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_191_355" id="target_note_LCL510_191_355"><sup>355</sup></a> heard thunder she observed a period of
religious retirement until she had appeased the gods.</p>
<p>9. ‘The priests, moreover, used to claim that religious
festivals [<span class="italic">feriae</span>] became polluted if any work was undertaken
once they had been proclaimed and formally scheduled.
The priest in charge of sacrifices<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_191_356" id="target_note_LCL510_191_356"><sup>356</sup></a> and the flamens
were also forbidden to observe any work being done during
festivals: that’s why their approach was announced by a
herald, so that any such activity would cease, and anyone
who ignored the announcement was fined.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_191_357" id="target_note_LCL510_191_357"><sup>357</sup></a></p>
<p>10. Indeed,
besides the fine there was the rule that a person who out of
ignorance performed some work on such occasions was
obliged to offer expiation with a pig. Scaevola the pontiff
used to claim (fr. 1b <span class="italic">IAH</span> 1:57 = fr. 11 <span class="italic">IAR</span><sup>6</sup>) that one who
intentionally acted thus could not offer expiation,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_191_358" id="target_note_LCL510_191_358"><sup>358</sup></a>
though Umbro denies that pollution is suffered by one
who undertook a task that served the gods or their sacred
rites or performed some action that met a vitally pressing
need.</p>
<p>11. Scaevola, finally, when asked what one was permitted
to do on a festival, replied (fr. 12 <span class="italic">IAH</span> 1:57 = fr. 12
<span class="italic">IAR</span><sup>6</sup>), “What would cause harm if neglected.” Accordingly,
if an ox fell into a pit and the head of the household
freed it with the aid of workmen, he was not seen as having
polluted the festival, and similarly one who propped up a
broken roof-beam and averted an imminent collapse.</p>
<p>12. Hence Maro too, familiar with every branch of learning
and aware that a sheep is bathed either to cleanse the wool

and harvested crops, respectively (cf. Pliny <span class="italic">Natural History</span> 18.8,

meaning of “Semonia” is obscure: the term appears elsewhere
only in a fragmentary passage of Festus (p. 404.18), and in a formula
added at the end of a dedicatory inscription, again joined
with Salus (<span class="italic">Salus Semonia</span>——<span class="italic">populi Victoria</span>, <span class="italic">CIL</span> 6.30975 [1

the original inscription’s final word), in a way that suggests the
term might be an epithet derived from the name of the Sabine god
