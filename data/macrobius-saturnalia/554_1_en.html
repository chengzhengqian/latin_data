<p>11. It is nature’s doing that things either exceedingly
dry or exceedingly wet have no feeling.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL512_231_77" id="target_note_LCL512_231_77"><sup>77</sup></a> Bones,
teeth, fingernails, hair—they’re all so densely composed of
very dry material as to be impenetrable to that effect of the
life-principle which provides sensation; fat, marrow, and
the brain are so moist and soft that their softness fails to retain
the same effect of the life-principle that the dryness I
referred to fails to receive.</p>
<p>12. For that reason sensation
could no more be present in teeth, nails, bones, and hair
than it was in fat, marrow, and the brain. And just as cutting
hairs causes no pain, so if a tooth or bone or fat or the brain
or marrow should be cut, there would be absolutely no
pain.</p>
<p>13. “But,” you say, “we see people in agony when
their bones are cut, people tormented by toothache, too.”
Who would deny that’s the case? But when bone is cut, it’s
the sheath covering the bone that introduces the feeling of
agony while it suffers the cutting; once the physician’s
hand has got past that, the bone and the marrow it contains
are as free from pain when they’re cut as hairs are.
And when teeth hurt, it’s not the tooth’s bony tissue that’s
in pain but the flesh that holds the tooth.</p>
<p>14. Take the
fingernail too: all of it that grows clear of flesh is cut with no
sensation, the part that adheres to the flesh cause pain if it’s
cut, not from its own tissue from that of its base. So too
hair: while its upper part is cut, it feels no pain; if it’s torn
out, it acquires a sensation from the flesh it leaves behind.
The brain, too, which torments a person or even kills him
when it’s touched, brings on this pain not from its own capacity
for feeling but from that of its covering, that is, the
caul.</p>
