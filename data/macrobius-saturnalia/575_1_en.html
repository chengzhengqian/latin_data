posed and answered by Aristotle,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL512_273_119" id="target_note_LCL512_273_119"><sup>119</sup></a> who says that sea water
is much thicker than fresh—or rather, that it’s filled
with impurities, whereas fresh water is pure and fine.
That’s why (he says) the sea supports even inexperienced
swimmers, but river water, being weak, in a sense, and
lacking any support, soon gives way and sends to the bottom
any weight it receives.</p>
<p>20. He said that fresh water, being
naturally light, therefore enters the things that need
washing and draws out the dirty stains as it dries; but sea
water, being thicker, is prevented by its own density from
easily penetrating and cleaning and, since it dries only with
difficulty, does not draw out much dirt.’</p>
<p>21. When this seemed to meet with Horus’ assent,
Eustathius said, ‘Please, don’t deceive a credulous man
who has entrusted himself and his question to your good
faith. Aristotle’s account in this matter—as in some others—was
more clever than true.</p>
<p>22. The density of water is
so far from harming laundry that those who want to clean
some articles often mix in ash or, if that’s not available, dirt,
to do the job more quickly than they could with water
alone, even fresh water: the idea is to make the water
thicker so it can clean more quickly. Seawater’s density,
then, is no obstacle to cleaning.</p>
<p>23. Nor is it less effective
for being salty. Saltiness usually creates fissures and, as it
were, opens passages and so ought more effectively draw
out what needs to be washed away. But here’s the sole reason
that sea water is not good for cleaning: it’s greasy, as Aristotle
himself said on a number of occasions<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL512_273_120" id="target_note_LCL512_273_120"><sup>120</sup></a> and as is
shown by salt itself, in which everyone knows there’s something
greasy.</p>
<p>24. There is this further indication that sea
water is greasy: when it’s sprayed on a flame, it doesn’t so
much quench it as catch fire along with it, as the water’s
