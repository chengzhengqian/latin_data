about because of his mad building projects . . .”—not
“were milling about,” as we regularly find in copies written
with too little care—and in his sixth speech against Antony
(<span class="italic">Phil</span>. 6.15), “Who was ever found in that arcade<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_47_63" id="target_note_LCL510_47_63"><sup>63</sup></a> who
would advance a thousand of sesterces [<span class="italic">mille nummum</span>] to
Lucius Antonius?” True, too, that Cicero’s contemporary,
Varro, said, in Book 17 of his <span class="italic">Human Antiquities</span> (lib. 18 fr.
2), “It is more than one thousand one hundred of years
[<span class="italic">mille et centum annorum</span>]. . . .” Still, they could have
drawn the confidence to phrase things that way only from
the authority of their predecessors.</p>
<p>6. So Quadrigarius
wrote in Book 3 of his <span class="italic">Annals</span> (fr. 43): “There a thousand of
people [<span class="italic">mille hominum</span>] is slain”; and Lucilius in Book 3 of
his <span class="italic">Satires</span> (fr. 125):</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">From gate to gate there is a thousand [<span class="italic">mille . . . est</span>],</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">then six to Salernum.</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p>7. Elsewhere he even declined this noun: so in Book 15 he
says (fr. 511–13),</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">Beat this horse though it might at a thousand of</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">paces, and two thousand,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">no jolting galloper from Campania will stay in the</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">race</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">over a greater distance—in fact, it will seem to go</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">backwards.</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">similarly in Book 9 (fr. 331),</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">With one thousand of sesterces you can make a</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">hundred thousand.</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
