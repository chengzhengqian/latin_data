namely (500–2),</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">Their ears drooped and at the same time a fitful</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">sweat arose, the clammy sort typical of the dying;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">their hide was hot and did not yield when palpated.</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p>11. Lucretius says (1182–89):</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">Then they gave many signs of death besides:</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">mind disturbed, thoughts sunk in grief and fear,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">brow distraught, looks wild and fierce,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">ears beset by constant roaring to boot,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">breathing rapid or an occasional great sigh,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">neck clammy with a glistening slick of sweat,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">spittle thin and sparse, bright yellow and salty,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">coughing that scarcely escaped their rasping throats.</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>

<span class="line indent2">Thing</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">that had allowed some to feel on their faces the sky’s</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">life-giving breeze and to see the precincts of heaven</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">proved deadly for others and sealed their doom.</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
