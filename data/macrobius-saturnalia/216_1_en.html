in his <span class="italic">Bucolics</span>, when he talks about Daphnis’ apotheosis

if the victim put up an exceptional fuss when being led to
the altar and showed that it was being brought there unwillingly,
it was taken away, because they thought that the
god was unwilling to receive it as an offering. But when a
