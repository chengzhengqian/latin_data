was to be thrown in the arena; when someone happened to
ask Cascellius at about the same time whether in his opinion
a pine cone was a fruit, he said, “If a person is going to
throw it at Vatinius, it’s a fruit.”</p>
<p>2. When a merchant asked
him how he should divide a ship with his partner, he is
said to have replied, “If you divide the ship, neither you
nor your partner will have it.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_367_77" id="target_note_LCL510_367_77"><sup>77</sup></a></p>
<p>3. A witticism of Marcus
Lollius circulated at the expense of Galba, who was
renowned for his eloquence, though the deformity I’ve
remarked<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_367_78" id="target_note_LCL510_367_78"><sup>78</sup></a> detracted from the effect: “Galba’s genius inhabits
a hovel.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_367_79" id="target_note_LCL510_367_79"><sup>79</sup></a></p>
<p>4. Galba was also mocked quite harshly
by the grammarian Orbilius, when he appeared in court as
a witness against Galba’s client: when Galba, to disconcert
him, pretended not to know his profession and asked,
“What’s your line of work?,” Orbilius replied, “I give
hunchbacks an alfresco drubbing.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_367_80" id="target_note_LCL510_367_80"><sup>80</sup></a></p>
<p>5. When Gaius Caesar
gave 100,000 sesterces to the men who were playing
ball with him but ordered that 50,000 be given to Lucius
Caecilius, the latter said, “Why? Am I playing with one
hand?”</p>
<p>6. ‘When Publius Clodius was said to be in a snit with
Decimus Laberius because he didn’t comply with Clodius’
request for a mime script,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_367_81a" id="target_note_LCL510_367_81a"><sup>81</sup></a> Laberius said, “What are you
going to do to me? Make me go to Dyrrachium and come
back?,” alluding to Cicero’s exile.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_367_82" id="target_note_LCL510_367_82"><sup>82</sup></a></p>
