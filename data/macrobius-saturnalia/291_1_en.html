<p>5. The argument based on indignation is a similar gambit.
“What!,” says Juno (<span class="italic">A.</span> 1.39–40*),
<q><span class="line">Pallas Athena could burn the Argive fleet?</span><span class="linebreak"></span></q>
In this case destroying the victor’s fleet entails more of a
concession than destroying the exiled remnant. The next
step is to undercut the reason for the concession (<span class="italic">A.</span> 1.41):
