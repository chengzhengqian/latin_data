in the case of the golden bough.”</p>
<p>3. But I’m deeply embarrassed
that such a great man, and one with a scholar’s
deep knowledge of Greek literature, did not know Euripides’
very famous play, <span class="italic">Alcestis.</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL511_435_78" id="target_note_LCL511_435_78"><sup>78</sup></a></p>
<p>4. In this play Orcus enters
holding a sword to cut off Alcestis’ lock, and he says
(73–76):</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">This woman, then, will go down to Hades’ house.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">I come to her, to dedicate her with my sword:</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">whoever has a hair of his head consecrated by this</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">sword</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">is set apart for the god who dwells below the earth.</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p>5. I trust this makes it clear whom Virgil followed when he
introduced this story of the severed lock. The Greeks use
the verb <span class="italic">hagnisai</span> to mean “consecrate to the gods,” and
that is why your poet says, about the character Iris (<span class="italic">A.</span>
4.702–3),</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line indent11">. . . I bear this sacred offering</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">to Dis, as I was bid, and release you from your body.</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p>6. ‘Now, since nearly everything I’ve said to this point
has been informed by the tragedians’ authority, I’ll also
draw attention to what he borrowed from Sophocles.</p>
<p>7. After
Aeneas abandons Dido in Book 4, Virgil has her take
refuge, as it were, in the spells and curses of witches and
the sort of folk who lurk about altars, and in the course of
her remarks she says that she’s sought out herbs to calm
her passion, cut with a bronze blade.</p>
<p>8. Don’t you think it’s
worth asking how Virgil came to think of blades made of
bronze? I’ll quote Virgil’s lines first, then the lines of Sophocles
that Maro imitated (<span class="italic">A.</span> 4.513–14):</p>
