<p>9. Let this literate enjoyment and learned banter of ours
substitute for the barefoot dancer and the coarse clown
who spews shameless indecencies.</p>
<p>10. The ancients
thought humor worthy of careful study: to start with, I note
that two of the most eloquent men of old, the comic writer
Plautus and the orator Tully, were both second to none in
the charm of their jokes.</p>
<p>11. Indeed, Plautus was so famous
for this that after his death comedies circulating with no
sure indication of authorship were recognized as Plautine
from their abundant jokes.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_325_9" id="target_note_LCL510_325_9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>12. As for Cicero, no one could
be unaware of his mastery in this area if he’s bothered to
read the books his freedman compiled of his former master’s
jokes (though some think the jokes are the freedman’s).<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_325_10" id="target_note_LCL510_325_10"><sup>10</sup></a>
Similarly, who doesn’t know that his enemies
used to call him “the consular wag”? In fact, Vatinius even
used the phrase in a speech.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_325_11" id="target_note_LCL510_325_11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>13. And if it wouldn’t take
too long, I’d tell you about the cases in which he was defending
clients who were dead guilty but nonetheless got
them off with his jokes: take the case of Lucius Flaccus, for
example, whom Cicero got off with a timely joke when he
was on trial for extortion and his crimes were as plain as
black and white—the joke isn’t found in the speech itself,
