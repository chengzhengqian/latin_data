man especially employs, or one who is in other respects sophisticated,
chiefly at table and over drinks, when people
are easily provoked to anger.</p>
<p>4. For just as even a slight
touch sends someone standing on a cliff-edge headlong, so
even a slight grievance stirs to a rage someone who has indulged
in wine, whether a little or a lot. At a banquet, then,
one must be particularly careful to avoid the carping that
conveys a concealed insult.</p>
<p>5. Such things get all the more
urgently under the skin than straightforward insults, just
as angled hooks pierce and cling more tenaciously than
straight blades, especially since witticisms of this sort make
the bystanders laugh and add to the insult’s force by their
apparent agreement.</p>
<p>6. Now, it is a straightforward insult
to say, for example, “Do you forget that you were once
no better than a peddler of salt-cod?,” while it is an oblique
insult to say, “I remember when you used to wipe your

<p>8. When Laberius was looking for a
seat in the theater and Cicero would not have him sit beside

“But you used to make a habit of sitting in two seats,”
