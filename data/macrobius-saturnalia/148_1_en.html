sun’s journey does not depart from the so-called “parched”
zone, under which Ocean runs, circling the earth and
marking its limits;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_297_573" id="target_note_LCL510_297_573"><sup>573</sup></a> and the physical scientists universally
hold that heat is fed by moisture.</p>
<p>3. As for the fact that
Homer says, “and all the gods followed along,” he means
the constellations, which are borne along with the sun to
the west and the east by the daily movement of the heavens,
and are fed by the same moisture. For they call the
constellations and stars <span class="italic">theoi</span> [“gods”] from <span class="italic">thëein</span> [“run”],
because they are always in motion, or from <span class="italic">theôreisthai</span>
[“be observed”].<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_297_574" id="target_note_LCL510_297_574"><sup>574</sup></a></p>
<p>4. The poet adds “but again on the
twelfth” to indicate the number of hours, not days, the
time it takes them to come back and rise in the upper
hemisphere.</p>
<p>5. The following words from Plato’s <span class="italic">Timaeus</span>
(<span class="italic">Phaedr</span>. 246E4–247A1) lead us to think along the same
lines: “Zeus, heaven’s great guide, drives his winged chariot
and leads the way, ordering and taking thought for all
things; and the host of gods and divine powers follows after
him arranged in eleven divisions. Only Hestia stays behind
in the gods’ dwelling.”With these words he intends it to be
understood that the sun is “heaven’s great leader,” here
called “Jupiter” [i.e., Zeus], while the “winged chariot”
points to the sun’s speed.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_297_575" id="target_note_LCL510_297_575"><sup>575</sup></a></p>
<p>6. Because the sun, in whatever
sign he happens to be, is superior to all signs and constellations
and to the gods that are the signs’ guardians,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_297_576" id="target_note_LCL510_297_576"><sup>576</sup></a>
he seems to go before all the gods as their leader, arranging
and setting all things in order, and the rest of the gods, like
an army, seem to be distributed among eleven of the signs,
