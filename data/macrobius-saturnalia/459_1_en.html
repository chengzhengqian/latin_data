<blockquote><p><span class="line">sweltering made the field a morgue in the land of</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">Cecrops,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>

<p>8. But insofar as quoting all of both passages is quite a long
task, I’ll present some excerpts that will make the similarity
of the two descriptions apparent. Virgil says (505–8):</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">Then indeed the eyes are bright and bloodshot, a sigh</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">is drawn</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">from deep in the chest, now and again weighed down</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">with a groan,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">long, gasping breaths strain the gut, black blood</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">Pours</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">from the nostrils, the tongue becomes rough and</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">blocks the throat.</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p>9. Lucretius says (1145–50):</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">At first, they walked about with heads on fire with</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">fever,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">their two eyes bloodshot and gleaming.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Their throats, too, were constricted, they oozed</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">blood, the pathway of the voice was blocked and</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">closed with sores,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">and the tongue, the mind’s interpreter, dripped with</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">gore,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">weakened by the illness, clumsy in its movement,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">rough to the touch.</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p>10. Virgil says (503),</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">These were the signs they gave in the first days</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">before they died,</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
