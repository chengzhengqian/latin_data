<p class="noindent">The <span class="italic">scyphus</span> is Hercules’ cup, as the <span class="italic">cantharus</span> is father
Liber’s. In olden days sculptors fashioned Hercules with a
cup—and sometimes stumbling drunk—with good reason:
not just because the hero is said to have been fond of
drink but also because of the old tale that he crossed the
limitless seas in his drinking vessel, as though it were a sailing
vessel.</p>
<p>17. I’ll say a few words based on ancient Greek
texts about both of these reasons. To say nothing of what’s
common knowledge, the hero’s great fondness for drink is
plainly shown by the fact that Ephippus, in his <span class="italic">Busiris,</span>
brings Hercules onstage saying (fr. 2 <span class="italic">PCG</span> 4:132):</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">Are you unaware, by the gods, that I am from Tiryns</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">in the Argolid, where the people always fight all</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">their battles drunk?</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">—No doubt that’s why they always run away.</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p>18. There’s also a story—not terribly well known—that
there was a certain tribe near Heraclea, a city founded by
Heracles, whose name, “Kylikrani,” is formed from the
word <span class="italic">kylix</span>, which is a kind of cup that we, with the change
of a single letter, call the <span class="italic">calyx</span>.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL511_467_100" id="target_note_LCL511_467_100"><sup>100</sup></a></p>
<p>19. However, the story
that Hercules was borne along in a cup when he sailed
to Erytheia—that is, an island off Spain—is told both by
Panyassis, an outstanding Greek author (fr. 9 <span class="italic">PEGr</span> 1:176–77), and by Pherecydes (no. 3 fr. 18a <span class="italic">FGrH</span> = fr. 18a
