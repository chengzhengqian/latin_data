<p>5. But the nature of orators is not a single, simple thing:
this one is fluent and overflowing while that one aims to
speak briefly and concisely, the spare, dry, and sober sort
likes a certain austerity of speech, another frolics with a
rich, flashy, and flowery style. Amid the great variety that
they all display, Virgil alone is found to have achieved an
eloquence that is melded together from every style.’</p>
<p>6. Avienus replied, ‘I’d like you to explain this variety in
greater detail, with examples from specific speakers.’</p>
<p>7. ‘There are,’ Eusebius said, ‘four different speaking
styles:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL511_217_3a" id="target_note_LCL511_217_3a"><sup>3</sup></a> the abundantly inventive, which is Cicero’s domain;
the brief, where Sallust holds sway; the dry, which
is regarded as Fronto’s; and the rich and blossoming, in
which Pliny once reveled, as now our friend Symmachus
does, second to none of the ancients.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL511_217_4" id="target_note_LCL511_217_4"><sup>4</sup></a> But in Maro alone
will you find all four styles.</p>

confined within a narrower compass? (<span class="italic">A.</span> 3.11)

speaking, three styles (<span class="italic">genera dicendi</span>: refs. in Lausberg §1078–

and the “middle” (“gentle,” “blossoming”); but note that
Demetrius <span class="italic">On Style</span> 36 admits four (“plain,” “elevated,” “elegant,”
and “forceful”). Though the traits assigned the stylists here are in
some cases elsewhere so ascribed—e.g., Caesar called Cicero
“virtually the prince of abundant inventiveness” (<span class="italic">copia: On Analogy</span>
fr. 1 <span class="italic">GRF</span> 1:146), Quintilian speaks of “Sallustian brevity” (4.2.45, cf. 8.3.32)—they are not clearly or simply used to characterize
any of the traditional styles: “blossoming” (<span class="italic">floridum</span> = Gk.
<span class="italic">anthêron</span>) is used of both the “middle” (Quint. 12.10.58) and the
“grand” (Fortunat. 3.9, <span class="italic">RLM</span> p. 126.4); “dry” is otherwise used to
describe a fault of the “precise” style (Fortunat. ibid p. 126.6–7);
“rich” (<span class="italic">pingue</span>) is rare and uncomplimentary (Cic. <span class="italic">Speech on behalf
