too making this same point, that wine should be counted
among the things that are naturally warm; and just now
Eustathius, too, in touching on the causes of drunkenness,
mentioned wine’s warmth. But when I’ve pondered the
question, as I often have, I’ve formed the impression that
wine is by nature more nearly cool than warm: I’ll put before
you the reasons that lead me to this assessment, so that
you can pass judgment on it.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL512_203_50" id="target_note_LCL512_203_50"><sup>50</sup></a></p>

on the one hand cool by nature but is on the other hand
capable of taking on warmth, or even seeks it out when it
has been brought near sources of heat. For though metal
too is cold to the touch (<span class="italic">Il</span>. 5.75)—

and the warmth, though a new arrival, drives out the native
chill. Let’s ask, then, whether reason urges that the same is
true of wine.</p>
<p>3. Wine is either introduced to the body’s inner
regions by drinking or is applied as a poultice to treat
the body’s surface. Not even physicians are going to deny
that it is cool when it is poured on the skin, yet they assert
that it is warm inside the body—though it is not warm as
it goes down but becomes warm when it mingles with
sources of heat.</p>
<p>4. I would certainly like them to explain
why they give wine to a sick person whose gut has become
inactive, to restore its powers with wine’s astringent effect,
if wine’s cool nature does not gather and bind up what has
become weak and loose. And since, as I said, they apply
