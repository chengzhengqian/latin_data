more fluid than it formerly was, it’s turned into a breeze
when it’s stirred up. Furthermore, as a breeze it removes
what surrounded us; but since what surrounded us was
heat, once the heat has been removed by the breeze, it
gives us a new feeling of cool when it’s stirred.’</p>
<p>Evangelus interrupted the ongoing questioning and<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">9</span><span class="br"></span>
said, ‘I’ll give our friend Dysarius a workout, if he’ll but satisfy
his questioner with those “small and dewy”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL512_227_73" id="target_note_LCL512_227_73"><sup>73</sup></a> answers

<p>2. Tell me, Dysarius, why people who turn repeatedly
in a circle experience dizziness and darkened vision
and finally fall down, if they continue, though no other
bodily motion has this inevitable effect.’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL512_227_74" id="target_note_LCL512_227_74"><sup>74</sup></a></p>
<p>3. Dysarius replied, ‘The body knows seven motions: it
moves forward or back, or it turns right or left, or it goes
up or down, or it spins in a circle.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL512_227_75" id="target_note_LCL512_227_75"><sup>75</sup></a></p>
<p>4. Only one of these
seven motions is found in divine bodies, the circular one,
which is the motion of the heavens, the stars, and all the
other elements. The other six are chiefly the ones best
known to earth-bound animals, but sometimes the seventh
also comes into play. But those six, being unidirectional,
are harmless; the seventh, the one that causes circular motion,
produces confusion by constantly turning upon itself
and mingles cranial fluids with the breath that provides the
life-principle to the brain, the pilot, as it were, of all the
body’s senses.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL512_227_76a" id="target_note_LCL512_227_76a"><sup>76</sup></a></p>
