pleasures, which derive from the three remaining senses,
are peculiar to human beings.</p>
<p>13. I’ll quote the words of
the philosopher Aristotle on this topic, so that we may
share the sentiments of so brilliant and famous a man concerning
these disgraceful pleasures (<span class="italic">Probl</span>. 28 949b-950a):</p>
<p>14. Why are people who go to excess in pursuing the
pleasure of touch or taste called “incontinent”
[<span class="italic">akratês</span>]? For people who lack control in matters of
sex are of that sort, and those who lack control in the
enjoyment derived from food. Of those concerning
food, the sweetness derived from some things is
perceived by the tongue, from others, by the throat,
and that is why Philoxenus prayed to have “a crane’s
throat.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_385_101" id="target_note_LCL510_385_101"><sup>101</sup></a> Or else it is because we share the pleasures
derived from these sources with other animals,
and since subjection to these shared pleasures
is shameful, we do not hesitate to reproach the person
overcome by them and call him “incontinent”
and “uncontrolled,” because he is overcome by the
worst pleasures: for other animals derive pleasure
from only two of the five existing senses and are either
wholly insensible to pleasure from the other
three or experience it only contingently.</p>
