If among either the Phaeacians or the Carthaginians someone
had mixed recherché remarks about wisdom with the
stories told at those banquets, would he not have both
spoiled the pleasant atmosphere suited to those gatherings
and caused himself to be frankly and justly mocked? Philosophy’s
first rule, then, is to take the measure of her
fellow guests.</p>
<p>15. ‘In the second place, when she’s seen that she has an
opening, philosophy will not speak about her profound
mysteries over drinks and will initiate discussion, not of
knotty and finicky questions, but of useful ones that are
still not too taxing.</p>
<p>16. Those (for example) who count it a
kind of exercise to dance in the middle of a banquet will
banish from their cheerful company anyone who’s fool
enough to challenge his companions to a footrace or a boxing
match just because he wants more exercise: just so,
given the opportunity at table, one should philosophize in
an appropriate way, so that the mixing bowl of the liquid

in silence—diners should properly maintain a constant silence,
then there is no point in asking further whether
one should engage in philosophical discussion at table. But
if banquets will not be mute, why, when conversation is
