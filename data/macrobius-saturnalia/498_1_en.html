a desperado that he does not sometimes do or say something
that that could be praised. That’s why the following
very ancient line enjoys the status of a proverb (Aesch. fr.
471 <span class="italic">TGrF</span> 3:504):</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">For often even a foolish man has spoken in a very</span><span class="linebreak"></span>

<p>13. But the person entirely bereft of praise in every circumstance
and at every moment is someone whom none
can praise, the very worst and basest of all; and just as being
free of every fault makes one a person whom none can

(<span class="italic">Principal Doctrines</span> 3): “The definition of the magnitude
of pleasures is the removal of all that which causes pain.”
By the same principle Virgil used the term “whom none
could love” of the Stygian marsh (<span class="italic">G</span>. 4.479, <span class="italic">A</span>. 6.438): just
