that occur in the plural only, differently from nouns that
have both singular and plural forms: <span class="italic">Compitalia</span> and <span class="italic">Bacchanalia</span>
and <span class="italic">Agonalia</span> and <span class="italic">Vinalia</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_35_44" id="target_note_LCL510_35_44"><sup>44</sup></a> and all the others like
them are the names of holidays and are not used in the singular—or
if you were to use the singular form, it would not
mean the same thing unless you added “holiday,” as in “the
Bacchanal holiday,” “the Agonal holiday,” and so on, using
the word not as a substantive but as an adjective, what the
Greeks call an “epithet.”</p>
<p>10. They intended, then, to mark
the difference in the genitive case, so that by declining the
noun thus they would give a distinct form to the name
of the holy day, fully aware that in some nouns that have
the dative ending in –<span class="italic">bus</span> the genitive still often ends in
–<span class="italic">rum</span>, as in <span class="italic">domibus domorum, duobus duorum, ambobus
amborum.</span></p>
<p>11. ‘So too the word <span class="italic">viridia</span>: when it’s understood to
have served as an epithet, it produces its genitive in –<span class="italic">um</span>,
as in the phrase “green meadows,” <span class="italic">viridia prata, viridium
pratorum</span>; but when we want to indicate a place’s actual
“greenery,” we use the form <span class="italic">viridiorum</span>, as in the expression
“the beautiful appearance of the greenery,” <span class="italic">formosa
facies viridiorum</span>, the word being used in that instance as
a substantive, not an attribute.</p>
<p>12. The ancients, however,
took such liberties in using this genitive that Asinius
Pollio frequently goes so far as to say <span class="italic">vectigaliorum</span> (fr. 45

common than the plural <span class="italic">vectigalia</span>. But even though we
