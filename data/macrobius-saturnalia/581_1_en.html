though the senses ought to be considered among the more
reliable things when they’re accompanied by reason,
which sometimes finds a single sense insufficient for identifying
a specific object.</p>

the shape of a fruit that’s called an apple, it is not necessarily
an apple but could have been fashioned from some
material to look like an apple: another sense—smell—must
be called on to judge. But if the thing was placed
amid a heap of apples it could have acquired a whiff of
the very odor: here touch must be consulted, to judge by
the weight. But there’s concern that touch itself might also
be fooled, if a deceitful craftsman chose a substance that
could imitate the weight of a fruit. We must then take refuge
in taste, and should it agree with the shape, then it is an

how well-founded everything he said was, to the extent
that even Evangelus himself was not loath to add his testimony.
Dysarius then interposed, ‘It’s applause of that sort
that leads philosophy on to claim to deal with matters alien
to its expertise, with the result that it often plunges into obvious
errors. For example, while your Plato didn’t avoid
dealing with anatomy—the proper sphere of medicine—he
handed on to posterity an opportunity to mock him.</p>

food and drink,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL512_285_133" id="target_note_LCL512_285_133"><sup>133</sup></a> with the food, to be sure, being
