great mass of river and marsh water that’s at the mercy of
the cold, since it’s smoother than sea water.</p>
<p>34. As evidence
that a very great amount of such water flows into the Black
Sea, whose entire surface is imbued with fresh water, we
have not only Sallust’s statement (<span class="italic">Histories</span> fr. 3.65)—“The
Black Sea is fresher than all others”—but also the fact that
if you throw wheat chaff or sticks or any floating material in
the Black Sea, they’re carried beyond the Black Sea and
into the Sea of Marmara and from there into the sea that
washes the coast of Asia Minor—though it’s well known
that the sea’s water flows into the Black Sea, not out of it.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL512_261_102" id="target_note_LCL512_261_102"><sup>102</sup></a></p>
<p>35. For the only passage that transmits water from Ocean
into our seas is the Strait of Cadiz<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL512_261_103" id="target_note_LCL512_261_103"><sup>103</sup></a> that lies between
Spain and Africa: that influx itself most assuredly advances
along the coasts of Spain and Africa to the Tyrrhenian Sea,
then forms the Adriatic, from which it extends on the right
to the Parthenian Sea,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL512_261_104" id="target_note_LCL512_261_104"><sup>104</sup></a> on the left to the Ionian, and
straight ahead to the Aegean, from which it enters the
Black Sea.</p>
<p>36. Why, then, does water flow like a river from
the Black Sea, when the Sea receives water that flows in
from beyond it? Both the following explanations hold true:
the Black Sea’s surface water flows out because of the exceedingly
large amount of fresh water that enters it from
the land; but the water flowing in follows a path that runs at
a greater depth.</p>
<p>37. Hence it can be regarded as established
that floating things that are tossed into the Black Sea
are forced out, but if a column<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL512_261_105" id="target_note_LCL512_261_105"><sup>105</sup></a> falls in, it floats inward. It
has also been shown by experience that all the heavier
