April, June, Sextilis, September, November, and December
were counted as having twenty-nine days, with the
Nones on the fifth and seventeen days between the Ides
and the following Kalends.</p>
<p>7. But March, May, Quintilis,
and October had thirty-one days each: in these the Nones
were on the seventh and, again, there were seventeen days
after the Ides to the following Kalends. Only February
kept twenty-eight days, as though both the lesser number
and its evenness were appropriate to the spirits of the
dead.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_159_285" id="target_note_LCL510_159_285"><sup>285</sup></a></p>

the Romans reckoned their year according to a lunar calendar,

arranged the year in 354 days—for it was clear that their
year was eleven and one quarter days shorter than the sun’s
course, which completes the cycle of the zodiac in 365¼
days—they came up with the intercalary months according
to a regular system: every eight years they inserted
ninety days, from which they made three months of thirty
days each.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_159_287" id="target_note_LCL510_159_287"><sup>287</sup></a></p>
<p>10. The Greeks chose this system because it
was burdensome and difficult to intercalate eleven and
one quarter days every year: they preferred to multiply
that number by eight and to insert ninety days (the product

as I said, into three months. They called these
