<p>‘Homer’s contribution to Virgil is above all apparent<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">17</span><span class="br"></span>
from the fact that when the course of events forced Maro
to arrange the outbreak of war, which Homer did not
treat—since he began with the anger of Achilles, in the
tenth year of the war—he plainly struggled to produce the
new material, making the chance wounding of a stag the
cause of the upheaval.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL511_407_60" id="target_note_LCL511_407_60"><sup>60</sup></a></p>
<p>2. But when he realized that this
was a trivial and exceedingly childish device, he exaggerated
the peasants’ emotional response, so that their attack
would be a sufficient cause of war. It was just wrong, however,
to have Latinus’ slaves—especially those looking after
the royal stable, who knew the sort of pact Latinus had
struck with the Trojans because of the horses and yoked
chariot he was giving the latter (cf. <span class="italic">A.</span> 7.274–83)—start a
war against their master’s in-laws.</p>
<p>3. What’s the sequel?
The greatest goddess is brought down from heaven, the
greatest Fury is recruited from Tartarus, snakes are flung
about to create a frenzy—like some theatrical turn—the
queen is not just brought out from the private quarters
that preserve her matronly honor but is even forced to go
charging this way and that through the middle of town—no, not just that, she makes for the woods, calling on all the
other matrons to be her allies in madness—and they go
raving about, a chorus that’s lost all sense of decorum, and
celebrate insane rites.</p>
<p>4. Need I say more? I only wish that
for this part, too, Maro had found material to follow in his
mentor—or some other Greek author.</p>
