there’s a good reason why Aeneas slaughters no victim on
reaching Delos but offers sacrifice to Apollo and Neptune
on his departure:</p>
<p>2. it’s generally agreed, as Cloatius Verus
tells us in Book 2 of his <span class="italic">Things Arranged in Alphabetical
Order</span>,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL511_45_48" id="target_note_LCL511_45_48"><sup>48</sup></a> that there is an altar on Delos where no victim
is slaughtered but they worship the god only with a customary
prayer. Here’s what Cloatius says (fr. 6 <span class="italic">GRF</span> 1:470):
“On Delos there is the altar of Apollo the Begetter
[<span class="italic">Genetôr</span>], where no animal is sacrificed; they say that Pythagoras
regarded it as unpolluted<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL511_45_49" id="target_note_LCL511_45_49"><sup>49</sup></a> and worshipped at it.”</p>
<p>3. The poet shows that the altar where Aeneas prays is the
altar of Apollo the Begetter, since the pontiff enters the
temple and, without offering sacrifice, immediately begins
to pray, saying (<span class="italic">A.</span> 3.89)
<q><span class="line">Father, give a sign . . .,</span><span class="linebreak"></span></q>
to identify Apollo the Father more explicitly.</p>
<p>4. But shortly
thereafter, when Aeneas sacrifices a bull to Apollo and
Neptune, we necessarily understand that he did it at a different
altar, the poet taking care to call the god only “father”
in the first case, a title specific to that cult, and then in
the second case to call him Apollo, the name in general
use.</p>
<p>5. Cato also mentions this altar in his <span class="italic">On Raising
Children</span>, saying: “The nurse used to perform all these
