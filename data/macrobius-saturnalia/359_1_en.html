<p>11. A pilot who scans the heavens cannot help but turn his
neck frequently to search out assurance of clear weather in
the different quarters of the sky. Maro captured this wonderfully,
as though in a painting: because Arcturus is toward
the north, while the Bull (where the Hyades are
found), and Orion too, are in the south, he captured Palinurus’
frequent turning of his neck as he looked out for
the constellations.</p>
<p>12. “Arcturus,” he says: there, Palinurus
looks to the north; then “the Pleiades, the Hyades”—there,
he turns to the south; “and the two Bears”—he turns
his gaze back to the north; “and looks around for Orion of
the golden arms”—once again he turns back to the south.
Not just that, the verb “looks around” convey the action of
someone repeatedly swiveling this way and that by turns.</p>
<p>13. Homer brings on his pilot looking once to the Pleiades,
which are in the south, once to Boötes and the Bear, which
are in the northern sky.</p>
