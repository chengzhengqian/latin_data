Rome’s founding a certain Autronius Maximus beat his
slave, tied him to a gibbet, then drove him through the Circus
before the start of the show.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_113_179a" id="target_note_LCL510_113_179a"><sup>179</sup></a> Outraged at this, Jupiter
ordered a certain Annius,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_113_180" id="target_note_LCL510_113_180"><sup>180</sup></a> in a dream, to tell the senate
that he was displeased by such a cruel offense.</p>
<p>4. When
Annius kept the vision to himself, his own son suddenly
died, and after disregarding a second message, he himself
suddenly became enfeebled. At long last, heeding the advice
of friends, he had himself carried in a litter to the senate,
where he told the whole story: he had scarcely finished
when his health was immediately restored and he was able
to leave the curia on his own two feet.</p>
<p>5. So by decree
of the senate and the law of Maenius a day was added to
the Circus Games, to propitiate Jupiter: it is called the
<span class="italic">dies instauricius</span>, not (as some think) from the gibbet—that
is, <span class="italic">stauros</span> in Greek—but from the act of making
whole again, as Varro holds (fr. 430 <span class="italic">GRF</span> 1:362), noting
that <span class="italic">instaurare</span> means “to replace the equivalent amount”
[<span class="italic">instar novare</span>].<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_113_181" id="target_note_LCL510_113_181"><sup>181</sup></a></p>
<p>6. ‘You can see how concerned the highest god was
about a slave. But tell me, how do you come by this hugely
foolish disgust for slaves, as though they neither derive
their existence and sustenance from the same elements as
you nor draw the same breath of life from the same source?</p>
<p>7. Why not reflect that those whom the law calls “yours”
