one will rightly say that a human being is derived from
seed, rather than seed is derived from a human being, so
one cannot say that the chicken is derived from the egg,
but rather the egg is derived from the chicken.</p>
<p>11. Further,
if we should grant the other side’s statement that the things
that now exist took their beginning from some point in
time, it follows that nature first completely formed the individual
living creatures, then established the eternal law
that one generation would follow the next in an unbroken
line by means of procreation.</p>
<p>12. Now, as evidence that
things could have been completely formed at the outset we
even now have a considerable number of living things that
arise completely formed from the earth and rain, like mice
in Egypt and like frogs, snakes, and similar creatures elsewhere.
<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL512_301_140" id="target_note_LCL512_301_140"><sup>140</sup></a> Eggs, however, have never been produced from
the earth, since there is nothing completely formed about
them, whereas nature shapes completely formed things,
and eggs are derived from the things completely formed,
like parts from a whole.</p>
<p>13. For on the supposition that
eggs are the seedbeds from which birds derive, let’s see
what evidence is provided about seed itself by the philosophers’
definition, which holds that seed is a germ tending
toward a likeness of its source.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL512_301_141" id="target_note_LCL512_301_141"><sup>141</sup></a> But there can be no
aim to produce a likeness of that which does not yet exist,
just as seed does not flow from that which does not yet exist.</p>
<p>14. Let us take it, then, that at the first beginning of
things, along with all other living creatures born from seed
alone—and there is no doubt in their case that they existed
before their seed—birds too came forth completely
formed by nature the craftsman; and that because the
power of generation was implanted in each and every one,
they developed ways of giving birth that nature caused to
vary according to the differences among living things.</p>
