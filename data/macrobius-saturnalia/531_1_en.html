of the body expels it, and it naturally subsides into the weak
part that doesn’t have the strength to repel it: this foreign
matter, when it’s been received, causes the place into
which it has fallen to swell, and the swelling in turn produces
pain. This, then, is the threefold cause of gout or
of any disease that collected fluids produce: the excess
humor, the strength of the limb that rejects it, and the
weakness of the limb that receives it.</p>
<p>26. ‘So I’ve shown that four different processes of digestion
occur in the body, such that each depends on another,
and if an earlier process is blocked, then the one that
follows cannot be completed. Let’s now think back to the
first process that was completed in the belly, and we’ll find
out what blockage can arise from a varied diet.</p>
<p>27. Different
foods have different natures, some being digested
more quickly, others more slowly. When the first process is
turning food into juice, then, and all that’s been ingested is
not converted at the same time, the food that’s first converted
turns acidic while the rest is converted more slowly:
we often even perceive this directly when we belch.</p>
<p>28. The foods, too, that are digested slowly, like damp logs
that smoke at a fire’s urging, produce fumes at the prompting
of the body’s natural heat while they are being processed
more slowly—this too doesn’t escape the notice of
someone who belches.</p>
<p>29. But plain food, while it is all
turned at once into plain juice, entails no delay in conversion,
nor is any part of the process disturbed, as one part
follows another according to a stable schedule.</p>
<p>30. If anyone,
however, should refuse to heed this account (for
there’s nothing less patient than ignorance) and suppose
that only the quantity of food impedes digestion, refusing
to consider the kind also, here too a varied diet is caught
