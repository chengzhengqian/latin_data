passion for Caesar Augustus, though of course he retained
a proper regard for his high standing and sense of decency,
to avoid descending to the level of a wag.</p>
<p>2. He had
written a tragedy, the <span class="italic">Ajax</span>, and then erased it all because
he didn’t like it. When the tragic poet Lucius Varius asked
him how his Ajax was faring, Augustus said, “He’s fallen on
his sponge” (<span class="italic">dicta</span> 49 Malc.).<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_347_50" id="target_note_LCL510_347_50"><sup>50</sup></a></p>
<p>3. When someone was hesitantly
offering him a petition, now extending his hand, now
taking it back, Augustus said, “Do you think you’re giving a
penny to an elephant?” (<span class="italic">dicta</span> 8 Malc.).<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_347_51" id="target_note_LCL510_347_51"><sup>51</sup></a></p>

(<span class="italic">dicta</span> 50 Malc.).</p>
<p>5. ‘When he removed another man from his cavalry

saying, “The money isn’t the object, but I want it to appear
that you found me up to the task, so that I resigned my
commission voluntarily,” Augustus slapped him down by
replying, “You just tell everyone you received it, and I
won’t deny that I gave it” (<span class="italic">dicta</span> 51 Malc.).</p>
<p>6. A witticism
