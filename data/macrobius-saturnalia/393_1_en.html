contortions or deviate the least bit from just drawing out
the various details, but he stands there listing the arrayed
forces as though he were conducting a military review, a
subject that calls for no verbiage beyond the numbers.</p>
<p>17. And yet, when it’s right to do so, he works some wonderful
variations in presenting the leaders’ names:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">Then Skhedios and Epistrophos lead the men of</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">Phôkia . . . (<span class="italic">Il.</span> 2.517),</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Swift Aias, Oïleus’ son, led the Lokrians . . .</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">(<span class="italic">Il.</span> 2.527),</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Nireus led three balanced ships from Symê . . .</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">(<span class="italic">Il.</span> 2.671).</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p>18. In his admiration for the kind of heaped-up list found
in Homer Virgil conveyed the effect in a way I would almost
say is more elegant than his model (<span class="italic">Il.</span> 2.646–48):
<q><span class="line">Those who held Knôsos and high-walled Gortyn</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Lyktos and Milêtos and shining white Lykastos</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">and Phaistos . . .</span><span class="linebreak"></span></q>
and other passages like that.</p>
<p>19. Along the same lines one
finds in Virgil (A. 7.794–801):
<q><span class="line">The columns are marshaled thick on the plains, the</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">Argive youth</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">and platoons of Aurunci, the Rutuli and ancient</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
