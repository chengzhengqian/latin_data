<p>19. Indeed, if
you carefully examine the world itself, you will see a great
similarity between that divine creation and this poetic one:
just as Maro’s eloquence is a complete whole that responds
to the characters of all people—now brief, now abundant,
now dry, now colorful, now all at once, sometimes gentle,
sometimes turbulent—so the earth itself has fertile fields
and meadows in one place, shaggy woods and rugged crags
in another, dry desert sands here, places soaked by springs
there, and part opened up to the desolate expanse of the
sea.</p>
<p>20. Forgive me, then, and don’t say that I exaggerate in
comparing Virgil to the natural world:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL511_225_7" id="target_note_LCL511_225_7"><sup>7</sup></a> for I thought it
would fall short of his true measure, were I to say that he
combined, all by himself, the divergent styles of the ten orators
who flourished in the Athens of Attica.’</p>
<p>Then Evangelus said, with a mocking expression,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span>
‘Bravo! You compare to god the craftsman<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL511_225_8a" id="target_note_LCL511_225_8a"><sup>8</sup></a> a poet from the
hinterland of Mantua who—I’m quite certain—never
even read the Greek orators you’ve mentioned! How could
a native of the Veneto born to peasant parents and raised
amid the woods and thickets acquire even a smattering of
Greek literature?’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL511_225_9" id="target_note_LCL511_225_9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>

replied, ‘that any of the Greeks—even among the
greatest authors—drank as deeply of Greek learning as
the skillful Maro, or incorporated as much in his work.
