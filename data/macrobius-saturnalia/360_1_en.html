the character’s birth, as his model did, but also reproaching

obviously because in implanting one’s character a large
role is generally played by the qualities of one’s nurse and
the nature of the milk received, which enters the tender
babe and mingles with the parents’ seed when it is
still fresh, as the two-fold mixture shapes a single nature.</p>
<p>16. That is why a provident nature caused the capacity for
nursing to coincide with the delivery itself, so that the very
act of nurturing would make children and parents resemble
each other. For after the blood, like a craftsman, has
shaped the body’s every nook and cranny and fed it, the
same blood rises to the upper regions of the mother’s body
as the delivery approaches and takes on the nature of white
milk, so that it might nurture the new-born as it had previously
crafted it.</p>

<p>18. And this fact has been observed not only in the case of
human beings but in the case of domestic animals too: if
goats happen to be raised on ewes’ milk or lambs on shegoats’,
it’s well known that in the latter case the wool turns
out coarser while in the former the hair becomes finer.</p>
