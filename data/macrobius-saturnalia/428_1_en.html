<p>13. But those who think that the <span class="italic">kissybium</span> is a cup made of
ivy-wood—a <span class="italic">kission</span>, so to say—seem to rely on the authority
of Euripides, who in his <span class="italic">Andromeda</span> says (fr. 146 <span class="italic">TGrF</span>
5,1:256),</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">The whole throng of herdsmen came streaming,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">one carrying an ivy-wood cup [<span class="italic">kissinos skyphos</span>] of</span><span class="linebreak"></span>

<p>14. ‘So much for the <span class="italic">cymbium</span>. Next I should adduce
examples to prove my earlier statement that the <span class="italic">cantharus</span>
is both a kind of cup and a kind of ship.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL511_465_99" id="target_note_LCL511_465_99"><sup>99</sup></a> The word’s use to
denote a kind of cup is in fact familiar even from Virgil
himself, who very aptly attributes to Silenus (<span class="italic">E.</span> 6.17) the
cup that’s the property of father Liber; but I ought to show
that it’s also used to mean “ship,” as I promised above.</p>
<p>15. Menander, in his <span class="italic">Ship’s Captain</span> (fr. 286 Sandbach):</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">—Theophilos has arrived, leaving the Aegaean’s</span><span class="linebreak"></span>

<span class="line indent2">is here safe and sound, and his golden <span class="italic">kantharos.</span></span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">—What kind of <span class="italic">kantharos</span>? A ship?—Unhappy man,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
