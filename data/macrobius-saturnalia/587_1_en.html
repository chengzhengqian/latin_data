<p>2. ‘You think you’re making fun,’ Dysarius said, ‘and yet the
question you’ve raised is worth investigating and learning
the answer.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL512_297_139" id="target_note_LCL512_297_139"><sup>139</sup></a> Basing your joke on the trivial character of
the subject, you asked whether the hen first came from the
egg or the egg from the hen: but this should be counted
such a serious question that there ought to be quite a meticulous
discussion of it. I’ll put before you what it occurs
to me to say on both sides of the question, leaving to you
which of the two you prefer to think more correct.</p>
<p>3. ‘If we grant that all things that exist came into being
at some point, the egg will rightly be judged to have been
made first by nature. For the first stage of anything is still
incomplete and unformed and is shaped and perfected as

bird, began with a shapeless first stage and produced the
egg, which does not yet have a creaturely appearance.
From the egg there emerged the bird complete in form, as
it gradually came to be fully developed.</p>
<p>4. Further, whatever
nature has arrayed with varied adornments surely
was simple to begin with and gained in variety as elaboration
was added. Thus the egg at its creation was simple in

it has.</p>
<p>5. For just as the elements existed first and
all other objects were created from their combination, so
the germinative principles in the egg must be regarded
as—if you’ll indulge the metaphor—the elements of the
chicken.</p>
<p>6. Nor would I compare the egg with the elements
of which all things are composed without having a
