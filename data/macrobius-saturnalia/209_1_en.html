Now, if he had stopped there, he would have failed to distinguish
what was permitted from what was forbidden, but
by adding “health-giving” to “current” he made plain why
the cleansing was permitted.</p>
<p>‘The diligence worthy of a pontiff also entails using the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span>
names of sacred places with fitting precision. Let us try
to find out, then, what pontiffs properly call a “shrine”
[<span class="italic">delubrum</span>] and how Virgil used the same term.</p>
<p>2. According
to Varro, in the eighth book of his <span class="italic">Divine Antiquities</span>
(lib. 6 fr. 70) some people judge that a “shrine” includes,
besides the temple building, the open space taken over for
the gods’ use, as in the case of Jupiter Stator’s shrine in the
Circus Flaminius,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL511_27_23" id="target_note_LCL511_27_23"><sup>23</sup></a> while others take it to be the place
where a god’s image has been dedicated; to this Varro
added that just as the place where a candle is inserted is
called a “<span class="italic">candelabrum,</span>” so the places where a god [<span class="italic">dues</span>] is
located is called a “<span class="italic">delubrum.</span>”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL511_27_24a" id="target_note_LCL511_27_24a"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>3. In this formulation of
Varro’s, we can take it that he particularly endorsed the alternative
that he put last, in his customary fashion, namely
that the term “<span class="italic">delubrum</span>” is derived from the dedication of
a god’s image.</p>
<p>4. Still, Virgil carefully exploited both senses
of the term. To start from the second: he made sure that
when he was about to use the word “shrine” he inserted either
the gods’ proper names or terms used for gods, for example
(<span class="italic">A.</span> 2.225–26†),</p>

<span class="line indent2">up</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">to shrines on the city’s heights, . . .</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
