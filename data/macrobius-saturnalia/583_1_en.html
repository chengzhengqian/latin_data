I think.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL512_289_135" id="target_note_LCL512_289_135"><sup>135</sup></a> Since food that’s not dry and rough but softened
by moisture’s tempering effect must be conveyed to the
stomach, the same path must be open to both, so that food
that’s tempered by drink might be brought through the
stomach and stored away in the belly. Nature would make
no arrangement that was not healthy for the creature.</p>
<p>9. Furthermore, if some dense matter should descend into
the lung, which is solid and light, how does it reach the
place of digestion, or how can it be passed along to it, since
it’s well known that whenever by chance something a bit
denser than usual descends to the lung with a violent intake
of breath, harsh coughing and other wracking movements
soon occur, to the point of causing real distress?</p>
<p>10. If, however, there were a natural pathway drawing
drink into the lung, what would the lung suffer when gruel
is drunk down or a draft drained with an admixture of kernels
of some denser material?</p>
<p>11. That’s why nature took
the precaution of the <span class="italic">epiglottis</span>, which covers the windpipe
when food is eaten, to keep anything from falling
through it and into the lung when a breath happens to draw
it in, just as when it changes direction to cover the stomach’s
pathway when one has to speak, in order to open the
<span class="italic">artêria</span> to the voice.</p>
<p>12. We also know from experience that
those who drink slowly have moister bellies, as the moisture
that was taken in gradually remains longer; but whenever
someone drinks too greedily, the moisture passes to
the bladder as aggressively as it was ingested, and drier
food is digested slowly. This difference wouldn’t occur if
the passageways of food and drink were distinct from the
start.</p>
<p>13. As for the often-sung lyric that the poet Alcaeus
produced (fr. 347.1 L.-P.),
