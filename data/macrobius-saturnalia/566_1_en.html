sedately?’ ‘My reply can be brief,’ Dysarius said. ‘When
someone swallows food down greedily, he ingests a lot of
air with the food because his jaws are wide open and he’s
breathing rapidly: when air has filled his veins, it serves in
the place of food in producing the sort of repugnance born
of satiety.’</p>
<p>22. ‘If I’m not annoying you, Dysarius, please put up
with me as I gabble along out of an excessive desire to
learn: please tell me why we more easily hold food that’s
quite hot in our mouths than in our hands, and why if we
immediately swallow some food that’s too hot to chew any
longer, our bellies aren’t seriously burned.’</p>
<p>23. Dysarius
said, ‘The belly’s internal heat, being much greater and
more forceful, envelops in its own intensity any hot thing it
receives and weakens it. That’s why, if you put something
very hot in your mouth, it’s better not to open your jaws
wide as some people do—so you don’t make the hot thing
hotter with a fresh breath of air—but to briefly close your
lips, so that greater heat can come to the mouth even from
the belly and overwhelm the lesser heat. The hand, by contrast,
has no heat of its own that enables it to carry a hot
object.’</p>
<p>24. ‘I’ve long been eager to know,’ Avienus said, ‘why
water that’s filled with chunks of snow and is made as cold
as snow is less harmful to drink than water from melted
snow—for we know how many kinds of serious harm come
from drinking snow melt.’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL512_255_99" id="target_note_LCL512_255_99"><sup>99</sup></a></p>
<p>25. Dysarius said, ‘I’ll add a
further point to your question: even if water from melted
snow is heated over a fire and drunk hot, it’s no less harmful
than if it’s drunk cold. Water from snow, then, is dangerous
