“almond”; but it’s called the “nut of Thasos” too. Cloatius provides
evidence in Book 4 of his <span class="italic">Things Greek Arranged in
Alphabetical Order</span>, when he says (fr. 8 <span class="italic">GRF</span> 1:471), “The
 Greek nut is the almond”;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL511_135_160" id="target_note_LCL511_135_160"><sup>160</sup></a> moreover, in his play <span class="italic">Entreaty</span>
Atta says (15–16 <span class="italic">SRPF<sup>3</sup></span> 2:191),</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">add as much Thasian nut and honeycomb as you’d</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent3">like.</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p>9. ‘Though the winter begrudges our enjoying the
<span class="italic">mollusca</span>, still—since we’re talking about nuts—we’ll not
let it go without comment. In his play <span class="italic">The Slipper</span> Plautus<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">9</span><span class="br"></span>
mentions it (fr. 47 Goetz):</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line indent7">He said the <span class="italic">mollusca</span></span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">hangs over his roof tiles.</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p>10. Here, you see, Plautus mentions it but doesn’t give
a clear idea what a <span class="italic">mollusca</span> is. It is, however, the sort of
nut commonly called “Persian,” the name <span class="italic">mollusca</span> plainly
coming from the fact that its shell is softer [<span class="italic">mollior</span>] than
that of all other nuts.</p>
<p>11. Sueius, far and away the most
learned sort of fellow, provides suitable support for this
view in his pastoral poem titled <span class="italic">Herbed Cheese Spread,</span>
where he describes the gardener making this dish, saying
that he adds in this fruit along with the other ingredients
(fr. 1 <span class="italic">FPL<sup>3</sup></span>):</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">12. Now he mixes in . . . in part,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">in part Persian, so called because</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">the soldiers who once fought fierce battles</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">with the mighty king named Alexander the Great</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">during his war with Persia planted this sort of tree</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">in the exalted land of the Greeks after their return,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
