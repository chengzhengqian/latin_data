was no secret: indeed, his colleague Domitius upbraided
him for it in the senate, as though it were an ugly crime.
Nor was Crassus ashamed to admit it—far from it, the censor
actually boasted of it—if the gods be pleased!—and
took credit for acting with affectionate devotion.</p>
<p>6. As for
the fishponds of the most noble leading men—I mean
Lucullus, Philippus, and Hortensius, the ones Cicero calls
“fishpond-fanciers” (<span class="italic">Letters to Atticus</span> 1.19.6, 1.20.3)—how
stuffed they were with the most expensive fish is suggested
by the fact that, as Marcus Varro reports in his third
book on agriculture (3.2.17), when Marcus Cato (the one
who later died at Utica) was left as Lucullus’ heir by his
will, he sold the fish from the pond for 40,000 sesterces.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL511_107_131" id="target_note_LCL511_107_131"><sup>131</sup></a></p>

Latin) because as they swim along the surface they get
warmed by the sun and lose the capacity to flex and dive,
and so they become an easy catch.</p>
<p>8. It would be a long job,
should I want to list all the great authorities that have made
the morays from the strait of Sicily famous—but let me just
tell what Marcus Varro said in his book titled <span class="italic">Gallus on
Marvels (Logist</span>. fr. 55): “In Sicily too,” he says, “Papirius
[reports] that the floater morays are caught by hand, because
their girth makes them float on the surface.”</p>
<p>9. ‘So Varro. But who would deny that these people displayed
the most untamed and, as Caecilius puts it (283
