said (fr. 81) that not only sheep are called “two-toothed”
but all sacrificial victims that are two years old—yet he
didn’t say why they are so called.</p>
<p>6. But in commentaries
relating to pontifical law I read (fr. 2 <span class="italic">IAH</span> 2.2:566) that
they were first called <span class="italic">bidennes</span> [“two-year”], with a <span class="italic">d</span> inserted,
as often: thus we say <span class="italic">redire</span> not <span class="italic">reire</span> [“to go back”],
<span class="italic">redamare</span> not <span class="italic">reamare</span> [“to love in return”], and <span class="italic">redarguere</span>
not <span class="italic">rearguere</span> [“to refute”]. The letter <span class="italic">d</span> is commonly
inserted to take care of the gap between two vowels.</p>
<p>7. <span class="italic">bidennes</span>, then, was first used to convey the idea of
<span class="italic">biennes</span> and then from long usage the word was corrupted
from <span class="italic">bidennes</span> [“two-year”] to <span class="italic">bidentes</span> [“two-toothed”].
Still, Hyginus, who was not ignorant of pontifical law,
wrote in Book 5 of his work on Virgil (fr. 3 <span class="italic">GRF</span> 1:528) that
victims are called “two-toothed” because they are of an age
to have two teeth more prominent than the rest, which
show that they have passed from a younger to a more mature
stage in life.’</p>

Avienus asked why Virgil assigned the function of the
horse [<span class="italic">equus</span>] to the horseman [<span class="italic">eques</span>]:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL512_137_78" id="target_note_LCL512_137_78"><sup>78</sup></a> ‘For bounding
