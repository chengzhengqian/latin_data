<p>7. Therefore, just as they did not hesitate
to drive away any consecrated animal that could not
be conveyed directly to the gods, so they wanted consecrated
souls, which they judged could be conveyed directly
to heaven, to be separated from the body and make the
journey at the first possible moment.</p>

though his phrase, backed by great learning, was “with the
