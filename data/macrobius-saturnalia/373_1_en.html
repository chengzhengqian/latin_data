<p class="noindent">For what our poet conveyed by the phrase “from behind
the ship” your poet uses the phrase “rising from astern,”
handsomely enough: but the several apt epithets that our
poet applied to the breeze come off better.</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">17. He dines upon the poor men’s guts and black</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">blood.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">I saw it with my own eyes, as his great hand caught</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">up</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">the bodies of two<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL511_355_42" id="target_note_LCL511_355_42"><sup>42</sup></a> of our crew and dashed them</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">against the rock</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">as he lay on his back in the cave. . . . (<span class="italic">A.</span> 3.622–25)</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">But springing up he quickly snatched at my</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">companions,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">grabbing two at once, and dashed them against the</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">ground</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">like puppies: their brains spilled to the floor and wet</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">the earth.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Butchering them limb by limb, he prepared them for</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">his supper,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">then ate them like a lion raised in the mountain—</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">innards,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">flesh, and bones full of marrow—leaving nothing.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">We wept and raise our hands in prayer to Zeus. (<span class="italic">Od</span>.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">9.288–94)</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">Maro made his narrative bare and brief, whereas Homer
added a touch of emotion and balanced the grief of the
narrative with the righteous indignation that the cruelty
inspires.</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">18. Here too I saw Otus and Ephialtes, monstrous,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">hulking, who with their own hands tried to tear</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
