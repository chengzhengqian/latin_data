nothing warm to an inactive stomach, lest it become still
more inactive, they don’t forbid the drinking of wine, turning
weakness into strength by this application.</p>
<p>5. ‘I’ll give a piece of evidence that warmth is a contingent,
not an essential, trait of wine. If someone unknowingly
drinks aconite,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL512_205_51" id="target_note_LCL512_205_51"><sup>51</sup></a> I acknowledge that he is usually
cured by drinking wine unmixed with water: that’s because
when the wine has been instilled in the internal organs, it
takes on their warmth and, once rendered warm itself,
counteracts the cold poison. But if aconite is administered
by being dissolved in wine and drunk, no remedy can save
the drinker from death.</p>
<p>6. For in that case wine, being cool
by nature, increases the poison’s chill by being mixed with
it, since it doesn’t reach the internal organs in an independent
state but mixed with the other, or rather turned into
that other.</p>
<p>7. But they even force wine on people worn out
from excessive sweating or loose bowels, so that in both
cases it might bind up the passageways. When someone
cannot sleep, physicians treat him with cool substances,
now poppy juice, now mandrake or the like, including
wine:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL512_205_52" id="target_note_LCL512_205_52"><sup>52</sup></a> wine usually restores sleep, which can only be evidence
of its innate coolness.</p>
<p>8. Furthermore, all naturally
warm substances stir sexual desire, stimulate production
of seed, and promote procreation, yet when they’ve drunk
a very great deal of unmixed wine men become less eager
for intercourse and also do not sow seed suitable for conception,
for the excess wine, being a cool substance, makes
the seed thin and weak.</p>
<p>9. But here’s the thing that offers
most obvious confirmation of my assessment: all the things
that happen to people who are too cool also happen to people
