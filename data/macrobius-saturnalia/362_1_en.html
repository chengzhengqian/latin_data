<p>24. The Greek lines mention a bronze cauldron bubbling
over a large fire, and the whole passage gains in adornment
from the phrase “bubbling all around,” which subtly conveys
the bubbles that leap up from every direction.</p>
<p>25. The
Latin lines describe the whole sequence of events, the
sound of the flame and, in place of Homer’s “bubbling all
around,” there’s “the liquid leaping as it boils and “a smoking
stream bubbling high with foam” and “raging within”:
unable to find a single word that had a comparable worth,
he made up for the lack with a suite of different descriptions.
Then he capped it by saying “no longer can the water
contain itself,” conveying what always happens in fact
when too hot a fire has been built. Poetry in the grand style
is nicely elaborated here by inclusion of all the things that
happen in this sort of scene.</p>
