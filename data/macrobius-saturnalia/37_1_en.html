(fr. 6 <span class="italic">HRR</span> 2:73 = fr. 17 <span class="italic">GRF</span> 1:535)—held this land together
with Cameses, another native, in a power-sharing
arrangement whereby the region was called Camesene,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_75_93" id="target_note_LCL510_75_93"><sup>93</sup></a>
the settlement Janiculum.</p>
<p>20. This arrangement was later
reduced to the sole rule of Janus, who is held to have had
two faces, so that he could see what was in front of him and
what was behind<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_75_94" id="target_note_LCL510_75_94"><sup>94</sup></a>—something surely to be explained with
reference to the shrewdness and cleverness appropriate to
a king, who ought to know the past and foresee the future:
compare Antevorta and Postvorta, whom the Romans worship
as very fitting companions of divination.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_75_95" id="target_note_LCL510_75_95"><sup>95</sup></a></p>
<p>21. When
Saturn arrived by ship, he was received hospitably by Janus
and taught him agriculture; and when Janus improved his
way of life, which had been wild and uncouth before the
fruits of the earth were discovered, he rewarded Saturn by
making him a partner in his rule.</p>
<p>22. When Janus became
the first to coin money, he maintained his respect for Saturn
in this too: because Saturn had arrived by ship, he had
the likeness of his own head stamped on one side of the
coin, a ship on the other, to preserve the memory of Saturn
for posterity.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_75_96" id="target_note_LCL510_75_96"><sup>96</sup></a> We know that the bronze was stamped that
way from the gambling game in which boys throw denarii
high in the air and shout “heads” or “ships,” bearing
witness to antiquity thereby.</p>
<p>23. We know that Janus and
Saturn ruled together in harmony and collaborated in
founding neighboring settlements from Maro, who reports
