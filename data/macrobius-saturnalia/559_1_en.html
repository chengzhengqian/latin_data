by its coolness.</p>
<p>9. That is why this more burdened time of
life is also afflicted with insomnia: sleep, which is chiefly
the result of humor, depends on natural humor, of the sort
that’s generously present in infancy, which abounds in humor
that’s natural, not superfluous.</p>
<p>10. The same principle
prevents graying in childhood, even though it’s a very
moist time of life: it is not moist with the phlegm that cold
produces but is nourished by a natural and life-giving humor.
The humor that either arises from the coldness of old
age or is contracted from some chance defect is superfluous
and so also harmful.</p>
<p>11. ‘We see this humor endangering women’s extremities,
if it is not purged frequently,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL512_241_87" id="target_note_LCL512_241_87"><sup>87</sup></a> we see it weakening
eunuch’s lower legs, where the bones lack their natural
strength from being constantly bathed in excess humor
and so are easily twisted: they cannot bear the burden of
the body they prop up, like a reed that bends under a
weight set upon it.’</p>
<p>12. Eusebius said, ‘Since discussion of
excess humor has taken us from old age all the way to eunuchs,
please explain why their voices are so high-pitched
that you often cannot know whether a woman or a eunuch
is speaking unless you take a look.’</p>
<p>13. Dysarius answered
that an abundance of excess humor caused that condition
too: ‘It thickens the <span class="italic">artêria</span> [= windpipe] through which
the sound of the voice rises, making the voice’s passageway
narrow: that’s why high-pitched voices belong to women or
eunuchs, deep voices to men, whose voice passes through
a passageway that is unencumbered and entirely open.</p>
<p>14. That an equal coolness produces an almost equal abundance
of misplaced humor in eunuchs and women is apparent
from this point too: both often become plump, and
both surely have breasts that are enlarged in almost similar
ways.’</p>
