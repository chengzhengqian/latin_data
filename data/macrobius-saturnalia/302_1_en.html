ref. to the speech’s conclusion (<span class="italic">peroration</span>), where rousing the audience’s
pity or indignation (etc.) was thought especially apt, and
the subject therefore typically occupied the final position in analyses
of a standard speech’s parts: thus it stands at the end of Book 1
in Cicero’s <span class="italic">On Invention</span> and at the end of Book 2 in the anonymous
treatise <span class="italic">Rhetoric for Herennius.</span> That it is the only topic
treated in the surviving part of Book 4 might suggest that that part
is in fact the last part of the speaker’s treatment of his subject: this
would confirm Marinone’s argument (1977, 72) that there is no
lacuna between Books 4 and 5 (<span class="italic">pace</span> Arnoldus Vesaliensis [ed.
Colon. 1521], followed by Jan, Eyssenhardt, and Willis) and that
the speaker must be Eusebius (cf. 5.1.1).</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL511_213_35').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
