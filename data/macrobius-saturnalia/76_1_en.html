goddess in charge of vital organs.</p>
<p>33. The goddess receives
an offering of bean porridge and bacon,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_153_269" id="target_note_LCL510_153_269"><sup>269</sup></a> which are especially
conducive to bodily strength. The Kalends of June is
also called the “bean Kalends,” because in this month ripe
beans are used in sacrifice.</p>
<p>34. ‘Then follows July: in Romulus’ system, where
March came first, this month was called Quintilis from its
numerical position,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_153_270" id="target_note_LCL510_153_270"><sup>270</sup></a> and it still kept that name even after
Numa put January and February at the start of the year,
though it then appeared seventh, not fifth. Later on, under
a law carried by Mark Antony, the son of Marcus, as consul,
it was named July in honor of Julius Caesar, because he was
born on the fourth day of Quintilis.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_153_271" id="target_note_LCL510_153_271"><sup>271</sup></a></p>
<p>35. Next, August is
the month that was previously called Sextilis, before it was
granted as an honor to Augustus, by a decree of the senate
that I’ve quoted here (SC 42 <span class="italic">FIRA</span><sup>2</sup> 1:280–81):</p>
<blockquote><p>Whereas in the month of Sextilis Commander
Caesar Augustus both entered his first consulship
[43 <span class="sc">bce</span>] and brought three triumphal processions
into the city [29 <span class="sc">bce</span>], and legions led down from
the Janiculum followed his auspices and tutelage
[43 <span class="sc">bce</span>];<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_153_272a" id="target_note_LCL510_153_272a"><sup>272</sup></a> and whereas in this month Egypt was
brought under the power of the Roman people [30
<span class="sc">bce</span>]; and whereas in this month the civil wars were
ended;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_153_273" id="target_note_LCL510_153_273"><sup>273</sup></a> and whereas for these reasons this month
is and has been the most fortunate for this realm;
it is the senate’s will that this month be called
“August.”</p></blockquote>
