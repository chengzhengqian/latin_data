<p>4. And so Augustus deluded himself with the
thought that his daughter’s high spirits gave the appearance
of license but were innocent in fact, and he dared to
believe that Claudia of old had been just like that:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_363_74" id="target_note_LCL510_363_74"><sup>74</sup></a> he told

she changed her style of dress and, trying to look serious,
gave her pleased father a hug. Though he had been able to
conceal his unhappiness the day before, he couldn’t conceal
his joy now, and said, “Isn’t this style of dress so much

please my husband” (<span class="italic">dicta</span> 64 Malc.).</p>

became notorious too. At a set of gladiatorial contests
the very different entourages of Livia and Julia caught the
people’s attention, with men of weight and standing gathered
around Livia, while Julia was surrounded by a gaggle
of youths of decidedly dandified appearance. Her father
slipped her a note pointing out the difference between the
two first ladies—to which she nicely wrote back, “These
young men will grow old with me, too.”</p>
