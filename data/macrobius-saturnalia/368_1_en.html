<p>‘And since Virgil himself need not blush to acknowledge<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">13</span><span class="br"></span>
Homer as his superior, let me tell you of the passages
where he seems to me less robust than his model.</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">2. Then as he begged in vain and made ready to say</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">still more,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Aeneas lopped his head to the ground and left just his</span><span class="linebreak"></span>

<span class="line">breath, their heads nodding above him as they flew.</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">But that poet of yours has (G. 3.111):</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">. . . grow damp from the pursuers’ panting spittle.</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
