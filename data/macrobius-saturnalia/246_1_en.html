doing a dance with castanets that it would disgrace a

<p>8. You see how it grieved Africanus to have seen the son of
an office-seeker dancing with castanets—a candidate for
election, that is, whose hopes and plans for winning a magistracy
could not restrain him from doing something that

fancy, now and then declaims Greek poetry, tells jokes,
talks in different voices, strikes poses.”</p>
<p>10. So says Cato,
who (as you see) thought even singing was not the mark of
a serious person, though others were so far from judging it
disgraceful that Lucius Sulla, a man of very great reputation,
is said to have been an excellent singer.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL511_101_118" id="target_note_LCL511_101_118"><sup>118</sup></a></p>
