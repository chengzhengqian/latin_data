<p>4. That seems to be the form of expression in the case you
pointed to: “he himself with the <span class="italic">lituus</span> of Quirinus,” that is,
holding the <span class="italic">lituus</span> of Quirinus. And it would not be at all
strange for it to have been put that way, “There was Picus
with the <span class="italic">lituus</span> of Quirinus,” just as we say, “There was a
statue with a large head.” “Is” and “was” and “has been” are
usually omitted, with a delicacy that does not detract from
the thought being communicated.</p>
<p>5. ‘But since the <span class="italic">lituus</span> has come up, I should not let a
possible line of inquiry go by: whether the augur’s <span class="italic">lituus</span> is
so called from the battle-horn of the same name or the
battle-horn is called a <span class="italic">lituus</span> after the augur’s staff—for
both have the same shape, and both are curved at the head.</p>
<p>6. But if, as some suppose, the battle-horn was called a
<span class="italic">lituus</span> because of its sound, after this line of Homer
(<span class="italic">Il</span>. 4.125),</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">the bow twanged,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL512_125_64" id="target_note_LCL512_125_64"><sup>64</sup></a></span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">then the augur’s staff must be called the <span class="italic">lituus</span> from its resemblance
to the horn. Furthermore, Virgil uses that word
for the horn, too, as in this case (<span class="italic">A</span>. 6.167):</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">he was going to face battle distinguished by both his</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line"><span class="italic">lituus</span> and his spear.’</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
