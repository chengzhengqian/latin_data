arrows—and Augustus thought it only fair to find himself
in the same position, vis-à-vis Pylades, as the Roman people
had been.</p>
<p>18. Since Pylades was said to have changed
the old style of dancing that had had its heyday with our ancestors
and to have introduced a new and charming style,
he was asked by Augustus what contribution he had made
to dance and answered (<span class="italic">Il</span>. 10.13):</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">the sound of pipes and flutes and the din of men.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_379_93" id="target_note_LCL510_379_93"><sup>93</sup></a></span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p>19. When his competition with Hylas provoked a riot, he
replied to Augustus’ outrage with the comment: “You’re
being ungrateful indeed, your highness: let them be distracted
by us.”’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_379_94" id="target_note_LCL510_379_94"><sup>94</sup></a></p>
<p>Delighted by these remarks the company set about<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">8</span><span class="br"></span>
praising Avienus’ powers of memory and pleasing wit, as a
slave brought in dessert.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_379_95" id="target_note_LCL510_379_95"><sup>95</sup></a></p>
<p>2. Flavianus said, ‘I imagine
many people disagree with Varro, who banned cakes from
dessert in that wonderfully captivating Menippean satire
of his called <span class="italic">You Know Not What the Evening Will Bring</span>
(fr. 333 Cèbe): but Caecina, your memory’s better—please
give us the exact quotation.’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_379_96" id="target_note_LCL510_379_96"><sup>96</sup></a></p>
<p>3. Caecina Albinus replied,
‘The passage in Varro that you want me to relate goes very
much like this (fr. 341 Cèbe): “Those treats are sweetest
that have not been sweetened: for sweets don’t reliably
make common cause with good digestion.” “Treats”
is the term our ancestors used to denote every sort of
dessert—what the Greeks called “cakes” [<span class="italic">pemmata</span>] or
“sweetmeats” [<span class="italic">tragêmata</span>]; you can also find this label applied
to the sweeter varieties of wine in the older comedies,
where they’re called “Liber’s treats.”’</p>
