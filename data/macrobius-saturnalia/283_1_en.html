<p>‘In Virgil emotion often depends on an action’s cause:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL511_175_15" id="target_note_LCL511_175_15"><sup>15</sup></a><span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span>
in fact, it’s the cause that for the most part makes a state of
affairs appear either cruel or pitiable, as in Cicero’s attack
on Verres (2.5.119), from whom the parents of those he
had killed in prison asked leave to bury the dead: the
source of resentment wasn’t so much his being asked or his
attempt to extort money but the reason underlying their
request and his attempt.</p>
<p>2. Demosthenes, too, in complaining
that Midias had cheated a certain person, uses the
reason for his cheating to increase people’s indignation at
the deed (21.83ff.): “He cheated a judge,” he says, “who
had honestly decided a case involving the two of us.”</p>
<p>3. Virgil
too, then, often derived emotion from this source in a
first-rate fashion. “Galaesus” he says, “is killed in battle”—not
an event worthy of pity per se in a time of war, but then
he added the cause (<span class="italic">A.</span> 7.536):</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">while coming between the two sides in the interest of</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">peace.</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p>4. So too elsewhere (<span class="italic">A.</span> 10.781):
<q><span class="line">He is laid low, unhappy man, . . .</span><span class="linebreak"></span></q>
then he adds the pitiable reason
<q><span class="line">. . . by a wound meant for another,</span><span class="linebreak"></span></q>
that is, since the spear had had another man as its target.</p>
<p>5. And when he wants to convey that Palamedes was slain
unworthily (<span class="italic">A.</span> 2.83–85*†):</p>
