<p>53. Natural science
shows that the story is to be understood in the following
terms. After the time of chaos, when the formless confusion
began to take on the visible shapes of things and their
elements, and the earth, still moist, tottered on a shaky
foundation of labile material, as the heaven’s warmth
gained strength and showered down fiery seeds upon the
earth these two stars are believed to have been produced:
the sun—carried up into the highest regions because its
heat was greatest—and the moon—keeping to the lower
regions, held in check by the moister kind of warmth that
is natural to the female sex<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_237_448" id="target_note_LCL510_237_448"><sup>448</sup></a>—as though the one were
composed of a father’s elements, the other of a mother’s.</p>
<p>54. Now the physical scientists want Latona to be seen as
the earth, long hindered by Juno, who wished to prevent
the divinities I’ve mentioned from being born: that is, the
air,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_237_449" id="target_note_LCL510_237_449"><sup>449</sup></a> which was then still moist and heavy, was blocking
up the heavens and preventing the lights’ brilliance from
shining forth (as though in the natural sequence of birth)
through the thick, moist air.</p>
<p>55. But the ineluctable force
of divine providence, which is believed to have aided the
birth, carried the day: hence on the island of Delos (to lend
credibility to the tale) a temple of Providence, which they
call the shrine of Athena <span class="italic">Pronoia</span> [“of foreknowledge”],<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_237_450" id="target_note_LCL510_237_450"><sup>450</sup></a>
is tended with appropriate ceremony.</p>
<p>56. Apollo and Diana
are said to have been born on an island because they
seem to us to rise up out of the sea;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_237_451" id="target_note_LCL510_237_451"><sup>451</sup></a> the island is called
