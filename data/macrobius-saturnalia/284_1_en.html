<blockquote><p><span class="line indent2">. . . treacherously betrayed, innocent, the victim</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">of an unspeakable informer, he was sent down to</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">death by the Pelasgi</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">because he urged against the war.</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p>6. Aeneas, too, did well to state the reason for his fear in
giving a sense of its magnitude (<span class="italic">A.</span> 2.729):</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">and fearing alike for my companion [sc. Ascanius]</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">and my burden [sc. Anchises].</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p>7. Consider Iapyx:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL511_177_16" id="target_note_LCL511_177_16"><sup>16</sup></a> what reason is given for his rejecting
all other skills and living “without glory” (<span class="italic">A.</span> 12.397), as the
poet says? (<span class="italic">A.</span> 12.395)</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">. . . that he might carry on the destiny of his father,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">now laid to rest.</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p>8. This is the same sort of thing (<span class="italic">A.</span> 10.812):</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">Led astray by filial devotion, you’ve dropped your</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">guard,</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">and that was the reason even his enemies found Lausus
worthy of pity.</p>
<p>9. But when Aeneas urges that the dead be
buried, what reason does he give? (<span class="italic">A.</span> 11.24–25†)</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line indent6">. . . with their own blood</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">they have created this homeland for us.</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p>10. ‘Just resentment, too, is sometimes conveyed by
reference to its cause, as in this case (<span class="italic">G.</span> 3.226–27):</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">groaning deeply at the disgrace, at the blows the</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">Haughty</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">victor dealt, and at the lovers he has lost, unavenged.</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
