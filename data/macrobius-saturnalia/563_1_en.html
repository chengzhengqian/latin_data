honey: in the former, then, it sinks of its own weight and
falls to the bottom, but in honey it’s forced upward, dislodged
from its place because it is lighter.’</p>
<p>9. ‘Since questions similar to what’s been said are occurring
to me, Dysarius, why is it that honey and wine are
considered best at very different ages, honey when it’s very
fresh, wine when it’s very old?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL512_249_92" id="target_note_LCL512_249_92"><sup>92</sup></a> For that’s the source of the
proverb that gourmands employ: to strike the right balance
in your honeyed wine, you should mix new honey
from Hymettus with an old Falernian wine.’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL512_249_93" id="target_note_LCL512_249_93"><sup>93</sup></a></p>
<p>10. ‘The reason,’
Dysarius said, ‘is that they are opposite in character:
wine is essentially moist, honey dry. If you doubt what I’m
saying, consider the effect of medicine: parts of the body
that need to be moistened are bathed with wine, those that
need to be dried are wiped down with honey. As the passage
of time draws off something from both, wine becomes
more concentrated, honey becomes drier: honey loses its
juice, wine its water.’</p>
<p>11. ‘The next question I’m going to ask is not unlike the
others:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL512_249_94" id="target_note_LCL512_249_94"><sup>94</sup></a> if you keep containers of wine and olive oil half
full for a while, why does the wine almost always turn sour
while the oil, by contrast, takes on a more pleasant flavor?’</p>
<p>12. ‘Correct on both counts,’ Dysarius said. ‘Air from the
outside enters the empty space above the level of the
liquid, drawing off and absorbing all the finest particles of
moisture. This drying effect in a sense strips wine of its
strength, causing it to be more harshly sour or more astringently
dry, according to whether it was naturally weak or
robust.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL512_249_95" id="target_note_LCL512_249_95"><sup>95</sup></a> In the case of oil, by contrast, the drying of the excess
moisture has the effect of clearing out the mustiness
that was lurking in it, giving the oil a new, pleasant flavor.’</p>
