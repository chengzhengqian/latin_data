not just because it is very cold but for another reason,
which I’ll reveal relying on the authority of Aristotle,
who posed it in his <span class="italic">Inquiries in Physics</span> and presented his
solution, if I’m not mistaken, in these terms:</p>
<p>26. “All water,”
he says,</p>
<blockquote><p>contains a certain amount of very rarefied air that
makes it healthy, but it also contains earthy impurities
that give it body, though less body than the
earth. When it is compacted by cold air and frigid
weather, then, and congeals, the very rarefied air is
inevitably expelled, as it were, by evaporation, and
with that air’s departure it freezes solid, left with
only its earthy nature. This is apparent from the fact
that when the same water is melted by the sun’s
heat, less of it is left than there was before it froze,
while it lacks the only healthy element in the water,
which the evaporation removed.</p></blockquote>
<p>27. Snow, which is merely water that has condensed in the
atmosphere, loses its rarefied element by being condensed
and therefore plants in our innards the seeds of a wide
range of diseases when it is melted and drunk.’</p>
<p>28. ‘Mention of frigid weather reminded me of an old
question that used to exercise me:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL512_257_100" id="target_note_LCL512_257_100"><sup>100</sup></a> why do wines never or
rarely freeze, though most all other liquids usually are
made to congeal by excessive cold? Is it because wine contains
some germs of heat—leading Homer to speak of
“gleaming wine” (<span class="italic">Il</span>. 1.462 <span class="italic">et al</span>.) for that reason, not (as
some suppose) because of its color<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL512_257_101a" id="target_note_LCL512_257_101a"><sup>101</sup></a>—or is there some
