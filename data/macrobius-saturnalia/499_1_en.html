“one whom none could love” through the removal of love.</p>
<p>16. Here is the second way the epithet <span class="italic">inlaudatus</span> can be
defended. In archaic Latin the verb <span class="italic">laudare</span> [“to praise”]
meant “to name and address”: thus in civil trials the person
posting a surety is said <span class="italic">laudari</span>, that is, to be named. Someone
who is <span class="italic">inlaudatus</span>, then, is as it were one who cannot
<span class="italic">laudari</span>, that is, one who is never to be named, just as the
joint council of Asia once decreed that no one was ever to
speak the name of the man who had burned the temple of
Diana at Ephesus.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL512_121_61" id="target_note_LCL512_121_61"><sup>61</sup></a></p>
<p>17. ‘The third of the criticisms remains, that fact that he
spoke of a “tunic caked with gold.” But the phrase conveys
the quantity and thickness of the gold that was woven into
the tunic, giving the impression of fish-scales: the verb
“to be caked” [<span class="italic">squalere</span>] is derived from the density and
roughness of the scales [<span class="italic">squamae</span>] seen on the skins of
snakes and fish.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL512_121_62" id="target_note_LCL512_121_62"><sup>62</sup></a></p>
<p>18. Other authors demonstrate this fact,
as does Virgil himself in several passages: “[the horse] was
covered,” he says (<span class="italic">A</span>. 11.770–71),</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">by a caparison of bronze</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">scales stitched with gold in a feather pattern,</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">and in another passage (<span class="italic">A.</span> 11.487–88),</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">already dressed now in his cuirass, glowing warmly,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">he bristled</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">with brazen scales.</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">Accius in <span class="italic">Pelopides</span> writes (517–8 <span class="italic">SRPF<sup>3</sup></span> 1:235):M</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">The serpent’s scales were edged with caked gold and</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">purple.</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
