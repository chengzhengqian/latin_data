superior to the ancients or should be compared with them,
but I’ve responded to Horus’ scolding<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL511_97_110" id="target_note_LCL511_97_110"><sup>110</sup></a> by just stating the
facts: people were keener on luxuries in those days than

<p>Rufius Albinus, as expert in antiquity as Caecina, interposed:<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">14</span><span class="br"></span>
‘I’m surprised, Albinus,’ he said, ‘that you haven’t
told us how extravagant a variety of seafood people used to
take pains to acquire: by discussing that you could have
made the point about the singular restraint of our festivities.’
‘Please,’ replied Caecina, ‘tell us what your reading
has supplied on this topic: there’s no one with a better-stocked

to reproach us—do you recall seeing a dancer, male or
female, in anyone’s dining hall nowadays? But in those
days even respectable people tried to outdo one another in
dancing. For just consider—to start from the period when
