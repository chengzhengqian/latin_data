so; and Trebatius, in Book 1 of his <span class="italic">Religious Observances</span>
(fr. 4 <span class="italic">IAH</span> 1:405 = fr. 2 <span class="italic">IAR</span><sup>6</sup>), says that on a market day
a magistrate can free a slave and award judgments.</p>
<p>29. Against this, however, Julius Caesar, in Book 16 of his
<span class="italic">Auspices</span>, says (fr. 1 <span class="italic">IAR</span><sup>6</sup>) that on a market day a non-voting
assembly of the people (<span class="italic">contio</span>) cannot be called—that
is, a matter cannot be brought before them—and so a voting
assembly cannot be held on a market day.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_201_377" id="target_note_LCL510_201_377"><sup>377</sup></a> Cornelius
Labeo, too, in Book 1 of his <span class="italic">Calendar</span> asserts (fr. 1 Mast.)
that a market day is a religious festival [<span class="italic">feriae</span>].</p>
<p>30. An attentive
reader will find the reason for these divergent opinions
in Granius Licinianus’ second book:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_201_378" id="target_note_LCL510_201_378"><sup>378</sup></a> there he says
that a market day is a festival of Jupiter, since it is the custom
for the wife of the flamen<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_201_379" id="target_note_LCL510_201_379"><sup>379</sup></a> to sacrifice a ram to Jupiter
in the Regia on every market day, but that by the
Hortensian law [287 <span class="sc">bce</span>] they were made days of legal
business [<span class="italic">fastus</span>], so that the peasants who came to market
in the city could settle their lawsuits; for on a day not suited
to legal business [<span class="italic">nefastus</span>], the praetor could not utter the
formula of judgment.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_201_380" id="target_note_LCL510_201_380"><sup>380</sup></a></p>
<p>31. So those who say that a market
day is a religious day have ancient practice on their side to
save them from a charge of falsehood, while those who
take the opposite view render a true judgment in the view
of the generations that came after that law.</p>
<p>32. ‘Now, some credit Romulus with instituting the
market days, claiming that when he shared his reign with
Titus Tatius and established sacrifices and religious associations,
he added the market day too: Tuditanus gives this
sort of account (fr. 3).</p>
<p>33. But Cassius says (fr. 17) that
Servius Tullius created market days so that people intending
to set both their urban and their rural interests in order
would gather in the city from the countryside. Geminus
