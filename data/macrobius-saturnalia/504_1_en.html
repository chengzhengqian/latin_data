<p>15. Servius replied: ‘There are very many words we
commonly use whose true and proper meanings we do not
clearly apprehend: <span class="italic">vestibulum</span> is one of them, a word we
encounter everywhere in conversation, yet not clearly considered
by all who use it casually, under the impression
that the <span class="italic">vestibulum</span> is the first part of the house, which they
call the atrium.</p>
<p>16. But Caecilius Gallus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL512_131_70" id="target_note_LCL512_131_70"><sup>70</sup></a> a very learned
man, in Book 2 of <span class="italic">On the Meaning of Words Relevant to

part of it but is an empty space in front of the house door

<p>18. Like some other particles, <span class="italic">ve</span> sometime conveys an
increase in emphasis, sometimes a decrease: thus in the
case of <span class="italic">vetus</span> [“aged”] and <span class="italic">vehemens</span> [“forceful, violent”],
the former is a compound conveying great age [<span class="italic">ve</span> + <span class="italic">aetas</span>]
from which a syllable has dropped out, while the other is
formed to denote thought [<span class="italic">ve</span> + <span class="italic">mens</span>] that is too aggressive
