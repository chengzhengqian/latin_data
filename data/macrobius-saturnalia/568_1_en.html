other reason? Since I’m ignorant of the reason, I want to
know.’</p>
<p>29. In response Dysarius said, ‘Granted that wines are
fortified by their essential warmth: is olive oil of a less fiery
nature, or is it less capable of warming our bodies? And yet
it congeals in frigid weather. Surely, if you suppose that
things that are innately warmer freeze less readily, it would
be consistent for olive oil not to harden and for things that
are innately colder to freeze readily in frigid weather—yet
vinegar, the foremost coolant among liquids, never congeals
in frigid weather.</p>
<p>30. Is it the case, then, that oil
congeals more quickly because it is both smoother and
thicker? Fluids that are smoother and denser seem to congeal
more readily, but wine doesn’t have that syrupy quality
and is much more fluid than oil, while vinegar is the
most fluid of all liquids and is so much harsher that its sour
quality makes it distressing; and there’s the example of sea
water, which is also harsh because of its bitterness and
never freezes in frigid weather.</p>
<p>31. As for the fact that the
historian Herodotus wrote—against the virtually unanimous
opinion of those who have looked into these matters—that
the Bosporus (which he also calls the Cimmerian
Sea) and all the seas in the region called Scythia freeze
in frigid weather and come to a standstill (4.28), that is
contrary to what is generally thought.</p>
<p>32. Sea water doesn’t
freeze; however, because there are very many rivers and
marshes in those regions that flow into the sea, the fresh
water floats on the sea’s surface and congeals, and though
the seawater is unaffected, there seems to be ice in the sea,
though it’s really formed from the inflowing water.</p>
<p>33. We
see this happen in the Black Sea too: some chunks and, so
to speak, slabs of ice are borne along, solidified out of a
