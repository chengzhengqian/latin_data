<p>23. Lucretius in Book 5, where he talks about the chaotic
condition of the world before its present state (432–39):</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">At that time neither the wheel of the sun could be</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">seen, flying high,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">its light blazing, nor the stars of the great firmament</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">nor the sea nor the sky, neither the earth nor the air,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">nor did a single thing appear as it does to us now,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>

<span class="line">From that point segments of space began to separate</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">and like things began to be joined with like, shutting</span><span class="linebreak"></span>

<span class="line">defining the component parts, and arranging the</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">massive segments.</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>

<span class="line">and the sea on its own, so that it lies open, its waters</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">set apart</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">and on their own, too, the unmixed and well defined</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">fires of the ether.</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">and further on (455–56):</p>
