<p>20. I’ll spend the whole
day and more, should I want to give a thorough account of

<p>While Servius was holding forth, Praetextatus noticed<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">7</span><span class="br"></span>
Avienus whispering to Eustathius and said, ‘Come now,
Eustathius, make good our fine young friend Avienus’
modest restraint and share with us yourself what he’s murmuring
in your ear.’</p>
<p>2. Eustathius said, ‘For a while now
he’s been dying to ask Servius many questions about Virgil
that fall within a teacher’s proper sphere, and he hopes he
can be allowed the time to be instructed by one more
learned than himself on points he finds doubtful and obscure.’</p>
<p>3. And Praetextatus said, ‘Good for you, Avienus,
for not concealing the things that leave you uncertain. So
then, let our most learned teacher be prevailed upon to accept
your consultation, since we’ll all profit from the things
you want to learn: don’t be slow, now, to give Servius an
opening to talk about Virgil.’</p>
