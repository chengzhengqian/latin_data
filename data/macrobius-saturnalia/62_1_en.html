<p>29. Anaxilaus of Messene, who founded Messana in Sicily,
was tyrant over the people of Rhegium: at his death he left
two small children, whom he was content to entrust to his
slave Micythus.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_125_196" id="target_note_LCL510_125_196"><sup>196</sup></a> The slave then behaved irreproachably

power to rule, while he himself accepted a small travel-allowance
and set off for Olympia, where he reached old
age in utter tranquility.</p>
<p>30. ‘There are not a few examples that also show how
slaves contributed to the common good. When there was a
shortage of recruits in the Punic War, slaves who promised

the Romans were defeated at Cannae, 8000 slaves were
purchased for military duty, and though captive Romans
could have been ransomed more cheaply, the commonwealth
