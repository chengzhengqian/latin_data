<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">he landed in the other’s tracks before the dust settled</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">around them.</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">The meaning of this line is as follows: if a race happens to
be run over dusty ground, a runner of course leaves a track
when he raises his foot from the earth, and yet quicker
than thought the dust raised by a footfall settles back over
the track.</p>
<p>The godlike poet’s point, then, is that the pursuer
is so close that he plants his foot in the other’s track
before the dust settles upon it. But what does your poet say
when he wants to convey the same thing? (A. 5.324)</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">. . . and now Diores treads on the other’s heel with</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">his own</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p>6. Consider Homer’s refinement in this line (Od. 9.372):</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">he lay with his broad neck bent to one side.</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">But that poet of yours says (A. 3.631):</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">he rested his bent neck. . . .</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p>7. Let’s compare these lines too, if you’re agreeable:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">The chariots now alit on the much-nourishing earth,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">now sprang up in mid-air . . . . (<span class="italic">Il.</span> 23.368–69)</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Now they seem borne along on the ground, now</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">raised up on high</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">through the unresisting air . . . . (<span class="italic">G.</span> 3.108–9)</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
