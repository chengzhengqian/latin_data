Where in these cases is Homer’s careful practice? Since
there are in the <span class="italic">Iliad</span> two men named Aias, he speaks now
of “Aias son of Telamôn” (<span class="italic">Il.</span> 2.528 <span class="italic">et al.</span>), now of “swift
Aias, Oïleus’ son” (<span class="italic">Il.</span> 2.527 <span class="italic">et al.</span>), and similarly elsewhere
of the men “who have the same name and equal spirit” (<span class="italic">Il.</span>
17.720), and he continually uses specific markers to distinguish
those he gives the same name, so the reader won’t be
forced to guess who is meant by the name at any given
time.</p>

<span class="line">Those who held Euboia . . . (<span class="italic">Il.</span> 2.536),</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
