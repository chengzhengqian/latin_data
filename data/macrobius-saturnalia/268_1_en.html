<p>4. What are we to make of the fact that we find suitable authors
distinguishing the fig from fruit [<span class="italic">pomum</span>], as though
it were not one of them? Thus Afranius in his <span class="italic">Sella</span> (300
<span class="italic">SRPF<sup>3</sup></span> 2:241):
<q><span class="line">fruit, vegetable, fig, grape.</span><span class="linebreak"></span></q>
But Cicero too, in Book 3 of his <span class="italic">On Household Management,</span>
says (fr. 18), “He neither plants a vine nor carefully
tends the one that has been planted: he has no olive oil,
figs, fruit.”</p>
<p>5. One should also be aware that the fig is the
only tree that does not bloom. Figs that do not ripen are
called <span class="italic">grossi</span>; the Greeks call them <span class="italic">olynthoi.</span> Mattius says
(fr. 14–15 <span class="italic">FPL<sup>3</sup></span>):
<q><span class="line">in so many thousands you’ll not see not one unripe</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">[<span class="italic">grossus</span>],</span><span class="linebreak"></span></q>
and a little later,
<q><span class="line">you could get from another unripe figs [<span class="italic">grossi</span>] dripping</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">with milky juice.</span><span class="linebreak"></span></q>
Postumius Albinus, too, in Book 1 of his <span class="italic">Annals</span>, says of
Brutus (no. 812 fr. 3 <span class="italic">FGrH</span> = fr. 4 Ch.), “that is why he took
on the character of a doltish fool and was eating little unripe
figs [<span class="italic">grossuli</span>] with honey.”</p>
