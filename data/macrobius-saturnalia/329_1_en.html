wife Creusa’s shade in Book 2 and his father Anchises’ shade in
Book 6: in the former, Aeneas speaks the lines as first-person narrator,
in the latter, the narrator refers to Aeneas in the third person.
As the lines are quoted here, the verbal person is, strictly speaking, ambiguous; but since Eustathius is working through the
text seriatim, we are to assume that it is the passage from Book 2
that M. has in mind. Cf. 5.7.8n.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL511_267_26a').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
