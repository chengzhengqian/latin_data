<p>15. Virgil made handsome use of the following epithets
too: for an arrow, “flying iron” (<span class="italic">A</span>. 4.71), and for the Romans,
“the toga-clad race” (<span class="italic">A.</span> 1.282), the first of which
Sueius used, the other, Laberius. For in Book 5 Sueius says
(fr. 8 <span class="italic">FPL<sup>3</sup></span>),</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">. . . the flying missile,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL512_95_50" id="target_note_LCL512_95_50"><sup>50</sup></a></span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>

<span class="line">You ask that I remove the licentious lustfulness</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">of the toga-clad stock,</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">and also farther along (56–57),</p>

<p>‘If you like, I will list the figures that he borrowed from<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">6</span><span class="br"></span>
the ancient writers, when I’ve gathered them up, spur-of the-moment,
from my memory. But right now I’d like
Servius to speak about the figurative usages that he’s noticed
in Virgil that were <span class="italic">not</span> taken over from earlier writers
but were rather shaped by the poet himself or adopted,
with a poet’s daring, in a novel yet becoming way. For since
he spends each day explaining the same bard to our talented
youth, he must inevitably have quite a ready supply
