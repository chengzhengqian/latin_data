<p>16. ‘Now, in the brilliant and wide-ranging discussion in
which you set out the sequence of digestion’s processes, all
that you said about the nature of the human body does
nothing to detract from the position I intend to argue, and
that it was all said eloquently I do not deny. I withhold
assent only from the statement that the varied juices produced
when different sorts of food are processed are inimical
to our bodies, and I do so because our bodies themselves
are constructed of different sorts of properties.</p>

while a plain diet produces from itself juice with one property
only. Yet we know that like is nourished by like: please
explain, then, where the body’s other three properties derive
their nourishment.</p>
<p>18. As for the principle that individual
elements attract their like, Empedocles is a witness,

feel pain; but he does feel pain and therefore is not a single
thing.” It follows that if the human being is not a single
thing, his nourishment should not be a single thing.</p>
<p>20. God, too, the creator of all things, did not want the air
that surrounds us and that we draw in with our breathing to
