is reported by the augur Marcus Laelius (fr. 4 <span class="italic">IAR</span><sup>6</sup>): in
the Second Punic War, after numerous portents, the senate
decreed that the Board of Two should consult the Sibylline
books, and the books, when inspected, declared that
supplication should be offered on the Capitoline and a
special banquet should be offered to the gods, funded
by contributions from the community;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_59_79" id="target_note_LCL510_59_79"><sup>79</sup></a> freedwomen, who
wore long garments, were also to contribute for that purpose.</p>
<p>14. So the ritual of supplication was performed, with
a hymn sung by freeborn boys and freedmen’s sons, and
by girls of marriageable age with two living parents: as a
consequence, freedmen’s sons (at least those born to a legitimate
marriage) gained the right to wear the praetexta
and a leather thong around their necks in place of the amulet.</p>
<p>15. ‘Verrius Flaccus reports that when the Roman people
were in the grip of a plague and an oracle said it was
happening because the gods “were being looked down
upon,” the city was seized by anxiety because the oracle
was opaque; and it came to pass that on the days of the Circus
Games<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_59_80" id="target_note_LCL510_59_80"><sup>80</sup></a> a boy was looking down on the procession
from a garret, reporting to his father the arrangement of
the secret sacred objects he saw in the cart’s coffer. When
his father told the senate what had happened, it decreed
that the route of the procession should be covered with an
awning; and when the plague had been put to rest, the boy
who had clarified the ambiguous oracle gained the use of
the praetexta as his reward.</p>

by tradition dated to the reign of Tarquin the Proud and were typically
consulted in times of crisis; they were preserved by a priestly
college, originally the Board of Two, which by the time of this
story had become a “Board of Ten” (<span class="italic">decemviri</span>; by the end of the
Republic, a “Board of Fifteen”). The “special banquet” was the
ritual of the <span class="italic">lectisternium</span> (lit. “spreading the bed [with blankets]”),
when images of the gods were placed on couches and
