a guilty man on the same days is an act requiring expiation.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_101_157" id="target_note_LCL510_101_157"><sup>157</sup></a></p>

long neglected after Novius and Pomponius, says (fr. 3–5
<span class="italic">SRPF</span><sup>3</sup> 2:332), “Our ancestors instituted many fine customs,
and this the best: from the deepest chill they produced
the seven-day Saturnalia.”</p>
