to Gellius (fr. 25) the senate decreed that the temple
of Saturn be built, with the military tribune Lucius
Furius in charge.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_87_118" id="target_note_LCL510_87_118"><sup>118</sup></a></p>
<p>2. The god also has an altar before the
Senaculum, where sacrifice is offered in the Greek manner,
with uncovered head, because they think that it was
offered that way from the beginning, first by the Pelasgi
and later by Hercules.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_87_119a" id="target_note_LCL510_87_119a"><sup>119</sup></a></p>
<p>3. ‘Now, the Romans wanted the temple of Saturn to be
the treasury, because it is said that when he dwelt in Italy
no theft was committed in his territory, or else because in
his reign no one held private property (Verg. <span class="italic">G.</span> 1.126–27):</p>

<p class="noindent">Hence the money belonging in common to the people was
placed in his temple, because under his rule all men had all
things in common.</p>

Tritons<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_87_120" id="target_note_LCL510_87_120"><sup>120</sup></a> with their trumpets that were placed atop the
temple’s roof: that’s because from the time of the god’s
commemoration down to our own day history shines
bright and all but speaks, whereas it was previously mute,
shrouded in darkness, unknown—as is indicated by the

to await the presiding magistrate’s decision on a venue: the
gathering-place was called a senaculum. Since the senate customarily
met in several different venues, there were several different senacula. We know of 3: one centrally located, on the rise of the

the porta Capena in the city’s SE quadrant; and one in the Campus
