things that are either a pleasure to read or a mark of cultivation
to have read or useful to remember.</p>
<p>11. I judge that
I have included nothing that is either useless to know or
difficult to learn:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_9_5" id="target_note_LCL510_9_5"><sup>5</sup></a> everything here will make your mind
more active, your memory better stocked, your speech
more skillful, your language more refined—save here and
there where the natural flow of the Latin language might
fail me, who was born under an alien sky.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_9_6" id="target_note_LCL510_9_6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>12. And if others

readers to indulge him and spare him their bad opinion if
