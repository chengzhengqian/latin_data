blocked with food, it is not diluted by any admixture and is
perceived as being stronger as it passes through the empty
space.’</p>
<p>18. ‘Here’s something else I need to know,’ Avienus
said.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL512_253_98" id="target_note_LCL512_253_98"><sup>98</sup></a> ‘Why does someone who drinks when he’s hungry
relieve his hunger a little, whereas someone who eats when
he’s thirsty does not just leave his thirst unquenched but
actually becomes even more eager to drink?’</p>
<p>19. ‘The reason
is well known,’ Dysarius said. ‘Nothing keeps liquid
from seeping through all parts of the body and filling the
veins, wherever it turns when it is taken in, and so the fasting
that produced the emptiness is relieved by the antidote
of drink, as though the emptiness was partly filled. But
food, being larger and more solid, is received by the veins
only gradually when it has been processed and so offers no
relief or consolation to the thirst it encounters—rather, it
absorbs whatever external moisture it encounters, and so
the lack of moisture that we call thirst increases.’</p>
<p>20. ‘Here’s another thing I don’t want to remain ignorant
of,’ Avienus said. ‘Why do we experience more pleasure
from quenching thirst with a drink than from soothing
hunger with food?’ Dysarius replied, ‘The answer here too
is clear from what I’ve said before: all that’s taken in by
drinking goes to all the body’s recesses at once and the
sensation of all its parts produces one very great and perceptible
feeling of pleasure. Food, by contrast, being distributed
very meagerly, only gradually assuages the feeling
of deprivation: its pleasure is therefore diminished in a
number of ways.’</p>
<p>21. ‘I also want to add this to the questions I’ve asked:
why does a feeling of satiety more readily come over those
who eat greedily than those who eat the same food more
