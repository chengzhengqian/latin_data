fleeing seems contrary to the state of being “mature” [<span class="italic">maturitas</span>]:
so please tell me how I ought to make sense of this
expression.’</p>
<p>8. Servius replied, ‘Nigidius, a man outstandingly
learned in all the worthy disciplines, said (fr. 48),
“Something that happens ‘maturely’ happens neither
too soon nor too late but achieves a balanced mean,” and
Nigidius gets it right on the mark. For grains and fruit are
said to be “mature” when they’re neither hard and unripe
nor too soft and ready to fall but have reached a point of
balanced ripeness in their proper season.</p>
<p>9. The deified
Augustus neatly caught the sense of Nigidius explanation
with two Greek words: for they say that in his conversation
and correspondence he often said, <span class="italic">speude bradeôs</span> [“make
haste slowly”] (<span class="italic">epist</span>. fr. 50 Malc.), by which he meant to
suggest that to any task one should apply both the speed of
serious application and the delay of due diligence, with
“maturity” as the product of these two opposing qualities.</p>
<p>10. And that is the way Virgil introduces Neptune when he
orders the winds to depart,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL512_127_66" id="target_note_LCL512_127_66"><sup>66</sup></a> so that they might leave as
quickly as they would if fleeing and yet blow gently while
retreating, as though they were going away “maturely,”
which is to say, temperately—for the god worries that they
might harm the fleet by their very departure, if they carried
the ships in a retreat that was too much like flight.</p>
<p>11. Virgil also very shrewdly distinguished between “to
make mature” [<span class="italic">maturare</span>] and “to hasten” [<span class="italic">properare</span>], as
direct opposites, in these lines (<span class="italic">G</span>. 1.259–61):</p>

<span class="line">to do in good time [<span class="italic">maturare</span>] many things that will</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
