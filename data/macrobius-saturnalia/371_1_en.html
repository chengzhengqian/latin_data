<span class="line">As when a destructive fire fall upon a dense forest</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">and the whirling wind carries it in every direction,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>

<p class="noindent">He spoiled two comparisons for the sake of producing one,
deriving the fire from the first, the torrent from the second,
and doing justice to neither.</p>
