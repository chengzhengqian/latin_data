the god’s likeness, he replied<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL511_361_43" id="target_note_LCL511_361_43"><sup>43</sup></a> that he’d found the basic
pattern for Zeus in these three lines of Homer:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">The son of Kronos spoke and with his dark brow</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">nodded,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">and his divine locks swept down from the lord’s</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">immortal head: he made great Olympus tremble,</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">for (he said) he inferred the expression on Zeus’ face from
his brow and hair—both of which, you can see, Virgil omitted.
Granted, he didn’t pass over the jolt Olympus received
from Zeus’ awesome nod, but he took over the oath from
another passage in Homer, using this addition to make up
for his sterile borrowing.</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">24. . . . the boy with the first signs of youth on his</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">unshaven cheeks. (<span class="italic">A.</span> 9.181)</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">. . . with a first growth of beard, his youth utterly</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">alluring. (<span class="italic">Od.</span> 10.279)</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">By omitting the pubescent boy’s winsomeness—“his youth
utterly alluring”—he made his own Latin version less winsome.</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">25. As a wild beast, trapped by hunters’ tight circle,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">rages against their weapons: fully aware, it makes</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">a death-defying leap and bounds over the spears. (<span class="italic">A</span>.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">9.551–53)</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">On the other side Peleus’ son rose against him, like a</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">lion</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">on the hunt, which men are frantic to slay when they</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
