<p>45. A couplet that he wrote about himself is in
circulation: its point, made obliquely, is that the gods do
not utterly hate those who struggle in this life with various
miseries, but there are hidden causes, which a few men, by
careful inquiry, are able to grasp (<span class="italic">Anth. Gr</span>. 7.676):</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">I, Epictetus, was born a slave, maimed in my body,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">an Irus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_133_213" id="target_note_LCL510_133_213"><sup>213</sup></a> in my poverty, and dear to the gods.</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p>46. ‘I think I’ve made the case that the name “slave”
should not be viewed with disgust and contempt, both because
Jupiter felt concern for a slave and because many
slaves have proved to be loyal, shrewd, gallant, and even
philosophers. Now I should briefly review the case of the
Sigillaria, so you will not judge that my remarks<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_133_214" id="target_note_LCL510_133_214"><sup>214</sup></a> had
more to do with humor than with religion.</p>
<p>47. ‘Epicadus reports (test. 6 <span class="italic">GRF</span> 1:103) that when
Hercules had slain Geryon and led his cattle victoriously
through Italy, he built the Sublician bridge (as it’s now
called)<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_133_215" id="target_note_LCL510_133_215"><sup>215</sup></a> so that he could cast into the river human effigies
equal in number to the companions he had lost to mischance
on his journey: that way, they could be carried
along by the current to the sea and be restored, in a sense,
to their ancestral homes in place of the bodies of the dead.
That (according to Epicadus) is why the practice of fashioning
such effigies has remained part of the rites.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_133_216" id="target_note_LCL510_133_216"><sup>216</sup></a></p>
<p>48. But
I think the explanation I reported a bit earlier is more accurate:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_133_217" id="target_note_LCL510_133_217"><sup>217</sup></a>
namely, that when a more auspicious reading of
spanned the river downstream from the Tiber island, near the Forum
Boarium, was built by Ancus Marcius (Livy 1.33.6).
