learned men have not learned the name of the city itself,

they knew they had often inflicted on enemy cities, should
the name of their protector-god become known and allow
their enemy to summon it forth.</p>
<p>6. ‘We should see to it, however, that the mistake some
have fallen into not confuse us too—I mean the belief that
a single spell both summons the gods from a city and devotes
the city to destruction. For I have found both spells
in Book 5 of Serenus Sammonicus’ <span class="italic">Secret History</span>, and he
says that he found them in the very ancient book of a certain
Furius (<span class="italic">IAH</span> 1:29f. = fr. 1 <span class="italic">IAR<sup>6</sup></span>).<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL511_67_75" id="target_note_LCL511_67_75"><sup>75</sup></a></p>

<span class="line">or a goddess,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL511_67_76" id="target_note_LCL511_67_76"><sup>76</sup></a> and upon you above all, who have undertaken</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">to protect this city and people, and ask you</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">all for your favor: may you all desert the people</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">and community of Carthage, leave their sacred</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">places, temples, and city, and depart from them,</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">8. and upon this people and community heap fear,</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
