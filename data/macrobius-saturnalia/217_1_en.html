of cult that he called Mezentius “despiser of
the gods” (<span class="italic">A</span>. 7.648) for doing the opposite. Nor did he use
that phrase, as Asper thinks (p. 137), because Mezentius

for the gods<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL511_43_43" id="target_note_LCL511_43_43"><sup>43</sup></a>—if that were the case, he would have
much more reason to use the phrase of Busiris, whom he
was content to describe as “unpraised,” though he was far
crueler.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL511_43_44" id="target_note_LCL511_43_44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>

the Rutulians to offer to him the first fruits that

fearing a similar command, made the following vow: “Jupiter,
if you prefer that we make that offering to you rather
than Mezentius, we pray that you make us victorious.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL511_43_45a" id="target_note_LCL511_43_45a"><sup>45</sup></a></p>
<p>11. Because he demanded divine honors for himself, then,
he earned Virgil’s description as “despiser of the gods”:
hence the priest’s<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL511_43_46" id="target_note_LCL511_43_46"><sup>46</sup></a> pious abuse (<span class="italic">A.</span> 11.15–16),
