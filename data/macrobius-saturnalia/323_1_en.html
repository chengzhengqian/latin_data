<span class="line">rejoicing in the boars and swift deer;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">with her the nymphs, daughters of Zeus who holds</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">the aegis,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">range over the country in their play; and Leto feels</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">great gladness in her mind.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Above them all she holds her head,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">easily recognized as she goes, and they are all lovely:</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">so the pure maiden is conspicuous among her</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">attendants. (<span class="italic">Od.</span> 6.102–9)</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">11. Aeneas was left standing there, brilliant in the</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">bright light,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">his face and torso like a god’s. For his mother herself</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">had breathed upon her son the grace</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">of fair hair, the rosy glow of youth,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">a look of joy and dignity in his eyes:</span><span class="linebreak"></span>

<span class="line">12. Then the maid Eurynome bathed Odysseus</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">in his house and anointed him with oil,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">and about him set a handsome mantle and tunic.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Then from the crown of his head Athena caused</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">much beauty to flow, made him taller and sturdier to</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">look upon,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">and from his head sent forth his hair in curls, like the</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">hyacinth.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">As when someone surrounds silver with liquid gold,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">a skilled man whom Hephaistos and Pallas Athena</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">have taught</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
