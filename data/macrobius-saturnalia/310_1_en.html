taking first the wanderings from the <span class="italic">Odyssey</span> and then the
battles from the <span class="italic">Iliad</span>? Yes, because the order of events
necessarily changed the order of the narrative: whereas in
Homer the war was fought at Troy first, with Ulysses become
a wanderer on his return from Troy, in Maro Aeneas’
voyage preceded the wars that were subsequently fought
in Italy.</p>
<p>7. Or again, when Homer wanted to represent
Apollo as hostile to the Greeks in <span class="italic">Iliad</span> 1, he based the reason
on a wrong done to the god’s priest; when Virgil represented
Juno as hostile to the Trojans, he gathered together
a heap of reasons.</p>
