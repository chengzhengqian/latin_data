if he knew that it is forbidden to sacrifice a bull to this god,
or if he’d learned what’s in Ateius Capito? Here’s what he
says in Book 1 of his <span class="italic">On the Law of Sacrifices</span> (fr. 1 <span class="italic">IAH</span>
2.1:279 = fr. 14 <span class="italic">IAR<sup>6</sup></span>): “thus it is forbidden for a bull, boar,
or ram to be sacrificed to Jupiter.”</p>
<p>4. Indeed, in Book 68
Labeo added (fr. 20 <span class="italic">IAH</span> 2.1:80 = fr. 6 <span class="italic">IAR<sup>6</sup></span>) that a bull is
sacrificed only to Neptune, Apollo, and Mars. So there you
have it: your pontiff doesn’t know what what’s sacrificed
on which altars, though even temple-wardens knows such
things, nor did the ancients’ efforts leave them unmentioned.’</p>
<p>5. With a smile, Praetextatus replied, ‘If you want to
consult Virgil on which of the gods receives a bull as an

is the product of his cleverness. For he shows that the
offering was not acceptable to the god: that’s why there
follows (<span class="italic">A.</span> 3.26),</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">a portent, dreadful to describe and extraordinary to</span><span class="linebreak"></span>

made for this mistake: for Ateius Capito, whom you’ve set
up as Maro’s adversary, went on to say (fr. 2 <span class="italic">IAH</span> 2.1:279),
“If anyone should happen to offer a bull to Jupiter, let him
