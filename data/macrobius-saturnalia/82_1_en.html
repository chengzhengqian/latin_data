intercalary month but also an intercalary day.</p>

began. Licinius Macer actually attributes the beginning of
the practice to Romulus (fr. 6); Antias contends (fr. 7) in his
second book that Numa Pompilius devised it for the sake
of religious rituals; Junius records that king Servius Tullius
first performed intercalation (fr. 4 <span class="italic">IAH</span> 1:38 = fr. 9 <span class="italic">IAR</span><sup>6</sup>),
and Varro adds that he also instituted market days (<span class="italic">Ant.

Tuditanus reports (fr. 7 <span class="italic">HRR</span> 1:146 = fr. 1 <span class="italic">IAR</span><sup>6</sup>) that the

Cassius also writes (fr. 21) that the Board of Ten were responsible,

(ibid.) that a very ancient law to which an intercalary
month is attributed was inscribed on a bronze column under
the consuls Lucius Pinarius and &lt;Publius&gt; Furius [472
