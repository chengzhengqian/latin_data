in the middle of the jar. But it’s also shown by experience
that the best olive oil floats on top, while the best
honey is at the bottom. Why is it, then, that the best oil is
believed to be at the top, the best wine in the middle, and
the best honey at the base of the jar?’</p>
<p>14. Without hesitation, Dysarius replied, ‘The best
honey is heavier than the rest, and so the portion of honey
at the bottom of the jar is obviously heavier and therefore
more valuable than that above it. In a wine-jar, by contrast,
the admixture of dregs not only makes the lower portion
murkier but also makes it taste worse, while the upper is
spoiled by its contact with the air, which mingles with it
and makes it more diluted.</p>
<p>15. That’s why farmers are not
content just to store wine-jars indoors but actually bury
them and fortify them by smearing the outside with a sealant,
doing everything they can to keep the wine out of contact
with the air, which so plainly harms the wine that
it scarcely retains its freshness in a vessel that’s full and
therefore more impervious to the air.</p>
<p>16. But if you draw
from it and leave room for the air the mix in, all that remains
becomes spoiled. The wine in the middle, then, is
protected from harm in direct proportion to its distance
from the two extremes, being neither murky nor diluted.’</p>
<p>17. Avienus added, ‘Why does the same drink seem
more potent to someone who’s been fasting than to someone
who’s eaten?’ Dysarius said, ‘Fasting empties the
veins, being full closes them up: so when a drink flows
straight into the empty veins, since it doesn’t find them
