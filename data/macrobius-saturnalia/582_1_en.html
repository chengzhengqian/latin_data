through the <span class="italic">artêria</span> [“windpipe”] that’s called <span class="italic">trakheia</span>

formed such a judgment or committed it to writing is astounding—or
rather, lamentable.</p>
<p>3. So Erasistratus, most
renowned of ancient physicians, rightly attacked him, saying
that his account was very different from that discovered
by reason.</p>
<p>4. For there are two channel-like tubes
that go downward from the opening of the throat. All food
and drink is ingested through one of them, slips down into
the stomach, and from there is carried into the abdomen,
which the Greek call <span class="italic">hê kata koilia</span> [“the lower cavity”],
