body’s dominant humor,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL512_179_32" id="target_note_LCL512_179_32"><sup>32</sup></a> or from the amount of food itself,
when the body’s nature is unequal to the task of digesting
all that’s been heaped up. Let’s first consider the
kind of juice.</p>
<p>10. ‘Someone who takes plain food easily recognizes
from experience what juice helps his body or causes it distress,
and he is in no doubt what kind of food holds sway
over him, because he has eaten only one sort: harm is thus
easily avoided, since its cause is known.</p>
<p>11. On the other
hand, someone who has a varied diet experiences a variety
of juices from the variety of foods; the humors that arise
from this varied material are out of harmony, they produce
blood (into which they are converted by the liver) that is
not clear and pure, and they thus transmit their cacophony
to the veins. As a result, diseases bubble up from the discord
of conflicting humors.</p>
<p>12. Furthermore, because all
the things that there are to eat are not of a single nature,
they are digested, not all at the same time, but some more
quickly, some more slowly, so that the orderly sequence of
digestion is thrown into confusion.</p>
<p>13. For the food that we
eat is not digested in a single process but undergoes four
different processes to provide the body with nutrition: one
of these processes everyone, even dullards, perceive, while
a more esoteric analysis is required to detect the others.
The reason for this is something I should go into a bit more
deeply, so that it will be clear to everyone.</p>
<p>14. ‘There are in us four special powers that have been
given the task of administering our diet.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL512_179_33" id="target_note_LCL512_179_33"><sup>33</sup></a> One of these
