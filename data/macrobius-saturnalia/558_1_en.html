head has more moisture,’ Eusebius said, ‘why does it experience
baldness, which only dryness produces?’</p>
<p>3. ‘Your
objection is to the point,’ Dysarius said, ‘but the reason is
clear. Nature made the anterior parts of the head more porous,
so that any superabundant or vaporous fumes around
the brain could dissipate through more passages. That’s
why we see in the dried skulls of the dead what look like sutures,
which bind together the two hemispheres, so to
speak, of the head. People with more generous passages
swap moisture for dryness and therefore turn gray more
slowly, though they’re subject to baldness.’</p>
<p>4. ‘If dryness
makes people bald, then, and the back of the head is drier,
why do we never see the back of the head bald?’</p>
<p>5. The
other replied, ‘The dryness of the back of the head is a natural
condition, not a flaw: everyone’s occipital region is dry.
Baldness, on the other hand, arises from the sort of dryness
that occurs as the result of an imbalance—what the
Greeks call <span class="italic">dyskrasia</span>.</p>
<p>6. So curly-headed people, whose
balance is such that their heads are drier, are late turning
gray but make an early transition to baldness; on the other
hand, those with thinner hair don’t readily lose it, since the
humor called phlegm<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL512_239_86" id="target_note_LCL512_239_86"><sup>86</sup></a> nourishes it, but they become gray
early. Hairs turn white in imitation of the color of the humor
by which they’re nourished.’</p>
<p>7. ‘If, then, an abundance
of that humor colors old men’s hair gray, why has old
age come to be thought of as a time of extreme dryness?’</p>
<p>8. ‘Because old age,’ Dysarius said, ‘turns cold when the
passage of time extinguishes the natural warmth, and from
that cold there arise chill and superfluous humors; but longevity
makes the life-giving humor dry up. As a result, old
age is dry and lacking in natural humors, but it is damp
with a superabundance of the unnatural humor produced
