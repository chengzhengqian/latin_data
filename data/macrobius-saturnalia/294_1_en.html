“ordered to die”—as sources of emotion. We are to understand
her words this way: though she was “ordered to die at
an enemy’s tomb,” she is still more fortunate than I, because
“she did not endure being shared out as booty” (<span class="italic">A.</span>
3.323).</p>
<p>3. This case is similar (<span class="italic">A.</span> 1.94):</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">. . . o thrice and four times blessed!;</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">and when he remarks, apropos of Pasiphaë (<span class="italic">E.</span> 6.48),<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL511_197_23" id="target_note_LCL511_197_23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">Proetus’ daughters made the fields resound with</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">counterfeit lowing,</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">he shows that that was a less miserable by adding (<span class="italic">E.</span> 6.49–50),</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">but none of them ever sought intercourse—</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">disgusting!—</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">with cattle. . . .</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p>4. Is the following argument from the lesser not terribly
moving? (<span class="italic">A.</span> 3.712–13*)
<q><span class="line">Neither Helenus the seer—though he warned of</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">many horrors—</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">nor dreadful Celaeno predicted that I would feel</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">such grief.</span><span class="linebreak"></span></q>
Here we can only conclude that he judged all his past suffering
less grievous than his father’s death.</p>
<p>5. ‘Some have said that the argument from what is
greater cannot be used in the same way, but Virgil introduced
it subtly in treating Dido (<span class="italic">A.</span> 4.669–70):</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">. . . just as if the enemy had been let in and all</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Carthage were to fall, or ancient Tyre. . . .</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
