<blockquote><p><span class="line">8. Here a dazzling poplar looms</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">over the cave and pliant vines weave shadings</span><span class="linebreak"></span>

<p class="noindent">There are those who suppose that Virgil coined the word
“shadings” on his own authority, though in Book 10 of <span class="italic">Divine
Antiquities</span> Varro said (fr. 82), “Some magistrates in
the town were granted that sort of shading,” and in Book 5
of his <span class="italic">Laws</span> Cicero said (fr. 2 Powell), “Would you like,
then—since the sun seems a bit lower in the sky than noon
and this whole space doesn’t receive sufficient cover from
these saplings—to go down to the Liris and pursue the rest
of the discussion in the alders’ shading?,” and similarly in
<span class="italic">Brutus</span> (37), “But as from out of the shading of that very
learned fellow Theophrastus . . . .”</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">9. The stags pass over the plain at a gallop and gather</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">their dusty column in flight. (<span class="italic">A</span>. 4.154–55)</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">The attractive use of “pass over” [<span class="italic">transmittunt</span>] for “cross
over” [<span class="italic">transeunt</span>] is found in Lucretius, too, in Book 2
(329–30),</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">And the horsemen fly about and suddenly pass over</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">the middle of the plain, making it shake with their</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">mighty charge.</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">But Cicero, too, says “We passed over [the bays] of
Paestum and Vibo with sheets dead even”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL512_75_32" id="target_note_LCL512_75_32"><sup>32</sup></a> (cf. <span class="italic">Att.</span>
16.6.1), that is, “we crossed over.”</p>

angle of the sail relative to the ship’s prow-to-stern axis: when the
