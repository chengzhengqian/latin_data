sun and the moon,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_269_513" id="target_note_LCL510_269_513"><sup>513</sup></a> because the sun, as the source of
breath, warmth, and light, is the begetter and guardian of
human life and so is believed to be the <span class="italic">Daimôn</span>, or deity,

is the health-giving strength that comes upon mortal
minds and bodies from the substance of the sun; Salus, by

the bodies of living creatures and strengthens them with
its health-giving balance.</p>
<p>2. Figures of serpents are joined
to their images, then, because they insure that human
bodies are rejuvenated and regain their original vigor, as
though by shedding their old skin of infirmity, just as serpents
are rejuvenated from one year to the next by shedding
the skin of old age. For that reason, too, the serpent’s
likeness is related to the sun himself, because the sun always
returns from the old age, as it were, of its nadir
