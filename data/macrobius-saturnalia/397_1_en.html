or intentionally I’m not sure. Homer preferred
to turn a blind eye to Chance and instead hands over
everything to be guided solely by the ordinance that he
calls <span class="italic">moira</span> [‘destiny’], to the extent that the word <span class="italic">tykhê</span>
[‘chance’] is nowhere used in the Homeric corpus. Virgil,
by contrast, not only knows and makes mention of chance
but makes it all powerful, though even the philosophers

cup-bearer whom the gods received into heaven (<span class="italic">Il.</span>
