<p class="noindent">Lucretius in Book 5 (213–17):</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">But still sometimes, when all the gains that great toil</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">seeks are in leaf and flower throughout the land,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">either the heavenly sun, blazing with extreme heat,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">destroys them, or sudden rains and chill frosts,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">and gusts of wind in a wild cyclone assail them.</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p>30. ‘There are other long passages that Maro transferred
from the ancients into his own work with the change
of a few words. Since copying out numerous verses from
both sources would be a lengthy process, I will just note his
models, so that a person so inclined might read and compare
the passages and marvel at their similarity.</p>
<p>31. In
Book 1 of the <span class="italic">Aeneid</span> a storm is described (81–123), and
Venus complains to Jupiter about the dangers her son faces
(227–53), and Jupiter comforts her by telling her that her
posterity will flourish (254–96). All of this is taken from
Book 1 of Naevius’ <span class="italic">Punic War</span> (fr. 14 <span class="italic">FPL<sup>3</sup></span>): there too Venus
complains to Jupiter while the Trojans are beset by a
storm, and after her complaint Jupiter comforts her by
speaking of her posterity’s great expectations.</p>
<p>32. Similarly,
the passage about Pandarus and Bitias’ opening the
gates of the camp (<span class="italic">A</span>. 9.672–818) was taken over from
Book 15 of Ennius (fr. iv),<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL512_59_26" id="target_note_LCL512_59_26"><sup>26</sup></a> where he presented two
Histrian soldiers breaking out of the gate of the camp under
siege and wreaking havoc on the besieging enemy.</p>
<p>33. ‘Nor did he avoid borrowing from Cicero, provided
he could augment his work’s adornment from whatever
source (<span class="italic">A.</span> 11.124–45):
<q><span class="line">O great in fame, in arms greater,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">man of Troy . . .,</span><span class="linebreak"></span></q>
