<p>3. In Book 15 Ennius applies this passage to the fighting of
the tribune Gaius Aelius, with these lines (391–98 Sk.):</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">From every side the missiles converge on the tribune</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">like a shower:</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">they pierce his small shield, its boss rings as it’s struck</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">by the shafts,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">. . .</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">with the helmet’s bronze re-echoing, but neither can</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">Anyone</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">tear at his body with a blade, though they press from</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">every side.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">All the while he breaks and brandishes the shafts that</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">come full spate.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Sweat seizes his entire body, the strain is great,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">nor has he any chance to catch his breath. With</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">winged steel</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">the Histrians harry him as they hurl their spears.</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
