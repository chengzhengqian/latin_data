Pompey, prophetically, “Watch out for that badly draped

<p>10. At some time after that, Caesar honored
Laberius with a knight’s gold ring at the end of the games.
Laberius immediately went to watch from the fourteen
rows reserved for knights, the order he had affronted both
when he was stripped of the rank and when he was restored
in their presence:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_343_43a" id="target_note_LCL510_343_43a"><sup>43</sup></a> as Laberius passed, in search of
a seat, Cicero said, “I’d make room for you if the seating
weren’t so cramped,” simultaneously spurning Laberius
and mocking the new senate that Caesar had enlarged beyond
the sanctioned limit.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_343_44" id="target_note_LCL510_343_44"><sup>44</sup></a> Nor did he get away with it:
“Odd that you’re cramped,” Laberius replied, “given that
you usually occupy two seats,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_343_45" id="target_note_LCL510_343_45"><sup>45</sup></a> as a reproof of the political
inconstancy that gossip unjustly imputed to that best of citizens.</p>
<p>11. On another occasion, too, Cicero openly mocked
Caesar’s nonchalance in adding new members to the
senate: when he was asked by his host Publius Mallius to
help clear the way for his stepson to gain a decurionate,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_343_46" id="target_note_LCL510_343_46"><sup>46</sup></a>
Cicero said, before a throng of witnesses: “He’ll get it at
Rome, if you like; at Pompeii, not so easy” (<span class="italic">dicta</span> 2–4).</p>
<p>12. Nor was his bite limited to these remarks: on receiving
the customary morning greeting from a certain Andro of
Laodicea, he asked the man how he came to be in Rome;

request to appear on the stage (see 2.7.2–8), Laberius placed
himself in the category of actors—persons of diminished social
standing (cf. 3.14.11n.)—thereby forfeiting his status as a Roman
knight; Caesar’s gift of the gold ring symbolized its restitution.
The knights would have been affronted by the disrespect entailed
in Laberius’ shedding his rank for cash (2.7.2) and in Caesar’s
casual restoration of it. On the knights privileged seating, see
3.14.12n.: even if we assume that Laberius passed Cicero in the
orchestra, where senators sat, on his way to the knights’ rows, the premise of the following repartee is rather obscure (there probably
has been some confusion on M.’s part).</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL510_343_43a').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL510_343_44"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL510_343_44" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">44</sup>By rewarding supporters with membership in the senate,
