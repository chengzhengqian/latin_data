why do all sweet things seem sweeter when cold than when
hot?’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL512_263_106" id="target_note_LCL512_263_106"><sup>106</sup></a> Dysarius replied, ‘Heat engrosses the senses, and
great warmth impedes the tongue’s faculty of taste: hence
the pleasant sensation is blocked when the mouth has first
been irritated. But if heat is not present to do harm, then—and
only then—can the tongue register the appropriate
degree of sweetness, its attractive quality being diminished.

either uniquely or to a degree beyond all the rest seeks sustenance
that is suited to its own nature: I mean heat, which
demands that it be provided with liquid.</p>

see that of the four elements,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL512_263_108" id="target_note_LCL512_263_108"><sup>108</sup></a> when they exist in the
world outside us, neither water nor air nor earth needs
something to sustain it or to consume, and they do no harm
to nearby things even when they’re placed in contact with
