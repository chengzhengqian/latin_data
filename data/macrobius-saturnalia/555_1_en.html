<p>15. ‘I’ve spoken, then, about the parts of a human being
that are without feeling and have indicated why that is so.
It remains for me to discharge my obligation by explaining
why the brain governs the senses while being without sensation
itself. I will try to dispose of this question too.</p>
<p>16. ‘The senses we’re speaking of are five in number:
sight, hearing, smell, taste, and touch.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL512_233_78" id="target_note_LCL512_233_78"><sup>78</sup></a> These are located
either in or around the body and are known only to bodies
destined to die: no divine body possesses sensation,
whereas the soul is itself more divine than anybody, even if
the body is a god’s. If, then, the gods with their lofty standing
regard bodily sensation as unworthy of themselves, on
the ground that it is something suited to mortals, so much
more is the soul’s majesty too great to stand in need of sensation.</p>
<p>17. The soul, which gives the body the light of life,
causes a human being to continue to exist and be a living
creature. Furthermore, it gives the body the light of life by
dwelling in it, and its dwelling is the brain: being spherical
in nature and coming to us from on high,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL512_233_79" id="target_note_LCL512_233_79"><sup>79</sup></a> it has occupied
the part of the human being that is high and spherical
and that lacks sensation, for which the soul has no use.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL512_233_80" id="target_note_LCL512_233_80"><sup>80</sup></a></p>
<p>18. But because a creature needs sensation, the soul locates
in the brain’s cavities the breath that is one of its effects,
and this breath by its nature provides and governs
the senses.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL512_233_81" id="target_note_LCL512_233_81"><sup>81</sup></a></p>
<p>19. From these cavities, which our ancestors
called the brain’s ventricles, there are seven <span class="italic">syzygiai</span>
[“pairs”] of nerves:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL512_233_82a" id="target_note_LCL512_233_82a"><sup>82</sup></a> you can use whatever Latin term you
