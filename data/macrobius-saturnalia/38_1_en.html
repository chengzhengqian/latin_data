<p class="noindent">and it’s also obvious from the fact that later generations
dedicated two neighboring months to them, so that December
has the festival of Saturn while January has the
other’s name.</p>
<p>24. When Saturn suddenly disappeared in
the middle of their reign, Janus devised a way to increase
his honors. First he named his entire kingdom “Saturnia,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_77_98" id="target_note_LCL510_77_98"><sup>98</sup></a>
then he established an altar, as though for a god, and
sacred rites that he called the “Saturnalia”: by so many
centuries do these rites antedate the city of Rome. He accordingly
commanded that Saturn be revered with the solemn
grandeur of religious scruple, as the source of a better
way of life, a status indicated by his image, to which Janus
added a sickle, the symbol of the harvest.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_77_99" id="target_note_LCL510_77_99"><sup>99</sup></a></p>
<p>25. To Saturn
people attribute the practice of grafting shoots, cultivating
fruit trees, and methodically raising all produce of every
conceivable kind. The people of Cyrene, when they sacrifice
to him, even wear garlands of fresh figs and send each
other honey-cakes, believing that he discovered honey and
fruit. The Romans also call him Sterculius, because he first
fertilized fields with manure [<span class="italic">stercus</span>].<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_77_100a" id="target_note_LCL510_77_100a"><sup>100</sup></a></p>
<p>26. The time of
his reign is said to have been the happiest, both because of
its material abundance and also because the distinction
between slavery and freedom did not yet exist,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_77_101" id="target_note_LCL510_77_101"><sup>101</sup></a> as is
made plain by the fact that slaves are allowed complete
license during the Saturnalia.</p>
