<p>7. Servius said: ‘As for the verb “harried,” I think a response
can be made along these lines: “harry” is a weighty
word apparently derived from the verb “carry” [<span class="italic">vehere</span>],
which immediately implies a certain force of another person’s
will, since one who is carried is not in control of his
movements. The derivative verb “to harry” is plainly associated
with a much more intense sort of forceful movement.</p>

preserved by the ancients, who used language
properly and exactly.</p>

the land of Italy.” Cato said Italy was “harried” by Hannibal,
though no sort of disaster or savagery or inhumanity
could be found that Italy did not fully suffer at that
time.</p>
<p>11. Marcus Tullius, in the fourth book against Verres
(2.4.122): “that scoundrel so despoiled and plundered [the
temple] that it seems to have been harried, not by some
foreign enemy—who even in war would still have observed
religious scruple and traditional rights—but by barbarian
free-booters.”</p>
<p>12. ‘Regarding “whom none can praise,” I think there
are two possible answers. One goes like this: no one is such
