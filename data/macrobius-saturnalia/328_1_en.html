<span class="line">12. Like a snake that has fed upon poisonous plants</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">and</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">lain swollen underground in midwinter’s cold,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">now it sheds its skin and—renewed and glistening</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">with youth—</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">uncoils it slippery length into the light, raising its</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">bulk</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">high up toward the sun, its forked tongue darting</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">from its mouth. (<span class="italic">A</span>. 2.471–75)</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Like a snake in its mountain lair lying in wait for a</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">man,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">fed full of evil poisons and possessed by a terrible</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">anger,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">it coils round its lair, striking terror with its glance:</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">so Hector, with unquenchable fury, did not give way.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">(<span class="italic">Il</span>. 22.93–96)</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">13. More violently than a foaming river that bursts its</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">levees, pours out,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">and with its torrent breaks through the masses set in</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">its way,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">tumbling, boiling into the fields and over all the</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">plain,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">carrying off cattle and stables together . . . . (<span class="italic">A.</span></span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">2.496–99)</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">As when a swollen river comes down upon the plain,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">driven from the mountains in a wintry flood by the</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">rain of Zeus,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">it sweeps along many parched oaks, many pines,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">and hurls much debris into the sea. (<span class="italic">Il.</span> 11.492–95)</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
