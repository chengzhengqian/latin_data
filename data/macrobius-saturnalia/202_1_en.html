he indicates that this same force of the word [<span class="italic">area</span> &lt;
<span class="italic">a</span>(<span class="italic">n</span>)<span class="italic">sae</span>] derives from the act of grasping.</p>
<p>10. ‘Our poet—with knowledge as profound as his talent
is beguiling—also took some archaic words that he
knew belonged to the proper usage of sacred ritual and so
construed them that the meaning remained intact though
a given word’s sound was changed.</p>
<p>11. For example, in
the first book of Pictor’s <span class="italic">Pontifical Law</span> we find the word
<span class="italic">vitulari</span> (fr. 5 <span class="italic">IAH</span> 1:11 = fr. 1 <span class="italic">IAR</span><sup>6</sup>): Titius glossed its
meaning thus, “<span class="italic">vitulari</span> means ‘vocally rejoice’” (fr. 3 <span class="italic">GRF</span>
1:556); Varro, too, in the fifteenth book of his <span class="italic">Divine Antiquities</span>
(fr. 223), reports that in certain rites a pontiff is accustomed
to <span class="italic">vitulari</span>, which the Greeks term “singing a
paean.”</p>
<p>12. How economically, how learnedly, how neatly
Maro conveyed all these interpretive obscurities! (<span class="italic">A.</span>
6.657)
<q><span class="line">. . . and singing a joyous paean in a chorus!</span><span class="linebreak"></span></q>
If <span class="italic">vitulari</span> means “vocally rejoice,” which in turn is the
same as “sing a paean” [παιανίζειν], is not the verb perfectly
interpreted by “singing a joyous paean”?</p>
<p>13. And to
dwell on this word a bit longer: in his book <span class="italic">On the Gods</span> (cf.
fr. 23 <span class="italic">GRF</span> 1:537) Hyllus says that the goddess of joy is
called Vitula;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL511_13_12" id="target_note_LCL511_13_12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
