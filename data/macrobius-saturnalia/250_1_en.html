<p>10. Nor was that fish uncommon at Rome, so that it had to
be fetched from foreign parts: we have it on the authority
of Pliny (<span class="italic">Natural History</span> 9.171) that as dictator Gaius
Caesar gave a dinner for the people to celebrate his
triumph and bought 6,000 pounds of moray from Gaius
Hirrius. It’s a well known fact that this Hirrius’ villa,
though neither splendid nor large, was sold for 4,000,000
sesterces because of its fishponds.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL511_109_132" id="target_note_LCL511_109_132"><sup>132</sup></a></p>
<p>‘Nor did the sturgeon, which the seas raise for wastrels,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">16</span><span class="br"></span>
escape the extravagance of that era. So you can see
clearly that the fish’s name was well known at the time of
the Second Punic War, here’s how Plautus speaks of it,
in the character of a parasite, in his play titled <span class="italic">Baccaria</span>
(17–20):</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">2. What mortal was ever graced with good fortune as</span><span class="linebreak"></span>

<span class="line">Now the sturgeon that hid from me in the sea before</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">this—</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">my teeth and hands will see that its flesh is hidden</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">away for good.</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p>3. Is the poet’s testimony not weighty enough? Then hear
Cicero testify to the honor this fish enjoyed in the eyes of
Publius Scipio, the great hero of Africa and Numantia.
These are Cicero’s words in his dialogue <span class="italic">On Fate</span> (fr. 4):</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">4. For when Scipio was at home with Pontius in his</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">property at Lavernium a sturgeon happened to be</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">brought to him—quite a rare catch, but a fish, they</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
