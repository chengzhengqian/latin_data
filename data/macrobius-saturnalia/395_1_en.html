<p class="noindent">and so on with the rest of the tale used to draw out this
pleasant interlude.</p>
<p>4. Virgil followed his model in his first
catalogue, telling stories now about Aventinus (<span class="italic">A.</span> 7.657–63),
now about Hippolytus (<span class="italic">A.</span> 7.765–80), while in the second
catalogue Cycnus provides him with a tale (<span class="italic">A.</span> 10.189–93):
by weaving in these pleasant interludes he provides
an antidote to narrative monotony.</p>
<p>5. Indeed, he did the
same thing in all the books of the <span class="italic">Georgics</span>, with supreme
subtlety. For after the didactic material, which is naturally
hard going, he ended each book by inserting extraneous
material, to refresh the reader’s intellect or aesthetic
sense—the first book, with the excursus on weather-signs
(351–468), the second, with praise of the rural life (458–540),
while the third book ends with the plague that struck
the farm animals (478–566), the fourth with the story of
Orpheus and Aristaeus that is far from pointless (315–558).
Thus in every aspect of his oeuvre Maro’s imitation of
Homer is clear as day.</p>
<p>6. ‘Homer stuffed all his verse so full of epigrams that
his individual sayings have the status of proverbs and are
on everyone’s lips:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">But the gods do not give all at once to mortal men</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
