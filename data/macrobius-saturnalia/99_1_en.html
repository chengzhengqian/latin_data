on a day after the Kalends, Nones, or Ides.</p>
<p>24. Then
the senate ordered that the college of pontiffs be consulted
on the religious issues involved, and the pontiffs established
that all days that follow the Kalends, Nones, and
Ides should be considered black days and so unsuitable for
battle, for actions requiring religious purity, and for voting
assemblies.</p>
<p>25. Furthermore, Fabius Maximus Servilianus
the pontiff says, in Book 12 (fr. 4 <span class="italic">HRR</span> 1:118 = <span class="italic">IAH</span> 1:28),
that it is wrong to make offerings to one’s ancestors on a
black day, since on that occasion too one must mention Janus
and Jupiter at the start of one’s prayer,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_199_373" id="target_note_LCL510_199_373"><sup>373</sup></a> and it is not
right that they be named on a black day.</p>
<p>26. Most people
also avoid as ill-omened the fourth day before the Kalends,
Nones, or Ides: it is often asked whether a tradition of religious
sanction is tied to this practice, but I’ve been able to
find nothing written on the matter save that in Book 5 of
his <span class="italic">Annales</span> Quintus Claudius reports (fr. 52) that the utterly
devastating disaster at the battle of Cannae occurred
on the fourth day before the Nones of Sextilis.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_199_374" id="target_note_LCL510_199_374"><sup>374</sup></a></p>
<p>27. Of
course, as Varro remarks (<span class="italic">Ant. hum.</span> lib. 16 fr. 4), the distinction
between days fit [<span class="italic">fasti</span>] and unfit [<span class="italic">nefasti</span>] for legal
business is relevant only to civil, not military, affairs.</p>
<p>28. ‘As for my calling market day a religious festival

festivals, did not count market day among the festivals
but called them only “customary occasions”;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_199_376a" id="target_note_LCL510_199_376a"><sup>376</sup></a> Julius
Modestus is certain that when the augur Messala asked the
pontiffs whether Roman market days and Nones are held
to be religious festivals, they replied that they did not think
