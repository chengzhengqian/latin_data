if they are the same as the target’s, for example, if
one poor man mocks another for his poverty, or one lowborn
man another: when Amphias of Tarsus, a former gardener,
<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL512_173_27" id="target_note_LCL512_173_27"><sup>27</sup></a> became a great man and passed some comments
about a friend’s being “of poor stock,” he quickly added,
“But I too am born from the same seed,” and caused equal
pleasure on all sides.</p>
<p>21. But jibes that take the form of direct
criticism can fill their target with pleasure, for example,
if you should criticize a hero for being prodigal of his
own well-being and willing to die for others, or a generous
man for wasting his estate by being more concerned about
others than about himself. That’s how Diogenes used to
praise his teacher, the Cynic Antisthenes, by appearing to
criticize him: “He’s the very man,” he said, “who made me
a beggar, who once was rich, and caused me to live in a clay
jar instead of my spacious house.” That was more effective
than if he were to say, “I’m grateful to him for making me a
philosopher and a man of perfect virtue.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL512_173_28" id="target_note_LCL512_173_28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p>22. ‘So, then, though “jibe” is a single term, it comprises
different effects. That’s why among all the other habits of
an austere life that Lycurgus established among the Spartans
there was this exercise too: young men learned both to
offers jibes that lacked a sting and to tolerate jibes directed
at them by others, and if any of them became indignant
because of such a jibe, he was thereafter forbidden to direct
one at another.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL512_173_29" id="target_note_LCL512_173_29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<p>23. Since you see, then, my friend
Avienus—and it is right that I shape your young mind,
which is so readily taught that it anticipates the lessons it
should learn—since you see, I say, that every sort of jibe is
a two-edged sword, I suggest that in banquets, where anger
sets traps for high spirited good humor, you avoid witticisms
of this sort and instead propose questions suitable
