<p>4. Nor do I deny
that I too could, as it were, have sung a palinode:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL512_189_37" id="target_note_LCL512_189_37"><sup>37</sup></a> it’s one
of the preliminary exercises in the schools of rhetoric to
treat general topics by arguing both sides in alternation.
But since an account by other Greeks will perhaps more
readily respond to the discoveries of Greeks, we all ask
you, Eustathius, to refute Dysarius’ positions with contrary
arguments and thereby reinstate the gaiety of our
banquet that was dishonorably dismissed.’</p>
<p>5. Eustathius tried for quite some time to beg off but
then gave in to the urging of so many distinguished men,
whose insistence was irresistible. ‘I am forced to declare
war,’ he said, ‘on two things very dear to me, Dysarius and
austerity, but relying on your authority, as though given a
waiver by the praetor’s edict,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL512_189_38a" id="target_note_LCL512_189_38a"><sup>38</sup></a> I shall present myself as appetite’s

<p>6. ‘First of all, the cleverness of our friend Dysarius
took us in with examples—as I shall show—more superficially
attractive than valid: for he said that farm animals
enjoy a plain diet, and that their health is therefore more
resistant to attack than ours. I shall prove that both these
propositions are false.</p>
