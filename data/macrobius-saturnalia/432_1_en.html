behind it (<span class="italic">A</span>. 1.42†):
<q><span class="line">With her own hand she hurled Jupiter’s swift bolt</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">from the clouds;</span><span class="linebreak"></span></q>
for Euripides brings Minerva onstage asking Neptune to
