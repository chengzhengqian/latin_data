stomach while the lung receives the latter.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL512_293_136" id="target_note_LCL512_293_136"><sup>136</sup></a> The lung is divided
by so many passageways and gapes with so many
fissures, not to provide exits for the breath (an unseen process
of exhalation would be enough for that), but so that
the juice could quickly pass over to the seat of digestion if
some food fell into the lung.</p>
<p>17. Further, if the <span class="italic">artêria</span>
chances to be severed, drink cannot be swallowed, but
with its proper path as it were split, it’s heaved back up and
out, leaving the stomach unaffected: this wouldn’t happen
if the <span class="italic">artêria</span> were not the path of moisture.</p>
<p>18. But this
point is obvious, too: people with an ailing lung burn with
extreme thirst, and that wouldn’t happen if the lung were
not drink’s proper repository. Consider this point too: creatures
without lungs do not drink.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL512_293_137" id="target_note_LCL512_293_137"><sup>137</sup></a> Nature created nothing
superfluous, but made the several limbs so that they
would somehow support life: when there is no use for it, it
is not missed.</p>
<p>19. ‘Or reflect on this: if the stomach received food and
drink, the bladder would have no use, since the stomach
could pass on the waste of both to the intestine, which now
receives only the waste of food, and there would be no
need for distinct passageways to convey them separately,
but a single passageway would be enough for both as they
were passed on from the same staging-point. As it is, the
bladder on one side and intestine on the other serve the
cause of health, since the stomach hands off to the latter,
the lung to the bladder.</p>
<p>20. Nor should we omit the fact
that in urine, the waste product of drink, no trace of food is
found, and it is not imbued with any property of food’s
waste, either in color or odor: but if they had been together
