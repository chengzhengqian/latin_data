<p>19. For trees and plants, too, the water and earth in which
they’re raised has more power and influence in improving
their quality or making it worse than the very seed from
which they’re sown: you would often see a productive tree
aglow with health be made sickly by the juice of inferior
soil if it is transplanted. For the purpose of reproaching
bad character, then, Homer lacked what Virgil added.</p>

<p>21. The Greek poet merely mentions that the horses are
running with the whip’s encouragement, though adding
“stepping high” is the most delicate possible touch, conveying
how much the horse’s nature contributes to the
race’s momentum.</p>
<p>22. But Maro described the chariots
rushing from the gate and hurrying over the field with
wonderful speed, and by taking over the germ of an idea
planted by Homer’s whip he painted a verbal picture of the
drivers “cracking their rippling lashes” and “leaning forward
to put more into the blow”: he touched on every
aspect of a chariot race to give a complete description of
the contest.</p>
