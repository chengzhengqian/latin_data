[<span class="italic">dicta</span>] not by chance but intentionally, since our ancestors
used that term for jokes of this sort, as Cicero himself attests
in Book 2 of his letters to Cornelius Nepos (fr. II.1):
“And so, though all the things we say [<span class="italic">dicere</span>] are ‘things

people could not begrudge us our jokes, even if we were to
indulge our own line of banter; but since we trace these
witticisms back to the ancients, the high standing of those
authors certainly provides us with cover. If you approve
what I’ve come up with, then, let’s all recount such <span class="italic">dicta</span> as
