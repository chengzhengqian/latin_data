<p>5. Homer, on Charybdis (<span class="italic">Od</span>. 12.236–43):</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">Terribly did she suck down the briny water of the sea;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">then when she spewed it out, like a cauldron on a</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">high blaze,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">she roared, all seething, and high up the foam fell</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">upon the tall cliffs on both sides.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">But when she gulped down the briny water of the</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">sea,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">all was seen to seethe within, the rocks all around</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">bellowed terribly, and below the sea bed was visible</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">with its dark sand. And pale fear seized them.</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p>6. Homer, on Scylla (<span class="italic">Od.</span> 12.85–97):</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">Within dwells Skylla, eerily puling,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">no louder than the sound of a new-born pup,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">but she herself is an evil monster: no one would be</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">glad</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">to look upon her, not even if a god should meet her.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Twelve feet she has, all like tentacles,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">six long necks, and on each neck</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">a gruesome head with three rows of teeth,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">close-packed and crowded, full of black death.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">She is hidden up to her middle in the hollow cave</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">but sticks her heads out of the dreadful hole:</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">there she fishes, scanning eagerly around her rock</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
