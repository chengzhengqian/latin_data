<p>21. They call the same god who presides over the sources
of health <span class="italic">Oulios</span>, or “author of well-being,” as Homer says
(<span class="italic">Od</span>. 24.402):
<q><span class="line">Health to you, and much joy.</span><span class="linebreak"></span></q>
Maeandrius writes (no. 491 fr. 2 <span class="italic">FGrH</span>) that the people
of Miletus sacrifice to Apollo <span class="italic">Oulios</span> for their health.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_219_412" id="target_note_LCL510_219_412"><sup>412</sup></a>
Pherecydes reports (no. 3 fr. 149 <span class="italic">FGrH</span> = fr. 149 <span class="italic">EGM</span>)
that when Theseus was brought to Crete to face the Minotaur,
he made a vow to Apollo <span class="italic">Oulios</span> and Artemis <span class="italic">Oulia</span> for
his safe return.</p>

are celebrated under different names, since we learn
that the other gods who have opposite effects in the same
sphere are judged to have a twofold power and a double
name, as in the case of Neptune, whom people call
now <span class="italic">Enosichthôn</span>, or “earth-shaker,” now <span class="italic">Asphaliôn</span>, or
“he who steadies.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_219_413" id="target_note_LCL510_219_413"><sup>413</sup></a> Similarly, Mercury both arouses and
lulls to sleep men’s minds or eyes, as the poet says (<span class="italic">Il</span>.

<blockquote><p><span class="line">He took up his wand with which he beguiles men’s</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">sight,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line"> &lt;those whom he wishes, and rouses them too when</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
