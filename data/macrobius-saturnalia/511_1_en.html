I to suppose that philosophy ought to be brought into a setting
where rhetoric, wholly a profession of the people,
blushed to come? For when the Greek orator Isocrates,
who first placed the restraints of rhythm on prose that was
previously free, was asked by his companions at a banquet
to give them a display from the well-spring of his eloquence,
he begged off on the following grounds: “I have no
knack for the things this place and time require; the things
I have a knack for are not suited to this place and time.”’</p>
<p>5. In response Eustathius said, ‘I agree with your goal,
Symmachus, of paying philosophy the greatest possible respect,
which makes you think that she should be worshipped
only within her own inner sanctum. But if she will
be exiled from banquets for this reason, then let the children
she fosters also keep far off—I mean, honorable behavior
and restraint, and dutiful devotion along with sobriety:
which of these am I to say is less worthy of respect than
philosophy? That way the chorus of such reverend matrons,
banished from gatherings of this sort, would award
the liberty of dinner parties to concubines alone, which is
to say, to vices and crimes.</p>

the lessons it regularly preaches, or would not know how
to limit itself when it has itself defined the appropriate
boundaries in all spheres of human behavior. Yet if I invite
philosophy to the dinner table, I do not mean that she is
to abandon self-control, when she is expert at teaching
self-control in all things.</p>

has in mind passages like Plut. <span class="italic">Mor</span> 629E (in a chapter imitated at
