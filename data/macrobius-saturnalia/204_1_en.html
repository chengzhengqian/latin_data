<p>17. ‘He shows that Aeneas is a pontiff even from the
term he uses for the narrative of his labors: for the pontiffs
were empowered to record the events of history,
and this record was called the “annals”—in fact, the “supreme
annals,” as if compiled by the supreme pontiffs.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL511_17_17" id="target_note_LCL511_17_17"><sup>17</sup></a>
For that reason the poet says, in the character of Aeneas
(<span class="italic">A.</span> 1.373†),</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">. . . and there is time free to hear the annals of great</span><span class="linebreak"></span>

<p>‘In the pontiffs’ edicts it is a matter of greatest concern<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span>
to determine what is “sacred” (<span class="italic">sacrum</span>), what “profane”
(<span class="italic">profanum</span>), what is “holy” (<span class="italic">sanctum</span>), what “filled with religious
scruple” (<span class="italic">religiosum</span>): we should therefore inquire
whether Virgil used each of these terms according to its
proper definition and maintained the precise force of each
word in his customary way.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL511_17_18" id="target_note_LCL511_17_18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>2. ‘The “sacred,” as Trebatius says in his first book <span class="italic">On
Religious Scruples</span>, is “whatever is considered to belong to
the gods” (fr. 1 <span class="italic">IAH</span> 1:404 = fr. 1 <span class="italic">IAR<sup>6</sup></span>). Mindful of this
definition, our poet almost always added mention of the
gods when he used the term “sacred” (A. 3.19):</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">I was making sacred offerings to my mother,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">daughter of Dione, and the gods,</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
