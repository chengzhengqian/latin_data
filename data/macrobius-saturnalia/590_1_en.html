<p>‘There you have a position to take on either side, Evangelus,
and if you you’ll suppress your mockery a bit, you
may ponder your choice.’</p>
<p>15. Evangelus said, ‘Since your aggressive chatter turns
even jokes into sober discussions, I’d like the two of you to
solve this puzzle for me, which I’ve really pondered for a
while. I was recently shown boars that the forest had offered
up to hunters on my estate at Tibur: since the hunt
went on for a while, some were brought in during the daytime,
others at night.</p>
<p>16. The meat of the former continued
to be intact and untainted, whereas those brought in at
night under a full moon turned putrid. When this was discovered,
the porters on the following night inserted a piece
of sharpened bronze in one or another part of the body and
brought the boars in with their flesh intact. Hence my
question: why did the moonlight harm the game that was
killed while the sun’s rays did not?’</p>
<p>17. ‘The answer is simple and straightforward,’ Dysarius
said.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL512_303_142" id="target_note_LCL512_303_142"><sup>142</sup></a> ‘Nothing ever putrefies save when heat and
moisture combine, and game putrefies only when a kind of
hidden discharge of fluid undermines the meat’s solidity
and turns it into liquid.</p>
<p>18. Now, if heat is balanced and
moderate, it favors the formation of moisture, while if it’s
excessive, it dries it up and reduces the meat’s bulk. Thus
the sun, being the greater source of heat, drains moisture
from the carcasses, whereas the moonlight, which lacks
outright heat but does have an imperceptible warmth,
does more to spread the moisture, and the result—with
the added warmth and increased moisture—is putrefaction.’</p>
<p>19. When Dysarius was finished, Evangelus looked at
Eustathius and said, ‘If you agree with this account, you
