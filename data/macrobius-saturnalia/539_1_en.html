<p>29. But it’s not enough just to offer an excuse for pleasure:
it should be praised, too. For food that’s consumed with
pleasure is drawn down eagerly and put away in a belly that
receives it readily in open anticipation; and while the belly
enjoys it energetically, it digests it promptly, which does
not happen in the same way to foods that have no allure of
their own to commend them. Why, then, do you accuse a
varied diet of stimulating appetite when a vigorous appetite

fails and is imperiled?</p>
<p>30. Pilots fly ahead with a following
wind even if it’s too strong, and they check its force when it
grows too great, but they cannot raise it when it falls. Just
so, reason, our pilot, tempers appetite when it is stimulated
and grows, but once it has fallen off, the living creature
is snuffed out.</p>

and which, in the interest of display more than utility,
scours every hidden place in the woods and troubles foreign
seas. Thus, even though the proper mean, when it’s
observed, does not harm diners’ health, luxury itself is still
a moral sickness.’</p>
<p>33. When these remarks had been well received,
Dysarius said, ‘You’ve followed the precepts of dialectic,
Eustathius, I of medicine:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL512_201_49" id="target_note_LCL512_201_49"><sup>49</sup></a> the person who wants to
