do not even think the passage is difficult, being
content themselves with the knowledge—which they pass
along to their students—that Palicus is the name of some
god. As to who the god is or how he got his name, their ignorance
is as complete as their indifference, since they
don’t even know where to begin to look, being as good as
Greek-less.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL511_449_89" id="target_note_LCL511_449_89"><sup>89</sup></a></p>

Book 1 of the <span class="italic">Georgics</span> (100–3):</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">Pray for damp solstices and calm winters,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>

<p>2. Not only is the meaning here rather obscure and the expression
a bit more tangled than usual for this poet, but the
passage involves a question derived from ancient Greece
that deserves notice: what is that “Gargara itself” that Virgil
held out as a model of fertility?</p>
<p>3. The Gargara in question
is in Mysia, a province on the Hellespont, but the
name has two different meanings, referring to two different
places: Gargara is the name of both the top of Mount
Ida and the town at foot of the mountain.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL511_449_90" id="target_note_LCL511_449_90"><sup>90</sup></a></p>
<p>4. Homer uses
the name of the mountain-top here (<span class="italic">Il.</span> 8.47–48):
<q><span class="line">He came to Ida, rich in springs, mother of beasts,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Gargaron.</span><span class="linebreak"></span></q>
