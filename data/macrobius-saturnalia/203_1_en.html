Vitula,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL511_15_13" id="target_note_LCL511_15_13"><sup>13</sup></a> and in proof adduces the fact that—when the Roman
people enjoyed a success on 8 July, after the Etruscans
had put them to flight the day before (hence that day’s
name, ‘Flight of the People’)—there was exuberant rejoicing
[<span class="italic">vitulatio</span>] after the victory, accompanied by specific
rites.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL511_15_14" id="target_note_LCL511_15_14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>15. Some people reckon that the goddess’ name
suggested itself because she has life-sustaining power, and
for this reason sacred rites are said to be performed for her
in return for the harvest, since it is through the harvest that
human life is sustained.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL511_15_15" id="target_note_LCL511_15_15"><sup>15</sup></a> It is for this reason, we remark,
 that Virgil says (<span class="italic">Ecl</span>. 3.77<sup>*</sup>),
<q><span class="line">When I make an offering with a calf [<span class="italic">vitula</span>] for the</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">harvest, may you come,</span><span class="linebreak"></span></q>
using “a calf” [<span class="italic">vitula</span>] in place of “exuberant rejoicing”
[<span class="italic">vitulatio</span>], which as I explained previously is the name of
the sacrifice performed for some joyous reason.</p>
<p>16. Still,
let us bear in mind that we should read this phrase with the
ablative case,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL511_15_16" id="target_note_LCL511_15_16"><sup>16</sup></a>
<q><span class="line">When I make an offering with a calf (<span class="italic">vitula</span>) for the</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">harvest, . . .”</span><span class="linebreak"></span></q>
that is, when I perform the religious rite not with a sheep,
not with a goat, but with a calf, as though to say “when I
shall sacrifice a calf for the harvest.”</p>
