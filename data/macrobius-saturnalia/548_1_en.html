the wine that remains in their veins, the sweetness thus
protecting the person from the evil of drunkenness. That,
then, is why must, which is merely sweet, does not make
someone drunk.</p>
<p>18. ‘But appropriate analysis produces this consideration
also: must is heavy, and because of its mixture of gas
and water and its own weight it quickly settles into the intestine
and is expelled.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL512_219_64" id="target_note_LCL512_219_64"><sup>64</sup></a> It does not stay in the areas of the
body subject to drunkenness, but after it has departed it
naturally leaves behind in a person the two qualities that
are essential to it, gas and water.</p>
<p>19. Now, gas is no less
heavy and so settles into the nether regions, whereas water
not only doesn’t drive one senseless but even dilutes
and quenches any remnant of wine’s residual strength.</p>
<p>20. That water is present in must is shown, moreover, by
the fact that when must ages, its volume decreases while
its strength increases, since the water that made it milder
has evaporated and only the essence of the wine remains,
strong and unimpeded, with no admixture of water to dilute
it and make it mild.’</p>
<p>After these remarks Rufius Albinus said, ‘I too will do<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">8</span><span class="br"></span>
my best not to leave our friend Dysarius idle.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL512_219_65" id="target_note_LCL512_219_65"><sup>65</sup></a> Please explain

digestion by removing whatever was heavy in the meat and
