So Aeschylus.</p>
<p>25. Callias, however, in Book 7 of his <span class="italic">History
of Sicily</span> writes (no. 564 fr. 1 <span class="italic">FGrH</span>): “Erykê is as much as
ninety stades from Gela; the location is tolerably secure
and . . . long ago was a city of the Sicilians. At its base, it
happens, are the so-called Delloi, two craters that the Sicilians
regard as the brothers of the Palikoi: from them a
bubbling arises that resembles boiling water.” So Callias.</p>
<p>26. But Polemon, in his book titled <span class="italic">On the Miraculous
Rivers of Sicily</span>, says (fr. 83 <span class="italic">FHG</span> 3:140–41):</p>
<p>The so-called Palikoi are believed by the inhabitants
to be gods native to the region. They have as brothers
craters sunk in the ground: those who approach
them must be free of pollution and abstain from sexual
intercourse, and also from certain foods.</p>
<p>27. The
heavy odor of brimstone rises from them and produces
a strange drowsiness in bystanders; their water
is foul, with a color very like white soapsuds, and
rises in frothing waves, like the swirling and bubbling
of water on a high boil. They say that these
craters are unfathomably deep, so that cattle that
fall into them and a mule-team driven into them
disappear, as do grazing mares that jump in them.</p>
