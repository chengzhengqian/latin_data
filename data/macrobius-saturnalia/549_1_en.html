<p>2. Dysarius replied, ‘The thing that causes you to suppose
that this food’s digestion is cared for in its preparation
is just what makes it difficult to digest. For the lightness
that the grinding produces causes it to float in the moist
food it encounters in the middle of the belly, preventing it
from sticking to the belly’s surface, which promotes digestion
with its warmth.</p>
<p>3. So too, when it’s tossed in water
right after it’s been ground and shaped, it floats: from that
you can gather what it does in the stomach’s moisture as it
distances itself from the necessity of digestion; so digestion
is then delayed, just as things that are steamed are broken
down more slowly than those that are seared. Furthermore,
while the meat is ground quite energetically a lot of
gas becomes wrapped up in it, and the belly has to dispose
of that first, so that what remains of the meat can finally be
digested when it’s free of the gas.’</p>

Rufius said.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL512_221_67" id="target_note_LCL512_221_67"><sup>67</sup></a> ‘Why is it that some people find it easier to
digest more robust forms of meat than those that are delicate?
For example, though they quickly digest chunks of
beef, they have a hard time digesting coarse fish.’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL512_221_68a" id="target_note_LCL512_221_68a"><sup>68</sup></a></p>
<p>5. ‘In
these cases,’ Dysarius said, ‘the source of the problem is
the person’s excessive warmth. If it encounters an appropriate
substance, it freely comes into contact with it, grapples
with it, and quickly finishes it off. But in the case of
insubstantial material, at one time it bypasses it as though
it failed to see it, at another it turns it into ash rather than
juice, just as fire turns massive oaks into glowing lumps of
charcoal, whereas if wheat chaff falls into a fire, only its
