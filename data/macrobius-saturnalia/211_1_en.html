whether “Penates” is the Trojans’ name for Apollo and
Neptune, who are said to have built Troy’s walls, and
whether Aeneas carried them to Italy. Cornelius Labeo,
too, takes the same view in his book on the Penates (fr. 12b
Mast.), which Maro follows when he says (<span class="italic">A.</span> 3.118–19†),</p>

Moreover, they say that Jupiter is fiery air in the

Dardanus founded the line of Trojan kings: the Samothracian origin
given him here points to the tradition that made him a son of
Zeus and Atlas’ daughter Electra. Awareness of the alleged link
