wishes: I come now to the place allotted to me for asking a
question—something I think worth knowing, which I put
to Dysarius again, someone I’m almost too fond of, a man
of supreme learning both in all other matters and in the
matter before us.</p>
<p>14. I was recently on my estate in Tusculum,
when the grapes were being picked at vintage-time
according to the annual custom.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL512_217_63" id="target_note_LCL512_217_63"><sup>63</sup></a> One could see the mingled
crowd of slaves and peasants drinking the must as it
was pressed from the grapes or flowed freely from them,
and yet they didn’t become drunk: I was especially surprised
in the case of those whom I knew to become crazy
drunk from a little wine. My question is, why does must

<p>15. Dysarius replied, ‘Everything sweet quickly leaves
one feeling he’s had enough and doesn’t long create the

Must, then, which is not yet pleasant but merely sweet,
doesn’t allow enough of itself to be consumed to cause
drunkenness, because of a certain repugnance.</p>
<p>17. I can
add another point: sweetness is so naturally resistant to
drunkenness that physicians force people whose stomachs
are dangerously swollen to vomit by giving them a great
deal of wine, and after they’ve vomited they give them
bread smeared with honey as an antidote to the fumes of
