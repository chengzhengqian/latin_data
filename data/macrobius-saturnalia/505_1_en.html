I said above, people who used to build large houses in
olden times usually left an empty space in front of the
doorway, between the doors and street.</p>
<p>20. People who
came to pay their morning respects to the master of the
house used to congregate in that space before they were
admitted and thus stood neither in the street nor within
the house. From the large space devoted to this congregation,
as a kind of stable area, the name <span class="italic">vestibula</span> was given
to the spaces where visitors did a lot of standing around
[<span class="italic">stare</span>] before being admitted to the house.</p>
<p>21. Others
agree that the <span class="italic">vestibula</span> are the areas I’ve described but
nonetheless disagree about the meaning of the word,
thinking that it applies not to the house’s visitors but to its
inhabitants, who spend time no time at all standing there
but only passing through as they’re leaving the house or returning</p>
<p>22. So, then, whether <span class="italic">ve</span> should be understood
here as conveying increased emphasis, as the former hold,
or decreased emphasis, as the latter, it is agreed that <span class="italic">vestibulum</span>
is the name given to the space that separates the
house from the street. The “opening” [<span class="italic">fauces</span>], on the
other hand, is the narrow passageway that leads from the
street to the <span class="italic">vestibulum.</span></p>
<p>23. Therefore, when Aeneas sees
the “opening” and “reception area” of the impious souls’
dwelling, he is not within the dwelling nor is he polluted by
contact with the dread and accursed building, but he is
looking from the street at the space between the street and
the building.’</p>
