<p>20. ‘Dysarius’ whole account,’ Eustathius said, ‘was
brilliantly said and correct. But we should consider more
closely whether the degree of heat is the cause of putrefaction,
so that it can be said that greater heat does not cause
it, but it issues from a lesser, moderate heat. For the sun’s
heat, which is too hot in the summer and mild in the winter,
causes meat to putrefy in the summer, not the winter.</p>
<p>21. The moon, then, doesn’t spread moisture because its
heat is milder, but moonlight has a certain peculiar property—the
Greek term is <span class="italic">idiôma</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL512_305_143" id="target_note_LCL512_305_143"><sup>143</sup></a>—and there is a certain
essence in the light which issues from it that makes bodies
moist and steeps them in a kind of imperceptible dew that,
mingled with the moon’s warmth, putrefies meat that’s
been infused with it for any length of time. 22. Not all heat
is of a single sort, so that the sole difference is whether
it’s greater or less, but as very clear evidence shows, there
are different kinds of fire that have nothing in common.</p>
<p>23. Goldsmiths use only fire fueled by wheat chaff to shape
their gold, since all other sorts are considered unsuitable
for working that material; but physicians prefer fire from
cut twigs to any other kind for concocting their cures.</p>
<p>24. Those who melt and shape glass feed their fire with
wood from the tree called the tamarisk; heat from olive
logs promotes the body’s health but is destructive for baths
and does great harm in loosening the joins of marble. It’s
not surprising, then, that the sun’s heat dries while the
moon’s moistens, by reason of the peculiar quality of each.</p>
