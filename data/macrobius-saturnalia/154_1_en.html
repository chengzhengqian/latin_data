their accomplishments up out of all proportion, we too
want to claim that even our poets are philosophers, when
Tully himself, who claimed to be a student of philosophy
no less than of speech, squanders what glory he accumulated
with his oratory thanks to the half-baked account he
provides the moment he speaks on the nature of the gods,
or on fate, or on divination.’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_309_591" id="target_note_LCL510_309_591"><sup>591</sup></a></p>
<p>5. Then Symmachus said, ‘As for Cicero, who shrugs off
insults—we’ll see about him later, Evangelus.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_309_592" id="target_note_LCL510_309_592"><sup>592</sup></a> Right now
Maro is our concern: so tell me, please, do you think his
works are fit only for teaching boys, or do you admit that
they have a deeper content? For you seem to me still to
think of Virgil’s verses the way we did as boys, when we
chanted them out for our teachers when they lectured.’</p>
<p>6. ‘Not at all, Symmachus: when we were boys we admired
the verses without judging them, and neither our
teachers nor our stage in life allowed us to take a good look
at the faults. Yet no one can brazenly deny they’re there,
seeing that he himself acknowledged them: why did he bequeath
his own poem to the flames on his death bed,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_309_593" id="target_note_LCL510_309_593"><sup>593</sup></a> if

be concealed from later generations?</p>

obviously he blushed to think of posterity’s verdict, if they
read of the goddess pleading with her husband to make
arms for her son (<span class="italic">A.</span> 8.370–86)—the only husband she’d
had, and she well knew she’d had no children by him!<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_309_594" id="target_note_LCL510_309_594"><sup>594</sup></a>—or
if they caught out the thousands of other deeply embarrassing
flaws, whether in his choice of words—now
Greek, now barbarous<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_309_595" id="target_note_LCL510_309_595"><sup>595</sup></a>—or in the very organization of
the work.’</p>
