of “filled with religious scruple.” Servius Sulpicius has recorded
(fr. 3 <span class="italic">IAH</span> 1:241 = fr. 14 <span class="italic">IAR<sup>6</sup></span>) that “religious scruple”
[<span class="italic">religio</span>] is the term attached to something that a certain
holiness makes remote and apart from us, as though
the term were derived from “to leave behind” [<span class="italic">relinquere</span>],
as “reverence” [<span class="italic">caerimonia</span>] is derived from “to be in want
of” [<span class="italic">career</span>].<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL511_23_21" id="target_note_LCL511_23_21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
