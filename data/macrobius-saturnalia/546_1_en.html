where there’s more warmth are most coated by hair. But
women’s bodies are smooth because they’re made dense
by their innate coolness: density accompanies chilliness,
and smoothness density.</p>

are the sign not of a large quantity of moisture but of
its poor quality. That which is expelled is raw and undigested:
as a feeble thing, it flows out and has no settled
resting place but is driven out as though naturally harmful
and cooler. The clearest token of this is the fact that
women tend also to become chilled when they’re purging,
