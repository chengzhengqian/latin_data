<p>11. ‘You should often call on the person who has given a
well-received recitation to tell about it, if you can, or who
has completed an embassy without a hitch and with a good
outcome, or was given a warm and friendly reception by
the emperor, or was the sole survivor, thanks to his cunning
or strength, when nearly his whole fleet was seized by pirates,
for even a long telling of such events scarcely satisfies
the speaker’s desire.</p>
<p>12. A person is also glad to be asked to
tell of a friend’s sudden stroke of good fortune, which on
his own he’d hesitate either to mention or to pass over in silence,
for fear of seeming boastful, on the one hand, or malicious,
on the other.</p>
<p>13. A person who takes pleasure in
hunting should be asked how he circled the forest, how he
wandered through the animals’ haunts, how he succeeded
in the hunt. If a devotee of religion is present, give him the
chance to tell of the observances that earned him the gods’

censors could place a mark (<span class="italic">nota</span>) next to the names of those they
found morally reprehensible (cf. 2.4.25). Inclusion of the custom
in these words of advice is a striking anachronism (it is not in
Plutarch): by the time M. was writing more than 450 years had
passed since the last censor had been elected, and more than
three centuries since an emperor (Domitian) had performed a
censor’s duties.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL512_161_13').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
