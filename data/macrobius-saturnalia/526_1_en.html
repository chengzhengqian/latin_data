for a banquet, or answer them yourself.</p>
<p>24. The ancients
were so far from thinking that activity frivolous that Aristotle
wrote some works on the subject and Plutarch and
your Apuleius:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL512_175_30" id="target_note_LCL512_175_30"><sup>30</sup></a> we should not condemn what so many
philosophers thought worthy of their attention.’</p>
<p>Praetextatus said, ‘Why is this sort of question urged<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span>
only on this young man, when it’s becoming for the elderly
as well? Come now, all of you who are here: let’s talk about
these topics that befit a banquet, and not just about food,
but whatever touches on our physical nature—especially
given that our friend Dysarius is here, whose learning and
skill will be able to contribute a very great deal to questions
of this sort. If it’s agreeable, let’s draw lots so that each
one of us in order might put forward a question that he
deems worth answering.’</p>
<p>2. With general agreement on
this point they all gave over to Praetextatus the role of
starting the discussion, so that once he had begun the rest
would have an example to follow in putting their questions
as the thread of the discussion unwound.</p>
<p>3. Then
Praetextatus said, ‘I want to know whether it is easier to digest
food that is plain or varied, since I see that many opt
for the latter, some for the former. There is in fact a kind of
austerity that is proud and defiant, a form of showing off,
while a fondness for eating wants to appear pleasant and
gracious by contrast. Given, then, that the one is censorious,
the other luxurious, I’d like to know which is better
suited to maintaining one’s health—and there’s no need to
seek out an authority with Dysarius here, since when it
comes to what’s right for the human body he’s no less
skilled than nature herself, the source and support of our
physical being. Please tell me, then, what medical science
urges on this question.’</p>
