the book that he wrote on drunkenness<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL512_209_56" id="target_note_LCL512_209_56"><sup>56</sup></a>—that women become
inebriated rarely, old men frequently, but he didn’t
include the reason either for the latter frequency or the
former rarity. Since this whole question is relevant to our
physical nature, which you ought to know, given both your
diligence and your profession, please reveal the reason for
the facts that he stated in rather gnomic form—if, at any
rate, you agree with the philosopher’s statement.’</p>
<p>16. Dysarius replied, ‘Aristotle was right about this as
about all else, nor could I fail to agree with a man whose
discoveries nature herself finds agreeable. Women (he
said) become drunk rarely, old men frequently. That two part
formulation is entirely reasonable, and each part depends
on the other: when we’ve learned what protects
women from drunkenness, we’ll at the same time grasp
what frequently drives old men to it—for the female body
and the body of an aged male are allotted natures that are
exact opposites.</p>
<p>17. A woman has the most moist sort of
body: this is shown by their smooth and radiant skin and
above all by their constant purgings,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL512_209_57" id="target_note_LCL512_209_57"><sup>57</sup></a> which relieve the
body of water. When, therefore, the wine they’ve drunk
spills into such a large collection of moisture, it loses its
force, becomes diluted, and cannot readily impinge on the
brain’s settled state when its strength has been snuffed out.</p>
<p>18. Further support for the truth of Aristotle’s statement
comes from the fact that the female body, which has to
perform frequent purgings, has been constructed with a
rather large number of cavities that open out into channels
and provide the passageways for the moisture that gathers
to be discharged:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL512_209_58" id="target_note_LCL512_209_58"><sup>58</sup></a> wine’s fumes quickly dissipate through
these cavities.</p>
<p>19. By contrast, an old man’s body is dry, as
the roughness and dullness of his skin show. That’s also
