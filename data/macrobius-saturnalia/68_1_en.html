those of other nations got the calculations wrong in
different ways, but all were in error. To limit myself to describing
the habits of a few areas: the Arcadians used to unfold
their year in three months, the Acarnanians in six,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_137_223" id="target_note_LCL510_137_223"><sup>223</sup></a>
