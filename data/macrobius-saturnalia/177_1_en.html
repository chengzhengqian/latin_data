<p>21. When in the triumviral period Augustus had written
some Fescinnine verses aimed at Pollio, the latter said,
“But I’ll keep my peace: it’s not easy to have a war of words
with a man who can sign your death warrant.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_355_62" id="target_note_LCL510_355_62"><sup>62</sup></a></p>
<p>22. When
Curtius, a Roman knight and extreme voluptuary, picked
up a scrawny thrush at one of Caesar’s banquets, he asked
if he’d be permitted to send it back: when the emperor replied,
“Of course,” he straightway threw it out the window.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_355_63a" id="target_note_LCL510_355_63a"><sup>63</sup></a></p>
<p>23. Unprompted, Augustus settled the debts of a
certain senator whom he liked, to the tune of 4,000,000
sesterces: by way of thanks, the man wrote only, “Nothing
for me?”</p>
<p>24. Whenever Augustus was beginning a new
project, his freedman Licinus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_355_64" id="target_note_LCL510_355_64"><sup>64</sup></a> made a large cash contribution.
In line with that custom he promised 100,000 sesterces
in a note in which part of the superscript bar extended
beyond the number specifying the amount, leaving
an empty space beneath:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_355_65" id="target_note_LCL510_355_65"><sup>65</sup></a> Caesar took the opportunity to
add another hundred thousand in his own hand, carefully
filling the space and making the writing match, and he received
the doubled amount. The freedman said nothing,
but the next time Caesar began a project he offered a gentle
reproach for what had been done by writing a note that
read, “My lord, to the expense of the new project I contribute
what you think right.”</p>

sung at weddings, with insults directed at the groom; the latter element
presumably explains the extended use here, where invective
poetry seems to be meant (for Augustus’ talent in this vein,
