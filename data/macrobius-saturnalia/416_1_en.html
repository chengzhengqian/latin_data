<p>16. So far as I know, absolutely no Latin author attests
who this god Palicus is, or rather the gods Palici (for there
are two), but Maro unearthed this lore from the most recondite
Greek sources.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL511_441_83" id="target_note_LCL511_441_83"><sup>83</sup></a></p>
<p>17. First of all, just as the river
Symaethus mentioned in this passage is in Sicily, so too the
gods Palici are worshipped in Sicily and are first attested in
the work of the tragedian Aeschylus—who was of course a
Sicilian<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL511_441_84" id="target_note_LCL511_441_84"><sup>84</sup></a>—in lines that also provide an explanation of their
name, what the Greeks call an “etymology.” But before I
quote Aeschylus’ lines, I should briefly set out the history
of the Palici.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL511_441_85a" id="target_note_LCL511_441_85a"><sup>85</sup></a></p>

nymph Thalia was impregnated by Jupiter and then, out of
fear of Juno, prayed that the earth would open up to receive
her. And it did. But when the infants that she had carried
in her womb came to term, the earth opened up again,
and the two babies who came forth from Thalia’s womb
were named the Palici, from “coming back again” (<span class="italic">palin

and then came back out again.</p>
<p>19. Not far from that spot
are pools that are not far across but immeasurably deep,
their boiling surface always bubbling. The inhabitants refer
to them as the “Mixing Bowls”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL511_441_86" id="target_note_LCL511_441_86"><sup>86</sup></a> and give them the
name “Delli,” taking them to be the brothers of the Palici:
they are a very important cult center, where the divine
power is shown to be especially effective in enforcing oaths
in their presence.</p>
