why people at this stage in life are less flexible, which is evidence
of dryness. In old men wine does not encounter
a contrary moisture to oppose it, so it fastens onto the
dry body with its strength intact and quickly occupies the
places that provide a person with good sense.</p>
<p>20. There’s
also no doubt that old men’s bodies are hard, so that the
natural passageways become occluded in their harder
limbs, and the wine they’ve drunk has no chance to dissipate
but instead rises undiminished to the seat of the
mind.</p>
<p>21. That’s why even healthy old men suffer from the
same ills as drunks: their limbs shake, their tongues are unsteady,
they talk a lot and are prone to anger—conditions
to which drunk young men are as subject as sober old men.
Once they’ve borne wine’s onslaught in even a slight form,
these woes, by which they’re already beset because of their

you’re wrong to think that women’s nature is cool: if you’re
agreeable, I’ll easily demonstrate that it’s warmer than a
man’s.</p>
<p>3. The natural moisture in a body past childhood
hardens and is sharpened into bristles: that’s why at that
age the pubic area, the cheeks, and other parts of the body
take on a coating of hair. But in a woman’s body the warmth
dries this moisture and results in a dearth of hair, and that’s
why the female body remains smooth and radiant.</p>
