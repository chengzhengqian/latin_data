custom is a practice established by our forefathers pertaining
to the religious beliefs and rituals of our ancestors.”</p>
<p>10. Virgil, then, followed both authorities: to start with,
since Varro had said that the custom comes first and is followed
by common practice, Virgil added, to “it was the custom,”
both “one that the towns of Alba Longa from there
on kept” and “Rome, greatest city in the world, now tends,”
pointing to the enduring usage.</p>
<p>11. And since Festus says
that it pertains to religious rituals, Maro taught the same
lesson by adding the word “sacred”: “one that the towns
of Alba Longa from there on kept sacred.”</p>
<p>12. Thus the
custom came first, the maintenance of the custom—that
is, common practice—second, thereby satisfying Varro’s
definition. Then by adding “sacred,” he showed that the
custom was devoted to a religious ritual, as Festus claimed.</p>
<p>13. He had the same definition in mind in Book 12, too,
when he says (A. 12.836–37):<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL511_63_70" id="target_note_LCL511_63_70"><sup>70</sup></a>

and the rest. For he maintained the sequence of the kingdoms,
the Latins ruling first, then the people of Alba
