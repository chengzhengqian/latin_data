matter, what is the principle behind vision itself—a question
on which some people hold views that are neither true
nor plausible?’</p>
<p>2. Dysarius said, ‘Water is denser, air thinner, and so
our vision penetrates the former more slowly: striking up
against it and bouncing back, our line of vision becomes divided
and collides with itself. When it turns back after being
divided, it meets the image’s contours not head on but
from every direction, and so it happens that the image we
see seems larger than its original. The sun’s orb in the
morning also appears larger than usual because the atmosphere
between the sun and us is still dewy from the night,
and the sun’s image increases in size as though it were being

given the support of Democritus, since in this as in all

<p>4. Epicurus, then,
holds that images of a sort emanate from all objects in a
continuous stream, nor does a moment go by in which
objects do not throw off cohesive but insubstantial trace-images

hasten toward the seat assigned to them by nature.
These are the great man’s views: if you oppose them, I look
forward to learning what you have to say.’</p>
<p>5. Eustathius replied with a smile, ‘It’s clear what misled
Epicurus: he diverged from the truth by relying on the
analogy of the other four senses, since in hearing, tasting,
