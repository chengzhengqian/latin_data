<p>28. ‘At a banquet he was delighted by the musicians of
the slave-dealer Toronius Flaccus and, though he had rewarded
other entertainers with cash, he gave these the gift
of a grain ration.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_359_69" id="target_note_LCL510_359_69"><sup>69</sup></a> When he subsequently asked for the
same musicians to entertain at another banquet, Toronius
offered his regrets, saying, “They’re milling the grain.”</p>
<p>29. ‘When he was returning to Rome on top of the
world after his victory at Actium, one of those who ran to
congratulate him was holding a raven that he had taught to
say, “Hail Caesar, the victorious commander.” Marveling
at the dutiful bird, Caesar bought it for 20,000 sesterces.
The trainer’s confederate, who had gained nothing from
this generous act, swore to Caesar that the man had another
raven, too, which Caesar asked to be shown. When it
was brought out it spoke the words it had been taught:
“Hail the victorious commander, Antony.” Nothing fazed,
Caesar thought it sufficient that the trainer divide the gift
with his mate.</p>
<p>30. When he was similarly greeted by a parrot,
he ordered its purchase and, admiring a magpie with
the same skill, he bought it too. Seeing this, a poor shoemaker
was moved to teach a raven to give the same salute:
but after he’d spent his last penny on the bird—which remained
mute—he kept saying, over and over, “My effort
and my money, down the drain.” At length, however, the
raven began to repeat the greeting it was taught; but when
Augustus heard it as he was passing by, he said in response,
“I have greeters of that sort in abundance at home.” The
raven still remembered hearing his master’s complaint,
and so ended by saying, “My effort and my money, down
the drain.” That made Caesar laugh, so he had the bird
purchased at a price higher than all the rest.</p>
