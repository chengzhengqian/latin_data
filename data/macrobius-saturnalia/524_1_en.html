Socrates challenged Critobulus, a young man famous for
his good looks, to a beauty context, he was making a joke,
not engaging in mockery.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL512_171_24" id="target_note_LCL512_171_24"><sup>24</sup></a> And surely, were you to say to
a man whose wealth lacked nothing, “I’m setting your
creditors on you,” or to an exceedingly chaste man, “You
have the whores’ gratitude for enriching them with your
unflagging bounty,” both would be pleased, knowing
that these witticisms put no strain on their consciences.</p>

though they appear to offer praise: this was the
distinction I drew not long ago. For if I were to say to a very
fearful person, “You should be compared with Achilles or

there are some remarks we’re glad hear if they’re made
about us when friends are present, but when a wife or parents
or teachers are present we don’t want to be the object
of a jibe, unless it’s such that their own strict moral sense
would be glad to hear:</p>
<p>19. for example, if someone were to
make fun of a young man in his parents’ or his teachers’
presence for risking his mental health by continuously
staying up late into the night to read, or if someone were to
make fun of a man in his wife’s presence for playing the
fool by showing his devotion to his wife and never having a
choice bit on the side. Both the targets of these remarks
and those present to hear them find them quite amusing.</p>
