<p class="noindent">circumstances that expressly set the grove apart from
the people’s possession. Moreover, to make plain that the
place was not abandoned [<span class="italic">relictum</span>] just because it was difficult
of access, he also added the fact that it was “holy” (<span class="italic">A.</span>
8.600–601):</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">Tradition has it that the ancient Pelasgians hallowed</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">it to Silvanus,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">God of fields and the herd . . .</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p>10. According to Pompeius Festus, those who can distinguish
the things they ought to do from the things they
ought to avoid are “filled with religious scruple.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL511_25_22" id="target_note_LCL511_25_22"><sup>22</sup></a> Accordingly,
Maro says (<span class="italic">G.</span> 1.269–70*†),

By “drawing down” he just means “clearing out”: for on
holidays [<span class="italic">dies festi</span>] it is permitted to clear out old streambeds
that have become silted up, but not to dig new ones.</p>
<p>11. I should note in passing this point, too, which the poet
himself also made by the way, relying on a single word’s
suggestiveness. Pontifical law stipulates that—whereas
sheep are usually washed for two reasons, either to treat
their mange or to clean their wool—on holidays it is
not permitted to wash them to clean their wool, but washing
is permitted if their mange can be cleared up by the
treatment.</p>
<p>12. That is why our poet counted the following
among the permitted activities (<span class="italic">G.</span> 1.272):
