more on this subject, since that exceptionally learned man
Eustathius pursued this subject more fully a little earlier.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL511_11_7" id="target_note_LCL511_11_7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>7. ‘We can often discover our poet’s profound learning
in a single word that ordinary readers suppose was used
at random.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL511_11_8" id="target_note_LCL511_11_8"><sup>8</sup></a> For example, we find it written in many places
that speech alone cannot propitiate the gods unless the
person praying also takes hold of the altar with his hands.</p>
<p>8. That is why Varro, in the fifth book of his <span class="italic">Divine Antiquities</span>
(fr. 66), says that altars [<span class="italic">area</span>] were first called <span class="italic">asae</span>,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL511_11_9" id="target_note_LCL511_11_9"><sup>9</sup></a>
because people offering sacrifice had to grasp them—and who would doubt that vessels are usually grasped by
means of handles [<span class="italic">ansae</span>]?—and that by a change of letters
they began to be called <span class="italic">arae</span>, just as people once called
the “Valesii” and “Fusii” are now called the “Valerii” and
“Furii.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL511_11_10a" id="target_note_LCL511_11_10a"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>9. The poet covered all this ground in the following
verse (<span class="italic">A.</span> 4.219–20†):<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL511_11_11" id="target_note_LCL511_11_11"><sup>11</sup></a>
<q><span class="line">As with such words he prayed and grasped the altar,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">the All-Powerful One paid heed. . . .</span><span class="linebreak"></span></q>
Surely you accept that “paid heed” was added, not because
he was merely praying, but because he was also grasping
the altar? And so too when Virgil says (<span class="italic">A.</span> 6.124),

s later becoming <span class="italic">r</span>, as Varro said, by a process called rhotacism—and
it was not unreasonable to suspect a link between <span class="italic">asa</span>
and <span class="italic">ansa</span>, since many words spelled with an internal or terminal <span class="italic">ns</span>
in Varro’s day had earlier been spelled with <span class="italic">s</span> (e.g., <span class="italic">consul</span> vs. <span class="italic">cosul</span>;
the <span class="italic">n</span> between the vowel and <span class="italic">s</span> was not pronounced). But the point of the rhetorical question that introduces <span class="italic">ansae</span> is obscure, and
the sequence of thought in the passage was perhaps condensed or
garbled by M. when he derived it from his likely source, Aelius
Donatus. In any case, <span class="italic">asa</span>, which is cognate with Engl. “ash,” is
unrelated to <span class="italic">ansa.</span></a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL511_11_10a').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL511_11_11"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL511_11_11" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">11</sup>Cf. also Serv. on <span class="italic">A.</span> 6.124.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL511_11_11').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
