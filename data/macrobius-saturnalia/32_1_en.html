the name Rod [<span class="italic">scipio</span>] and passed what began as a surname
on to his descendants as part of the family name. So
too, Avienus, your own Messala<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_65_83" id="target_note_LCL510_65_83"><sup>83</sup></a> got his name from the
Valerius Maximus who received the surname Messala after
capturing Messana, the most renowned city in Sicily.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_65_84" id="target_note_LCL510_65_84"><sup>84</sup></a></p>
