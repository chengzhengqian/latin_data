creatures either walk or creep or they live by swimming or
flying.</p>

their being in an egg; all flying creatures are produced
from eggs save for one whose nature is uncertain—for the
bat certainly flies with wings of hide, but should not be
counted among the flying creatures because it walks on
four feet and bears fully-formed whelps and nurses them

before the chicken is like saying a womb came to be
before a woman: asking how a chicken could exist without
an egg is like asking how humans were produced before
the genitals instrumental in their procreation. So just as no
