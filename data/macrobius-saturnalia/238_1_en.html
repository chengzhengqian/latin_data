depth of his learning that caused him to assign Salii to Hercules,
because that god is also identified with Mars by

Menippean satire titled <span class="italic">This One’s Another Hercules,</span>
where in speaking about Hercules the Invincible (fr. 20

discusses the meaning of “festra” (a very small opening in a
shrine), a word that Ennius also used.</p>

others like them bother us, let’s out with them, so that
airing them might free us—not Maro—of error.’</p>
