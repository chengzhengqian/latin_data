spring from the same beginning, enjoy the same heaven,

human beings. “They’re slaves”: no, fellow slaves, if you reflect
that chance has the same power over us both. You can
look on him as a free man as easily as he can see you as a
slave. Are you unaware how late in life Hecuba was enslaved,
or Croesus, or Darius’ mother, or Diogenes, or
Plato himself?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_115_183" id="target_note_LCL510_115_183"><sup>183</sup></a></p>
<p>8. Finally, why does the name “slave”
make us shudder? “He’s in fact a slave”: but from force
of circumstances—yet perhaps his mind is free. “He’s a
slave”: this will count against him if you show who is not.
One man is a slave to lust, another to greed, another to ambition—and
we’re all slaves to hope and to fear. And surely
no slavery is worse than the one we chose for ourselves.</p>
<p>9. Yes, we trample on the man who lies fallen beneath the
yoke that bad luck has put upon him, as though he were
wretched and of no account—but we don’t stand criticism
for the yoke that we’ve placed on our own necks.</p>
<p>10. ‘You will find among slaves someone who can’t be
bribed, and you’ll find a master who from hope of gain
plants kisses on the hands of another man’s slaves: I will
therefore judge a man’s value not according to his luck but
according to his character, for each of us is responsible for
his character, while chance determines our circumstances.
If someone intent on buying a horse inspects its blanket
and bridle, but not the horse itself, he’s a fool;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_115_184" id="target_note_LCL510_115_184"><sup>184</sup></a> more
foolish still is the man who thinks a person’s worth can
be judged either from his garments or from the circumstances
that merely enfold us like a garment.</p>
