<p>When all present had praised Albinus’ memory as a<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span>
storehouse of antique lore, Praetextatus noticed Avienus
whispering to Rufius Albinus and said, ‘Why in the world,
my dear Avienus, do you want to keep secret from the rest
of us what you’ve disclosed to Albinus alone?’</p>
<p>2. Then
Avienus: ‘I am of course much moved by Caecina’s authority,
and I know full well that such great learning is not subject
to error: still, my ears were struck by his novel usage,
when he chose to say “by night to come” [<span class="italic">noctu futura</span>]
and “on the day of tomorrow” [<span class="italic">die crastini</span>] rather than
“on the coming night” [<span class="italic">futura nocte</span>] and “tomorrow” [<span class="italic">die
crastino</span>], according to the rules of grammar.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_31_40" id="target_note_LCL510_31_40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<p>3. For <span class="italic">noctu</span>
is an adverb, not a noun; furthermore, <span class="italic">futura</span>, which is
an adjective, cannot be used with an adverb. And it’s certainly
the case that <span class="italic">noctu</span> and <span class="italic">nocte</span> differ from each other
in same way as <span class="italic">diu</span> [an adverb] and <span class="italic">die</span> [a noun]. As for
<span class="italic">die</span> and <span class="italic">crastini</span>, they’re not in the same grammatical case,
and only the same case can link words in this kind of
phrase. Then there’s <span class="italic">Saturnaliorum</span>: I’d like to know why
we would choose to use that form rather than <span class="italic">Saturnalium</span>.’</p>
<p>4. As Caecina smiled silently in response, Symmachus
asked Servius what he thought of these matters:
‘Though in this gathering,’ he said, ‘which demands respect
no less for its learning than for its nobility, it is more
fitting for me to learn than to teach, I will do Symmachus’
bidding and speak first about the word <span class="italic">Saturnalia</span>, then
about the rest, to show that no novel usage is involved in
speaking thus.’</p>
<p>5. ‘Someone who says <span class="italic">Saturnalium</span> relies upon the rule
that nouns with a dative plural ending in –<span class="italic">bus</span> never allow
the genitive plural to be a syllable longer than the dative: it
either has the same number of syllables, like <span class="italic">monilibus</span>
