<p>4. About this law Serenus Sammonicus says,</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">The law of Fannius, my most holy eminences,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL511_121_144a" id="target_note_LCL511_121_144a"><sup>144</sup></a></span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">came before the people backed by the huge consensus</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">of all the citizen ranks, and it was not the praetors</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">or tribunes who brought it, as they do most</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">other laws, but the consuls themselves, in accordance</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">with the considered judgment of all good</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">men, since extravagant banqueting was inflicting</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">incredible damage on the commonwealth and matters</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">had reached the point that very many freeborn</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">boys, caught in luxury’s snare, were peddling their</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">chastity and freedom and many of the plebs were</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">coming to the comitium completely soused and</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">reaching decisions touching the commonwealth’s</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">safety while drunk.</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p>5. So Sammonicus. Fannius’ law was stricter than Orchius’
in that the earlier law limited only the number of banqueters
and so permitted every individual to gobble up
his estate with a few companions, whereas Fannius’ law
also limited expenditures to 100 asses, leading the poet
Lucilius to call it (1192), with his customary wit, the “100-
<span class="italic">as</span>” law.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL511_121_145" id="target_note_LCL511_121_145"><sup>145</sup></a></p>
