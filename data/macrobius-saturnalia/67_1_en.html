the oracle showed that “heads” meant “figurine heads,” not
“human heads,” and that <span class="italic">phôs</span> could mean both “person”
and “lights,” the Pelasgi began to light candles to Saturn
and to bring a kind of mask, in place of their own heads,
to the shrine of Dis<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_135_218" id="target_note_LCL510_135_218"><sup>218</sup></a> contiguous with Saturn’s altar.</p>
<p>49. From there was handed down the custom of exchanging
candles on the Saturnalia and purchasing figurines
fashioned from clay for people to offer to Saturn, in place
of Dis, in expiation of themselves and their kin.</p>
<p>50. That’s
why those common exchanges, begun on the Saturnalia,
extend for seven days, which makes them only festive days
[<span class="italic">festi</span>], not all days of religious observance [<span class="italic">feriati</span>],<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_135_219" id="target_note_LCL510_135_219"><sup>219</sup></a> since

interposed: ‘Won’t you go on, Praetextatus, and extend
your pleasant discourse to the year also, before you’re
burdened with questions, in case anyone present does not
know how the earliest people organized the year and how
it was later reorganized along more reliable lines? You
yourself, I think, have whetted your listeners’ appetite for
this lesson by talking about the days that were added to the
month.’ Then the other picked up the thread of his remarks
and wove together all that follows:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_135_221" id="target_note_LCL510_135_221"><sup>221</sup></a></p>
