name to sumptuary laws [fr. 143 <span class="italic">ORF</span><sup>2</sup>]). Then after a few
years Antius Restio brought another law before the
people<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL511_127_152a" id="target_note_LCL511_127_152a"><sup>152</sup></a>—an excellent law, yet rendered null and void,
not because it was formally repealed, but because luxury
was firmly planted and the vices were united in an unshakable
alliance. Still, one memorable thing is recalled about
Restio, the law’s mover: afterwards, and for as long as
he lived, he never dined out, lest he witness the disdain
heaped on the law that he himself had carried for the common
