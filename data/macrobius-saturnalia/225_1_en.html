not “goddess.” There’s also a statue of Venus on Cyprus
that’s bearded, shaped and dressed like a woman, with a
scepter and male genitals, and they conceive her as both
male and female.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL511_59_65" id="target_note_LCL511_59_65"><sup>65</sup></a></p>
<p>3. Aristophanes called her <span class="italic">Aphroditos</span>
(fr. 325 <span class="italic">PCG</span> 3,2:180), and Laevius says (fr. 26 <span class="italic">FPL<sup>3</sup></span>):
<q><span class="line">Worshipping, then, the nurturing god [<span class="italic">almus</span>] Venus,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">whether she is female or male,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">just as the Night-shiner [= moon] is a nurturing</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">goddess.</span><span class="linebreak"></span></q>
In his <span class="italic">Atthis</span> Philochorus, too, states (no. 328 fr. 184 <span class="italic">FGrH</span>)
that she is also the moon and that men sacrifice to her in
women’s dress, women in men’s, because she is held to be
both male and female.</p>
<p>4. ‘Virgil’s shrewdness in matters of religious practice is
the source of this passage too (<span class="italic">A</span>. 5.517–18*):
<q><span class="line">It fell dead and left its life among the sky-high</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">stars. . . .</span><span class="linebreak"></span></q>
Speaking about the stars and planets in his <span class="italic">On the Gods’
Attributes</span>, Hyginus says (fr. 1 p. 42 Bunte) that birds are
properly sacrificed to them: hence Virgil’s erudite statement
that the bird’s life-spirit remained with the divinities
to which it was given as an acceptable offering.</p>
