<p>10. In Book 4 of the <span class="italic">Divine Antiquities</span> Varro judges (fr. 61)
that Hercules was called “victor” because he defeated every
sort of animal. At Rome, however, there are two temples
of Hercules Victor, one by the porta Trigemina, the
other in the forum Boarium.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL511_49_53a" id="target_note_LCL511_49_53a"><sup>53</sup></a></p>
<p>11. Masurius Sabinus explains
the origin of this surname differently in Book 2 of

Thus he gave the god a title that both represented Hercules’
