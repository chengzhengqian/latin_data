is in their bodies also this further indication of warmth: the
abundance of blood, which is by nature hot and is drawn
off by frequent purgings, lest it burn the body were it to
become settled. Who, then, would maintain that they’re
cool, when no one can deny that they’re warm because
they’re full of blood?</p>
<p>5. Furthermore, though we no longer
follow the practice of burning the dead,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL512_213_60" id="target_note_LCL512_213_60"><sup>60</sup></a> we learn from
our reading that in the period when cremation was considered
a way of honoring the dead, if it ever turned out that
a number of corpses were to be burned at the same time,
the funeral attendants usually added one female corpse
for every ten male corpses: with the addition of this one
corpse—fiery by nature, as it were, and therefore quick to
burn—all the rest caught fire.</p>
<p>6. Thus the ancients too
were aware of women’s innate warmth. I’ll add this point
too: since heat is always the cause of procreation, women
become suitable for that purpose more quickly than boys,
because they are naturally warmer: according to public
law, too, the twelfth year marks puberty in the case of a

<p>7. No need to
go on, I think: don’t we observe that when it’s very cold
women can make do with a moderate amount of clothing
and they’re not wrapped in blankets as men usually are,
because (of course) their innate warmth combats the chill
that the air lets loose upon them?</p>
<p>8. Smiling in response, Symmachus said, ‘Our friend
Horus bids fair to appear an orator instead of a Cynic, turning
on their heads the perceptions that could be taken to
prove the innate coolness of women’s bodies. In fact it’s
lack of warmth that causes them to be less hairy than
men.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL512_213_62" id="target_note_LCL512_213_62"><sup>62</sup></a> It’s heat that produces hair, and that’s why eunuchs
