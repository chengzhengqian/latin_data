did he determine that it would be continually dry or always
damp, since a single property could not support us, who
are compounded of four mingled properties. So he made
the spring warm and damp, while the summer dry and hot,
the autumn dry and cold, the winter both damp and cold.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL512_197_44" id="target_note_LCL512_197_44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>
<p>21. So too the elements that are our basic constituents
themselves consist of different qualities and sustain us
thereby: fire is hot and dry, air is hot and damp, water is
likewise damp but cold, earth is both cold and dry.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL512_197_45" id="target_note_LCL512_197_45"><sup>45</sup></a> Why,
then, do you restrict us to a simple diet when nothing
around us or in us or in the things of which we’re composed
is simple?</p>
<p>22. As for your attempt to attribute to a varied
diet the fact that food in the stomach turns acidic or sometimes
gives off fumes, you have to claim either that a person
who enjoys a varied diet always suffers these symptoms
or that a person who has a plain diet never suffers them.
But if someone who enjoys an abundant meal often escapes
this problem and someone who treats himself with a
plain diet often does suffer the condition you censure, why
do you attribute this to the variety of food and not the
proper limit placed on consumption? For a greedy consumer
of plain food suffers the ill of indigestion, and a
moderate partaker of varied food enjoys the benefit of
good digestion.</p>
<p>23. ‘“But,” you’ll say, “loss of self-control itself arises
from taking a range of different foods, as the appetite is
stimulated and urges consumption of more than is necessary.”</p>
<p>24. I return again to my earlier statement: indigestion
results from the amount, not the character, of the
food. Someone with self-control observes a proper limit
even at a meal of Sicilian or Asian proportions,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL512_197_46" id="target_note_LCL512_197_46"><sup>46</sup></a> while a
