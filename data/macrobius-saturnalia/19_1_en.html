certainly permissible to say both <span class="italic">Saturnalium</span> et <span class="italic">Saturnaliorum</span>:
the one form is supported by the grammatical rule
and authoritative usage, while the other is supported by
authoritative usage alone—but it is the usage of many.</p>
<p>17. ‘As for the other words that struck our friend
Avienus as novel, we must champion them by relying on
the ancients’ testimony.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_39_52" id="target_note_LCL510_39_52"><sup>52</sup></a> For Ennius—unless one thinks
he fails the test of elegance in our refined age—used the
phrase <span class="italic">noctu concubia</span> in these verses (<span class="italic">Ann</span>. 227 Sk.):</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">And at that bedding down time of night [<span class="italic">noctu</span></span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2"><span class="italic">concubia</span>] the Gauls stole over</span><span class="linebreak"></span>

<p>18. Here we should note that he not only used the phrase
<span class="italic">noctu concubia</span> but also the phrae <span class="italic">qua noctu</span>. This was in
Book 7 of the <span class="italic">Annals</span>; in Book 3 he gives clearer testimony
(<span class="italic">Ann</span>. 142 Sk.):</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">On this night [<span class="italic">hac noctu</span>] all of Etruria will hang by a</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">thread.</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">Claudius Quadrigarius, too, in Book 3 of his <span class="italic">Annals</span> (fr. 44):
“The senate, however, was convening by night, and in deep
night (<span class="italic">multa noctu</span>) was sent back home.”</p>
<p>19. While we’re
on this topic it’s not beside the point, I think, to remark that
in the Twelve Tables the Board of Ten<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_39_53" id="target_note_LCL510_39_53"><sup>53</sup></a> used “night” [<span class="italic">nox</span>]
in place of “by night” [<span class="italic">noctu</span>] in a most extraordinary way
(1.17 <span class="italic">RS</span>): “If (someone) committed theft by night [<span class="italic">nox</span>], if
(someone) committed murder [lit. ‘killed him’], let him be
rightly put to death”—where it should also be noted that
for the pronoun ‘he’ they used <span class="italic">im</span>, not <span class="italic">eum</span>, in the accusative
case.</p>
