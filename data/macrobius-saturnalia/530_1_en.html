it becomes the liver’s concern. Now, the liver is congealed
blood and for that reason is innately hot: it turns the processed
juice into blood, and just as the conversion of food
to juice was the first digestion, so the passage of juice into
blood is the second.</p>
<p>20. When this process is complete,
the liver’s heat disperses the blood to each of the limbs
through the veins’ channels, with the coolest among the
digested elements spilling into the spleen, which is the
body’s cooling center, as the liver is the center of warmth.</p>
<p>21. That’s why the whole right side of the body is sturdier,
the left weaker: the former is guided by the warmth of the
innards on that side, the latter is enfeebled by contact with
the cold that grips the left.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL512_183_34" id="target_note_LCL512_183_34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<p>22. Now, the third digestion
occurs in the veins and arteries, which are the receptacles
of blood and breath. For when they’ve received the blood
they filter out the wastes, as it were: the veins deposit in the
bladder the part that’s watery and serve up to the body’s
several limbs blood that’s clear and pure and rich in nutrients:
so it happens that though only the belly takes in food,
the food’s nutrients are dispersed through all of the limbs’
passages and also feed the bones and marrow and nails and
hair.</p>
<p>23. This is the fourth digestion: it occurs in the several
limbs, as the nutrients given to each become the sustenance
for that specific limb. And yet though the material
has been filtered so many times, it is not free of waste products,
which—when all the limbs are fit and healthy—disappear
through invisible passageways.</p>
<p>24. But if some part
of the body is ailing, the final waste products I mentioned
subside into that very part, as if seeking out the weaker,
and this is origin of the diseases that physicians customarily
call <span class="italic">rheumata</span> [“fluxes”].</p>
<p>25. For if the amount of this
final juice is greater than it ought to be, the healthier part
