covered with an ivy wreath,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_261_496" id="target_note_LCL510_261_496"><sup>496</sup></a> which shows that the onslaught
of war should be held in check, as it were, by the
bondage of forbearance, for ivy has the natural capacity to
bind and hold in check. Wine’s heat, too, for which father
Liber is the source, often drives men to the frenzy of war.</p>
<p>3. Because their characteristic actions derive from kindred
kinds of heat, men have claimed that Mars and Liber are
one and the same god. The Romans, certainly, worship
both under the description of “father,” calling one “father
Liber,” the other “Marspiter,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_261_497" id="target_note_LCL510_261_497"><sup>497</sup></a> that is, “father Mars.”</p>
<p>4. Father Liber is also shown to be a god of war, because
they have claimed that he is the originator of the triumphal
procession.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_261_498" id="target_note_LCL510_261_498"><sup>498</sup></a> Since father Liber is the same as the sun,
and Mars is the same as father Liber, who would doubt that
Mars is the sun?</p>
<p>5. The Accitani, a people of Spain,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_261_499" id="target_note_LCL510_261_499"><sup>499</sup></a> have
a very important cult in which they worship a statue of
Mars decorated with the sun’s rays, calling him Neton.</p>
<p>6. And of course natural science requires us to believe that
the gods who are the sources of heavenly heat are distinct
in their names rather than in their essential substance:
so the boiling heat that sets the mind ablaze and
stirs it now to anger, now to deeds of valor, sometimes, too,
to wild acts of temporary madness—all these being the
causes of wars—they named “Mars,” whose force the poet
expressed through the simile of fire, saying (<span class="italic">Il</span>. 15.605):
