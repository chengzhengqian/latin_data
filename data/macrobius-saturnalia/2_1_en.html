fund of knowledge. If ever the need arises for a piece of
history, say, that lurks hidden from the common run of
men in a mass of books, or to call to mind some memorable
deed or saying, you will be able to find and produce it easily
as though from your own private store of culture.</p>
<p>3. Nor have I haphazardly deployed these items that are
worth remembering, as though in a heap: I have organized
the diverse subjects, drawn from a range of authors and a
mix of periods, as though in a body, so that the things I initially
noted down all a jumble, as an <span class="italic">aide mémoire</span>, might

that I have sought out in my varied reading, so that by
being arranged consistently it will come together in an
orderly whole. Things made distinct are more readily remembered,
and the very process of distinction involves a
kind of fermentation that gives zest to the whole, blending
the varied samples so that we experience a single flavor:
