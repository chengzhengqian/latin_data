<p>12. “The ancients,” he said (fr. 15 <span class="italic">IAH</span>

wore a ring not as an ornament but to seal documents.
For that reason, having more than one ring
was not allowed and only a freeman could have one,
since they alone were worthy of the credit that the
seal implied; accordingly, slaves in the household
did not have the right to wear a ring. A figure was engraved
on the material of the ring—whether it was
iron or gold—and the ring was worn according to
each person’s whim, on either hand and on any finger.</p>

that they boasted of the inflated prices they paid for
stones to engrave. That is the point at which the
right hand, which is the busier hand, ceased to be
used for wearing a ring, and the function was transferred
to the left, which is idler, lest the right hand’s

the pinky on the left hand was chosen as being more
suitable than the others for being entrusted with a
valuable ring. The thumb [<span class="italic">pollex</span>], which was so
named because of its strength [<span class="italic">pollet</span>],<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL512_269_114" id="target_note_LCL512_269_114"><sup>114</sup></a> is not idle
even on the left hand and is always as engaged in activity
as the hand as a whole: that’s why (he says) the
Greeks call it the <span class="italic">antikheir</span>, that is, “second hand.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL512_269_115" id="target_note_LCL512_269_115"><sup>115</sup></a></p>
