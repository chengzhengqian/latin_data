<blockquote><p><span class="line">9. I’ve sought out, too, herbs full of sap; bronze</span><span class="linebreak"></span>

<p class="noindent">Sophocles’ tragedy even has in its title the subject of our inquiry:
for it’s called <span class="italic">Herbalists.</span> In this play he describes
Medea cutting poisonous herbs with head averted, lest she
herself be killed by the force of their noxious odor: she
pours the herbs’ juice into bronze casks and cuts the herbs
themselves with bronze blades.</p>
<p>10. These are Sophocles’
lines (fr. 534 <span class="italic">TGrF</span> 4:410):</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">Keeping her gaze averted behind her hand,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">she receives in bronze casks the cloudy white juice</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">that drips from the cutting . . .</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">and a little after that:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line indent5"> . . These covered</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">baskets hide the roots’ cuttings,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">which she reaped with a bronze blade,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">with a cry and a shout, naked.</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p>11. So Sophocles, whom Virgil doubtless took as his model
in producing the bronze blades. Now there are plenty
of indications that bronze implements are generally used
for sacrifice, and above all in sacrifices that aim either to
soothe people, or curse them, or (finally) heal them of illnesses.</p>
<p>12. I say nothing of that line where Plautus says
(<span class="italic">fab. inc.</span> 60 Goetz):</p>
