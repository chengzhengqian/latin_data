heat of fire, at least when in battle, and while he’s cutting
the enemy down, the glow of his head and armor is as
daunting as the warrior himself. (<span class="italic">Il.</span> 5.4):</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">an unwearying fire was blazing from his helmet and</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">his shield.</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p>35. Virgil admired this touch immoderately—and used it
immoderately. For now he describes Turnus in these terms
(<span class="italic">A.</span> 9.733–34),
<q><span class="line indent12">at his crown the blood-red</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">crest quivers and flashing lightning bolts issue from</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">his shield,</span><span class="linebreak"></span></q>
at another time Aeneas, also in the same terms (<span class="italic">A</span>.
10.270*–71):
<q><span class="line">The crown of his head is ablaze, flame spills from the</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">peak</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">of his crest, his shield’s bronze boss belches huge</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">flames.</span><span class="linebreak"></span></q>
The poor timing of this description is evident from the fact
that Aeneas is not yet in battle but is just coming into view
while riding on his ship.</p>
<p>36. In another passage (<span class="italic">A.</span> 7.785–86),</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">His helmet, with it high horse-hair crest arranged in</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">three rows,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">supports a Chimaera the breathes the fires of Aetna</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">from its maw.</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">Then there’s Aeneas all agog at the arms just brought from
Vulcan and set upon the ground (<span class="italic">A.</span> 8.620):</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">the helmet belching flames, its crest awesome.</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
