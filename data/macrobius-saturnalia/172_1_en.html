and when he found out—for Andro replied that he had
come on an embassy to Caesar, to secure his homeland’s
freedom—Cicero’s reply alluded to Rome’s servitude: “if
you succeed, please intercede for us too” (<span class="italic">dicta</span> 1).</p>
<p>13. ‘The vigor of his mordant wit wasn’t limited to jests
but could be deadly serious too, as this example shows,
from a letter to Gaius Cassius, Caesar’s murderer (<span class="italic">Fam</span>.
12.4.1): “I wish you had invited me to the banquet on the
Ides of March: there certainly wouldn’t have been any leftovers.
Now those leftovers are proving to be a pain.”
Cicero also made a very pleasant joke about his son-in-law
Piso and Marcus Lepidus . . .’</p>
<p>14. As Symmachus was still speaking and, it appeared,
intending to speak some more, Avienus interrupted—as
often happens in table-talk—and said, ‘In this kind of cut-and-thrust,
Caesar Augustus was second to no one, perhaps
not even to Cicero: if you’d like, I’ll recount some
of his witticisms that I recall.’</p>
<p>15. To which Horus said,
‘Avienus, let Symmachus finish reporting Cicero’s witticisms
about the men he mentioned, and the account you
want to give about Augustus will make a more appropriate
sequel.’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_345_47" id="target_note_LCL510_345_47"><sup>47</sup></a></p>
<p>16. As Avienus fell silent, Symmachus went on:
‘As I was saying, since Cicero’s son-in-law, Piso, had a
rather effeminate gait, while his daughter had a more vigorous
stride, Cicero said to his daughter, “Walk like your
husband”;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_345_48" id="target_note_LCL510_345_48"><sup>48</sup></a> and when Marcus Lepidus told the conscript
fathers in the senate, “. . .,” Tully said, “I wouldn’t have
made so much out of a <span class="italic">ressemblance de cas</span>” (dicta 15–16).<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_345_49" id="target_note_LCL510_345_49"><sup>49</sup></a>
But go on, Avienus, don’t let me keep you when
you’re dying to speak.’</p>
