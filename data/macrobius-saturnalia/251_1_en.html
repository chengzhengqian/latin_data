<span class="line">say, that’s <span class="italic">la crème de la crème.</span> But when he had invited</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">to dinner a couple of those who had come to</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">greet him, and it looked as though he was going to</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">invite still more, Pontius said in his ear, “Be careful,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Scipio: that sturgeon of yours doesn’t like a crowd.”</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p>5. I grant that this fish didn’t command a high price in
Trajan’s reign, as Pliny attests when he makes the following
remark about the fish in his <span class="italic">Natural History</span> (9.60):<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL511_111_133" id="target_note_LCL511_111_133"><sup>133</sup></a> “The
fish is not highly prized now, something I myself find surprising,
since it’s rarely found.”</p>
<p>6. But this spirit of thrift
didn’t last long: when Serenus Sammonicus, a scholar of
the day, wrote to the emperor Severus, who made a show
of his austere habits, and discoursed on this fish, he started
with the words of Pliny that I quoted just above and then
added:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">7. As you know, Pliny lived all the way to the time of</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Trajan, and he’s no doubt telling the truth when</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">he says, ‘The fish is not highly prized now.’ But I</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">mean to show that it was prized by the ancients, a</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">point I make particularly because I see that it has returned</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">to favor at our banquets, like an exile with its</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">civic rights restored: for when you deign to include</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">me as a guest at your sacred banquet, I notice that</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">this fish is served by garlanded servants to the sound</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">of a flute. As for Pliny’s report about the sturgeon’s</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">scales (ibid.), that supreme scholar of the natural order,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Nigidius Figulus, shows that it’s true: in Book 4</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
