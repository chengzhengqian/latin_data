Virgil named the Acheloüs, among all other rivers, when
he intended “water” to be understood, and no one suspects
that some more profound bit of learning might be present.</p>
<p>4. But after examining the matter more deeply I have
found that the learned poet has spoken (as my evidence
will show) in the manner of the most ancient Greeks, who
used “Akheloös” as the proper term for “water”—nor did
they do that to no purpose: rather, the reason has been
carefully recorded. But before I explain the reason, I shall
use the testimony of an ancient poet to show that this manner
of speaking—using “Akheloös”to mean “water” in general—was
pervasive.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL511_423_72" id="target_note_LCL511_423_72"><sup>72</sup></a></p>
<p>5. Aristophanes, a poet of the Old
Comedy, says in his <span class="italic">Rooster</span> (fr. 365 <span class="italic">PCG</span> 3,2:205),
<q><span class="line">I was puking up a nasty</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">burden—for the wine was weighing me down—</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">. . .</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">I had not mixed the drink with Akheloös.</span><span class="linebreak"></span></q>
I was being weighed down (he says) by the wine that had
not been mixed with water, that is, by pure wine.</p>
<p>6. Furthermore,
Ephorus, the well known author, shows in Book
2 of his <span class="italic">Histories</span> why they adopted this usage (no. 70 fr. 20
<span class="italic">FGrH</span>):
<q><span class="line">Now, only the inhabitants nearby sacrifice to other</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">rivers; the Akheloös alone happens to be honored by</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">all humankind, who refer to other rivers by their</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">proper names, not by one or another common term,</span><span class="linebreak"></span></q>
