the Romans’ system, or agrees that the Etruscan Tiber too
has derived some good from his country’s learning.’</p>
<p>38. Eustathius interposed: ‘I doubt that anyone—not just
our friend Horus, a serious and accomplished man, but
anyone else—could be such a worthless judge that he
would not agree that the organization of the Roman year
has been refined, as they say, to perfection—a perfection
made all the more pleasing by the speaker’s unshakeable
memory and brilliant way of speaking. And it’s not surprising
that this exposition has avoided criticism’s sting, since it
has the authority of utter correctness derived from Egypt.</p>
<p>39. For just as Julius Caesar owed to Egyptian learning his
knowledge of the stars’ movements, on which he left us
some learned books (<span class="italic">On stars</span> test. 4 Klotz), so he borrowed
from the same teachings in stretching the period by
which the year is defined.</p>
<p>40. But because Latium’s ancient
inhabitants did not yet have the chance to learn from
Egypt (travel there was closed to them), they followed the
custom of Greece in reckoning the days of the months, so
that the count moved backward, with the date dwindling
by degrees from the greater number and ending with the
lesser.</p>
<p>41. For just as we speak of the tenth day [sc. before
the Kalends], then the ninth, and then the eighth, so the
Athenians were accustomed to speak of the tenth and the
ninth of the waning month.</p>
<p>42. And when Homer says (<span class="italic">Od.</span>
16.162):
<q><span class="line">With one month waning, another arising,</span><span class="linebreak"></span></q>
he must mean by “waning” the month in which the count
gradually diminishes until it gives way to the name of the
month to follow, and by “arising” the one that stands next
in the series as it comes to succeed its shrinking predecessor.</p>
