<p>16. When still quite young, he offered Vatinius this choice
bit of mockery: though the latter was sore with the gout, he
wanted to appear to have shaken off the disorder and so
was boasting that he was walking a mile each day: “I’m not
surprised,” Caesar said, “seeing that the days are getting a
bit longer” (<span class="italic">dicta</span> 60 Malc.).<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_353_61" id="target_note_LCL510_353_61"><sup>61</sup></a></p>

huge debt that a certain Roman knight had concealed
while he was alive—more than 20,000,000 sesterces!—he
ordered that a pillow from the man’s bedroom be purchased
at the estate-auction and, when people were surprised
at the command, explained, “I have to sleep on the
pillow that man was able to sleep on when he was so deep

house where Cato had lived and, to flatter Caesar, Strabo

said, “Whoever does not wish the existing constitution to
be changed is a good man and a good citizen” (<span class="italic">dicta</span> 62
Malc.). A remark meant in earnest, to be sure, in praise of
Cato, and in his own self-interest, to discourage anyone
from attempting revolution.</p>

praiseworthy than glibness—especially given that he put
up with some remarks whose bite went beyond jesting.</p>
<p>20. An edged barb on the part of a provincial gained a
certain notoriety. When the man came to Rome he caused
everyone to stare, because he was the spit and image of
Caesar: Augustus ordered that the fellow be brought to
him and asked him, “Tell me, young man, was your mother
ever in Rome?” Not content with a simple “no,” the man
added, “But my father was, any number of times.”</p>
