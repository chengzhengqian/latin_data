<span class="line">10. He went striding like a lion raised in the</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">mountains, who too long</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">has been without meat, and his valiant spirit urges</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">him on</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">to go and make an attempt on a crowded fold of</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">sheep:</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">if he finds there the men who tend them,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>

<span class="line">he has no wish to leave the farmstead untested</span><span class="linebreak"></span>

<span class="line">As when someone sees a snake and recoils</span><span class="linebreak"></span>

<span class="line">he draws back, away, his cheeks grow pale:</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
