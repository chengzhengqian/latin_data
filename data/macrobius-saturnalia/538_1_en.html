person without self-control exceeds that limit even if he’s
dining on olives or greens. And just as the one who enjoys
an abundantly varied meal holds onto his good health
if he has observed a proper limit, so a man who eats mere
salt become unhealthy, should he fall upon it greedily.</p>
<p>25. Finally, if you think variety in the things we consume
is harmful, why do you compound from such contrary
and conflicting ingredients the potable medicines that you
administer by mouth, for people to dose their innards?</p>
<p>26. You mix euphorbium with poppy juice and balance
mandrake and other herbs of a disastrously cold nature
with pepper, and you even use horrendous kinds of animal
tissue, putting beavers’ testicles<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL512_199_47" id="target_note_LCL512_199_47"><sup>47</sup></a> and poisonous snake’s
flesh in your potions and mingling with them all the produce
of India, all the imported herbs in which Crete is so
fertile.</p>
<p>27. Since when it comes to life’s safe-keeping, then,

<p>28. ‘To top it all off, you launched an attack on pleasure
in a censorious aria, as though pleasure is always virtue’s
enemy and not just when it rejects moderation and lapses
into luxury. For that matter, what does your Mr. Sobersides
do, in not eating beyond the demands of hunger and in
drinking only when thirsty, but take pleasure from both?
Pleasure, then, is not instantly disreputable just because of
its very name, it becomes something to respect or condemn
according to the limit placed on its enjoyment.</p>
