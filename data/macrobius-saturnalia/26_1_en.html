all the philosophical schools, has aligned himself with the
one he most approved, and he fully employs, by himself, all
the styles of speaking known to the Greeks; yet at Rome he
is so much his own reliable interpreter that you would not
know in which language he speaks more fluently or more
resourcefully.’ All present approved the judgment with
which Quintus Aurelius selected these choice companions,
and with matters arranged thus, together they took
leave of Praetextatus, then each took leave of one another
and returned home.</p>
<p>On the following morning<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_53_70" id="target_note_LCL510_53_70"><sup>70</sup></a> they all were on hand at<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">6</span><span class="br"></span>
