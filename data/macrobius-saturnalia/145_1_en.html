<p>26. ‘The Archer [Sagittarius], lowest and last of all the
houses in the zodiac,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_291_561" id="target_note_LCL510_291_561"><sup>561</sup></a> turns from a human being into a
beast in its hindquarters, as if those hind parts shoved it
down from the upper regions to the lower; yet it shoots an
arrow, which shows that the life of every single creature
depends on the ray of the sun even when it emerges from
the lowest regions. The Goat’s Horn [Capricornus], which
starts to lead the sun back from the lower regions to the
upper, seems to imitate a goat’s nature: while grazing, it
always seeks the heights of overhanging crags instead of
the low-lying pastures.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_291_562" id="target_note_LCL510_291_562"><sup>562</sup></a></p>
<p>27. ‘Doesn’t the Water-carrier [Aquarius] display the
sun’s very essence? For how does rain come to fall upon
the earth save through the heat of the sun, which draws up
the moisture that pours back down in abundant showers?
The Fish [Pisces] occupy the last place in the zodiac’s
sequence: they are consecrated to the sun not by some
figurative interpretation of their nature, as with the rest of
the signs, but because they directly display the sun’s power,
which gives life not just to creatures of the air and the land
but also to those that spend their time submerged in the
water, as though exiled from the sight of the sun. So great is
the sun’s power that it reaches down even to beings that are
hidden away and quickens them with life.</p>
<p>‘Now, to let my discourse circle back to the manifold<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">22</span><span class="br"></span>
power of the sun: surely Nemesis, who is worshipped as
the antidote to arrogance,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_291_563" id="target_note_LCL510_291_563"><sup>563</sup></a> is nothing other than the
power of the sun, seeing that it’s her nature to obscure the
brilliant and take them from our sight, and contrarily to
throw light on the obscure and present them to our sight.</p>
