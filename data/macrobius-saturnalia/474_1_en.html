<p class="noindent">meaning “fastened” to them and so “hostile” to them—has
a precedent in Book 14 of Lucilius, where he writes
(474–75):</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">If that praetor were not inflicted on me and giving</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">me a hard time,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">I’d be fine: but I tell you, he’s the one person who’s</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">gutting me.</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">3. . . . spews a huge wave of morning callers from</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
