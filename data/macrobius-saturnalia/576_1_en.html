greasy quality provides fuel to the fire.</p>
<p>25. Finally, let’s
follow Homer, who was uniquely knowledgeable about
nature. He has Alcinoüs’ daughter, Nausicaä, at the seaside
washing clothes not in the sea but in a stream (<span class="italic">Od.</span> 6.85–95),
and in the same passage shows us that there’s something
greasy intermingled with sea water:</p>
<p>26. when Ulysses
has long since emerged from the sea and is standing with
his body already dry, he says to Nausicaä’s slaves (<span class="italic">Od.</span>
6.218–19),</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">Stand there at a distance, attendants, until I</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">wash the brine from my shoulders.</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">After, when he’s gone down into the river (<span class="italic">Od.</span> 6.226),</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">he cleaned the salt-foam from his head.</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p>27. The god-like bard, who followed nature in every respect,
represented the common experience of coming out
of the sea, standing in the sun so that the sun quickly dries
the water, and yet having stick to the body’s surface a kind
of film, if I can put it like that, which we also feel when we
wash things. This is seawater’s greasy quality, which is the
only thing that gets in the way of cleaning.</p>
<p>‘Since you’ve acquitted yourself of all our companions<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">14</span><span class="br"></span>
and are indulging me for a bit, with water our recent topic,
I’d like to ask why images in water appear larger than the
objects actually are.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL512_275_121" id="target_note_LCL512_275_121"><sup>121</sup></a> This is the sort of thing we find food
peddlers doing, when their morsels are usually presented
looking larger than they really are—in water-filled glass
jars we see exceptionally large, round eggs and little livers
