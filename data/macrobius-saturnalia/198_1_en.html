Evander—and in fact will find him celebrating the rites of
Hercules—he sails along the Tiber, so that he might thus
be purified before attending his host’s rites.</p>
<p>4. Hence, too,
Juno’s bitter complaint, provoked as much by the fact that
he reached “the Tiber’s longed-for channel” (<span class="italic">A.</span> 7.303) as
by the fact that he had succeeded in reaching Italy against
her will: for she knew that once he was purified by the river
he could also sacrifice to her acceptably<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL511_5_2" id="target_note_LCL511_5_2"><sup>2</sup></a>—and she did
