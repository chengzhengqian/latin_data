<p>15. There you have a style that you’ll find nowhere else,
with a brevity that’s not abrupt, an abundance that’s not
mindless, a dryness that’s not barren, a luxuriance that’s
not cloying.</p>
<p>16. ‘There are, furthermore, two styles that provide an
ethical contrast.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL511_223_6" id="target_note_LCL511_223_6"><sup>6</sup></a> One is the mature and serious sort associated
with Crassus, which Virgil uses when Latinus advises
Turnus (<span class="italic">A.</span> 12.19–21):
<q>
<span class="line">O young man of surpassing spirit, the more you exult</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">in your fierce valor, the more earnestly should I</span><span class="linebreak"></span>

<p>18. ‘Do you perceive how Virgil’s eloquence is distinguished
by combining all the different styles? I think, in
fact, that Virgil took pains to achieve this blend because he
sensed that he was preparing himself to serve as a universal
resource, and I further believe that this foresight of his was
the product of a divine, not merely mortal, intelligence: he
followed no guide but nature, the very mother of all things,
and he wove her into the fabric of his verse, like the harmony
