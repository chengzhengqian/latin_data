emotion, as when Cicero laments the fire made with
damp wood used to kill the person who was confined with
it (<span class="italic">Verr.</span> 2.1.45). This instance is based on means, since
Verres used smoke as the means to commit the murder—as
one man might use a sword, another poison—and on
that account aroused a very strong emotional reaction.
Cicero does the same thing, too, when he complains that a
Roman citizen was flogged (<span class="italic">Verr.</span> 2.5.140–42).</p>
<p>18. You’ll
find the same sort of thing in Virgil (<span class="italic">A.</span> 6.592–93):
<q><span class="line">But the almighty father hurled his missile among the</span><span class="linebreak"></span>

and so on: he subtly mocked the devices used by the one
while conveying the anger of the other by reference to his
real and forceful device.</p>
<p>19. ‘I’ve now cataloged the individual sources of emotion,
according to rhetorical doctrine, and I’ve shown how
Maro used them. But Virgil sometimes uses a combination
of two or more sources in a single instance, to increase the
emotional response:</p>
<p>20. so in the case of Turnus he relies
both on age (<span class="italic">A.</span> 12.43–44),</p>

<span class="line">father . . .,</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">and on location (<span class="italic">A.</span> 12.44–45),</p>
