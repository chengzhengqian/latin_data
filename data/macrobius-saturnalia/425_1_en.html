that I don’t think any Latin authors use, and precious few
Greeks<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL511_459_92a" id="target_note_LCL511_459_92a"><sup>92</sup></a>—I don’t see why they aren’t forced to investigate
the meaning of these strange, foreign terms.</p>
<p>3. Be that as
it may: the <span class="italic">carchesium</span> is a cup known only in Greece:
it’s mentioned by Pherecydes in the books of his <span class="italic">Histories</span>,
where he says that Jupiter gave Alcmena the gift of a
golden <span class="italic">carchesium</span> as a reward for lying with him (no. 3 fr.
13 <span class="italic">FGrH</span> = fr. 13a <span class="italic">EGM</span>).<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL511_459_93" id="target_note_LCL511_459_93"><sup>93</sup></a> But Plautus abandoned the unfamiliar
name, saying in his play <span class="italic">Amphitryo</span> (534) that he
gave her a <span class="italic">patera</span>, though the shapes of the two vessels
are very different.</p>
<p>4. For a <span class="italic">patera</span>, as its very name indicates,
is flat and open [<span class="italic">patens</span>], while a <span class="italic">carchesium</span> is tall,
with a pinched waist and handles of middling heft that extend
from lip to base.</p>
<p>5. But Asclepiades, one of the most
learned and careful of the Greeks, thinks that the name
<span class="italic">carchesia</span> was drawn from the nautical sphere:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL511_459_94" id="target_note_LCL511_459_94"><sup>94</sup></a> for he says
that the lower part of a ship’s sail is called the <span class="italic">pterna</span>
[“heel”], the middle part the <span class="italic">trachêlos</span> [“throat”], and the
upper part the <span class="italic">carchesium</span>, from which the so-called horns
[<span class="italic">cornua</span> = yard-arms] extend into either side of the sail.</p>
<p>6. Not only does Asclepiades mention this cup but so do
other famous poets like Sappho, who says (fr. 141b),
<q><span class="line">All of them, then,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">held <span class="italic">karkhâsia</span></span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">and were pouring libations . . .;</span><span class="linebreak"></span></q>
Cratinus, in his <span class="italic">Dionysalexandros</span> (fr. 40 <span class="italic">PCG</span> 4:142),
