<p>14. So far as I know, it is nowhere attested that there was in
Italy the custom of going to war with one foot shod, the
other bare; but I shall now adduce abundant authority to
show that some Greeks had this custom.</p>
<p>15. Here indeed
we can marvel at the care the poet took while making no
display of it at all: having read that the Hernici, whose city
is Anagnia, were Pelasgians by origin and derived their
name from a certain Pelasgian king named Hernicus, he
attributed to the Hernici, who were an ancient colony of
the Pelasgi, a custom that he had read about in connection
with Aetolia.</p>
<p>16. Julius Hyginus, in Book 2 of his <span class="italic">Cities</span>,
demonstrates at length that a certain Pelasgian named
Hernicus was the leader of the Hernici (fr. 8 <span class="italic">HRR</span> 2;74 = fr.
13 <span class="italic">GRF</span> 1:533–34). That it was the Aetolians’ custom to go
to war with only one foot shod is shown by Euripides, the
most brilliant of tragic poets, in his tragedy <span class="italic">Meleager</span>, when
a messenger enters to describe the dress of each of the
leaders who had assembled to capture the boar.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL511_429_76a" id="target_note_LCL511_429_76a"><sup>76</sup></a> Here are
