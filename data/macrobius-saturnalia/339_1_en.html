<span class="line">For I know that you will go hence from the house of</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">Hades</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">and steer your well-made ship to the island of Aiaia.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">There I ask you, lord, be mindful of me, do not go</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">and leave me behind, unmourned, unburied, do not</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">forsake me—lest I bring the wrath of the gods down</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">upon you—</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">but place me on a pyre with my weapons, such as I</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">have,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">and heap up a monument for me, an unlucky man,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">on the gray sea’s shore, for later men to learn of.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Do these things for me, and fix my oar upon my</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">tomb,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">the one I rowed as a living man with my companions.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">(<span class="italic">Od.</span> 11.66–78)</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">14. Tityos too, whom the Earth, mother of all, had</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">raised,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">was there to see: his body is sprawled over nine</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">acres, a loathsome vulture crops his imperishable</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">liver</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">with its hooked beak, rummaging for a feast in</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">innards</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">that give great scope to vengeance. His spacious</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">chest is</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">the bird’s lair, his guts, ever renewed, know no peace.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">(<span class="italic">A</span>. 6.595*–600)</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">15. I saw Tityos too, the son of glorious Earth,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">lying on the ground: over nine acres he lay,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">two vultures, one each side, trimmed his liver and</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">settled in his bowels, his hands no use to keep them</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">off.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
