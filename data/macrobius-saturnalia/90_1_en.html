<p>12. The lesser pontiff revealed the number of days remaining
to the Nones by “calling” because after the new
moon<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_181_326" id="target_note_LCL510_181_326"><sup>326</sup></a> citizens in the countryside were obliged to gather
in the city on the Nones, to receive an account of the
month’s holy days from the priest in charge of sacrifices
and to find out what they had to do in the course of the
month.</p>
<p>13. Hence some think that the Nones got its name
as the start of a new [<span class="italic">nova</span>] process of ritual observance, or
because nine [<span class="italic">novem</span>] days are always reckoned from it to
the Ides,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_181_327" id="target_note_LCL510_181_327"><sup>327</sup></a> just as the Etruscans used to observe several
Nones, because they greeted their king every ninth
[<span class="italic">nonus</span>] day and sought his advice on their personal affairs.</p>
<p>14. ‘The name of the Ides was taken from the Etruscans,
who call that day Itis,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_181_328" id="target_note_LCL510_181_328"><sup>328</sup></a> which they take to mean “Jupiter’s
surety.” For we regard Jupiter as the source of light
[<span class="italic">lux</span>]—hence the Salii sing of him as “Lucetius” in their
hymns<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_181_329" id="target_note_LCL510_181_329"><sup>329</sup></a>—and the Cretans call the day “Zeus,” while the
Romans themselves call him Diespiter, as father [<span class="italic">pater</span>] of
the day [<span class="italic">dies</span>]:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_181_330" id="target_note_LCL510_181_330"><sup>330</sup></a></p>
<p>15. this day is rightly called “Jupiter’s
surety,” then, because its light does not end with sunset but
extends the day’s brilliance into the night thanks to the
moonlight, since the day usually coincides with the full
moon, that is, with the middle of the month. So to the day
that lacks even the darkness of night they gave the Etruscan
name “Jupiter’s surety,” and from that arose the ancient
provision that every Ides should be observed as Jupiter’s
holy day.</p>
<p>16. Others think that because the moon then
appears full, the Ides [<span class="italic">Idus</span>] was named “Vidus” from “vision”
