in his seventeenth book that once upon a time in Delphi a
temple that religious sentiment had previously preserved
untouched was sacked and burned, adding that many cities
around Corinth and the islands nearest the mainland were
devastated by an earthquake, and that never before and
never since was Delos troubled, but its stones remained
ever undisturbed.</p>

reverence with which he regarded the place.</p>
