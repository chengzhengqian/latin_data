though the public interest turned critically on this venture—to
make sure if anyone chanced to catch a parrotwrasse
in a haul of other fish, he returned it immediately to
the sea, safe and unharmed.</p>
<p>11. ‘Why should we be amazed that the gluttony of that
era was slavishly dependent on the sea, when wastrels even
paid great—or I should say, greatest—honor to the wolf-fish

<p>12. I certainly don’t know why they were so inclined, but
that they were is also made clear by Marcus Varro, who in
Book 11 of his <span class="italic">Human Antiquities</span> (fr. 1) lists the areas of
Italy that produce the best foods and awards the palm to
the fish of the Tiber, saying, “Campanian land bears the

in support of the law of Fannius.1<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL511_115_138" id="target_note_LCL511_115_138"><sup>38</sup></a> I’m quoting
what he says not just because it will provide evidence
about the wolf-fish caught between the two bridges but

the people alive at the time. He describes wastrels wandering
drunk into the forum to serve as judges and reports the
