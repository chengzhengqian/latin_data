<p>13. ‘The nut that’s so soft it breaks when you’ve scarcely
touched it is called “terentine.” About this nut one finds
the following in a book by Favorinus (test. 48): “Similarly,
there’s the fact that some people call sheep and nuts
‘Tarentine’ when they are properly ‘terentine,’ from
<span class="italic">terenus</span>, the Sabine term for ‘soft’; Varro, in his first book
<span class="italic">To Libo</span>, expresses the view (fr. 231 <span class="italic">GRF</span> 1:263) that the
Terentii are so called from the same term.” Horace could
seem to fall into the mistake noted by Favorinus when he
speaks of “soft Tarentum,” too.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL511_137_161" id="target_note_LCL511_137_161"><sup>161</sup></a></p>

<p>‘And since we see fleshy fruits [<span class="italic">mala</span>] intermingled with<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">19</span><span class="br"></span>
the sweets, we should talk about their varieties, leaving
nuts behind. There are agricultural writers who distinguish
nuts and fleshy fruits by calling “nuts” any fruit
[<span class="italic">pomum</span>] that’s covered by something hard on the outside
and has the edible part inside, whereas a fleshy fruit has
the edible part outside and the hard part inside. According
to this definition, what the poet Sueius counts among the
nuts just above should rather be counted among the fleshy
fruits.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL511_137_163" id="target_note_LCL511_137_163"><sup>163</sup></a></p>
