this stops at the soul’s departure, the limbs wither, and the
entire body is annihilated by the pressure of its own
weight. Then the blood too, which gave strength to the
limbs as long as it retained its warmth, turns to pus when
that warmth is lost and does not remain within the veins
but forces its way out, and with the body’s openings thus
relaxed a thick slime of decay flows out.</p>
<p>5. Salt mixed with
the body keeps this from happening, because being naturally
dry and warm it restricts the body’s dissolution with
its warmth and blocks or absorbs the moisture with its dryness.
Certainly, the fact that moisture is dispersed or consumed
by salt is easily seen if you make two loaves of
bread of equal size and sprinkle one with salt while leaving
the other without salt: you’ll find that the salt-free loaf is
heavier, obviously because the lack of salt causes it to retain
moisture.’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL512_247_90" id="target_note_LCL512_247_90"><sup>90</sup></a></p>

wine that’s been filtered become stronger in its effect<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL512_247_91" id="target_note_LCL512_247_91"><sup>91</sup></a> but

quickly as it itself is affected—by turning to vinegar—if it’s
kept?’</p>
<p>7. ‘It quickly affects the drinker,’ Dysarius said, ‘because
the clearer it’s made by filtering out the dregs, the
more able it is to penetrate the drinker’s veins. It turns
quickly, however, because it has nothing to give it body and
is vulnerable to harm on every side: the dregs are, in effect,
the wine’s roots, supporting it, nourishing it, and giving it
strength.’</p>
<p>8. ‘Here’s another question,’ Avienus said. ‘Why do the
impurities of all liquids save honey sink to the bottom,
while honey alone sends its impurities up to the surface?’
Dysarius replied, ‘In all other liquids the iterial,
being dense and earthy, is heavier, but it’s lighter than
