god’s name to that, let me tell you what the Assyrians think
of the sun’s power. To the god whom they revere as the
highest and greatest they gave the name “Adad,” which can
be translated as “one one.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_305_586" id="target_note_LCL510_305_586"><sup>586</sup></a></p>
<p>18. This god, then, they worship
as most powerful, but they give him as a consort the
goddess named Adargatis<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_305_587a" id="target_note_LCL510_305_587a"><sup>587</sup></a> and ascribe all power over all
things to this pair, whom they understand to be the sun and
the earth; nor do they distinguish all the different manifestations
of their power, giving each a different name, but
they use the symbols with which they are adorned to signify
the many-sided excellence of the two-fold godhead.</p>
<p>19. The symbols themselves, moreover, provide an account
of the sun: the image of Adad is distinguished by rays
angled downward, making plain that heaven’s power is in
the rays of the sun that are sent down to earth; the image of
Adargatis is distinguished by rays angled upward, making
plain that all the things the earth produces come to be
thanks to the power of the rays sent from above.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_305_588" id="target_note_LCL510_305_588"><sup>588</sup></a></p>
<p>20. Under
Adargatis, too, there are images of lions,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_305_589" id="target_note_LCL510_305_589"><sup>589</sup></a> showing
that she is the earth in the same way that the Phrygians
fashioned the Mother God, which is to say, the earth, being
drawn by lions.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_305_590" id="target_note_LCL510_305_590"><sup>590</sup></a></p>
