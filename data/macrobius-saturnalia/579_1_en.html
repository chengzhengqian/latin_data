themselves at him, when the pupil that is a crucial element
in vision is quite small? How in the world can an entire
army be seen? Do the images that emerge from the individual
soldiers mass themselves and, thus marshaled in
their thousands, penetrate the onlooker’s eyes?</p>
<p>12. ‘But why belabor such an empty view, when its very
emptiness is self-refuting? There is no doubt, however,
that we experience vision for the following reason.</p>
<p>13. An
innate light flashes from the pupil in a straight line wherever
you turn:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL512_281_125" id="target_note_LCL512_281_125"><sup>125</sup></a> if that natural emanation of the eyes
should find the surrounding air to be clear, it continues
straight through it until it strikes up against an object, and
if you turn your face to look around, your line of vision
moves straight ahead in both directions. But the emission
itself, which I’ve said darts out from our eyes, begins from
a slender base and ends by becoming broader, like rays
represented by a painter: that’s why the eye sees to the
depths of heaven while looking through the teeniest hole.</p>
<p>14. There are, then, three things we need to see: the light
that we give off, clear air intervening, and an object for our
gaze to strike against and stop; should that gaze continue
on too long, it becomes tired and doesn’t maintain its direction
straight on but become split and is diffused to the
left and the right.</p>
<p>15. This is why wherever on earth you
stand, the sky appears to have an end-point, and this is
what the ancients called the horizon: their research reliably
discovered that a glance directed by eyes looking
ahead through a flat area cannot continue more than 180
stades<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL512_281_126" id="target_note_LCL512_281_126"><sup>126</sup></a> and from that point curves back. I added the
qualification “through a flat area” because we see elevated
