For some people say that the Pinarii rescued the Supreme
Altar when it was burning from a fire in the neighborhood,
and that is why Virgil said the house of Pinarius guarded
the rites.</p>
<p>13. Asper says (p. 137) that Virgil’s remark “aims
to draw a distinction with the Potitii, who were bribed
by Appius Claudius to hand over the rites to the public
slaves.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL511_51_56" id="target_note_LCL511_51_56"><sup>56</sup></a></p>
<p>14. But in his book <span class="italic">Practices of the Pontiffs</span>, on offerings
of supplication, Veranius says (fr. 4 <span class="italic">IAH</span> 2.1:7 =
fr. 12 <span class="italic">IAR<sup>6</sup></span>) that after the Pinarii were the last to arrive at
the midday meal, when the diners were already washing
their hands, Hercules forbade them or their descendants
to taste from the tithe that was to be offered to him:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL511_51_57" id="target_note_LCL511_51_57"><sup>57</sup></a> they
should come only to serve as his ministers, not to share the
meal, and thus it was as minsters that they were said to
“guard the rites.”</p>
<p>15. Virgil himself uses the term in this
way elsewhere (<span class="italic">A.</span> 11.836*†):
<q><span class="line">But long since did Opis, guard of Trivia, in the</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">mountains . . .,</span><span class="linebreak"></span></q>
that is, Diana’s minister—unless perchance he used the
term “guard” to mean that she restrained herself and kept
apart from the rites, as he says elsewhere (<span class="italic">G.</span> 4.110–11†),
<q><span class="line">And to guard against thieves and birds with his willow</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">scythe,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">the protective power of Hellespontine Priapus, keeps</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">watch.</span><span class="linebreak"></span></q>
Here plainly he means by “guard” one who keeps birds and
thieves away.</p>
