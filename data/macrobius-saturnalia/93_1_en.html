But all days that follow the Kalends, Nones, or Ides are
equally ill-omened,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_187_343" id="target_note_LCL510_187_343"><sup>343</sup></a> and that’s why they declared the
Nones unsuitable for weddings: so that the bride would
not either inaugurate her matronly privileges on the following
day or offer sacrifice on an ill-omened day when it is
against divine law for religious rites to be celebrated.</p>
<p>‘But since the sequence I am following has brought me<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">16</span><span class="br"></span>
to mention specific days, I should say a few words on the
subject our friend Horus asked about.</p>
<p>2. As Numa apportioned
the year into months, so he apportioned each
month into days and designated all days as either religious
[<span class="italic">festi</span>] or ordinary [<span class="italic">profesti</span>] or split [<span class="italic">intercisi</span>]. Religious
days were dedicated to the gods, ordinary days were
granted for people to take care of personal or public business,
and split days were shared by the gods and human beings.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_187_344" id="target_note_LCL510_187_344"><sup>344</sup></a></p>
<p>3. On religious days there are sacrifices, religious
feasts, games, and holidays; among ordinary days there are
days for legal business, assembly days, days for resuming
trials, appointed days, and days for battle; split days are not
split for other activities but are internally divided, so that
during some hours it is consistent with divine law to pronounce
judgment, but during other hours it is not.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_187_345" id="target_note_LCL510_187_345"><sup>345</sup></a> For
when the victim is being slain, it is against divine law to
speak,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_187_346" id="target_note_LCL510_187_346"><sup>346</sup></a> but between the slaying and the offering<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_187_347" id="target_note_LCL510_187_347"><sup>347</sup></a> it is
permitted, and then again it is forbidden when the offering
is being burned. I should, then, explain at greater length
the distinction between religious and ordinary days.</p>
<p>4. ‘A sacred occasion is celebrated either when sacrifices
are offered to the gods or when a day is marked
by feasts for the gods or when games are staged in
honor of the gods or when a holy festival is observed.</p>
