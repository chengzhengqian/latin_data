<span class="italic">monilium, sedilibus sedilium</span>, or is one syllable shorter, like
<span class="italic">carminibus carminum, liminibus liminum</span>. So, then, <span class="italic">Saturnalibus
Saturnalium</span> is more correct than <span class="italic">Saturnalibus
Saturnaliorum</span>.</p>
<p>6. But those who say <span class="italic">Saturnaliorum</span> are
supported by the authority of great figures: Sallust in the
third book of his <span class="italic">Histories</span> says <span class="italic">Bacchanaliorum</span> (<span class="italic">Hist.</span>
3.31),<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_33_41" id="target_note_LCL510_33_41"><sup>41</sup></a> and Masurius in the second book of his <span class="italic">Calendar</span>
says (fr. 1 <span class="italic">IAH</span> 2.1:363 = fr. 8 <span class="italic">IAR</span><sup>6</sup>), “the day of the
Vinalia [<span class="italic">Vinaliorum</span>] is sacred to Jupiter, not Venus, as
some think.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_33_42" id="target_note_LCL510_33_42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>
<p>7. And to cite the testimony of the grammarians
themselves: Verrius Flaccus, in his book titled <span class="italic">Saturn</span>,
says (test. 10 <span class="italic">GRF</span> 1:510), “The days of the Saturnalia
[<span class="italic">Saturnaliorum</span>] are considered holidays among the
Greeks too,” and in the same book he says, “I judge that I
have clarified the founding of the Saturnalia [<span class="italic">Saturnaliorum</span>].”
So too Julius Modestus, writing on religious festivals,
uses the phrase “festival of the Saturnalia [<span class="italic">Saturnaliorum</span>]”
(cf. <span class="italic">GRF</span> 2:9) and in the same book says, “Antias
relates that Numa Pompilius was the originator of the
Agonalia [<span class="italic">Agonaliorum</span>]” (fr. 6).<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_33_43a" id="target_note_LCL510_33_43a"><sup>43</sup></a></p>
<p>8. ‘“Nonetheless, I wonder,” you’ll say, “if this authoritative
usage can be backed up by some rational principle.”
Of course it can; and insofar as it’s proper for a grammarian
to have recourse to his favorite principle—that of grammatical
analogy—I’ll rely on the clues available to discover
what turned those men aside from the customary form of
expression and caused them to prefer to say <span class="italic">Saturnaliorum</span>
rather than <span class="italic">Saturnalium</span>.</p>
<p>9. In the first place, I judge that
they wished to treat these nouns, which are holiday names
