and he showed thereby that “profaned” is properly applied
to something once “sacred” that has indiscriminately been

<p>5. ‘“The term ‘holy,’” Trebatius also reports, in his tenth
book <span class="italic">On Religious Scruples</span>, “is sometimes the same as
‘sacred’ and ‘filled with religious scruple,’ sometimes different—that
is, neither ‘sacred’ nor ‘filled with religious
scruple’” (fr. 9 <span class="italic">IAH</span> 1:406 = fr. 7 <span class="italic">IAR<sup>6</sup></span>).</p>
<p>6. The following
pertains to the second category (<span class="italic">A.</span> 12.648–49†):

where Evander focused on the honor of chastity that belonged
to his uncorrupted wife. Hence, too, “holy laws,”
which should not be corrupted by any tie to penal sanction.

<p>7. As for the first category of Trebatius’ definition of
“holy,” according to which it is the same as “sacred” or
“filled with religious scruple,” consider this (<span class="italic">A.</span> 2.682–83):
