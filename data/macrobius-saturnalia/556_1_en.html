wish, but we Greeks refer to a <span class="italic">syzygia</span> of nerves when two
nerves arise together and terminate at a specific point.</p>
<p>20. The seven <span class="italic">syzygiai</span> of nerves, then, arise from the
brain’s ventricle and serve as channels that conduct, each
to its own terminus, the sense-bearing breath according
to the law of nature, infusing the creature’s limbs—the
nearby and farther removed alike—with sensation.</p>
<p>21. ‘The first <span class="italic">syzygia</span> of these nerves, then, has the eyes
as its target and allows them to perceive sights and distinguish
colors; the second spills into the ears, which thereby
are able to recognize sounds; the third insinuates itself into
the nostrils and provides the ability to smell; the fourth occupies
the palate, which discerns tastes; the fifth fills the
whole body with its power—for every part of the body
distinguishes soft and rough, cold and hot.</p>
<p>22. The sixth
passes from the brain and makes for the stomach, which
stands in greatest need of sensation, so that it can seek out
what it needs, reject what it doesn’t, and act in a balanced
way in a sober person. The seventh <span class="italic">syzygia</span> of nerves infuses
with sensation the spine’s marrow—for a creature,
the equivalent of a ship’s keel—and is so much the most
useful and important <span class="italic">syzygia</span> that physicians have called it
the “long brain.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL512_235_83" id="target_note_LCL512_235_83"><sup>83</sup></a></p>
<p>23. From this <span class="italic">syzygia</span>, as from the brain,
passages emerge and extend in different directions, empowering
the soul to pursue the three chief aims that a
creature’s body has, thanks to the soul’s providence: that it
remain alive, that it live in a fitting way,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL512_235_84" id="target_note_LCL512_235_84"><sup>84</sup></a> and that it seek
immortality through its posterity.</p>
<p>24. The soul’s influence
where these three aims are concerned is channeled, as I
