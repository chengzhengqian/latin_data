lookout for every kind of seed and eagerly going after fruit
on trees: their appetites match the longevity that fable attributes
to them.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL512_193_41" id="target_note_LCL512_193_41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>
<p>12. ‘Dysarius’ second example, if I recall correctly,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL512_193_42" id="target_note_LCL512_193_42"><sup>42</sup></a>
was that physicians usually give sick people a plain diet, not
a varied one: though you people do this, I think, not because
it’s easier to digest but to restrain appetite, so that
the repugnance of the monotonous diet might depress the
desire to eat, the thought being that the person’s nature is
not up to digesting a lot of food because it’s enfeebled.
That’s why when a sick person tries to get more even of the
simple food, you take it away while he still wants it: thus it
is not the kind but the limited amount that motivates the
practice.</p>
<p>13. As for the point you press, to the effect that
mixing is avoided in eating as it is in drinking, it involves a
trap set by a lurking verbal quibble, since it’s made colorable
by the use of the same word—“mixing”—in different
senses. But the way drink works is very different from the
way food works: who ever experienced from overeating the
severe impairment of mental capacity that befalls us from
drinking?</p>
<p>14. Someone who’s stuffed with food feels a burden
on his stomach or belly, while someone soaked in wine
is like a madman. I think this is because food’s density
causes it to stay in one place and await the ministrations of
digestion, so that only after it’s been processed does it seep
insensibly into the limbs. Drink, being naturally lighter,
soon rises high in the body and strikes the brain, which is
located at the highest point, with a scattering of hot fumes.</p>
<p>15. That is why we avoid mixing wines: otherwise something
capable of suddenly seizing the brain strikes the seat
of reason with a heat that’s as varied as it is sudden. No
comparison, no explanation makes it plausible that the
same danger should be feared from a varied diet.</p>
