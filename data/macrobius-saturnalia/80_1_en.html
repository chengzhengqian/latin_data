<p>11. The Romans also decided to
imitate this arrangement—to no avail, since they overlooked
the fact that they had added one day to the number
chosen by the Greeks, in honor of the odd number, as I
mentioned above [§5]. For that reason the number and arrangement
of the days could not square with an eight-year
cycle.</p>
<p>12. This error was not detected immediately, however:
in eight year cycles they followed the Greek example
of adding ninety “overflow” days, parceling out the total in
four intercalations of, alternately, twenty-two and twenty-three
days; but every eighth year there were eight intercalary
days too many, because of the one day by which, as
I’ve noted [§5], the Romans’ yearly cycle exceeded the
Greeks’.</p>
<p>13. ‘When this error too was finally recognized, they
corrected it in the following way. In every third eight-year
period they parceled out not ninety but sixty-six intercalary
days, to compensate for the twenty-four days by which
they had exceeded the Greek model every twenty-four
years.</p>
<p>14. February was set aside for the intercalation because
it was the last month of the year, and in this too they
imitated the Greeks, who also inserted the added days in
the last month of the year, according to Glaucippus (no.
363 fr. 1 <span class="italic">FGrH</span>), who wrote on the rites of the Athenians.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_161_290" id="target_note_LCL510_161_290"><sup>290</sup></a></p>
<p>15. They departed from the Greeks in one respect, however:
whereas the latter intercalated when the final month
was over, the Romans intercalated after the twenty-third
