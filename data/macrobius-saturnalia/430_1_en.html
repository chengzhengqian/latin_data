what they say is closer to myth than to history. Still, <span class="italic">I</span> think

Greek history. As you know, he calls one of Diana’s
companions “Opis,” a name people commonly think Virgil
perhaps used at random or even made up: they don’t know
that the sly poet chose to give the name to the companion
because ancient Greek authors had given it to Diana herself.</p>
<p>2. But here is what Virgil says (<span class="italic">A.</span> 11.532†–35):</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">Meanwhile in their resting place on high Latonia</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">was addressing swift Opis, one of her maiden allies,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">one of her holy troupe, and with her lips she spoke</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">these sad words;</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">and further on (<span class="italic">A.</span> 11.836†):</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">but for a long while now in the mountain Trivia’s</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">guardian, Opis. . . .</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p>3. He says that Opis is Diana’s companion and ally. But now
hear how the name came to be used by Virgil, who (as I
said) gave it to the goddess’ companion because he had
read that it was an epithet of the goddess herself.</p>
<p>4. Alexander
of Aetolia, an outstanding poet, reports in his book
titled <span class="italic">Muses</span> that the people of Ephesus cared for the temple
dedicated to Diana so zealously that they posted rewards
for the cleverest poets of the day to write different
kinds of poems in the goddess’ honor. In the lines I’m
about to quote “Opis” is the name given, not to Diana’s
