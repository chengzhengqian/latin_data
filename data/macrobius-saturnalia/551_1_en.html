warm because of the season, the cold sinks down into the
earth’s deepest recesses and chills the waters that bubble
up in the depths; conversely, when the air is wintry, the
heat descends to the nether regions and makes the water
steam as it arises in the depths.</p>
<p>11. Accordingly, a phenomenon
that alternates with the seasons everywhere else is always
the same in Egypt, where the air is always hot: as it
seeks the depths, the cold becomes wrapped up in the
roots of the vines and so gives that property to the juice
produced there. That’s why the wines of a hot region are
free of heat.’</p>
<p>12. ‘Having once entered on the topic of heat,’ Albinus
said, ‘our line of inquiry is not finding it easy to head in a
different direction.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL512_225_72" id="target_note_LCL512_225_72"><sup>72</sup></a> Please tell me why a person who enters
a hot bath is burned less if he doesn’t move but feels
the heat more if he stirs the water with his own motion, as
the water burns more intensely every time it is moved.’</p>
<p>13. Dysarius said, ‘Hot water that adheres to our body soon
feels milder, either because the skin has become acclimated
to it or because it is cooled by contact with us. But
motion constantly brings new hot water into contact with
the body, the acclimatization I just referred to fails to occurs,
and the constant supply of new water increases the
sensation of heat.’</p>
<p>14. ‘Why, then,’ Albinus said, ‘when the
hot air is moved by a breeze in the summer, does it feel not
hotter but cooler? By the same principle motion should increase
the burning sensation in this case too.’</p>
<p>15. ‘The
same principle is not at work in the warmth of water and
the warmth of air,’ Dysarius said. ‘The substance of water
is more solid, and when dense matter is moved against
some surface, it attacks it with its force undiminished.
When air is moved it’s dispersed as wind: having become
