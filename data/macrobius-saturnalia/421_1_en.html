Here the very meaning shows that it’s appropriate to take
“Gargarum” to denote the highest point on the mountain,
since he’s speaking about Jupiter.</p>
<p>5. But elsewhere, too,
Homer’s testimony makes the point more plainly (<span class="italic">Il.</span>
14.352):
<q><span class="line">Thus the father slept untroubled on highest</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">Gargaron;</span><span class="linebreak"></span></q>
and Epicharmus, a very ancient poet, wrote as follows in
the play titled <span class="italic">Trojans</span> (fr. 130 <span class="italic">CGF</span> 1,1:115):</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">Lord Zeus, dwelling on Ida, the place of snow-capped</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">Gargara.</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p>6. From these lines it’s clear as day that “Gargara” is the
name of Mount Ida’s peak.</p>
<p>7. But now I’ll list those who
used “Gargara” as the name of a town. Ephorus, the very
well-known historian, says in Book 5 (no. 70 fr. 47 <span class="italic">FGrH</span>):

<span class="italic">Asia</span>, recalls, “After Assos is a city named Gargara, which
is bordered by Antandros.”</p>
<p>8. Aratus’ book of <span class="italic">Elegies</span> is in
circulation, in which the poet says of a certain Diotimus
(<span class="italic">Anth. Gr.</span> 11.437),
<q><span class="line">I wail in grief for Diotimus, who sits upon a rocky</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent3">perch,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">teaching the Gargareans’ children their ABCs.</span><span class="linebreak"></span></q>
From these lines we also learn the name of the town’s citizen,
because they’re named as “Gargareans.”</p>

then, it is well established that “Gargara” at one time has to
be understood as the name of the mountain-top, at another
