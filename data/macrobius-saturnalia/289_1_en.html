<span class="line indent2">[me]:</span><span class="linebreak"></span></q>
here too one must obviously understand that to lose a son
is to be destroyed.</p>
<p>25. And when Juturna complains that
she’s barred from helping her brother (<span class="italic">A.</span> 12.882†),
<q><span class="line"><span class="italic">I</span> am immortal? . . .,</span><span class="linebreak"></span></q>
what follows from this? That it is not true immortality to
live in grief.</p>
<p>26. The poet quite delicately inserted these
expressions, which (as I remarked) get their power from
their precision.</p>
<p>‘For stirring emotion rhetoric also has the sources that<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span>
are called “sources related to the matter at hand,” and they
are very handy for that purpose.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL511_187_20a" id="target_note_LCL511_187_20a"><sup>20</sup></a> Foremost of these is argument
from likeness,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL511_187_21" id="target_note_LCL511_187_21"><sup>21</sup></a> which has three specific forms:
the precedent, the comparison, and the image (in Greek,

<p>2. Virgil uses the argument
from precedent (<span class="italic">A.</span> 6.119–23*):

involving various forms of argument (4.5.1–4.6.9) or figures of
thought (4.6.10–24), complement and overlap categories previously
used: so, e.g., Mars’ destruction of the Lapiths, cited in
4.5.6, was mentioned already under the “argument from the
lesser” (4.2.6) and was used in the latter case to represent indignation,
whereas the “argument from the lesser” adduced below (4.6.1–4) aims at pity; cf. 4.6.2, where “location” and “manner,”
discussed at 4.3.9–15 and 4.4.14–16, are shown to be effective in
the “argument from the lesser.”</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL511_187_20a').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL511_187_21"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL511_187_21" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">21</sup>Cf.
