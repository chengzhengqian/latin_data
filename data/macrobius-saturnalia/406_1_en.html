he preferred to give Greek titles to all his works, the

noun-form that’s alien to regular Latin usage.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL511_421_71" id="target_note_LCL511_421_71"><sup>71</sup></a></p>
<p>‘But enough about such things, most of which all<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">18</span><span class="br"></span>
Romans know, while others are known to at least some. I
come now to things fetched from the inner sanctum of
Greek literature, things no Roman knows, save those who
have earnestly drunk a full draught of Greek learning. For
this poet here was as evasive and secretive in his learning as
