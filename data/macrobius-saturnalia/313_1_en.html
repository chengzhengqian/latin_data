case one party thinking about his own interest, the other
the common interest (<span class="italic">Il.</span> 1.121ff. ~ <span class="italic">A.</span> 11.336–444)—the
single combat of Aeneas and Turnus, like that of Achilles
and Hector (<span class="italic">Il.</span> 22.21ff. ~ <span class="italic">A.</span> 12.697–952), the captives
marked out for the shades of Patroclus, on the one hand
(<span class="italic">Il</span>. 21.26–32), and of Pallas, on the other (<span class="italic">A.</span> 10.517–19):</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line indent19">. . . four youths,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Sulmo’s offspring, and as many again that Ufens</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">raised,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">he captures alive, to slaughter as offerings to the</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">dead.</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p>16. Then there’s Homer’s Lycaon, caught amid the rout
and reduced (no surprise) to begging, though Achilles did
not spare him in his grief for the slain Patroclus (<span class="italic">Il.</span> 21.34–135).
He’s replaced by Magus, who finds himself in similar
circumstances in the midst of the fray (<span class="italic">A.</span> 10.521):</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">thereafter he had aimed from afar his hostile spear at</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">Magus,</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">and when he grasped Aeneas’ knees and begged for his life
as a suppliant, Aeneas replied (<span class="italic">A.</span> 10.532–33),</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line indent6">. . . Turnus did away with that sort</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">of barter in war, back then when he killed Pallas.</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p>17. But where Achilles also mocks Lycaon when he’s already
dead, Maro transfers this to the death of Tarquitius.
The former says (<span class="italic">Il</span>. 21.122),</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">Lie there now</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
