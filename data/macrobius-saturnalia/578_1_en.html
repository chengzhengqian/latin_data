receive from the outside something that moves us to perceive

<p>6. Certainly, an utterance reaches our ears on its
own, and scents waft into our nostrils, and the source of
taste impinges on the palate, and things that are to be perceived
by touch come into contact with our body. From
this he reckoned that nothing emerges from our eyes but
that images of things pass on their own into the eyes.</p>
<p>7. Against this view is the fact that in mirrors the image
across from the viewer looks right back at him, though if
indeed it emerges from us and sets out in a straight line, it
ought to show us its back as it departs, with the left side
corresponding to the left, the right to right: compare the
actor who looks at the mask he’s taken off from the side on
which he put it on, which is to say, not the face but the hollowed-out
back.</p>
<p>8. Next I’d like to ask this fellow whether
images go flying off from objects only when there’s someone
who wants to see them or whether there are images
darting off on every side even when no one is watching.</p>
<p>9. If he should hold the former, my question is, who gives
the order for the images to present themselves to the onlooker
and meet his gaze whenever he chooses to look in
that direction.</p>
<p>10. If he should cling to the latter position,
and so claim that images of all objects are flowing in a
steady stream, my question then is: how long do they maintain
their shapes intact when there’s no substance to bind
them so they stay together? Or if we should grant that they
stay together, how will they retain any color, which itself
though naturally incorporeal can never exist independent
of a physical body?</p>
<p>11. Furthermore, who can convince
himself that as soon as he turns his eyes, images—of
heaven, sea, shore, meadow, ships, cattle, and countless
things besides that we take in with a single glance—thrust
