influence of the priests, who wanted the year to be longer

of days in the year was now increased, now decreased,
and under the cover of a scrupulous precision the opportunity
for confusion increased.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_167_299" id="target_note_LCL510_167_299"><sup>299</sup></a></p>
<p>2. But Gaius Caesar took
all this chronological inconsistency, which he found still ill-sorted
and fluid, and reduced it to a regular and well-defined
order;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_167_300" id="target_note_LCL510_167_300"><sup>300</sup></a> in this he was assisted by the scribe Marcus
Flavius, who presented a table of the individual days to
Caesar in a form that allowed both their order to be determined
and, once that was determined, their relative position
to remain fixed.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_167_301" id="target_note_LCL510_167_301"><sup>301</sup></a></p>
<p>3. When he was on the point of
starting this new arrangement, then, Gaius Caesar let pass
all the days still capable of creating confusion: when that
was done, the final year of confusion was extended to 443
days.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_167_302" id="target_note_LCL510_167_302"><sup>302</sup></a> Then imitating the Egyptians, who alone know all
things concerned with the divine, he undertook to reckon
the year according to the sun, which completes its course
in 365¼ days.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL510_167_303" id="target_note_LCL510_167_303"><sup>303</sup></a></p>
<p>4. For just as one month is a “year” for
the moon—since the moon completes its circuit of the
zodiac in a little under a month—so the solar year
must be calculated according to the number of days the
sun takes to return to the sign from which it began:
that’s why it’s called the “turning year” and is considered

benefit the tax farmers, since their profit lay in collecting more
taxes than the amount for which they had contracted (cf. Cassius
Dio 54.21.5, on a provincial procurator who allegedly persuaded
the Gauls that there were 14 months in the year for a similar purpose);
the advantage of having it shortened presumably lay with
the opportunity to begin collecting taxes again more quickly.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL510_167_298').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL510_167_299"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL510_167_299" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">299</sup>Cf.
