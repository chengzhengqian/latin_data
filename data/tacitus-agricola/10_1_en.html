respectively, have likened the shape of Britain as a whole to an elongated shoulder-blade<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL035_45_1" id="target_note_LCL035_45_1"><sup>1</sup></a> or to an axe-head. This is in fact its shape up to the borders of Caledonia,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL035_45_2" id="target_note_LCL035_45_2"><sup>2</sup></a> whence also this idea has been extended to the whole; but when you cross the border a vast and irregular tract of land runs out forming the final stretch of coast-line and eventually tapers as it were into a wedge. It was only under Agricola that the Roman fleet for the first time rounded this coast, the coast of the remotest sea, and established the insularity of Britain;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL035_45_3" id="target_note_LCL035_45_3"><sup>3</sup></a> by the same voyage it discovered the islands called Orcades,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL035_45_4" id="target_note_LCL035_45_4"><sup>4</sup></a> up to that time unknown, and conquered them.

However, they brought the report that the sea was sluggish and heavy to the oar and comparatively torpid even to the wind—I presume because land and mountain, the cause and occasion of storms, are fewer and further between, and because the deep mass of uninterrupted water is slower to be set in motion. The character and tides of the ocean it is beyond the function of this work to investigate, and, besides, many have recorded them. I would add but a single word, that nowhere has the sea more potent influence: many tidal currents set in various directions; nor merely do the incoming tides wash the shores and ebb again, but penetrate the land
