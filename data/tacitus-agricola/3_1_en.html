the first, from the very outset of this happy age, Nerva<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL035_31_1" id="target_note_LCL035_31_1"><sup>1</sup></a> has united things long incompatible, the principate and liberty; Trajan is increasing daily the happiness of the times; and public confidence has not merely learned to hope and pray, but has received assurance of the fulfilment of its prayers and so has gained strength.

For the term of fifteen years, a large space in human life, chance and change have been cutting off many among us; others, and the most energetic, have perished by the Emperor’s ferocity; while we few who remain have outlived not merely our neighbours but, so to say, ourselves; for out of our prime have been blotted fifteen years, during which young men reached old age and old men the very bounds almost of decrepitude, and all without opening their lips.</p>
