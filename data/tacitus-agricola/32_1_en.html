prayers and prowess. Victory! and the stream is with you. Defeat! and difficulties are everywhere. To have covered so much ground, to have passed the forests, to have forded the estuaries, is honour and glory to an army advancing; but our successes of today become the worst of perils in retreat: we have not the same knowledge of locality, we have not the same abundance of supplies; we have but our hands and swords, and therein we have everything. As for myself, I have long ago reached the conviction that retreat is fatal both to army and to general: therefore not only is honourable death always better than life dishonoured, but in our special case safety and honour go together; nor would it be inglorious to fall at the world’s edge and Nature’s end.</p>

These are the men who last year under cover of night attacked a single legion and were beaten by a shout: these are the most fugitive of the other tribes of Britain, for which reason they have survived so long. When you pierced the thickets and glens, the bravest beasts charged at you; the timid and spiritless were dislodged by the mere stir of your march. Even so the keenest of the Britons have long since fallen; there is left only the flock of cowards and shirkers. That you have found them at last is not because they have made a stand; they have been overtaken: desperation and supreme panic have paralysed their troops here on this spot, for you to win a glorious and spectacular victory. </p></section><notes></notes></section>
