<p><span class="bold">44.</span> Agricola was born on 13 June, in the third consulship of Gaius Caesar;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL035_109_1" id="target_note_LCL035_109_1"><sup>1</sup></a> he died in his fifty-fourth year on 23 August, in the consulship of Collega and Priscinus.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL035_109_2" id="target_note_LCL035_109_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Should posterity desire to learn his mere appearance, he was well-proportioned rather than imposing. There was no violence in his face; its dominant expression was benign. You could easily credit him with goodness, and be glad to think him great. As for the man himself, though snatched away in the mid-career of his prime, he lived to a ripe old age measured by renown. The true blessings of life which lie in character he had fulfilled. What more could fortune have added to one who had been consul, and had worn the decorations of triumph? He did not boast of excessive riches but was possessed of an ample fortune. With daughter and wife surviving him, he may even pass for happy to have escaped what was to come with his position unimpaired, his reputation brilliant, his friends and kin safe.</p>
<p>For though he was not permitted to survive to the light of this happy age, and to see Trajan ruling—a consummation which he foretold in our hearing alike in prayer and prophecy—yet he reaped a great compensation for his premature death, in escaping those last days wherein Domitian no longer fitfully and with breathing spaces, but with one continuous and, so to speak, single blow, poured forth the life-blood of the state.</p>
