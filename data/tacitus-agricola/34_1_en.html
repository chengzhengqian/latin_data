<p><span class="bold">36.</span> The battle began with fighting at long range; the Britons, with their long swords and short shields, showed determination and skill in evading or brushing aside the Roman missiles, while on their own side they launched dense volleys of spears; until Agricola ordered four battalions of Batavi and two of Tungri<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL035_93_1" id="target_note_LCL035_93_1"><sup>1</sup></a> to bring things to the swordâ€™s point and to hand-to-hand fighting; a manoeuvre familiar to them from long service and embarrassing to the enemy, whose shields were small and swords too long; for the British swords, without points, did not admit of locked lines and fighting at close quarters. Accordingly when the Batavi began to exchange blows hand to hand, to strike with the bosses of their shields, to stab in the face, and, after cutting down the enemy on the level, to push their line uphill, the other battalions, exerting themselves to emulate their charge, proceeded to slaughter the nearest enemies; in their haste to snatch victory they left many behind them only half killed, or even unhurt.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the squadrons of cavalry (for the charioteers had fled) took a hand in the infantry battle. And here, though they caused momentary panic, they found themselves brought to a standstill by the close ranks of the enemy and the unevenness of the ground; and it began to look very little like a cavalry action as our troops, who had enough difficulty in holding their ground, were pushed forward by the weight of the horses; repeatedly also straggling chariots, the horses terror-stricken and driver-less, at the casual prompting of panic made oblique or frontal charges.</p>
