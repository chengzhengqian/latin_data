Slaves born to slavery are sold once for all and are fed by their masters free of cost; but Britain pays a daily price for her own enslavement, and feeds the slavers; and as in the slave-gang the new-comer is a mockery even to his fellow-slaves, so in this world-wide, age-old slave-gang, we, the new hands, worth least, are marked out to be made away with: we have no lands or mines or harbours for the working of which we might be set aside.</p>
<p>“Further, courage and high spirit in their subjects displease our masters: our very distance and seclusion, in proportion as they save us, make us more suspected: therefore abandon all hope of pardon, and even at this late hour take courage, whether safety or glory be most prized. A woman could lead the Brigantes<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL035_83_1a" id="target_note_LCL035_83_1a"><sup>1</sup></a> to burn a colony, to storm a camp; and had not their success lapsed into inactivity they might have thrown off the yoke; but <span class="italic">we</span> shall fight as men unscathed and untamed, men who have (been trained) for freedom, not for regrets: let us show them at the very first encounter what manner of men Caledonia has kept in reserve for her cause.</p>
