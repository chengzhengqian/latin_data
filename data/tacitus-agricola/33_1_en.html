<p><span class="bold">35.</span> Even while Agricola was still speaking the enthusiasm of his men gave voice, and the close of his speech was followed by wild excitement, and they broke up at once to take their place for battle.</p>
<p>He drew up his inspired and straining lines so that the detachments of auxiliary infantry, which amounted to eight thousand men, made a strong centre, while the three thousand cavalry were spread out on the wings; the Roman legionaries themselves were posted in front of the palisade, to be a great matter for pride in the event of victory, if the battle were fought without the expenditure of Roman blood, and a reinforcement if the others were repelled.</p>
<p>The British line, in order to be at once impressive and alarming, was drawn up on higher ground, in such a way that the front rank was on the level, while the rest, on a gentle slope, seemed to be towering higher and higher; the war-chariots, noisily manoeuvring, filled the intervening plain.</p>
<p>Then, because the enemy’s numbers were superior, Agricola, fearing to be assailed simultaneously in front and on the flanks, opened out his ranks, although his line was bound to become thereby too long proportionately, and most of his staff warned him to call up the legions; but he was more sanguine than they and deaf to all prophecies of ill; he sent away his horse and took up his position on foot in front of the auxiliaries.</p>
