<p>Thus the British strategy was turned against themselves, for the squadrons passed over by the general’s order from the front of the battle and attacked the enemy’s line from behind; after this, wherever the open ground permitted, began a grand and gory drama of pursuit, wounds, capture, and then—as other fugitives crossed the path—of butchery for the captive; the enemy either fled now in armed hordes before smaller numbers, or, in some cases, according to the differences of temperament, voluntarily charged even unarmed, and made an offering of their lives. Everywhere were weapons, corpses, lopped limbs, and blood upon the ground; but sometimes even in the defeated was found the courage of resentment. For as they approached the forest they rallied and knowing their ground began to surround the foremost and the most reckless among their pursuers. Had not Agricola been everywhere and ordered his strong, light-armed cohorts to scour the woods, like a cordon, and where the woods were thicker, dismounted cavalry, where thinner, mounted cavalry to do the same, undue confidence might have provoked a serious reverse.</p>
