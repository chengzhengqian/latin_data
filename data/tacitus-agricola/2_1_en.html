<p><span class="bold">2.</span> It is recorded that when Rusticus Arulenus extolled Thrasea Paetus, when Herennius Senecio extolled Helvidius Priscus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL035_29_1a" id="target_note_LCL035_29_1a"><sup>1</sup></a> their praise became a capital offence, so that persecution fell not merely on the authors themselves but also on their books: the police, in fact, were given the task of burning in the courtyard of the Forum the memorials of our noblest characters.</p>
<p>They imagined, no doubt, that in those flames disappeared the voice of the people, the liberty of the Senate, the conscience of mankind; especially as the teachers of Philosophy also were expelled, and all decent behaviour exiled, in order that nowhere might anything of good report present itself to men’s eyes.</p>
<p>Assuredly we have given a signal proof of our sub-missiveness; and even as former generations witnessed the utmost excesses of liberty, so have we the extremes of slavery. The investigations of the secret police<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL035_29_2" id="target_note_LCL035_29_2"><sup>2</sup></a> have deprived us even of the give and take of conversation. We should have lost memory itself as well as voice, had forgetfulness been as easy as silence.</p>

Arulenus Iunius Rusticus (brother of Iunius Mauricus, Chapter 45.1) and P. Clodius Thrasea Paetus were both Stoics of Northern Italian descent. Paetus, friend of Nero, and later a shocked critic of him and the Senate, was accused of <span class="italic">maiestas</span> in <span class="sc">a.d.</span> 66, dissuaded Rusticus as tribune from interposing his veto at the trial, and took his own life. Rusticus' account of his death was the main accusation against Rusticus when arraigned and executed by Domitian in <span class="sc">a.d.</span> 93. Paetus' son-in-law C. Helvidius Priscus, another Stoic, exiled first in <span class="sc">a.d.</span> 66 but praetor in <span class="sc">a.d.</span> 70, was again exiled. He was a fearless critic even of the good Vespasian (Emperor <span class="sc">a.d.</span> 69–79) and was executed in 74. Herennius Senecio from Spain wrote an account of Priscus' death. Scorning the higher offices because he disliked the imperial rule, he was condemned for <span class="italic">maiestas</span> in <span class="sc">a.d.</span> 93. These four men, all related, were champions of a so-called “Stoic opposition” not to the principate but to the subservient position of the Senate.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL035_29_1a').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL035_29_2"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL035_29_2" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">2</sup>The emperor Domitian (<span class="sc">a.d.</span> 81–96) encouraged the <span class="italic">delatores,</span> “informers,” who reported to him every kind of adverse criticism.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL035_29_2').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
