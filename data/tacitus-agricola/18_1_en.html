It was by now mid-summer. The army was looking for a peaceful rest, campaigning being presumably over; the enemy for their opportunity. The tribes of the Ordovices,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL035_61_1" id="target_note_LCL035_61_1"><sup>1</sup></a> shortly before his arrival, had crushed almost to a man a regiment of cavalry encamped among them; and this first stroke had excited the province. Those who wanted war applauded the precedent, and waited to see how the new governor would react.</p>
<p>As for Agricola, though the summer was over, though the different units were scattered through the province, though his soldiers had already laid aside service for that year—all factors of delay and hindrance if he was to begin fighting—and although the balance of opinion was in favour of merely guarding the disaffected areas, he decided to confront the danger. He gathered the detachments of the several legions and a small force of auxiliaries, and then, when the Ordovices did not venture to descend from the hills, led his army to the uplands, himself marching in the van to inspire the rest with equal courage to face similar peril. He almost exterminated the whole tribe: then, recognising the necessity of confirming first impressions, knowing that he depended upon the issue of his first campaign to terrorise the enemy for the future, he determined to reduce the island of Anglesey, from the capture of which, as I have before recorded, Paulinus had been recalled by the general rebellion in Britain. His plans had been hastily formed and so, as was natural, he had no ships on the spot; yet the resourcefulness and determination of the general bridged the straits. </p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL035_61_1"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL035_61_1" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">1</sup>Of north Wales, in “Snowdonia.”</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL035_61_1').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
