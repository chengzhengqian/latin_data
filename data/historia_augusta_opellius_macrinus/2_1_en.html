a Marcus, it should be known how often he went out walking, when he varied his diet, and when he changed his clothes, whom he advanced in public life and at what time. By searching out all this sort of thing and recording it, he filled his books with gossip, whereas either nothing at all should be said of petty matters or certainly very little, and then only when light can thereby be thrown on character. It is character, of course, that we really want to know, but only to a certain extent, that from this the rest may be inferred.</p>

<p>II. Now after the murder of Antoninus Bassianus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL140_51_1" id="target_note_LCL140_51_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Opellius Macrinus, who was his prefect of the guard and had previously been the steward of his private property,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL140_51_2" id="target_note_LCL140_51_2"><sup>2</sup></a> laid hold upon the imperial power. Though of humble origin<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL140_51_3" id="target_note_LCL140_51_3"><sup>3</sup></a> and shameless in spirit as well as in countenance, and though hated by all, both civilians and soldiers, he nevertheless proclaimed himself now Severus and now Antoninus.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL140_51_4a" id="target_note_LCL140_51_4a"><sup>4</sup></a> Then he set out at once for the Parthian war<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL140_51_5" id="target_note_LCL140_51_5"><sup>5</sup></a> and thus gave no opportunity either for the soldiers to form an opinion of him, or for the gossip by which he was beset to gain its full strength. The senators, however, out of hatred for Antoninus Bassianus, received him as emperor gladly, and in all the senate there was but the one cry: “Anyone rather than the fratricide, anyone rather than the incestuous, anyone rather than the filthy, anyone rather than the slayer of the senate and people!”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL140_51_6" id="target_note_LCL140_51_6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>It may perhaps seem to all a matter for wonder
