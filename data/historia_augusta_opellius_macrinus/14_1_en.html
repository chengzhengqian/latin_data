When their guilt was proved, he gave orders that two oxen of extraordinary size should be cut open rapidly while still alive, and that the soldiers should be thrust one into each, with their heads protruding so that they could talk to each other. In this way he inflicted punishment on them, though neither our ancestors nor the men of his own time ever ordained any such penalty, even for those guilty of adultery. Yet in spite of all this, he warred against the Parthians,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL140_75_1" id="target_note_LCL140_75_1"><sup>1</sup></a> the Armenians,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL140_75_2" id="target_note_LCL140_75_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and the Arabs who are called the Blest,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL140_75_3" id="target_note_LCL140_75_3"><sup>3</sup></a> and with no less bravery than success.</p>

<span class="line">“Peerless in beauty the youth,”</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">“Not deserving to have as his father Mezentius.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL140_75_5" id="target_note_LCL140_75_5"><sup>5</sup></a></span><span class="linebreak"></span>

<p class="noindent">He also put living men into walls, which he then built up. Those guilty of adultery he always burned alive, fastening their bodies together. A slave who had fled from his master and had been found he would sentence to a combat with the sword in the public games. A public informer, if he could not make good his accusation, he would condemn to death; if he could make it good, he would present
