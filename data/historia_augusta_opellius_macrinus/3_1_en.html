<p>III. Concerning this matter I will relate what has been recorded in books of history. The priestess of Caelestis<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL140_53_2" id="target_note_LCL140_53_2"><sup>2</sup></a> at Carthage was wont, when inspired by the goddess, to predict the truth. Now once, in the reign of Antoninus Pius, she was foretelling the future to the proconsul, who, according to custom, was consulting about the public welfare as well as his own hopes of power, and when she came to the emperors she bade him in a loud voice count the number of times she said Antoninus. Then, to the amazement of all, she uttered the name Antoninus eight times. All interpreted this to mean that Antoninus Pius would reign for eight years, but he exceeded this number and those who had faith in the priestess, either then or later, felt sure that her words had some different meaning. And in fact, if all who bore the name Antoninus be counted, this will be found to be their number. For Pius first, Marcus second, Verus third, Commodus fourth, Caracalla fifth, Geta sixth, Diadumenianus seventh. Elagabalus eighth—all bore the name Antoninus; while the two Gordians, on the other hand, must not be placed among the Antonini, for they either had only their praenomen or were called Antonii, not Antonini.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL140_53_3" id="target_note_LCL140_53_3"><sup>3</sup></a> Hence it came about that Severus called himself Antoninus, as most writers relate, and Pertinax too and Julianus, and likewise Macrinus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL140_53_4" id="target_note_LCL140_53_4"><sup>4</sup></a>; and the Antonines themselves, who were the true successors of Antoninus, used this name
