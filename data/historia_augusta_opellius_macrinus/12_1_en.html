<p>XI. Macrinus, in his life as emperor, was, in spite of all, rather rigid and stern, thinking that so he could bury in oblivion all his previous career, though in fact this very sternness of his presented an opportunity for criticising and attacking him. For he wished to bear the names Severus and Pertinax,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL140_71_1" id="target_note_LCL140_71_1"><sup>1</sup></a> both of which seemed to him to connote harshness, and when the senate conferred on him the names Pius and Felix, he accepted the name of Felix but refused that of Pius.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL140_71_2" id="target_note_LCL140_71_2"><sup>2</sup></a> This refusal, it seems, was the cause of an epigram against him, written by a certain Greek poet and not without charm, which has been rendered into Latin in the following vein:</p>

<span class="line">Righteous and blessèd together he might have appeared and been surnamed,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">Unrighteous, unblessèd too, now and forever is he.”</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
