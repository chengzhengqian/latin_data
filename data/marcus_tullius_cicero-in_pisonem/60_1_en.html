fortune should be weighed,—do you think that to me you can appear anything but condemned, when our allies, when all communities whether federated, free, or tributary, when the merchants, the tax-farmers,
the whole of our civic community, the lieutenants, the military tribunes, and all the remnant of your troops who have escaped the sword or famine or disease, account you worthy of every torment; when neither before the senate nor before the knights of Rome nor before any order of society, neither in the city nor in Italy, can any extenuating circumstances be adduced to procure indulgence for your enormous crimes; when you loathe your own self, fear all your fellow-men, will venture to entrust your cause to none, and, in a word, pass verdict of “Guilty” upon yourself?</p>
<p>Never have I thirsted for your blood; never have<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">99</span><span class="br"></span> I invoked against you that final execution of law and judgement which may visit the just and the unjust alike. But to see you abject, despised, scorned by your fellows, a thing that despairs of itself and lives abandoned by itself, that peers into every corner and quakes at every whisper, that lives mistrustful of itself, without voice, liberty or authority, stripped of its consular pride, a shivering, trembling, fawning wretch—this have I desired to see you; and my desire has been gratified. Therefore if the blow you fear falls at last upon you, I shall not take it amiss; but should that blow be perchance deferred, your humiliation will yet be mine to enjoy; I shall be as well pleased to see you in daily dread of impeachment as if you were actually impeached; nor shall I be less glad to see you always a mean object of men’s pity than if for a brief while you claimed that pity by your garb.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL252_259_a" id="target_note_LCL252_259_a"><sup>a</sup></a></p>
