We are close upon the celebration of the most elaborate and gorgeous games<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL252_219_a" id="target_note_LCL252_219_a"><sup>a</sup></a> in the memory of man—games which are not only without parallel in the past, but of which it is difficult to conceive that future ages will ever show their like. Trust yourself to the people; make your venture at these games. Are you afraid of hisses? Where are your disquisitions? Do you fear to be hooted? That again is no matter to worry a philosopher.

But it is not voluptuousness in the ordinary<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">67</span><span class="br"></span> sense of the word that you must look to find in him.
