his label of consul. For since my whole cause was the cause of a consul and a senator, it was a consul and a senate whose help I needed; and of these two resources the former was by you two consuls even turned to my destruction, and the other torn root and branch from the constitution. And yet, if you ask what determined my conduct, I should not have retired, and my country would herself have retained me in her embrace, if I had had to contend merely with that funeral-gladiator<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL252_165_a" id="target_note_LCL252_165_a"><sup>a</sup></a> and with you and your colleague. For wholly different was the case of the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">20</span><span class="br"></span> heroic Quintus Metellus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL252_165_b" id="target_note_LCL252_165_b"><sup>b</sup></a> a citizen who in my judgement was equal with the immortal gods in glory; who thought fit to retire and so avoid an armed conflict with the gallant Gaius Marius—consul, nay, six times consul—and his invincible legions.

Other gales I saw upon<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">21</span><span class="br"></span> the horizon; other squalls I anticipated; other tempests threatened before which I did not retire, but made myself a solitary sacrifice to ensure the safety of all.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL252_165_ea" id="target_note_LCL252_165_ea"><sup>e</sup></a></p>
