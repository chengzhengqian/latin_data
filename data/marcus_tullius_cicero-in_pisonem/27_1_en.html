Gaius Marius, whom the Italy he had preserved saw sunk in the marshes of Minturnae, and the Africa he had vanquished saw banished and shipwrecked. Those were wounds dealt by the slings of fortune, not of misconduct; but punishment is the wages of sin, and of sin alone. Indeed were I ever to pray that disaster might light upon you—as I have often prayed, and the immortal gods have heard my prayers—I should not pray for disease or death or physical torture. That would be like the imprecation put into the mouth of Thyestes by the poet, who appeals to the sentiments of the uninstructed and not of the philosopher when he prays:</p>

A death like his must be set down to chance, not to retribution. What then is retribution? What is punishment? What is stoning? What is the cross? This: that there should be two generals in the provinces of the people of Rome; that they should control armies and bear the title of Imperator; and that one of these should be so utterly unmanned by the consciousness of his crimes and his atrocities, that from a province which was above all others the most prolific in triumphs he should dare to send no dispatch to the senate.
