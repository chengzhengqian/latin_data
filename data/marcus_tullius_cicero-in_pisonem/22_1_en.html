legates and magistrates, not, as you the Insubrian<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL252_183_a" id="target_note_LCL252_183_a"><sup>a</sup></a> have dared to assert, as one deprived of his country, but, as the senate at that very time styled me, as a citizen and the preserver of the constitution. For my restoration, and for mine alone, the senate thought fit by the consul’s voice and by letters to entreat the co-operation of all citizens from all Italy who had the welfare of the state at heart. To preserve my rights the whole of Italy, as at a given signal, flocked on one day to Rome. My restoration was made the subject of harangues delivered to numerous and applauding throngs by our excellent and heroic consul Publius Lentulus, by the illustrious and invincible citizen Gnaeus Pompeius, and by the other leading men of the city. Upon me, at the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">35</span><span class="br"></span> initiative and on the motion of Gnaeus Pompeius, the senate decreed that any who should hinder my return should be counted among his country’s foes, and the official pronouncement of the senate was delivered upon me in such terms that none ever had a triumph decreed for him in more laudatory language than was my restoration and restitution for me. And when the measure concerning me had been promulgated by all the magistrates save a single praetor,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL252_183_b" id="target_note_LCL252_183_b"><sup>b</sup></a> from whom it was scarce to be expected since he was the brother of my enemy, and two tribunes of the plebs who had been bought like marketed slaves, then Publius Lentulus the consul brought a law before the Assembly of the Centuries, upon the proposal of his colleague Quintus Metellus, who, just as in his tribunate<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL252_183_c" id="target_note_LCL252_183_c"><sup>c</sup></a> he had been alienated from me by political affairs, was by political affairs reunited to me in his consulship thanks to the courage and wisdom of one excellent and upright gentleman.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL252_183_d" id="target_note_LCL252_183_d"><sup>d</sup></a><span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">36</span><span class="br"></span>
