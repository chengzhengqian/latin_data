a chieftain of the Bessie tribe, when he had come as a delegate to your camp to promise you strong garrisons and auxiliaries of horse and foot from the Bessi; and not him alone, also all his fellow-delegates whose lives you sold to King Cotys. Against the Denseleti, a tribe which has always been submissive to this empire, and which even at the general rising of the barbarians preserved Macedonia when Gaius Sentius was praetor,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL252_241_a" id="target_note_LCL252_241_a"><sup>a</sup></a> you waged an abominable and piteous war, and though you might have had them for your trusted allies, you preferred to treat them as your bitterest foes. In this way you turned into plunderers and marauders the men who might have been the permanent defenders of Macedonia; they threw our revenues into confusion, they captured our cities, they laid waste our lands, they led away our allies into slavery, they carried off whole households, they drove off cattle, and they compelled the people of Thessalonica, who despaired of saving their town, to fortify their citadel.</p>

Yours are the crimes which the immortal gods have expiated upon our troops; attacked, as they were, by a single form of disease, when no one, who had once fallen sick, was able to recover, no one had any doubt that it was the violation of hospitality, the murders of delegates, the war wantonly and wickedly waged against peaceable allies, and the plundering of temples, which were responsible for this devastating pestilence.</p>
<p>You may recognize in this brief selection the general nature of your wickedness and cruelty.
