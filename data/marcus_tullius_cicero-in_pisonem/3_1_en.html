obtained all the magistracies without a rebuff? I can take a true pride in making that assertion of myself; for upon myself and for myself the Roman people bestowed all its offices. But when you were made quaestor, even men who had never seen you conferred that honour upon—your name. You were made aedile; it was a Piso—not you who bear that name—who
