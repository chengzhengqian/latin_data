were consul, wished to belong also to Sextus Clodius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL252_169_a" id="target_note_LCL252_169_a"><sup>a</sup></a>? And do you think that the consulship is attested by a dog that whines at the heels of a Clodius? A consul should declare himself such in spirit, in discretion, in honour, in dignity, in vigilance, in devotion, in the careful performance of the functions and duties of his office, and above all—as the signification of his title indicates—in consulting the interests of the commonwealth. Or am I to count him a consul who thought that the senate had no place in the constitution? And am I to count him a consul without reference to that great Council without whom even kings could not have existed at Rome? I will say no more on this point; but, when levies of slaves were being held in the forum, when arms in open daylight were being conveyed into the temple of Castor, and when that temple, its doors removed and its steps torn up, was occupied by the remnant of the conspirators and by him<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL252_169_b" id="target_note_LCL252_169_b"><sup>b</sup></a> who had once been Catiline’s collusive prosecutor but was now his avenger; when knights of Rome were being banished, patriots pelted with stones from the forum, and when the senate was not permitted even to mourn the constitution, let alone defend it; when the citizen whom this order, with the assent of Italy and all nations, had pronounced the saviour of his country was being driven forth without trial, without law, without precedent, by the hands of armed slaves—I will not say with your assistance (though I might truly say that) but at least without protest from you—at such a time will anyone pronounce that consuls existed at Rome? Who, pray, are robbers, if you are consuls? Who are to be<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">24</span><span class="br"></span> called pirates, who enemies, who traitors, who tyrants?</p>
