For who is there who considers you a fit person to be approached, to be in any way distinguished, or even to be greeted with ordinary civility? All expunge from the state the hateful memory of your consulship, your every act and quality, your very face and name. The lieutenants who served with you are estranged from you, your military tribunes are your enemies, while your centurions, and any soldiers who may yet survive from that great army which you dispersed rather than disbanded, detest you, invoke a murrain upon you, call down curses upon your head. Achaea drained, Thessaly harried, Athens mutilated, Dyrrachium and Apollonia desolated, Ambracia looted, the Parthini
and the people of Bulis mocked, Epirus wasted, Locris, Phocis, and Boeotia gutted, Acarnania, Amphilochia, Perraebia, and the Athamanes sold, Macedonia made a free gift to the barbarians, Aetolia lost, the Dolopes and the mountaineers upon their borders driven from their towns and fields, and Roman citizens who have commercial dealings in those countries,â€”all these felt that it was as an arch-peculator
of themselves and their allies, an arch-plunderer,
an arch-robber, and an arch-foe that you came into their midst.</p>
