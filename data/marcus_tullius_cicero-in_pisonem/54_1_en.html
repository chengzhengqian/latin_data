I say nothing of the licences which you scattered broadcast over the province, the tale of ships which you requisitioned or the sum-total of your spoils, I say nothing of your system of levying and commandeering corn, nothing of your robbing both communities and individuals of their liberties, though they had received them expressly as rewards—all offences which are explicitly forbidden by the law of Julius.</p>
