the honour, great the majesty of a consul. That greatness your narrow mind cannot comprehend nor your shallow nature recognize; your spiritless heart and feeble understanding cannot grasp it; nor can you, with your inexperience of prosperity, appreciate a role so eminent, so dignified, so august. In truth I have heard it reported that no sooner had the Seplasia<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL252_171_a" id="target_note_LCL252_171_a"><sup>a</sup></a> seen you than it scouted you as a Campanian
