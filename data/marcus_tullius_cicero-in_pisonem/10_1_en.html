but demonstrate what sort of a consul you, had it so happened, would have been at that crisis; it is with pay, God help us, and with provisions that you would have thought Catiline should be assisted! For what<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">15</span><span class="br"></span> difference was there between Catiline and the man to whom you sold the authority of the senate, the welfare of the community, and the whole constitution, for the price of a province? Yes, the consuls assisted Clodius in the execution of what Catiline was but attempting when I as consul defeated him. He would fain have massacred the senate, you<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL252_159_a" id="target_note_LCL252_159_a"><sup>a</sup></a> abolished it; have destroyed the laws, you rescinded them; have worked the downfall of his country, you assisted him. In your consulship what was achieved without recourse to arms? That crew of conspirators wished to burn the city, you to burn the house of him to whom it was due that the city was not burned. And yet even those scoundrels would not have wished to fire Rome if they had had a consul like one of you two; for they did not want to have no roof over their heads, but thought that while this order stood they would find no shelter for their villainy.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL252_159_b" id="target_note_LCL252_159_b"><sup>b</sup></a> They desired the slaughter of their fellow-citizens, you their enslavement; and herein you showed yourselves the crueller, for before your consulship the spirit of freedom was so deeply engrained in this people, that they held death preferable to servitude. Yet in this one respect the policies of yourselves and<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">16</span><span class="br"></span> of Catiline and Lentulus are counterparts one of another; you drove me from my house, and Gnaeus Pompeius into his<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL252_159_c" id="target_note_LCL252_159_c"><sup>c</sup></a>; for they held that, while I stood firm at my post as sentinel over the city, and while Pompeius, the vanquisher of all nations, withstood them, they could never hope to destroy the commonwealth.</p>
