What need for me to lay bare the full tale of your<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">86</span><span class="br"></span> avarice, intertwined as it is with the endless catalogue of your crimes? I will content myself with alluding in general terms to a few notorious examples. Did you not leave to be put out to usury in Rome the eighteen millions of sesterces which had been paid to you from the treasury, nominally as your outfit-money,
but really the price for which my life had been bought? After the people of Apollonia had paid you two hundred talents at Rome to gain exemption from their just debts, did you not deliberately sell the accomplished Roman knight Fufidius to them—the creditor to his debtors?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL252_243_a" id="target_note_LCL252_243_a"><sup>a</sup></a> Did you not, after handing over your winter quarters to your lieutenant and your prefect, utterly destroy those wretched communities, which were not only utterly drained of all their wealth but which also were forced to submit to the unspeakable and abominable degradation of your lustfulness?

In times of low prices, or if the governor could compound with the farmers for a low price, he could pocket the surplus.
