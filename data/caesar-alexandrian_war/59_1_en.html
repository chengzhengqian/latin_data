natural one for all its artificial appearance—whose summit is loftier than all the terrain surrounding it. Encircling this town are many considerable hills, intersected by valleys; and one of these—a very lofty one—which enjoys no little fame in those parts thanks to the victory of Mithridates, and the misfortune of Triarius and defeat of our army,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL402_127_1" id="target_note_LCL402_127_1"><sup>1</sup></a> is all but linked to the town by tracks along the higher ground, and is little more than three miles distant from Zela.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL402_127_2" id="target_note_LCL402_127_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Here Pharnaces repaired the ancient works of his father’s once prosperous camp, and occupied the position with his entire forces.</p>

This was speedily collected. The following night he left camp at the fourth watch<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL402_127_3a" id="target_note_LCL402_127_3a"><sup>3</sup></a> with all his legions in light order and the heavy baggage left behind in camp, and surprised the enemy at dawn by capturing that very position where Mithridates once fought his successful action against Triarius.

The rendering given is perhaps the most likely. Caesar had some four miles to march; and if he left camp early in the fourth watch (this would be quite short in June), he could have taken the position at dawn. Two other interpretations seem possible: (1) ‘at the fourth watch as the dawn was (just) breaking he captured . . .’
(2) ‘When at the fourth watch on the following night this material had been collected . . .’.
