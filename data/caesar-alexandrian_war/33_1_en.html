Thus the Thirty-Sixth legion launched an attack on the king’s cavalry outside the trench and fought so successful an action that it advanced up to the walls of the town, crossed the trench, and attacked the enemy in rear. The Pontic legion, however, on the other flank, drew back a little from the enemy, and attempted, moreover, to go round or cross the trench, so as to attack the enemy’s exposed flank; but in the actual crossing of the trench it was pinned down and overwhelmed.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL402_75_1" id="target_note_LCL402_75_1"><sup>1</sup></a> The legions of Deiotarus, indeed, offered scarcely any resistance to the attack.
