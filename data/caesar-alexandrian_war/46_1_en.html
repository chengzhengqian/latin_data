Moreover, he held a levy of Roman knights. These were conscripted from all the corporations<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL402_101_2" id="target_note_LCL402_101_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and colonies and, as they were thoroughly scared of military service overseas, he invited them to purchase their discharge. This proved a great source of profit, but the hatred it produced was still greater. This done, he reviewed his entire army and then despatched to the point of embarkation the legions he intended to take into Africa, with their auxiliary troops. He himself proceeded to Hispalis to inspect the fleet he was building up; and there he tarried awhile, since he had published a decree throughout the province that those who had been ordered to contribute, but had not yet contributed sums of money, must come before him.
