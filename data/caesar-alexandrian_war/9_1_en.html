Caesar returned to Alexandria with his victorious fleet, towing the merchant-ships against a gentle head wind.</p>

Nevertheless, after Ganymedes had declared in the council that he would not only make good the losses they had sustained but also increase the number of their ships, their hopes and confidence ran high and they began to repair their old ships and to devote greater care and more earnest attention to this matter. And though they had lost more than a hundred and ten warships in the harbour and docks,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL402_27_3" id="target_note_LCL402_27_3"><sup>3</sup></a> yet they did not abandon the idea of re-equipping their fleet. They saw in fact that neither troop reinforcements nor supplies could be conveyed to Caesar if they themselves had a strong fleet; apart from which, the men of the city and the coastal district, seamen as they were and trained as such from boyhood by daily practice, were anxious to resort to this their natural and native gift, and were aware how successful they had been with their humble little vessels. Consequently they threw themselves whole-heartedly into the task of equipping a fleet.</p>

Caesar had no marines on board, whereas the Alexandrians had; so that, though Caesar doubtless improvised
boarding parties from such sailors as could be spared, he had to rely mainly upon superior seamanship to ram or cripple his opponents’ ships.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL402_27_1').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL402_27_2"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL402_27_2" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">2</sup>Or perhaps <span class="italic">ut superioribus locis</span> should be read, the sense being ‘which, as being more elevated sites, had proved their mainstay.’</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL402_27_2').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL402_27_3"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL402_27_3" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">3</sup>These losses are briefly alluded to in <span class="italic">Civil Wars</span> III, ch. 111.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL402_27_3').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
