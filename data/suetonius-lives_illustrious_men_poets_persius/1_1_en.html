<h1><span class="ac">The Life of Aules Persius Flaccus</span></h1>
<p>Aules Persius Flaccus was born the day before the Nones of December in the consulship of Fabius Persicus and Lucius Vitellius,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL038_477_45" id="target_note_LCL038_477_45"><sup>45</sup></a> and died on the eighth day before the Kalends of December, when Publius Marius and Afinius Gallus were consuls.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL038_477_46" id="target_note_LCL038_477_46"><sup>46</sup></a> He was born at Volaterrae in Etruria, was a Roman knight, but was connected by blood and by marriage with men of the senatorial order. He died on his estate near the eighth milestone of the Appian Way.</p>
<p>His father Flaccus died when his son was about six years old, leaving him to the care of a guardian. His mother, Fulvia Sisennia, afterwards married a Roman knight named Fusius, but buried him also within a few years.</p>
<p>Flaccus studied until the twelfth year of his age at Volaterrae, and then at Rome with the grammarian Remmius Palaemon<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL038_477_47" id="target_note_LCL038_477_47"><sup>47</sup></a> and the rhetorician Verginius Flavus. When he was sixteen years old he became so intimate a friend of Annaeus Cornutus that he never left his side; and from him he obtained some knowledge of philosophy.</p>
<p>From early youth he enjoyed the friendship of Caesius Bassus, the poet, and of Calpurnius Statura, who died in youth, while Persius still lived. Servilius Nonianus he revered as a father. Through Cornutus he came to know Annaeus Lucanus also, a pupil of Cornutus and of the same age as himself. Lucan so admired the writings of Flaccus</p>
