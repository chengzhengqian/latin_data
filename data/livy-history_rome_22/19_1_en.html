Since Servilius followed the order, the meeting of the two men did much to impress on citizens and allies the grandeur of the dictator’s office—with the passage of time they had almost forgotten the authority it carried.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL233_229_57" id="target_note_LCL233_229_57"><sup>57</sup></a> At this point a letter was brought from the city with news that transport vessels carrying supplies from Ostia to the army in Spain had been captured off the port of Cosa<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL233_229_58" id="target_note_LCL233_229_58"><sup>58</sup></a> by a Carthaginian fleet.

Large numbers of men were conscripted in Rome; even freedmen who had children and were of military age<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL233_229_60" id="target_note_LCL233_229_60"><sup>60</sup></a> had sworn the oath of allegiance.
