Before any firm plans could be formulated, news suddenly arrived of another reverse: four thousand cavalry sent by the consul Servilius to his colleague under the command of the propraetor Gaius Centenius had changed course after hearing about the battle of Trasimene and been cut off in Umbria by Hannibal.

The dictatorship was a temporary appointment (six months maximum) originally to deal with an emergency, usually military, but then also for domestic purposes, especially the holding of elections.
