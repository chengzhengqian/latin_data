war was with Romans and being fought in Italy. For they had over the past two years come to hold both the Roman officers and their soldiers in such contempt that they could scarcely believe that their war was with the same people about whom they had received frightening reports from their fathers. And they say that Hannibal, too, as he was returning from the battle, commented that the cloud that usually sat on the mountain tops had now come down as a rainstorm.</p>
