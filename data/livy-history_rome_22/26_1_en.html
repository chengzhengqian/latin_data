a moderately-sized force secured Mt. Callicula and Casilinum, a town bisected by the River Volturnus and marking the boundary between Falernian and Campanian territory.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL233_243_76" id="target_note_LCL233_243_76"><sup>76</sup></a> While he himself then led the army back by way of the same heights, he sent Lucius Hostilius Mancinus out to reconnoiter with four hundred allied cavalry.</p>
<p>Mancinus, one of the crowd of young men often listening to the master of horse’s ranting diatribes, at first went forward to spy on the enemy from a secure vantage point, as a scout would, but when he caught sight of some Numidians roaming at large through the villages...<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL233_243_77" id="target_note_LCL233_243_77"><sup>77</sup></a> when given the chance, even killed a few of them. Suddenly Mancinus’ thoughts were focused on the fight and the instructions of the dictator (who had ordered him to advance only as far as he could safely and then fall back before being spotted by the enemy) slipped from his mind. The Numidians, some charging and some giving ground, lured him on almost right to their encampment, tiring the Roman horses and their riders. Then Carthalo, with whom lay supreme command of the Carthaginian cavalry, bore down on them at a gallop, routing them even before Mancinus came within javelin range and maintaining nonstop pursuit for about five miles. When he saw that the enemy was not abandoning the chase and that he had no hope of escape, Mancinus, encouraging his men, turned back to put up a fight although outnumbered in every respect. Thus the commander himself and the best of his cavalry troops were surrounded and killed. The others charged back in scattered flight and fled first to Cales and then, by almost impassable trails, to the dictator.</p>
