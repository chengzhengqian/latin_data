<p>In addition to these terrible disasters, the Romans were also alarmed by a number of prodigies and especially by the conviction that year of two Vestals, Opimia and Floronia, on charges of sexual misconduct. One had received the traditional penalty of being buried alive near the Colline Gate and the other had committed suicide. The man guilty of the misconduct with Floronia, Lucius Cantilius, was the secretary of a pontiff—one of the officers that they now call minor pontiffs<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL233_365_176" id="target_note_LCL233_365_176"><sup>176</sup></a>—and he was so badly flogged in the comitium by the Pontifex Maximus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL233_365_177" id="target_note_LCL233_365_177"><sup>177</sup></a> that he expired under the lash.</p>

Meanwhile a number of extraordinary sacrifices were conducted following instructions from the Books of Fate.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL233_365_180" id="target_note_LCL233_365_180"><sup>180</sup></a> These included a Gallic man and woman and a Greek man and woman being interred alive in the <span class="italic">Forum Boarium</span>, in a spot enclosed with stones that had already been stained by human sacrifice, which was very alien to Roman religious observance.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL233_365_181" id="target_note_LCL233_365_181"><sup>181</sup></a></p>
<p>When it was felt that enough had been done to placate the gods, Marcus Claudius Marcellus sent fifteen hundred soldiers—men whom he had under his command as recruits for the fleet—from Ostia to Rome for the city’s defense. He then sent the naval legion (that was the third legion) ahead to Teanum Sidicinum<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL233_365_182" id="target_note_LCL233_365_182"><sup>182</sup></a> with its military
