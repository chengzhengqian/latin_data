former consuls, praetors and aediles (numbered among them are Gnaeus Servilius Geminus and Marcus Minucius, who had been master of horse the year before and consul a number of years earlier). There were also eighty men who had either been senators or had held offices that qualified them for selection for the senate, but had served as soldiers in the legions of their own volition. Three thousand infantry and fifteen hundred cavalry were reportedly taken prisoner in the battle.</p>
<p>50. Such was the battle of Cannae. Its fame rivals that of the disaster at the Allia,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL233_345_160" id="target_note_LCL233_345_160"><sup>160</sup></a> and while it was less critical in its later impact (since the enemy stalled thereafter), it was in casualties for the army even more serious and appalling. For while the flight at the Allia meant the loss of the city, it still saved the army; at Cannae there were barely fifty men with the fleeing consul, and almost the entire army remained with the other one who lost his life.</p>
<p>In both Roman camps there was now a poorly armed crowd of leaderless men, and those in the larger camp sent a message to the smaller urging their comrades to join them while the enemy, exhausted from the battle and the jubilant feasting that would follow, would at night be deep in sleep. They would then leave for Canusium<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL233_345_161" id="target_note_LCL233_345_161"><sup>161</sup></a> in a single column, they said. Some rejected the suggestion out of hand, asking why those issuing the invitation could not come themselves, that being just as satisfactory a way to join up. Obviously it was because the ground between them was all in enemy hands and they preferred to expose other peopleâ€™s lives to such great danger rather than their own. Others were not averse to the suggestion but had not the nerve to follow it.</p>
