When Appius and Scipio were told that the other consul had survived the battle, they immediately sent him a message to report on their infantry and cavalry strength and also to ask whether his instructions were for their army to be brought to Venusia or remain at Canusium. Varro led his own troops to Canusium himself; and there was now some semblance of a consular army, and it appeared that they would at least be able to defend themselves against the enemy, behind fortifications if not in battle.</p>
<p>The report that had been brought to Rome made no mention of the survival even of these remnants of citizen and allied troops, only that the army and two consuls had been wiped out and all their forces entirely destroyed. Never before had there been such panic and uproar within the walls of Rome while the city was still safe. I shall concede defeat before the task and not attempt a description which, whatever details I record, will fall short of the truth. A consul and his army had been lost at Trasimene the year before, and now it was not just a case of one blow being followed by another blow but of it being followed by a disaster many times greater.
