the augurs that the dictatorâ€™s appointment was invalid. So, he said, they now had their <span class="italic">interregnum.</span> But one consulship did at least belong to the Roman plebs,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL233_303_131" id="target_note_LCL233_303_131"><sup>131</sup></a> and the people would make free use of it and give it to a man who preferred a quick victory rather than a long command.</p>
<p>35. The plebeians were inflamed by such speeches. There were three patrician candidates, Publius Cornelius Merenda, Lucius Manlius Volso, and Marcus Aemilius Lepidus, and two plebeian candidates from already-ennobled families,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL233_303_132" id="target_note_LCL233_303_132"><sup>132</sup></a> Gaius Atilius Serranus and Quintus Aelius Paetus (one a pontifex, the other an augur<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL233_303_133" id="target_note_LCL233_303_133"><sup>133</sup></a>). But only one consul, Terentius Varro, was elected, so the elections for the appointment of his colleague were in his hands.</p>
<p>Discovering that those running against Varro had lacked the necessary electoral strength, the nobles now forced Lucius Aemilius Paullus to stand, though for a long time he steadfastly refused to do so. Paullus had served as consul with Marcus Livius and had been a bitter enemy of the plebs ever since the condemnation of his former colleague, an affair in which his own reputation almost went up in flames.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL233_303_134a" id="target_note_LCL233_303_134a"><sup>134</sup></a> On the next election day all those who had been in competition with Varro withdrew, and Paullus joined the consul as a rival to oppose him rather than as a colleague.</p>
<p>The praetorian elections were held next. Marcus Pomponius Matho and Publius Furius Philus were returned, and Philus was allotted the urban judicial administration and Pomponius jurisdiction between citizens and foreigners.
