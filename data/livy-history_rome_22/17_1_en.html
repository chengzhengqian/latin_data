Sacred Spring before the people; that vow could not be made without the order of the people, he said. The question was put to the people in these words:</p>
<p>“Would it be your will and command that these measures be implemented? Should the Republic of the Quirites, the Roman people, be kept safe for the next five years, as I would wish and pray, throughout these wars—the war of the Roman people with the people of Carthage and the wars against the Gauls living this side of the Alps—let the people of Rome, the Quirites, then offer this gift.

Let whosoever makes this sacrifice make it when he wishes and in the way he wishes; and whatever his manner of making it let the sacrifice be considered duly made. If the animal due to be sacrificed dies, let it be considered unconsecrated, and with no guilt attaching to it. If anyone should unwittingly damage or kill the beast, let him not be regarded as culpable. If anyone should steal it, let neither the people of Rome nor the individual from whom it is stolen be considered guilty. If someone unwittingly performs the sacrifice on a day of ill omen, let it still be considered properly made. If it is performed by day or night, by slave or free man, let it be considered properly made. If it is performed before the time the senate and people have decreed, let the people be considered exempt and quit of the vow.”</p>
