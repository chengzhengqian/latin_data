betray, he would be nothing more than another worthless and discreditable nobody, he set his mind on making himself as useful as possible to his new allies. After considering everything that fortune could put within his reach, he turned his thoughts especially to returning the hostages, thinking that this one thing above all would win the Romans the support of the Spanish chieftains.</p>
<p>Well aware, however, that those guarding the hostages would do nothing without their commander Bostar’s authorization, he craftily approached Bostar himself. Bostar had his camp right on the shore outside the city in order to block the Romans’ access from that direction. There Abelux took him aside and explained how matters stood, as if he were unaware of it. Until that day fear had curbed the spirit of the Spaniards because the Romans were far off, he said, but now there was a Roman camp south of the Ebro, providing a secure stronghold and refuge for those wanting radical change. And so, since fear would not keep the Spaniards in check, they should be put under obligation to Carthage by some gesture of generosity and goodwill.</p>
<p>When, taken aback, Bostar asked what offering could now suddenly be so important to the Spaniards, Abelux replied: “Send the hostages back to their communities. That will win you gratitude both on a personal level from the parents—the people who command the greatest respect in their communities—and also on the public level from the various tribes. Everybody wants to be trusted, and giving a person one’s trust generally secures his true loyalty. I claim for myself the charge of returning the hostages to their homes so I can assist my own plan with a special effort, and increase as much as I can the gratitude for an act that by its very nature will make people grateful.”</p>
