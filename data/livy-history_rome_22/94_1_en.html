In fact it was not so much the path to glory Sempronius was pointing out to you as the one to safety; he was bringing you home to your parents, your wives and your children. You lacked the courage to be saved! What would you have done if you had to die for your country?</p>
<p>“Fifty thousand of your fellow citizens and allies lay cut to pieces around you that very day. If all those examples of courage can make no impression on you, then nothing ever will. If a disaster of such magnitude did not make you hold life cheap, then nothing will.</p>
<p>“You must long for your country while you are free, with your rights intact, or rather long for it while it is still your country and you are still its citizens. Too late are you longing for it now, having lost your status, forfeited your rights as citizens, become slaves of the Carthaginians. Is payment to be made for you to return to the position you lost through your scandalous cowardice? When your countryman Publius Sempronius told you to take up arms and follow him, you did not listen; but you did listen to Hannibal shortly afterward when he gave the order for your camp to be abandoned and your weapons surrendered.</p>
