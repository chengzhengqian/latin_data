<p>Although he noted the fifty per cent increase in his enemy’s troops, Hannibal was nevertheless remarkably cheered by the arrival of the consuls. Not only was there nothing left of the supplies acquired by his daily pillaging but there was nowhere else left for him to plunder since the grain had everywhere been transported into fortified towns when the countryside became unsafe. Thus, it was later ascertained, he was left with barely enough grain for another ten days, and because of the shortage his Spaniards were ready to desert—and would have if the Romans had waited long enough.</p>

Some seventeen hundred were killed, while there were no more than one hundred Roman and allied casualties. The consul Paullus, however, fearing an ambush, halted a disorderly pursuit by the victors, that being his day of command (for the consuls were alternating on a daily basis) and Varro was furious, screaming that the enemy had been allowed to slip through their fingers and the war could have been finished off if they had not halted.</p>
