<p>Having convinced the man, who was not very sharp-witted compared with other Carthaginians,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL233_265_93" id="target_note_LCL233_265_93"><sup>93</sup></a> Abelux set off furtively at night to the enemy outposts, where he was met by a number of Spanish auxiliaries and conducted to Scipio. He explained his project, assurances were exchanged and a time and location fixed for the transfer of the hostages, and he then returned to Saguntum.</p>
<p>He spent the next day with Bostar receiving his instructions on how the business was to be conducted. Then, having agreed with Bostar that he should make the journey at night so as not be spotted by enemy sentinels, he left, wakened those in charge of the boys at the hour he had agreed on with them, and led them all into the trap that he had treacherously prepared and of which he was supposedly unaware. They were brought into the Roman camp; and then every step relating to the return of the hostages was taken in line with the agreement made with Bostar and in the same sequence as if the affair were under the authority of the Carthaginians.</p>
<p>The Romans earned considerably more gratitude than the Carthaginians would have done for the very same service. For the Spaniards had found the Carthaginians hard to bear and domineering when things were going well, and their milder disposition now could have resulted from their changing fortunes and their fear; but the Romans had on their first arrival (they were strangers before) begun with an act of kindness and generosity; and Abelux, aprudent man, appeared to have had good reason for changing allies. And so they were all, with great unanimity, contemplating defection; and fighting would have broken out immediately but for the intervention of winter, which obliged Romans and Carthaginians alike to retire to their billets.</p>
