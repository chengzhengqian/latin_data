Swiftly dismounting, and throwing down their shields and spears at their enemies’ feet, they were welcomed into the center of the Roman ranks, taken to the rear of the lines and told to wait there at the back. While the engagement was under way at all points they quietly remained there; but when the battle had everyone’s attention and eyes preoccupied, they seized shields that lay scattered here and there among the piles of corpses and attacked the Roman line from behind. Hacking at soldiers’ backs and severing their hamstrings, they caused enormous loss of life and a lot more panic and confusion.
