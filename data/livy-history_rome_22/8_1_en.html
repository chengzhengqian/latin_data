Trasimene†.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL233_207_26" id="target_note_LCL233_207_26"><sup>26</sup></a> Between the two is only a very narrow pathway, as if just enough space had been deliberately left for this very purpose; the terrain then widens a little to form a plain, and beyond it rise some hills. There, in the open, he established camp, where he himself would take up position with only his African and Spanish troops. The Balearic troops and the other light infantry he led around behind the hills; and the cavalry he stationed right at the entry to the defile, where some hillocks conveniently provided cover so that after the Romans entered they would, with the cavalry blocking them, be entirely shut in between the lake and the mountains.</p>

The following description of the battle, which differs in significant respects from that of Polybius (3.81–89) is not altogether clear and has been the subject of much scholarly dispute. While I hope not to have strayed far from the Latin in making it readable in English, I admit to some uncertainty about it.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL233_207_26').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
