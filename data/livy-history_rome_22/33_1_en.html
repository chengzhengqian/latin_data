From there, well laden with plunder, the fleet came to Longuntica,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL233_257_84" id="target_note_LCL233_257_84"><sup>84</sup></a> where large quantities of esparto grass<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL233_257_85" id="target_note_LCL233_257_85"><sup>85</sup></a> had been laid up by Hasdrubal for the use of his fleet.
