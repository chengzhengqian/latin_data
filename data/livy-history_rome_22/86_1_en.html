annual festival of Ceres<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL233_363_173" id="target_note_LCL233_363_173"><sup>173</sup></a> was suspended, because religion forbade people in mourning to participate and at that time no married woman was untouched by grief. And so, to prevent any other public or private rites being abandoned for the same reason, a thirty-day limit was imposed on the period of mourning by senatorial decree.</p>
<p>When the unrest in the city settled down and the senators were recalled to the house, another letter was delivered, this time from the propraetor Titus Otacilius in Sicily, reporting that the kingdom of Hiero was being ravaged by a Punic fleet. He †wished to respond to Hiero’s appeals for help, he said, but had received a report†<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL233_363_174" id="target_note_LCL233_363_174"><sup>174</sup></a> that a second fleet, equipped and ready for action, was anchored off the Aegates Islands in order to launch an immediate attack on Lilybaeum and the rest of the Roman province when they became aware that he had turned to the defense of the Syracusan coastline. A fleet was therefore necessary if the senators wished to protect an allied king and Sicily.</p>
<p>57. When the letters from the consul and the praetor were read out, the senators decided<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL233_363_175" id="target_note_LCL233_363_175"><sup>175</sup></a> that Marcus Claudius, who commanded the fleet lying off Ostia, should be sent to the army at Canusium. The consul was then to be given written orders to turn his army over to the praetor and come to Rome at the earliest possible opportunity that was in accord with the interests of the state.</p>
