You well understand the happiness of poets: their spirits are immeshed by sorrows as fish by nets; if anything harsh or distressing occurs, the poetic sensibility does not readily free itself from the agonising entanglement. I have not yet obtained any part of my mother-in-law’s estate—not even as much as the usufruct of a third<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL420_443_1" id="target_note_LCL420_443_1"><sup>1</sup></a> of it at the price of a half. 3. By this time you will have seen how far the theme of the little poem<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL420_443_2" id="target_note_LCL420_443_2"><sup>2</sup></a> you demand is likely to please you. As for me, my anxiety absolutely forbids me to make the content of my poetry different from the content of the life I lead. You will certainly act unjustly if you match on equal terms, so to speak, our respective writings composed on the present occasion. The parts we play are different; I am afflicted, you fortunate, I still an exile,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL420_443_3a" id="target_note_LCL420_443_3a"><sup>3</sup></a> you are now a citizen;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL420_443_4" id="target_note_LCL420_443_4"><sup>4</sup></a> and the reason why my verses are not on an equality with yours is just this—that I claim similar privileges but do not get the same treatment.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL420_443_5" id="target_note_LCL420_443_5"><sup>5</sup></a> 4. But if by chance you do accept with a measure of indulgent approval these silly trifles of mine, written amid mental tortures, then you will convince me that they were like the songs of swans, whose cry is more tuneful in moments of agony, and like a lyre-string strung more forcibly than is wont, which is the more musical the more it is tensed.

Dalton
takes <span class="italic">medietas</span> as vaguely a portion instead of one half, and translates: “I am still unsuccessful in obtaining a decision about my mother-in-law’s estate, even provisionally, though I have offered a third part as ransom.” Mommsen believes that Sidonius has the usufruct of one-third provided that he buys one-half of the estate from the heirs, among whom he is not included.
