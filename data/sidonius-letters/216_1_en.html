</section>
<p>1. The bearer of this letter holds the honourable office of deacon. He with his family, seeking an escape from the whirlwind of Gothic depredation,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL420_275_1" id="target_note_LCL420_275_1"><sup>1</sup></a> was carried into your territory by the very impetus of his flight, so to speak. There on some farm land, belonging to a church over which your Holiness is set, this starving newcomer made a small sowing of seed on some half-tilled soil; and he earnestly pleads to be allowed to garner the whole crop. 2. If you cherish him with the kindness due to “them who are of the household of the faith,” I mean by waiving the rent due from the glebe, then he, a stranger whose outlook is as limited as his means, will consider that little acquisition as good as the profits of farming his native soil. Should you, as is your custom, let him off the statutory payment due for his exceedingly small bit of land, he will regard himself as liberally equipped with travelling expenses and will return with words of gratitude on his lips. If by his hand you make me the happy recipient of a characteristically gracious message your letter will be regarded here by the brethren one and all as a blessing dropped straight from heaven. Deign to hold me in remembrance, my Lord Bishop.</p>
