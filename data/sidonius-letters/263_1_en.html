Gracious heaven! What judgment and also what charm he shows at any time in deliberating and advising. When he is consulted he is full of piquant mother-wit, when he consults he is full of honeyed sweetness. He cares much for literature, but chiefly for religious literature, in which he is more concerned with the pith of the sense than with the froth of the words. The incentive, quickener, and
