How often he used to boast of himself as one who had often endured ill fortune, whilst we from a deeper feeling for him lamented that his recklessness must some day end in disaster, holding that a man is not fortunate if he is judged to be so only frequently, not always! 3.

He mocked every one of them when they conversed with him, professed astonishment at their suggestions, and ignored their services; if only few sought to accost him he nursed suspicion, if many, contempt; till in the end he was encircled by a wall of general antipathy, and was burdened by guards before he was disburdened of his office. He was arrested and brought in bonds to Rome, priding himself then and there on having sailed safely past the stormy coast of Tuscany, as though the elements were in some way submissive to him, recognising the clearness of his conscience. 4.
