But because for the moment we have, not indeed the reality of a treaty, but at least the ghost of a truce, admitting a glimpse of freedom to brighten our hopes, I earnestly beseech you, now that the opportunity exists, to favour us with many a missive sheet; for be assured<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL420_211_2" id="target_note_LCL420_211_2"><sup>2</sup></a> that in the hearts of the besieged citizens there is reserved for you such an affection as will obliterate any odium you incur as a besieger.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL420_211_3a" id="target_note_LCL420_211_3a"><sup>3</sup></a> Farewell.</p>
