Therefore (under Christ’s guidance) we are taking ourselves and our whole household away from the heat and the oppressiveness of the city, and at the same time escaping from the counsels of the physicians, who attend and contend at the bedside; for with their scanty knowledge and immense zeal they most dutifully kill many sick folks. Justus indeed will be admitted to our household by his claim as a personal friend, though if one had been inclined to jest in sad circumstances, I should easily have proved to you that he is better trained in the art of Chiron<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL296_473_1" id="target_note_LCL296_473_1"><sup>1</sup></a> than in that of Machaon. So we must the more earnestly make our appeal to Christ and beseech Him that, as our diligence has procured no cure for the patient’s malady, the power that is from above may cure it. Farewell.</p>
