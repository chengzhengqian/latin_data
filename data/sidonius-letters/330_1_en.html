Hence it behoves you, like a sentinel, to keep a kind of watch-tower guard over my reputation,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL420_503_1" id="target_note_LCL420_503_1"><sup>1</sup></a> explaining to the curious the reason for my action and communicating to me in letters as frequent as possible the opinion of all the best people in respect of it. 4. If, however, after compelling me to chatter on, you yourself persist in silence, it is surely not very unfair to pay you back by retaliatory silence. So you, before all others and above all others, must be indulgent to a task and service undertaken at your behest. For my part, I will promptly append to the margins of the eighth book any fresh copy that comes to hand. 5. It is true that your friend Apollinaris,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL420_503_2" id="target_note_LCL420_503_2"><sup>2</sup></a> who shows plenty of interest in other fields, is utterly listless in this one, being very little attracted by reading, either compulsory or voluntary: at least<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL420_503_3a" id="target_note_LCL420_503_3a"><sup>3</sup></a>
