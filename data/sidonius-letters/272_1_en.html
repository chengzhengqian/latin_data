<p>1. It is just like your loving heart and custom, my matchless patron in Christ,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL420_387_1" id="target_note_LCL420_387_1"><sup>1</sup></a> to assuage the worries of your friend in another land by a letter of consolation. I only wish that you might always so remember me as to sever by your intercession, as you alleviate by your exhortation, even this chain of anxieties which is one continuous torture to me. 2. For the rest, I believe that your freedmen are on their way back, having despatched the business you had charged them with. It is clear that they transacted their business with such diligence that they did not even require a helping hand. I have sent you by them a cowl for night wear in the hope that you will use it between your prayers and your lying-down, to cover your limbs, wasted as they are by fastings—although woollen material<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL420_387_2" id="target_note_LCL420_387_2"><sup>2</sup></a> is not a very suitable present now that winter is over and summertime approaches. Farewell.</p>
