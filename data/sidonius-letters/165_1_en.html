plight of the aforesaid bearer, who has been brought to your neighbourhood by a piece of business which has cropped up, presenting a double possibility; for he has proceeded on his way with the express intention either to enter suit or to enter upon his inheritance. He had a cousin on his father’s side who died unmarried and intestate, and he is taking steps to succeed him by right of agnate kinship, at least unless some crafty influence should thwart his purpose.

Farewell.</p>
