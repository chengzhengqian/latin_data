in this duty of mine, in which, as a novice, I am diffident and embarrassed. 3. And although you are the ruler of Senonia, do not in this unquiet situation refrain from setting right the purposes of the Aquitanians, for it matters little that our province is geographically separated from yours, since in the sphere of religion our cause is united. Moreover, of all the cities of Aquitanica Prima<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL420_311_1" id="target_note_LCL420_311_1"><sup>1</sup></a> the wars have left only the capital<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL420_311_2a" id="target_note_LCL420_311_2a"><sup>2</sup></a> of the Arverni on the side of the Romans; hence in appointing a prelate for the aforementioned country, we are weak in the number of provincial colleagues unless we are confirmed by the consent of the metropolitans. 4. It only remains to say, in respect of the precedence belonging to your rank, that so far no one has been nominated, summoned, or elected by me; everything is being reserved—untouched, unimpaired, and entire—for your judgment. The only part I claim for myself is to invite your personal attendance, to await your will, to applaud your decision, and, when anyone<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL420_311_3" id="target_note_LCL420_311_3"><sup>3</sup></a>

One gathers from this passage that Clermont was the only town in Aquitanica Prima not occupied by the Goths. If so, then Bourges was so occupied. [The other sees were those at Albigenses (Albi), Cadurci (Cahors), Gabali (Javols), Lemovices (Limoges), Ruteni (Rouergue), Vellavi (St. Paulien).—<span class="italic">E.H.W.</span>] Why were not the other Bishops of Aquitaine free to come to the election if Bourges was allowed to proceed with its election? Doubtless this was owing to the policy of Euric, the Gothic king. As for the last words of § 4, it is obvious that, if a sufficient number of other bishops of the same province was not available for the purposes of an election, others might be invited from neighbouring provinces. Agroecius, to whom this letter is addressed, was actually metropolitan of Senonia (Lugdunensis IV), but we must not infer from Sidonius that the deficiency in local bishops had to be made up by metropolitans from outside. I scarcely think that <span class="italic">vestras personas</span> of § 4 is a real plural: it is rather a grandiose reference to Agroecius alone. Or does <span class="italic">metropolitanorum assensu</span> at the end of § 3 imply that provincial bishops must get the permission of their metropolitan to visit another province or take part in an election there? It goes without saying that the repressive measures taken by Euric in the case of some dioceses were not taken in Bourges.—<span class="italic">A.</span> See note on § 6 of the next letter.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL420_311_2a').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL420_311_3"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL420_311_3" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">3</sup><span class="italic">quisque = quisquis = quicumque = quilibet?—A,</span> Yes.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL420_311_3').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
