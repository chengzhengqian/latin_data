The earth has grown hot; the ice of the Alps is disappearing; the land is being scored with irregular curved cracks gaping in the heat; gravel lies untidily in the fords, mud on the banks, dust in the fields; even streams that flow all the year round have languidly slowed down; the water is not merely hot, it boils. 2.

On the western side is a mountain, earthy in substance<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL296_419_4" id="target_note_LCL296_419_4"><sup>4</sup></a> but stiff to climb, which pushes out lower hills from itself like offshoots from a double stem; and these hills diverge so as to leave a breadth of about four <span class="italic">iugera</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL296_419_5" id="target_note_LCL296_419_5"><sup>5</sup></a> between
