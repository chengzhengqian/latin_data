only in Sidonius (cf. I. 11. 17, II. 3. 1, III. 6. 3, IV. 3. 1,
IV. 17. 1, VIII. 4. 1). M. B. O’Brien (<span class="italic">Titles of address in

wrongly attributes the use also to Claudianus Mamertus, misled by the fact that Sidonius <span class="italic">Epist.</span> IV. 3 is reproduced in editions of Claudianus, to whom the letter was addressed. The use of comparative adjectives (especially <span class="italic">maior, prior, senior</span>) in titles is derived from the use of the comparative for the superlative, which arose early in colloquial Latin and ultimately became fairly common in the literature. For the use of <span class="italic">dominus</span> as an honorary title in letters see the article in <span class="italic">Thesaurus linguae Latinae,</span> especially 1925 f., 1929. 30-1930. 66; also O’Brien, <span class="italic">op. cit.</span>, p. 83.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL296_331_1a').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
