I found the ascent quick and easy; between walls of terrifying precipice on either side, travelling had been simplified by cutting a pathway through the snow. 3. As to the rivers, I found that such of them as were not navigable had convenient fords or at any rate bridges fit for traffic: these our forefathers have constructed on a series of vaulted arches reaching from the foundations up to the roadway with its cobbled surface. At Ticinum<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL296_355_1" id="target_note_LCL296_355_1"><sup>1</sup></a> I went on board a packet-boat<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL296_355_2" id="target_note_LCL296_355_2"><sup>2</sup></a> (so they call the vessel) and travelled quickly down-stream to the Eridanus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL296_355_3" id="target_note_LCL296_355_3"><sup>3</sup></a> where I had my laugh over Phaethon’s sisters, of whom we have often sung amidst our revels, and over those mythical tears of arboreal ore. 4.

In each case I cruised a little way upstream from the point of confluence so as to view each actually in the midst of its own waters. Their banks and knolls were everywhere clad with groves of oak and maple. A concert of birds filled the air with sweet sounds; their nest-structures quivered, balanced sometimes on hollow reeds, sometimes on prickly rushes, sometimes too on smooth bulrushes: for all this undergrowth, nourished on the moisture of the spongy soil, had sprouted confusedly along the river banks. 5. Proceeding on my way I came to Cremona, whose nearness caused Mantua’s Tityrus to sigh profoundly in days of old.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL296_355_5" id="target_note_LCL296_355_5"><sup>5</sup></a> Next we entered the town of Brixillum<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL296_355_6" id="target_note_LCL296_355_6"><sup>6</sup></a> only to quit it, just allowing time
