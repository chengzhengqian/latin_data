suspension of my trochaic garrulity in favour of some trifle in six-footed lines. I bow to your command—only you must give an indulgent reception to my piece, whether you choose to call it an ode or an eclogue; for composition in a metre long disused is harder work.</p>
<p>It is your will, my friend, that the spirited iambus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL420_591_1" id="target_note_LCL420_591_1"><sup>1</sup></a> with its more vigorous strains should echo through my works as did the trochee heretofore; that the spondee should add its slow-moving pair of feet with its four time-units, thus for a moment inserting a check in the swift-footed trimeter; that, mingled with the rest, should resound that swiftest of feet well named of old from the art of pyrrhic dancing—a foot which must in every case be put in the final place; and the anapaest also, to give from time to time a frame to the iambic verse,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL420_591_2a" id="target_note_LCL420_591_2a"><sup>2</sup></a> now in the first half, now in the last, though the anapaest is more readily pronounceable when the third syllable in the sequence (that is, the long syllable) clings closely to the syllable which has a twin and is short.</p>
