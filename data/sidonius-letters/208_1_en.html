excuse my talkativeness when I commend to you the bearer of this letter. Should you support with ready favour his visit to a far country, a great haven of security will be opened to his pleas. His case concerns a will. He is not clear about the merits of his own documents and he has gone to seek skilled advice from the advocates who practise there. He will count it as good as winning the case if he finds that he is lawfully the loser; only, he does not want to be accused of having failed through indolence to guard the interests of himself and his family.

Deign to hold me in remembrance, my Lord Bishop.</p>
