amid the lamentable gulfs and sloughs of iniquity; and before rendering to any righteous man the allegiance of a learner, I am perforce called upon to discharge for others the duty of an instructor. Besides the impossibility of such a task, a feeling of shame oppresses me, because to me, to me of all men, you have entrusted, by the presentation of your official mandate,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL420_341_1" id="target_note_LCL420_341_1"><sup>1</sup></a> the right of choosing your bishop, and that, too, in the presence of a hallowed prelate<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL420_341_2" id="target_note_LCL420_341_2"><sup>2</sup></a> who is well worthy of the chief pontificate.
