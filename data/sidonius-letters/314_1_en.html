has happened an occurrence which has nothing conjectural or ambiguous about it, for our friend, this rash enquirer into the future, who for so long had been vainly dodging<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL420_471_1" id="target_note_LCL420_471_1"><sup>1</sup></a> his doom, has been caught by the time and manner of the death foretold. 11.

Where was he (Lampridius) murdered? Was the body carried from the scene of the murder? It seems that the reference at the beginning (<span class="italic">terra tabo madefacta deciduo</span>) is still to the face (the <span class="italic">obrutus vultus</span> of the previous sentence). And therefore I think the full stop after <span class="italic">doloris</span> should be a semicolon. Near the face the ground was wet with blood that had dripped down from it (from the mouth?). The raised pavement will account for the direction of the dripping. The murderers thought the body was already drained of blood. It seems odd that, after what had happened, they should have such a finicky regard for cleanliness! I wish I knew what and where the <span class="italic">pavimentum</span> was. This is by no means the only place where Sidonius leaves us guessing. If he would use fewer words and tell us more, it would be a great improvement.—<span class="italic">A.</span> I incline to the view taken by Dalton in his translation that the intention of the murderers was to lay the body on its face as if to suggest that it had fallen prone because of a seizure and violent haemorrhage—so that the pool of blood on the pavement of the room would look like the whole blood-content of the body. This seems to fit in with “<span class="italic">tamquam . . . exinanisset</span>”—they wish to make it appear that a terribly violent flux from the mouth had drained the body of all its blood. But the sense would be greatly improved, I think, if we could read <span class="italic">exanimasset</span> for <span class="italic">exinanisset.</span> Is this a possibility?—<span class="italic">W.H.S.</span></a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL420_471_4a').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
