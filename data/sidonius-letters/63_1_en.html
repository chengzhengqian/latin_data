frequent practice to read writers whose artistry was of a similar kind<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL296_455_1a" id="target_note_LCL296_455_1a"><sup>1</sup></a>—here Augustine, there Varro, here Horace, there Prudentius. 5. Amongst these books, the translation of the <span class="italic">Adamantius</span> of Origen by Turranius Rufinus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL296_455_2" id="target_note_LCL296_455_2"><sup>2</sup></a> was diligently studied by readers of our faith. We would all join in a discussion, expressing our various views just as we felt inclined. We debated why Origen was condemned by some of our chief hierophants as an inept and dangerous expositor, and yet his works had been translated into Latin with such faithfulness to the letter and the spirit that Apuleius could not be said to have turned Plato’s <span class="italic">Phaedo</span> or Tully Demosthenes’ <span class="italic">Ctesiphon</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL296_455_3" id="target_note_LCL296_455_3"><sup>3</sup></a> into such a perfect expression of the theory and the usage of Latin speech. 6. While all and sundry occupied themselves in these pursuits according to their individual tastes, a messenger would approach from the head cook to tell us that the time for refreshment was at hand. He had his eye on the passage of the hours as marked by the water-clock, and as the fifth hour was just departing he was proved to have arrived just at the right moment.

It is strange to find Varro ranked as an artist in prose with Augustine, and almost as strange to find him classed among those “distinguished by the grandeur of Latin eloquence.” Sidonius expresses admiration for Varros style also in <span class="italic">Epist.</span> VIII. 6. 18. As a matter of fact, <span class="italic">scientia</span> in the sense of erudition was the leading characteristic of Varro, as Quintilian says in a passage which gives the lie direct to these two sentences of Sidonius (Varro “is more likely to enhance one’s knowledge than one’s style,” <span class="italic">plus scientiae conlaturus quam eloquentiae, Inst. Or.</span> X. 1. 95); and Augustine himself says very much the same thing (<span class="italic">Civ. Dei</span> VI. 2).
