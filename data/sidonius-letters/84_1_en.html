return of their people, to you the returned people their harmony. And so one and all feel that you are theirs, and they are yours: and it is your crowning glory that they are not mistaken. 3. For day after day there is a picture before the mind of each, how you, a personage weighed down by years and frail through ill-health but exhalted in birth and venerable for your piety, with no pretext but that of affection broke through all the obstacles and all the hindrances in the way of your coming, I mean the length of the stages and the shortness of the days, the superabundance of snow and the scarcity of provisions, the wide expanse of the solitudes and the cramped space of the rest-houses; sloughs in the road, here rotten with soaking rain, there made jagged by dry frost; besides these, the rough stones of the causeways and the slippery ice of the streams, rugged hills to climb and valleys scoured by continual landslides; through all which discomforts, as you sought no private advantage, you won the love of a people. 4. To conclude, we pray God that the limits of your life may be advanced in accordance with your hopes, and that you may without interruption seek, win, and carry away with you the friendly feelings of good men, and that the affection which you are leaving behind you may attend you hereafter, and that not only the foundations but the completed edifice of that harmony which you have instituted in this or that part of the land may for many years bring you a due recompense. Farewell.</p>
