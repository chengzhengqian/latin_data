certain copies; only a small number came to hand, because I had no thought of compiling a little volume of this sort and so a number of pieces which so far had not been carefully kept<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL420_397_1" id="target_note_LCL420_397_1"><sup>1</sup></a> cannot now be discovered. As a matter of fact, the present specimens, being few in number and indeed of little importance, have been quickly finished off—although, when once my mind had been set to work I found the urge to write as strong as ever; and I studiously kept to this compromise<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL420_397_2" id="target_note_LCL420_397_2"><sup>2</sup></a> that the text of my letters should be extended if their number was reduced. 2. At the same time I thought that the book which you, most fastidious of readers, desired, would be reasonably convenient to handle and not quite inexcusable if (in view of the fact that you might well be offended by its flimsiness of sense and structure), you were at least not burdened with great sheaves of paper. So I commend to your judgment the varied feelings of my heart, being well aware that the mind is as fully exposed in a book as the face in a mirror. I have written some exhortations, a great deal of praise, a certain amount of advice, a few laments, and a good number of jests. 3. And if in your reading you have anywhere<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL420_397_3a" id="target_note_LCL420_397_3a"><sup>3</sup></a> found me rather vehemently roused against some persons, I would have you know that with the help of Christ’s right hand I will never

I always take temperamentum as indicating
a certain compensating balance; and here Sidonius, in apologising for the relative fewness of the published letters, says that he tries to balance the small total number of the collection by adding to the length of individual letters—the more so as he finds his old zest for composition revives as soon as his mind gets working on the material.
