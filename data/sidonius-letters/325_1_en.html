character, merits, and virtues of that great and good man (a man to whom is most rightly given the crowning glory of having handed on<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL420_493_1" id="target_note_LCL420_493_1"><sup>1</sup></a> his office to such a successor as you). Accordingly, you have urged me to promise to ply my pen in narrating for posterity the story of the war with Attila,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL420_493_2" id="target_note_LCL420_493_2"><sup>2</sup></a> which included,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL420_493_3" id="target_note_LCL420_493_3"><sup>3</sup></a> of course, the investment and the attack on Orleans, when the city was invaded but never plundered, and the far-famed prophesy of the priest who won the ear of heaven.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL420_493_4" id="target_note_LCL420_493_4"><sup>4</sup></a> 2. I began the story; but when I realised the immensity of the work I had undertaken I regretted having ever started it. Hence I have never submitted to the ears of any critic a work which I had myself already judged and condemned. But I hope to satisfy both your request and the merits of the great bishop by devoting myself to a panegyric on him at the first, and indeed a very early, opportunity. For your part, like a fair-minded creditor, you will win praise if you make allowance for your rash debtor’s improvidence by writing off the debt which he knows he cannot pay. Deign to hold me in remembrance, my Lord Bishop.</p>
