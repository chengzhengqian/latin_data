In the imperial times of Rome the word tetrarch meant a dependent prince; or a ruler of part only of a kingdom; or ruler of a very small territory. The tetrarch in this letter may be the Burgundian King Chilperic of the preceding letter; but tetrarch would apply better after his death to his nephew Chilperic II, who shared the kingship with his three brothers, Gundobad, Gundomar, and Godegesil, and himself ruled at Vienne. If, however, Sidonius does indeed allude to the first Chilperic, the title
“tetrarch” is hardly meant seriously. L.
