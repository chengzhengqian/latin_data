Besides this, thousands of legal precedents sanctioning the extreme penalty were aimed at his throat. 11. Then, and not till then, it is reported, did he show distress. His face grew pale as he tardily regretted his talkativeness, realising all too late that a man could be declared guilty of high treason even although he had not aspired to the purple.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL296_377_1" id="target_note_LCL296_377_1"><sup>1</sup></a> He was instantly deprived by solemn procedure of the privileges appertaining to the double prefectship, which he had held by reappointment for five years, and he was consigned to the state prison as one not degraded but rather restored to a plebeian family.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL296_377_2" id="target_note_LCL296_377_2"><sup>2</sup></a> The bitterest affliction of all (as those who watched the scene have related) was that, because he had marched into the presence of his judges elegantly dressed and groomed whilst his accusers were in dark clothing, the pitiable plight in which he appeared only a little later evoked no pity, as he was dragged off to prison after his commitment.
