remorse that men, in whose case it would have been a scandal if they had even followed in our steps, have passed you in the race? 5. Well, what need to say more? If you submit to these exhortations I am ready to be your comrade and helper, the guide and the partner of your efforts. If, however, you let yourself be entangled in the tempting snares of luxury and prefer (as people say) to be tied up with the dogmas of Epicurus, who makes jettison of virtue and defines the supreme good in terms of bodily pleasure alone, then here and now I call our ancestors and our posterity to witness that I have nothing to do with such wickedness. Farewell.</p>

I am distressed by the fall of Arvandus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL296_367_1" id="target_note_LCL296_367_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and do not conceal my distress; for it is the crowning glory of our Emperor that affection may be openly shown even for men condemned to death. I have shown myself this manâ€™s friend even more than his easy-going and unstable character justified, as is proved by the disfavour which has lately flared up against me on his account; for I have been rather too heedless and have scorched myself in its flame. 2. But such steadfastness in friendship was a duty which I owed to myself. On the other hand, he never had in his disposition any firmness of principle; and I complain of him frankly (but not spitefully) for scorning the advice of his loyal friends and so becoming the sport of fortune all through.
