roughly broken by rocky barriers and so whitens with splashes of foam, and presently frees itself from the steep rocks and buries itself in the lake. Whether it so happens that this river creates the lake or merely that it runs into it, it certainly passes beyond it, being strained through subterranean sieves,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL296_433_1a" id="target_note_LCL296_433_1a"><sup>1</sup></a> with the result that it undergoes a deprivation, not of its waters but of its fish. These are thrown back into the more sluggish water, where they increase the bulk of red flesh in their white bellies;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL296_433_2" id="target_note_LCL296_433_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and so it goes on: they are not able to make their way back or to find a way out, and their obesity creates for them what one may call a living circulatory prison. 18. As for the lake itself, on its right bank it is indented, winding and wooded; on the left, open, grassy and even. On the south-west the water is green along the shore, because the foliage stretches over the water, and just as the water floods the gravel, so the shade floods the water. On the east a like fringe of trees spreads a tint of the same kind. On the northern side the water presents its natural appearance. On the west is a vulgar and disorderly growth of weeds, which is often bent under the weight of the yachts that speed over it; round this growth slippery tufts of bulrushes wrap themselves; thick slabs of sedge also float there, and the bitter sap of grey willows is ever nurtured

The drains are likened to sieves or strainers because the apertures are covered by some kind of fine network or grating through which the water can filter but the fishes cannot pass. Apparently there was at this end of the lake a creek or inlet, which, since the current flowed in that direction, Sidonius regards as a continuation of the stream which flows into the lake at the other end. At the far end of this inlet there are drains to carry off the surplus water. The fishes are carried by the current into the inlet; they cannot get into the drains, and, of course, there is a bank or dam to stop further progress. Here the water which does not vanish through the drains is in constant commotion, hurled back and whirling round, and the fishes are carried round with it till they get back to the less agitated water, where they congregate like salmon at the bottom of a salmon-leap and grow fat and sluggish. They have not the strength or energy to struggle back to the lake against the current; their only motion is a repetition of the same old gyrationâ€”up to the drains, round, and back again. At any rate, this is the best I can make of a very obscure passage.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL296_433_1a').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL296_433_2"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL296_433_2" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">2</sup>This reference to their corpulence may contain also a side-reference to the appearance of the bellies, white or silvery flecked with red.
