content with what I had brought to light in my earlier publication. So I shall comply with your command, but I mean to continue the activity of my pen only so far as to extend my series of letters (imperfect<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL420_401_1" id="target_note_LCL420_401_1"><sup>1</sup></a> as they are, no doubt, from the first page<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL420_401_2" id="target_note_LCL420_401_2"><sup>2</sup></a> onwards) by the addition of a quite small number at the extreme end—just enough, I mean, to embellish the already completed work with a sort of marginal fringe. 2. But a danger to be particularly heeded is that these supplements to an already published collection may perhaps cause us to fall foul of some fault-finders. Even the masterly thoughts and finished eloquence of Demosthenes<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL420_401_3" id="target_note_LCL420_401_3"><sup>3</sup></a> and Cicero<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL420_401_4" id="target_note_LCL420_401_4"><sup>4</sup></a> could not escape the tongues of such people, tongues sharpened by nature on the whetstone of jealousy; the first had to suffer the detractions of Demades,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL420_401_5a" id="target_note_LCL420_401_5a"><sup>5</sup></a> the latter of Antonius,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL420_401_6" id="target_note_LCL420_401_6"><sup>6</sup></a> and these spiteful persons, though their ill-nature was as clear as their diction was obscure, have nevertheless passed into the cognisance of posterity simply through their hatred of merit. 3. But since you urge it, let me loosen my sails once more to the stormy winds, and after traversing oceans, as it were, let me cross this mere pond: for I am firmly convinced that it is as necessary
