have many pages to excite his disgust, especially in a style<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL420_499_1" id="target_note_LCL420_499_1"><sup>1</sup></a> which shows not polite elegance but rustic bluntness. 4. For where could I ever acquire the severe, archaic mode of expression? Where could I ever acquire those words employed by the Salii and the Sibylline oracles, or those brought all the way from Sabine Cures,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL420_499_2" id="target_note_LCL420_499_2"><sup>2</sup></a> words which our school-teachers generally pass over in silence and which some member of the College of Heralds<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL420_499_3a" id="target_note_LCL420_499_3a"><sup>3</sup></a> would more readily expound, or some flamen, or some antiquated riddler of legal quiddities? For my part, I have composed my little works in arid bald language,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL420_499_4" id="target_note_LCL420_499_4"><sup>4</sup></a> which for the most part is quite ordinary speech such as is rarely esteemed because in common use, and such as wins favour with difficulty because too easily come by. 5. I do indeed make bold to claim that this book, though presenting nothing spirited nor eloquent, has had nothing inserted that is not clear or that departs from precedent. But I need not say more about this: it is enough for me that my diction pleases my friends—though I include in the category of friends both those who refuse to deceive me in their criticisms and those who deceive themselves through their affection for me. It remains for me in the future only to pray God that those who come after may either criticize or be deceived in the same way. Farewell.</p>
