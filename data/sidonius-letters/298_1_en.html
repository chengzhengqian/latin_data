stock? How long, acting like a ploughman and not as a cavalier, will you continue burying in the winter tillage the spoils of the waving corn-land?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL420_439_1" id="target_note_LCL420_439_1"><sup>1</sup></a> How long will you bring the weight of the blunt mattock to bear on vine-rows in a never-ending effort to dig them through? 2. Why guide the plough-handle in competition with Serranus and Camillus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL420_439_2" id="target_note_LCL420_439_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and yet forgo all ambition for the consul’s robe? Do not bring a slur on the nobility by staying so constantly in the country. Whoso cultivates a farm in moderation, owns it: whoso cultivates it to excess, is owned by it.

I would not indeed say that a wise man should fail to concern himself with his private affairs, but he should act on the even principle of considering not only what he should <span class="italic">have</span> but what he should <span class="italic">be.</span> If you reject all other forms of accomplishments that noblemen should cultivate, and if the sting to extend your property is the only emotion that stirs you, then you may look back on a name derived from consular robes, you may recall a series of curule seats and gilded travelling-chairs and purple
