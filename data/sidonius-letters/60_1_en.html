almost before the violence of my grief had abated, a funeral dirge, not in elegiacs but in hendecasyllables, and this has been engraved on marble. If you are not seriously displeased with it, the bookseller I employ will undertake to add it to the other sheets of my epigrams;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL296_449_1" id="target_note_LCL296_449_1"><sup>1</sup></a> but if you feel otherwise about it, it is enough that a poem which is heavy as stone should be preserved on stone. 3. This is the funeral inscription:</p>
<p>“Torn from her father, husband, and five children by a swift and merciless death, the Lady Philomathia has been laid in this tomb by the hands of her weeping fellow-citizens. Pride of your family, glory of your husband, wise, chaste, gracious, upright and kind, a model even to your elders, you have by your sweet reasonableness combined things that are wont to be counted opposed, for a serious frankness and a merry modesty were the constant attendants of your virtuous life. For this cause do we grieve that you have hardly fulfilled three decades of existence and that in the years of vigorous life the last dues have been paid to you unduly soon.”</p>
<p>Whether you like this poem or not, bestir yourself and make haste to visit our town; for you owe the duty of consolation to the afflicted families of two fellow-citizens. I pray God that you may discharge that duty without ever requiring a repayment of it for yourself. Farewell.</p>
