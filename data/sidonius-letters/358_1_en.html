Thus when you, my saintly friend, find any men of literary tastes inactive or shy or hidden in some obscure retreat where their fame languishes, your brilliant eloquence with its skilful admonition urges them on<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL420_559_2" id="target_note_LCL420_559_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and thereby brings them to public notice. 10.

Deign to hold me in remembrance, my Lord Bishop.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL420_559_3" id="target_note_LCL420_559_3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
