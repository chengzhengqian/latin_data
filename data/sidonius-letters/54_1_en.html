<p>1. I am delighted, my honoured lord, that you have gained the insignia of the most exalted dignity; and I am no less delighted that the news has been sent me by a special messenger; for though you are at present a magistrate of the highest rank and through your success alone the patrician honour has found its way back after so many generations to the house of the Philagrii,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL296_437_1" id="target_note_LCL296_437_1"><sup>1</sup></a> yet you, with your characteristic regard for the claims of friendship, find ways of enhancing the greatness of your lofty dignities by geniality, and in a fashion far from common you raise your elevation still higher by a lowly spirit. 2. So in old days the approval of the public raised Quintus Fabius, the Master of the Horse, above the stern dictator, above the haughty Papirius;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL296_437_2a" id="target_note_LCL296_437_2a"><sup>2</sup></a> so Pompey, who never disdained to be the people’s man, was exalted above his rivals; so Germanicus, through the affection of the whole world, rose superior to the jealousy of Tiberius. Therefore I don’t want the bounty of the Emperor to flatter itself by taking the chief credit for your success. The most it could have done for you would have been to make us reluctantly let you get ahead of us, supposing we had been unwilling; but the special feature of your case, a feature of peculiar charm, is that you never find people jealous of you any more than you find them rivalling you. Farewell.</p>
