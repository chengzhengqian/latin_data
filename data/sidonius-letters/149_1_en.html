owe a great deal to our mothers as well; for it is not right that some slighter honour should be given to the truth that we were our mothers’ burden than to the fact that we are our fathers’ seed. But let us leave to scientists the exact theoretic treatment of our origin; and let me go on to the theme which actually suggested this preamble. 2. Your father is an Aeduan,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL420_141_1" id="target_note_LCL420_141_1"><sup>1</sup></a> your mother an Arvernian.

You must imagine them saying openly to your face: “What great wrong have we done you, ungrateful man, that for so many years you should have shunned the land that once nurtured you, shunned it as if it were enemy territory?
