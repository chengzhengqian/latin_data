For this reason, as I reciprocate your greeting, I rejoice greatly that at any rate in your illustrious breast there have remained traces of our vanishing culture. If you extend these by constant reading you will discover for yourself as each day passes that the educated are no less superior to the unlettered than men are to beasts. 3. With regard to your wish that I (and a presumptuous babbler I would be!) should attempt an exegesis of Holy Writ, I assure you that such requests would more reasonably be addressed to priests who are not only near you in residence but old in years, renowned for their faith and famed for their works, ready in speech and tenacious in memory, in short, superior in all the graces of supreme worth. For to say nothing of your own peopleâ€™s bishop, a paragon of a man, blessed with a character that knows every virtue and with a reputation to correspond, it would be much more fitting for you to consult, on any problems whatsoever, those illustrious fathers and leading hierophants of Gaul, the not too distant Lupus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL420_129_2" id="target_note_LCL420_129_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and the not insufficiently near Auspicius,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL420_129_3" id="target_note_LCL420_129_3"><sup>3</sup></a> men whose learning is so abundant that not even your questioning could sift it to the bottom. So you must be kind and at the same time reasonable, and forgive my refusal to satisfy this part of your petition; for if it is right for you to flee from ignorance, it is also right for me to avoid pretentiousness. Farewell.</p>
