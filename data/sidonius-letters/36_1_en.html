conspiracy of Marcellinus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL296_401_1" id="target_note_LCL296_401_1"><sup>1</sup></a> to assume the diadem was being hatched, he presented himself to the young nobles as their ringleader, still a “new man” in his old age; till in the end, thanks to some strokes of lucky audacity on his part, the chink of a gaping interregnum let in a ray of glory upon the obscurity of his birth. For the throne being vacant and the administration in a turmoil, he alone of all men was found bold enough to assume the government of Gaul by taking up the fasces before receiving his patent of office, and to mount for several months the tribunal of “illustrious” dignitaries as an “eminent” prefect,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL296_401_2a" id="target_note_LCL296_401_2a"><sup>2</sup></a> so that he had barely gained his high dignity by the end of the year, toward the very close of his term of service, like the official cashiers, or rather the advocates, who receive their promotion just at the time when their activities are coming to an end.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL296_401_3" id="target_note_LCL296_401_3"><sup>3</sup></a> 7.

Sidonius seems to imply that Marcellinus was a party to the plot; if this is so, he must have speedily withdrawn without committing himself deeply. We know that he soon became an active supporter of Majorian. The “interregnum” occurred between the death of Avitus and the accession of Majorian. It was an interregnum in a double sense, as there was no western Emperor and no Praetorian Prefect of Gaul.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL296_401_1').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL296_401_2a"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL296_401_2a" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">2</sup>Praetorian Prefects received the rank of <span class="italic">inlustris</span> as a matter of course (n. on <span class="italic">Carm.</span> 7. 241), but Paeonius remained a <span class="italic">spectabilis</span> until his appointment was regularised.
