when suddenly a domestic stood before us with a wry face. “Why that look on your face?” we said. He answered “I have seen, at the door, the reader called Constans, who has come back from my Lords Simplicius and Apollinaris. He duly delivered to them the letters he had received from you but he has lost the one he received from them in reply.” 3. When I learned this, my sunny joy was instantly overcast by a dark cloud of grief, and the unconscionable conduct of this messenger kindled in me such a raging fury that for several days I inexorably forbade that senseless blockhead to present himself to my sight, for I should have been indignant if he had failed to deliver to me any letters from any persons whatsoever, to say nothing of yours, which, so long as I retain a sense of the fitness of things, will always seem to me as supremely desirable as they are lamentably infrequent. 4. But when my anger had gradually abated in course of time, I received him and asked if he had brought some verbal message in addition. Unnerved though he was, and, grovelling, with tongue stammering and vision blurred through the sense of his guilt, he answered, that the words from which I might have derived such instruction and delight had been wholly committed to the pages which had disappeared on the way. So please rush back to your tablets, fold the sheets, and rewrite what you wrote; for I can bear calmly the thwarting of my desire by this unlucky accident only until such time as it comes to your knowledge through my words that your words have not come to me. Farewell.</p>
