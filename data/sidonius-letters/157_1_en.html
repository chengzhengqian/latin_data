civil service, which were centred at Rome under the direct control of the emperor; and in which the service was sometimes called <span class="italic">militia palatina</span>, where <span class="italic">militia</span> had no necessary reference to military duties. Cf. <span class="italic">Ep.</span> I. 3. 1, where Palatine and really military “masterships” are contrasted. So in a civil sense the Palatini were officials of the <span class="italic">comitatus</span>, the central government. In <span class="italic">Carm.</span> V. 307, however, there is a reference to Palatini who were indeed military, being guards stationed in various parts of Italy under the command of the <span class="italic">magister utriusque militiae</span> “Master of both services” infantry and cavalry at the same time. The term Palatini could be applied to any members of the field army.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL420_157_3a').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
