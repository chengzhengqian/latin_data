<p>1. Here is Amantius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL420_325_1" id="target_note_LCL420_325_1"><sup>1</sup></a> again, the bearer of my trifles; he is returning again to his well-loved Massilia in order to carry home, as usual, his pickings from the city’s spoils—at least if the . . . or the incoming ships should favour him.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL420_325_2a" id="target_note_LCL420_325_2a"><sup>2</sup></a> I should be sending through him a further instalment of jocular chatter, if one and the same mind could simultaneously indulge in hilarity and endure sorrows. For such is now the condition of our unhappy corner that, as report declares, its plight was less miserable in war than it is now in peace. 2. Our freedom has been bartered for the security of others, the freedom of the Arvernians (O the pity of it!)

<blockquote><p>
<span class="line"><span class="italic">te maris Eoi merces ei Hiberica ditant</span></span><span class="linebreak"></span>

<span class="line"><span class="italic">advehitur, toto tibi navigat orbe cataplus;</span></span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
and from Martial XII. 74. 1, <span class="italic">dum tibi Niliacus portat crystalla cataplus,</span> it seems clear that <span class="italic">cataplus</span> means the arrival of merchant ships, by sea or by river, at a port; and so Amantius goes down from Auvergne on a business trip to Marseille, hoping again to have a profitable venture—“if,” says Sidonius, “the incoming merchant fleets happen to favour him.” He is a buyer at the port of Marseille, acting as agent for persons in Auvergne, as Sidonius says in VI. 8. 1, <span class="italic">cum pecuniis quorumpiam catapli recentis nundinas adit.</span> I am not sure what should fill the lacuna marked by Luetjohann; perhaps <span class="italic">sors</span> either in the sense of “luck” or of “capital money.”—<span class="italic">W.H.S.</span> See Additional Notes, p. 613.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL420_325_2a').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
