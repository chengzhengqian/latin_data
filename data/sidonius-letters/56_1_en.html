suppliant suitor by the kindness of your answer. Had you yourself been so approached you would have been right in approaching her mother in turn and pressing for her approval of the match; but as it is, I ask you to sanction without hesitation an approval already given. Your kindness to the family has conferred upon you such a position of authority in the matter of this betrothal that even had Optantius been living, he would have had no right to exercise a fuller control over his own children. Farewell.</p>

<p>1. My friend Iohannes is rushing into the hopeless labyrinth of a complicated litigation, and until the merits of his documents are examined by your learning or by some learning like yours (if there is any such), he does not know what to choose and what to reject. His suit is a sort of two-sided one, and its form is so perplexing that he does not know what line of procedure his pleading should be ready to advocate or to dispute. 2. On his behalf I pour forth an earnest petition that you will go through his papers and get ready any plea that is legally competent, instructing him what contentions to put forward and how, also what ones to refute. For if the current of his case starts from the head-waters of your advice, I have no fear of its being weakened through any diversion of the stream by his opponents. Farewell.</p>
