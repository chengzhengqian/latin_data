But your brother dodges my reproach by the pretext of being constantly on his suburban farm, which results in his being never at home for me and at the same time in his being exempt from blame; and you on your part have for the time being the excuse that a landed possession, which you have barely succeeded in recovering, has long possessed your attention. 2. However that may be, come at once, and you will then in due time receive permission to leave, on condition that you come back, either turn and turn about, or both together after a longer interval.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL420_385_2a" id="target_note_LCL420_385_2a"><sup>2</sup></a> For however much you station yourselves in the country and play the active farmer, you will not really be fructifying your own proper soil unless you cultivate<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL420_385_3" id="target_note_LCL420_385_3"><sup>3</sup></a> more the field which you adorn most, the church.

of a colony, and I suppose Vienne was a colony. On the other hand, <span class="italic">frater communis</span> has been used in a previous letter in the sense “yours and mine.” Cf. IV. 18. 2, <span class="italic">tuque fraterque communis Volusianus</span>; IV. 12, 1, <span class="italic">ego filiusque communis</span>;
IV. 23. 1, <span class="italic">filius tuus</span>, <span class="italic">immo communis.</span> Yet it is hard to see how we are to take <span class="italic">colonum</span> if we take <span class="italic">fratrem</span> and <span class="italic">communem</span> together. Lastly, <span class="italic">colonum</span> might just mean “farmer.”—<span class="italic">A.</span> I think this last suggestion is the correct one, “your brother who like you is a farmer.”—<span class="italic">W.H.S.</span></a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL420_385_1').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL420_385_2a"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL420_385_2a" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">2</sup>Anderson made several efforts to correct <span class="italic">serius.</span> I would myself suggest <span class="italic">rarius</span>—“please come to the city and visit me” says Sidonius to the two agricultural brothers: “when you do visit me, I won’t let you go back to the country except on one condition, that either you go back singly and by turns, or that you go back <span class="italic">rarius</span>, at less frequent intervals.”—<span class="italic">W.H.S.</span> I think this gets a right contrast—between <span class="italic">discessus</span> a departure from city to country, and <span class="italic">redire</span> as expressing return to the city; and thus Sidonius means that, once they have come to town, he will approve of their departure again only if they agree to come back to town yet again, either each in turn or both acting together. In any case, <span class="italic">serius</span> will hide a word meaning the opposite of <span class="italic">vicissim</span> “each in turn.” Sidonius may have written <span class="italic">simul</span>, but I had proposed a word which does not occur elsewhere—<span class="italic">sertius</span> (“more jointly,” “with more co-operation”), as if from <span class="italic">serte</span>, on the analogy of <span class="italic">conserte</span> which does occur. L. A. Post has had the same idea, and suggests either <span class="italic">sertius</span> or <span class="italic">consertius</span> at this point. This solution seems to have occurred to him before it did to me.—<span class="italic">E.H.W.</span></a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL420_385_2a').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL420_385_3"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL420_385_3" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">3</sup><span class="italic">colatis</span>: I don’t think that <span class="italic">colatis</span> = <span class="italic">incolatis</span> as Grégoire and Collombet think.
