<p>1. You ask me, my most eloquent friend, now that you mean to visit your countrymen the Sequani, to send you some satire or other, if I have finished it.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL296_395_1" id="target_note_LCL296_395_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Now I am much surprised that you have made such a request; for it is not decent of you so quickly to believe the worst of a friend’s character. So you supposed, did you, that I was likely, after reaching such an age and retiring from active life, to spend pains upon a literary effort which in my young days, when I was in the government service, it would have been audacious for me to have composed and dangerous for me to have published?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL296_395_2a" id="target_note_LCL296_395_2a"><sup>2</sup></a> Who that has even a nodding acquaintance with the schoolmaster has not been told by the poet of Calabria:

2. However, to prevent you from entertaining such notions in future about your comrade, I will risk being rather long and tell from the beginning the whole story of the suspicion that was thrown on me by the chatter and smoke of malicious gossip. Under the

Sidonius, who was little, if at all, over thirty at the time, playfully
speaks as if his days of youth and official life were far behind him. He had recently retired from a government post in Rome (see § 3, <span class="italic">recenti commilitio,</span> and note on the passage) and had gone back to Auvergne (§ 4). Now he assumes the pose of a retired old fogey and talks airily of the days when he was a young man in the civil service. Even if we take this to refer to some post under Avitus, about five years before the incident related in this letter, it is a jesting absurdity; but it may well refer to the <span class="italic">recens commilitium</span> of § 3. Thus the present passage throws no real light on the official career of Sidonius.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL296_395_2a').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL296_395_3"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL296_395_3" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">3</sup>Horace, <span class="italic">Sat.</span> II. 1. 82 sq.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL296_395_3').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
