through the insurrection of Julius, the latter dyed with Hasdrubal’s life-blood;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL296_359_1" id="target_note_LCL296_359_1"><sup>1</sup></a> for here is the Metaurus, the glory of which river was won in a single day but has endured through the ages, as though even now it swept bloody corpses down its empurpled waters into Dalmatia’s seas. 8. As for the other towns on the Flaminian road, I just entered and then left them, passing on with Picenum on my left and Umbria on my right; but there either the wind Atabulus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL296_359_2" id="target_note_LCL296_359_2"><sup>2</sup></a> from Calabria or the malarial district of Etruria intoxicated my lungs with poisonous blasts of air that brought on sweats and chills alternately, and infected my whole body with its atmosphere.

Amid this distress Rome burst upon my sight. I thought I could drink dry not only its aqueducts but the ponds used in its mock sea-fights. But before allowing myself to set foot even on the outer boundary of the city I sank on my knees at the triumphal thresholds of the Apostles,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL296_359_5" id="target_note_LCL296_359_5"><sup>5</sup></a>

The exact site of Hasdrubal’s defeat is unknown, but it was probably not many miles from the mouth of the river.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL296_359_1').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL296_359_2"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL296_359_2" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">2</sup>A hot dry wind; see commentators on Horace, Sat.
