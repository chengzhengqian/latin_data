completed the payment of earthly benefits. For, let me tell you, your inheritance from Nicetius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL420_7_1" id="target_note_LCL420_7_1"><sup>1</sup></a> was heaven’s reward for your gift of Cuticiacum. 4. To conclude, we entreat of you to extend your protection to our community equally with our church; for now, not for the first time, but more than ever before, it will rightfully be under your patronage, if only because you have given it of your patrimony. What the value of that patrimony may be, at least if your presence deigns to pay it frequent visits, you may learn even from the Goths, for they often feel constrained to despise or renounce their own Septimania<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL420_7_2" id="target_note_LCL420_7_2"><sup>2</sup></a> for the prospect of gaining possession of this coveted corner, even though they should first lay it waste. 5. But it is proper that you, who stand between them and the Empire, should under God’s guidance, devise more peaceful measures; for though they have broken through the frontier of their ancient possessions and are advancing the borders of their violent appropriation towards the Rhone and the Loire<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL420_7_3" id="target_note_LCL420_7_3"><sup>3</sup></a> with all the valour—or brute force—which they can command, your authoritative voice will exercise restraint upon both sides by virtue of the prestige attaching to your word, with the result that our side will learn what to refuse when asked, and our opponents will cease to demand when they get a refusal. Farewell.</p>
