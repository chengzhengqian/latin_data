also<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL420_223_1" id="target_note_LCL420_223_1"><sup>1</sup></a> to your brother Ecdicius, in whose distinctions you take as much delight as in mine. It is very quick promotion, if you consider his age, very slow if you consider his deserts; for he has long been making payment for his advancement to this dignity not on the gold-scales<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL420_223_2" id="target_note_LCL420_223_2"><sup>2</sup></a> but in the battlefield, and as a free-lance soldier he has enriched the Treasury not with money but with the spoils of war. 2. But<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL420_223_3" id="target_note_LCL420_223_3"><sup>3</sup></a> Iulius Nepos, an Emperor<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL420_223_4" id="target_note_LCL420_223_4"><sup>4</sup></a> supreme alike in arms and in goodness, has shown a high sense of duty in fulfilling, with a promptitude<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL420_223_5" id="target_note_LCL420_223_5"><sup>5</sup></a> which redounds all the more to his credit, the pledge with which his predecessor Anthemius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL420_223_6" id="target_note_LCL420_223_6"><sup>6</sup></a> bound himself to reward your brother’s exertions; what the other repeatedly promised he has actually brought to pass. The upshot of this is that in each succeeding era the best citizens can and ought to expend their utmost powers with an eagerness based on perfect confidence, seeing that even after the death of an Emperor any reward that that prince has promised to his devoted servants is always duly paid by the principate. 3. Meanwhile, if I rightly judge your affection, this news is bringing you great comfort in the midst of very great misfortunes, and even the menace of a siege so near cannot divert your heart from the path of our common rejoicings; for I am well aware that even my advancement, which you have a legal right to share, did not give you as much pleasure as this, because, while you are a good wife, you are a particularly good sister.
