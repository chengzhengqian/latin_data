<p>1. I have received your letter by the hand of Paterninus. One could not say whether it has more of honeyed sweetness or of the salt of wit; anyhow, it displays such fertility of utterance, and such fragrant flowers of style that you are clearly profiting not only from open but stealthy reading. Yet even this “theft,” for which you apologise, of a book which you have copied out, must needs be matter for pride rather than for pardon; for how could you do anything wrong when even your faults are not without merit? 2. For my part I am quite pleased to hear of the little trick played on me in my absence, and I welcome as a splendid gift the fact that I have, so to speak, sustained a loss which is no loss. For that which has gone to serve your use has not gone from my ownership, nor have you acquired an increase of your technical skill through the diminution of another’s. On the contrary, you will henceforth with good right enjoy ample applause in that with your flaming genius you have fittingly chosen to imitate the character of fire; for one may seek to take from a fire, but the fire that is left and the fire that is removed are each a complete fire. So don’t be alarmed, and don’t cherish a rather unfair opinion of your friend’s character; for in the present case the wound of guilt might more truly be said to taint me, if I felt a stab of envy. Farewell.</p>
