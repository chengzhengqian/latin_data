It seems that the Emperor Iulius Nepos first sent Epiphanius (not him of Sidonius, <span class="italic">Ep.</span> V. 17. 10), Bishop of Pavia, to discuss terms (Ennodius, <span class="italic">Vita Epiph.</span> 81 ff.—he does not mention the four other bishops here named by Sidonius). Apparently Epiphanius
(who is not mentioned by Sidonius) accepted Euric’s chief proposal but left further discussions and the drafting of a treaty to Basilius, the recipient of this letter, and the three other Gallic bishops here mentioned by Sidonuis. Leontius (<span class="italic">Ep.</span> VI. 3) was Bishop of Arles, Faustus (born in Britain? Abbot of Lérins for many years—<span class="italic">Ep.</span> IX. 3 and 9) Bishop of Riez, Graecus (<span class="italic">Ep.</span> VI. 8; VII. 2 and 7 and 10(11); IX. 4) Bishop of Marseille. It is not certain that Sidonius knew the full details of the agreement made. For different views see Stevens, 158–160, 198–199, 207 ff.; L.
