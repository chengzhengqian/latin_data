<p>1. Although you are still detained in your beloved Gratianopolis,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL420_59_1" id="target_note_LCL420_59_1"><sup>1</sup></a> I have ascertained by the trustworthy report of old friends that you are kind enough to esteem my poor writings (whether fashioned in prose or warbling in poetic style) more highly than the reading of the rolls that are stored in your cases. This itself is a delight to me, to have learnt that my sheets occupy your leisure hours; but I quite realise that it is not the effectiveness of the work but affection for the author that produces such an enjoyment in a nature like yours; and so I am all the more in your debt, because you grant to friendship an award of distinction which you would be bound to refuse to the composition in itself. 2. But as to the complete answer which I must give to the other sort, who depreciate my literary work,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL420_59_2" id="target_note_LCL420_59_2"><sup>2</sup></a> I have not yet made up my mind. For the man who considers himself the best critic generally studies sound and unsound composition with equal interest, being no more greedy for lofty utterances to praise than for contemptible ones to ridicule. In this way technique, grandeur, and propriety in the use of the Latin language are particularly underrated by the armchair critics, who, with an insensibility which goes hand in hand with scurrility, and wishing to read only what they may criticize, cannot, by their very abuse of literature, be making a proper use of it. Farewell.</p>
