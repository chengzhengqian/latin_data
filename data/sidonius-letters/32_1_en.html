<p>1. I have received your letter by the Prefect of the Food-Supply;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL296_393_1" id="target_note_LCL296_393_1"><sup>1</sup></a> in it you commend him as an old comrade of yours to me as a new judge.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL296_393_2a" id="target_note_LCL296_393_2a"><sup>2</sup></a> I thank him heartily and you most heartily that you have both decided either to count on my friendship’s being safe or at least to believe that nothing has yet impaired it. For my part I accept the acquaintance and intimacy of your excellent friend not only with readiness but with enthusiasm, for I feel sure that our own mutual liking will become closer through this compliance on my part. 2. However, I should wish you also to recommend to his vigilance my own self, that is to say, the upholding and defence of my reputation. For I am afraid that the uproar of the theatre-benches may sound the cry of “starvation in Rome,” and that the general famine may be put down to my luckless management. In fact I am proposing to send this very man down to the harbour without a moment’s delay, for I have been informed that five ships hailing from Brundisium have reached the mouth of the Tiber with food-stuffs in the shape of wheat and honey; and if he is at all business-like he will see that their cargoes are promptly placed at the service of the expectant population. By so doing he will commend himself to me, me to the people, and both of us to yourself. Farewell.</p>
