By these poems you were bound to win more and more acceptance from your contemporaries and increased fame with posterity; at least, so it seemed to me whenever your verses were delivered to me still hot, as it were, from the composer’s anvil—and I am a good judge, though not a good writer. 3. But I must make an avowal. My earlier life quite properly spared time or, more correctly, devoted all its energy to such pursuits; but now it is time for serious reading and serious writing; one should think about life eternal rather than posthumous renown, and never forget that after death it will be our deeds, not our screeds, that will be weighed in the balance. 4.
