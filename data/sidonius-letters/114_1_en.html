must needs become rustics for the time being. 2. This judgment of mine is confirmed by the book you have published on the nature of the soul, the work of a man with a rich command both of words and of matter. You preface the work with a dedication to me, and so I have got a gift of supreme value, inasmuch as my personal reputation, which the merits of my own books could not have raised to a renown worth my pains, is, thanks to your books, assured for all time. And, great heaven! what a work, what a grand work it is!—abstruse in matter but clear in exposition, beset with obstacles in the introductory presentation but opened up in the discussion, roughened and furrowed by the barbed points of the syllogisms, and yet made soft to the tread by a flowery carpet of lush eloquence. 3. There one finds words which are new because they are old—indeed the language even of antique literature would justly fall from favour by comparison with it. A more valuable merit is that all that diction flows freely, though broken up into short groups of words; and with the abundance of matter and the conciseness of phrase, it seems to teach more than it expresses.
