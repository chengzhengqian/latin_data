farthing to pay, in the name of the Arvernian capital<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL420_285_1" id="target_note_LCL420_285_1"><sup>1</sup></a> at least I offer you limitless thanks. In this case thought of succouring was not prompted by community of province, by nearness of city to city, by the convenience of a river, or by an offer of payments. 9. And so through my agency measureless thanks are conveyed to you by those who have had the good fortune, through an abundant supply of your bread, to gain a sufficient supply of their own. So if you think I have adequately discharged the mission entrusted to me I shall now become a news-bearer instead of an envoy. Be it known to you, then, that your glory is noised abroad through all Aquitania; you are loved and praised, and longed for and honoured in the hearts and prayers of all. In these bad times you are to them a good priest, a good father, a good harvest;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL420_285_2" id="target_note_LCL420_285_2"><sup>2</sup></a> it was worth their while to be brought into peril of starvation, if in no other way they could have experience of your bountiful-ness.
Deign to hold me in remembrance, my Lord Bishop.</p>
