his father and grandfather had been swallowed up by the extravagance of that domestic Charybdis, he came to his senses—a late repentance indeed, but now at long last he took the bit in his teeth, shook his shoulders clear of the yoke, and, like Ulysses in the story,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL420_523_1" id="target_note_LCL420_523_1"><sup>1</sup></a> put wax in his ears and so, deaf to evil temptations, he fled the enticements of moral shipwreck with a mistress. Very properly, he has now become a respectable husband by marrying a girl of unblemished reputation, lofty in character and birth, and also possessed of a princely fortune. 3. It would, of course, have been truly splendid if he had renounced his life of pleasure so completely as not even to take a wife; but while one may succeed in altering course from error to virtue, it is given to few<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL420_523_2a" id="target_note_LCL420_523_2a"><sup>2</sup></a> to begin at the highest level, and it is rare for those who have long allowed themselves every licence to cut off all indulgence immediately and simultaneously. 4. Therefore it now behoves you by diligent prayer to gain for the wedded pair as soon as possible the prospect of having children, so that after the birth of one or two sons (and I have mentioned the extreme limit) this husband who before marriage had taken his lawless pleasures may for the future refrain from lawful pleasures. For this couple, though newly married, behave with such propriety and modesty that on observing them you can clearly realise what a world of difference there is
