<p>1. It is a proverbial platitude that delay is often the better course, and now I have found it so. Your friend Menstruanus, having been here for a long time under my eye, has won the right to be counted also amongst <span class="italic">my</span> dear and devoted friends. He is a congenial companion, with refined manners; he is modest and temperate, thrifty and religious, and endowed with so excellent a character that when he is invited to share the friendship of any of the best people he contributes no less benefit than he gains. 2. This I write, not because it is news to you, but to do justice to my good opinion of him. There are thus three grounds for rejoicing: you have one, in having the good fortune to train up or to choose friends so successfully; the Arverni have another, for I can state with confidence that they have found in him the merit which I am clear that you recognised; and he has the third, in that the best people have formed the best possible opinion of him. Farewell.</p>
