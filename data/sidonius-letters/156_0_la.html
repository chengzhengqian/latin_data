<p><span class="italic">This letter bears every sign of having been very much elaborated for publication. There are several things that do not ring true, apart from the elaborate playing with words.</span> (<span class="italic">Let us hope that the sacrifice of decency to verbal play in</span> § 2 init. <span class="italic">was not actually sent to a man whose father was</span> in extremis.) <span class="italic">Obviously</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL420_154_1" id="target_note_LCL420_154_1"><sup>1</sup></a> <span class="italic">Turpio was dead at the supposed time of writing. Thus the heirs would get a year’s grace. But surely the original letter was sent off at once along with that of Maximus</span> [<span class="italic">at one time in the Palatine civil service</span> (<span class="italic">see note on</span> § <span class="italic">1</span>), <span class="italic">later a cleric</span>], <span class="italic">while the life of Turpio still hung in the balance</span> (<span class="italic">at least</span>, <span class="italic">as far as they knew</span>). <span class="italic">The last part of the letter implies that the death had already occurred—but 
recently</span>, <span class="italic">as the settlement of the estate and other arrangements 
consequent upon death were not quite completed. Then in the same part of the le.tter Turnus is urged to secure the payment of the debt immediately</span> (<span class="italic">protinus</span>) <span class="italic">and threatened with the withdrawal of Maximus’ kind offer if he does not do so. And he is asked to pay at least the amount of the principal</span>, 
<span class="italic">although all the interest had been remitted.</span></p>
<p><span class="italic">This is not all. Surely Maximus, the zealous priest</span>, <span class="italic">did not say that in forgoing the interest as his clerical office required</span> 
(§ <span class="italic">6, ‘mei officii ratio’; but Dalton</span> [<span class="italic">Vol. II. p. 234</span>]
