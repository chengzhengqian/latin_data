<p>1. Go to now—indict me by the Electoral Corruption Acts and propose my dismissal from the Senate for striving with unsleeping labours to win a <span class="italic">hereditary</span> position, seeing that my father, my father-in-law, my grandfather and my great-grandfather won the distinctions of praetorian and city prefectures and Masterships at court and in the army.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL296_347_1a" id="target_note_LCL296_347_1a"><sup>1</sup></a> 2. And lo! my friend Gaudentius, till now only of tribunician rank, has overclimbed the yawning idleness of our countrymen by winning the dignity of a vicarius.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL296_347_2" id="target_note_LCL296_347_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Of course our young lord-lings are muttering about “trampling on good birth,” but when a man has risen over the heads of backbiters the only effect on him is a feeling of elation.

referred to ever held the Prefecture of the City; Sidonius himself held it in <span class="sc">a.d.</span> 468. <span class="italic">Magisterium</span> was the office of a <span class="italic">magister,</span> and <span class="italic">mag. mil.</span> obviously refers to the <span class="italic">magisterium militum</span> held by Avitus (Introd., p. <span class="sc">xx</span>, <span class="italic">Carm.</span> 7. 377 sq., n. on 359 sqq.), but <span class="italic">Palatinis magisteriis</span> is puzzling. We do not read elsewhere that any relation of Sidonius was ever <span class="italic">magister officiorum</span> or one of the <span class="italic">magistri scriniorum</span> (on these offices see Bury, I. p. 29). It is just possible, though scarcely likely, that Sidonius’s father held one of these posts after being <span class="italic">tribunus et notarius,</span> under Honorius, or, if he became chief (<span class="italic">primicerius</span>) of the <span class="italic">tribuni et notarii,</span> he may have received the honorary title of <span class="italic">magister officiorum</span> on his retirement from office, as seems sometimes to have happened. Or did the mysterious great-grandfather hold one of those offices? On the whole, it seems probable that when Sidonius says “Palatine and military Masterships” he is speaking loosely and grandiloquently of a Mastership of soldiers and the “Palatine” post of <span class="italic">tribunus et notarius.</span> The name “Palatine” was applied to offices connected with the great departments of the Imperial civil service which had their headquarters at Rome under the immediate control of the Emperor.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL296_347_1a').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL296_347_2"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL296_347_2" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">2</sup>He had been <span class="italic">tribunus el nolatius</span> (on this office see Bury I. 23, C.M.H.
