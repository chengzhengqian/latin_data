So he was the first to retire from the stress and strain of the game, puffing and blowing in a state of internal inflammation: indeed, his poor swollen liver was sending frequent stabs of pain through his overtaxed body. 8.

W. Moore in <span class="italic">Greece and Rome</span>, I (1932), 118 f., a game rather like this one is played today. His note is tantalisingly brief, but I suppose he means the game which many of us used to play in a simple and crude form—standing in a ring with one player in the middle, who tries to intercept and secure the ball as it is thrown from one player to another. In the game described by Sidonius with his usual pretentious obscurity the players apparently formed up in a circle or a double row, with one man (the <span class="italic">medius currens</span>, “runner in the middle,” “inside runner”) in the centre of the ring or p]ay-space (<span class="italic">area</span>). A ball was passed from one to another of the players, and the inside man tried to intercept the passes and, presumably, to secure the ball. When he succeeded in doing so either the thrower or the man for whom the pass was intended would change places with the <span class="italic">medius currens</span> (see <span class="italic">Ep.</span> II. 9. 4). A good deal of jostling and horse-play was evidently allowed. The meaning of <span class="italic">catastropha</span> is a problem. The interpretation in the <span class="italic">Dictionary of Antiquities</span> is surely impossible—at least for Sidonius. I think <span class="italic">catastropha</span> (“overturning”, “upsetting”)
was a technical term, applied to a diving tackle by which the <span class="italic">medius currens</span> tried to upset the man who had caught, or was trying to catch, the ball. He would make his dive, flinging himself forward almost doubled up (<span class="italic">pronatus</span>: cf. <span class="italic">duplicabantur,</span> II. 9. 4); and if he is too late he has to check himself suddenly and go for the player to whom the ball has now been thrown. This twisting and turning in different directions, in which the player would be very apt to lose his balance, is here suitably indicated by <span class="italic">ruinoso fiexu (ruinoso,</span> “tending to cause a bad fall”).—<span class="italic">A.</span> The game was it seems a form of harpastum (Greek ἁρπάζω, seize), “hand-ball.” L. A. Post suggests that it is usually the tackled person who suffers most, not the tackier; that <span class="italic">catastropha</span> is simply an “upset” or an “overturn”; and that the man missed a catch and fell on his face in a falling twist (<span class="italic">ruinoso flexu</span>) or twisting fall. Post’s reading <span class="italic">caveret</span> &lt;<span class="italic">et</span>&gt; <span class="italic">ad hoc</span> may well be right: “and when this happened” or “and besides this.” For the rest of the clause “<span class="italic">per catastropham . . . recolligeret</span>” he suggests something like the following: “he was often, by being overturned, brought down on his face (<span class="italic">pronatus</span>) and was scarcely able to recover from his contorted collapse.” But note that <span class="italic">Ep.</span> II. 9. 4 shows <span class="italic">catastropha</span> to be a special Greek word used in Roman ball-play.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL420_233_1a').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL420_233_2"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL420_233_2" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">2</sup><span class="italic">I.e.</span> being made <span class="italic">medius currens</span> in his turn.—<span class="italic">A.</span></a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL420_233_2').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL420_233_3"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL420_233_3" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">3</sup>The sense “cut off” or “cut short” is rather surprising, and I feel fairly sure that Sidonius wrote <span class="italic">interciperet.—A.</span></a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL420_233_3').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
