<p>1. I have arrived at Bourges, being called upon by a decree of the people: the reason for their appeal was the tottering condition of the church, which having recently lost its supreme pontiff, has, so to speak, sounded a bugle-note to the ranks of both professions<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL420_309_1" id="target_note_LCL420_309_1"><sup>1</sup></a> to begin canvassing for the sacred office.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL420_309_2a" id="target_note_LCL420_309_2a"><sup>2</sup></a> The population, split into different factions, buzzes with excited talk; candidates are being put forward, or say rather thrust forward, in a few cases by others, in many cases by themselves. If one forms any judgment, following, as far as man can, the way of God and of truth, one is met with nothing but frivolous, inconsistent, and specious pleas, and in fact—how shall I put it?—there is no simplicity there but simple shamelessness. 2. Indeed, were it not that you would think my complaint unfounded, I should dare to say that a great many of them are in such a reckless and dangerous temper that they would not shrink from offering bribes to secure the sacred see and the position that goes with it, and the prize might before now have been put up for auction in the open market if there had existed as conscienceless a seller as there does exist a willing buyer. So I beg that your longed-for arrival may arm<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL420_309_3" id="target_note_LCL420_309_3"><sup>3</sup></a> me with your companionship and sustain me with your help
