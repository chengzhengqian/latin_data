and those of our peoples. Welcoming therefore the new power which has come to my old friend from the post he has obtained, I have spent a long time devising some claim on your kind offices. You may be sure that I rely on them so implicitly that, although I cannot find anything to ask for, I believe you will of your own accord devise favours to confer upon me. Farewell.</p>

<p>1. The son of your nurse has run off with the daughter of mine—a scandalous thing, which would have estranged you and me had I not known that you knew nothing of the deed being done. But after some words disclaiming complicity you think fit to beg that this flagrant offence go unpunished. I consent on one condition—that you release the ravisher from his hereditary position of <span class="italic">inquilinus,</span> becoming his patron instead of his master.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL420_239_1a" id="target_note_LCL420_239_1a"><sup>1</sup></a> 2. The woman is already free. The only thing that will cause her to be regarded as taken in lawful marriage, not made over as a plaything, will be that our culprit, on whose behalf you plead, should promptly be made a client instead of a tributory payer and so begin to have the standing of a plebeian rather than of a <span class="italic">colonus.</span> For nothing

In late Roman times the term seems frequently to denote a landless labourer or cottager on a large estate; in practice his status differed little from that of a <span class="italic">colonus</span> (<span class="italic">Cod. Just.</span> XI, 48,13) and in this letter the terms are synonymous. <span class="italic">Coloni</span> were tenant farmers on a large estate, many of whom, since the time of Diocletian, were tied to the soil though in strict law free men; the condition of such what obscure, but seems to denote a <span class="italic">colonus</span> (or <span class="italic">inquilinus</span>) for whose taxes the landlord was responsible, which seems to be the case here. Sidonius asks that the <span class="italic">inquilinus</span> should now be made a free tenant farmer who, however humble his status—<span class="italic">plebeia persona</span>—would be distinguished by, among other things, liability for his own taxes. From the woman’s point of view, the change in the man’s status would mean that their children would be free, whereas children of tied <span class="italic">coloni</span> and <span class="italic">inquilini</span> were bound by their father’s <span class="italic">origo</span> even though the mother was free. Justinian later decided children in the latter category should also be free (<span class="italic">Cod. Just.</span> XI, 48, 24). The maintenance of the hereditary colonate was the Government’s
answer to a chronic shortage of agricultural labour which seriously affected the imperial revenue, since most of this derived directly or indirectly from the produce of the land. It was also in the interests of the landowning class to which coloni was hereditary, and when estates were sold, they passed, together with the land they were farming, to new <span class="italic">domini.</span> The term <span class="italic">originalis</span> here used of the status of an <span class="italic">inquilinus</span> is regularly used also of <span class="italic">coloni</span> denoting their bondage to the land by virtue of their <span class="italic">origo.</span> The meaning of <span class="italic">tributarius</span> is some- Sidonius and his friends belonged, since they needed tenants who would not move away. The rights of landowners over their tied <span class="italic">coloni</span> progressively increased, but in spite of this, free peasants sometimes voluntarily adopted the status for protection in these troubled times. In contrast, it was no doubt rare for a landlord to give up one of his <span class="italic">coloni.</span> See A. H. M.
