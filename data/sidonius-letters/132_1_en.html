<p><span class="italic">Since Anderson left no translation of the rest of this letter, W. H. Semple completed it as follows:</span> To reveal more than this to the same effect I count as unnecessary. As with his learning, so with these virtues—I deem it superfluous to enlarge upon them: for the good deeds with which, though poor in worldly estate, he richly endowed his conscience, he was the more concerned to conceal in the hope of reward hereafter. 5. His elder brother, the bishop, he held in most affectionate regard, loving him as a son and respecting him as a father. The brother, too, regarded him with the highest esteem, having in him a counsellor in his court, a deputy in his churches, an agent in his business, a factor on his estates, an accountant in his revenues, an associate in his reading, an interpreter in his exegesis, and a companion in his travels. So each repaid to the other the services of brotherhood in mutual good faith, setting an example which might well inspire envy. 6. But why, hoping to calm my grief, do I go on supplying fuel to the flame of it? So, then, as I had started to say at first, I have composed this sad and mournful dirge, in honour, as Virgil’s phrase<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL420_107_1" id="target_note_LCL420_107_1"><sup>1</sup></a> has it, of the unthankful ashes (that is to say, the dead who can show no gratitude): the work has been in a sense laborious, for my disuse of composition<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL420_107_2" id="target_note_LCL420_107_2"><sup>2</sup></a> was making it a difficult task, except that my natural indolence was quickened by my tear-burdened grief. This is his epitaph:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">Under this mound rests the body of Claudianus.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">He was the pride and sorrow of his brother Mamertus,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent3">And the unique boast of admiring bishops.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
