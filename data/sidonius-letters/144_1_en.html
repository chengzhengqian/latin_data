<p>1. You forget what you are asked to do, and on the other hand, you never fail to remember all your own demands. It would be quite tedious to recount all the assurances of a speedy return which you and your family showered on me and mine: and yet not a particle of them has been fulfilled—far from it. When you were arranging to run away from us you intended to make us think you would be back by Holy Easter; and so no heavy baggage was transported from town to your estate; no carriages, no wagons for carting luggage followed in your train. 2. I refrain from complaining about the trickery of the ladies whom you carried off with only the slightest modicum of luggage, but you and Volusianus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL420_131_1" id="target_note_LCL420_131_1"><sup>1</sup></a> whom we both own as a brother, had scarcely one client and one servant to escort you, and thus you beguiled the disquietude of those who saw you off by holding out the vain hope that you would hurry back to them. Certainly our brother Volusianus did so, for he cheated our hope and expectation with the pretence of a shorter trip when really<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL420_131_2" id="target_note_LCL420_131_2"><sup>2</sup></a> proceeding to his property at Baiocassium<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL420_131_3" id="target_note_LCL420_131_3"><sup>3</sup></a> and therefore likely to traverse the whole province of Lugdunensis
Secunda. 3. And now you yourself, after thus taking your ease for many days in defiance of your promise, say that I must send you any metrical trifles with which I may have toyed since you left.
