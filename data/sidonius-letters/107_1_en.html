So you will act as I desire if you do not get mixed up with such company even by way of slight acquaintance, especially with those on whose abandoned low-comedy talk shame imposes neither rein nor bar. Those braggarts who shine not with the sheen of virtue but whose unbridled tongue is defiled with the filth of babbling indecency are as foul in their inmost hearts as in their speech. For after all it would be easier to find a man who talks piously and lives immorally than to point to one who is at the same time wicked in language and good in character. Farewell.</p>
