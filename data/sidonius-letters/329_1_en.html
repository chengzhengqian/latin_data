<p>1. My noble Son, you demand that my pen should break through the bounds set by my former letters and should advance into further regions, not content to be confined within the generous concession of the aforesaid total. You add some reasons why this ninth book should be annexed to the eight earlier ones, pointing out that Gaius Secundus, whose tracks you declare me to be following in this work, completes his collection of letters in the same<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL420_501_1" id="target_note_LCL420_501_1"><sup>1</sup></a> number of parts. 2. Your demand is laudable enough; and yet the task which your affection lays upon me is in itself a difficult one and unlikely to enhance such meagre commendation as I have already gained: first, because the present is a rather late addition to the trifling work previously published, and secondly, because, if I mistake not, any judge must regard it as highly improper that the same body of material should have one single beginning and three epilogues. 3. Moreover, I do not know how it can be found excusable that my loquacity cannot restrain itself even after its declared limit—unless perhaps it is excusable on the ground that the limit for one’s pages cannot be made the limit for one’s friendships.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL420_501_2a" id="target_note_LCL420_501_2a"><sup>2</sup></a>
