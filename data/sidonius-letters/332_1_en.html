duce for you, in a harvest of health-giving doctrine, ears of grain full of spiritual meanings, it is not to be expected that from my quarter the dry stubble of a parched tongue should be allowed to crackle in your hearing. You might just as reasonably join the honking of geese with the song of swans and the soft chirping of cheeky sparrows with the melodious plaints of the nightingale. 3. Besides this, it would be a presumptuous and unseemly thing if the burden of the task you prescribe were shouldered by me, a new cleric and an old sinner, with slight knowledge and a heavy conscience; assuredly with the inevitable result that, if I sent my writing anywhere in the world, my person would not escape the ridicule of the critics, even when out of their immediate view. No, my Lord Bishop, do not, I pray, insist too strongly that my modesty, which seeks concealment as best it can, should be spoilt by the foolhardiness of beginning this work, for such is the spite of the detractors that a mere beginning on the subject you suggest would more readily bring their reproach than completion would bring their approval. Deign to hold me in remembrance, my Lord Bishop.</p>
