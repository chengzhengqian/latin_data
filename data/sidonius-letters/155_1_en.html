I therefore beg you to be lenient with one who is so severe with himself; follow the divine example and do not by your judgment pronounce guilty one who by his own confession has condemned himself. Even if you should be inexorable and order him to undergo unexampled forms of punishment, the pain inflicted by you cannot torture him more than the shame with which he tortures himself.
