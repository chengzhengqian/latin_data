The epithet <span class="italic">doctus</span> (in <span class="italic">Carm.</span> XXIII. 446 Leo is described as <span class="italic">doctiloquus</span>) as applied to a poet by Sidonius and by many others before him connotes a skilfully acquired mastery of the technique and machinery of poetry. Leo would no doubt appreciate such a description; but unfortunately Sidonius, with his itch for antithesis and word-play, has unconsciously suggested that inspiration (implied by <span class="italic">fonte</span>) was not very conspicuous in his friend’s poetry. Perhaps his blundering words were meant to affirm that Leo’s wonderful brain need not go to any mythical fountain for inspiration—his poetry is “all out of his own head.”—<span class="italic">A.</span> Yes, I agree. Sidonius has invited Leo to forget for a moment Hippocrene; but then he realises that, in addressing this very scholarly man, he is attributing to inspiration, to poetic μανία, what in fact is due to Leo’s own intellectual creativeness. So Leo’s poetry is the result of a conscious intellectual effort, not the effect of involuntary possession by the Muse.—<span class="italic">W.H.S.</span></a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL420_409_1').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL420_409_2"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL420_409_2" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">2</sup>More literally: “are sweated not so much out of that spring as from their own brow.”</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL420_409_2').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL420_409_3"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL420_409_3" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">3</sup><span class="italic">ab atavo Frontone</span>: Fronto (not he of <span class="italic">Ep.</span> IV. 21. 4) was famous for his oratory: see VIII. 10. 3 and IV. 14. 2.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL420_409_3').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL420_409_4"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL420_409_4" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">4</sup>Probably the Vandals; Euric had extended his rule over most of Spain and thus approached the Vandals in N.

These were a number of German tribes between the Main and the North Sea, the “Ripuarians” living by the Rhine, the “Salians” by the sea. Defeated by the emperor Julian (after <span class="sc">a.d.</span> 355) they were confirmed in their earlier occupation of Toxandria (between Meuse and Scheldt) as <span class="italic">foederati</span> of the Romans, serving in the Roman army. Early in the fifth century the Salians became independent tribes each under its own king. One of these kings, Chlodio or Chlogio, about <span class="sc">a.d.</span> 431 invaded more Roman territory, was defeated by Aëtius, but remained master of much of northern Gaul. Franks aided Rome again when Aëtius defeated Attila the Hun in Mauriac in 451. Between c. 456 and 481 a new king Childeric was now friendly now hostile to Rome. His successor Clovis conquered all Gaul except Burgundian territory and Provence, defeating the Roman Syagrius at Soissons in 486 or 487. In the next century the Merovingian house became supreme over all Gaul. L.
