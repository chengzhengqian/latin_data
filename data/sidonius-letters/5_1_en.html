Nobles in armour have places near his throne; a crowd of guards in their dress of skins is allowed in so as to be at hand, but excluded from the presence so as not to disturb; and so they keep up a hum of conversation by the door, outside the curtains but within the barriers. Meanwhile deputations from various peoples are introduced, and he listens to a great deal of talk, but replies shortly, postponing business which he intends to consider, speeding that which is to be promptly settled. The second hour comes: he rises from his throne, to pass an interval in inspecting his treasures or his stables. 5. When a hunt has been proclaimed and he sallies forth, he considers it beneath his royal dignity to have his bow slung at his side; but if in the chase or on the road chance presents bird or beast within his range, he puts his hand behind his back, and an attendant places the bow in it, with the string or thong hanging loose; for he thinks it childish to carry the bow in a case, and womanish to take it over ready strung. When he takes it he either holds it straight in front of him and bends the two ends and so strings it, or he rests upon his raised foot the end which has the knot, and runs his finger along the loose string until he comes to the dangling loop;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL296_339_2a" id="target_note_LCL296_339_2a"><sup>2</sup></a> then he takes up the arrows, sets them in place, and lets them fly.

Theodoric raises one foot, keeping the heel on the ground, and rests the strung end of the bow on that foot, while the other end rests against his body or is firmly held in one hand. He then stoops, bending the bow at the same time. Taking hold of the string at the end where it is tied to the bow, he runs his fingers along it, thus straightening it out, until they reach the loop, which he duly attaches.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL296_339_2a').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
