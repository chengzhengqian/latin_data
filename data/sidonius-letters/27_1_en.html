It may be that at this time, at least in Gaul, the word <span class="italic">Syrus</span> was used in the special sense of “banker” or “money-lender”: see Friedlaender, <span class="italic">Sittengeschichte,</span><sup>10</sup> 
I. 378, who compares the mediaeval use of “Lombard.”
With reference to the present passage Hodgkin (I. 861, n. 1) ingeniously suggests that there may be an allusion to a tradition that “all the bishops of Ravenna for the first four centuries were of Syrian extraction.” This seems very doubtful.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL296_383_2').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL296_383_3a"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL296_383_3a" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">3</sup>In the later Empire the trading classes were excluded by law from the army and from the civil service, and, on the other hand, soldiers might not go into trade—though some laxity seems to have been allowed in their case. The juxtaposition of <span class="italic">milites</span> seems to show that <span class="italic">militare</span> is here used of service in the army, not, as was usual in this period, of a post in the civil service. For <span class="italic">milites</span> some MSS. read <span class="italic">monachi</span> (“monks”), which deprives the sentence of all point. Probably <span class="italic">milites</span> was accidentally omitted in the archetype because of its similarity to <span class="italic">militant</span> (this is a common form of scribal error); then someone, noticing that a noun was wanted, stupidly inserted <span class="italic">monachi</span> (perhaps suggested by <span class="italic">clerici</span> in the preceding sentence).</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL296_383_3a').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL296_383_4"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL296_383_4" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">4</sup>For the meaning of <span class="italic">foederati</span> see Introd., p. x, n. 2.
