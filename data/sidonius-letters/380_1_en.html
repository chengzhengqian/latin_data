on the occasion when I took up that office<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL420_603_1" id="target_note_LCL420_603_1"><sup>1</sup></a> which, since of old, singly controls the rights of senate and people alike.</p>
<p>“Besides my hexameter verses I have fashioned many sportive poems in many patterns: oft have I turned off two-limbed<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL420_603_2" id="target_note_LCL420_603_2"><sup>2</sup></a> pentameters placed under hexameters.</p>
<p>“Yet again, I have amused myself, a practised rider, by cantering through the eleven syllables, and many a time I have sung in the Sapphic measure, but rarely in the swift iambic.</p>
<p>“Nor can I recall how many things I wrote in the first fervour of youth; I only wish that most of them might be buried in silence!</p>
<p>“For as the bourn of old age draws nearer, the closer I get to my last years, the more I am ashamed to remember now the flippant frolics of my youth.</p>
<p>“Appalled by this memory, I have transferred my study in all its forms to the cultivation of letter-writing, lest, guilty as I was of wanton song, I should be guilty also of wanton deed;</p>
<p>“And lest I should be thought a voluptuary demoralised by prettiness of language if I added to my pages tropes and trappings, so that my fame as a poet might not cast a slur on my strictness as a cleric.</p>
