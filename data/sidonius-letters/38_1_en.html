The next day Augustus invited me to take part in his banquet on the occasion of the sports of the circus. The first place on the left horn of the couch<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL296_405_2" id="target_note_LCL296_405_2"><sup>2</sup></a> was occupied by Severinus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL296_405_3" id="target_note_LCL296_405_3"><sup>3</sup></a> consul of the year, a man who through all the great struggles between the mighty and through all the unstable fortunes through which the state had passed had always kept a steady position of influence. At his side was Magnus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL296_405_4" id="target_note_LCL296_405_4"><sup>4</sup></a> who had formerly had the standing of an ex-prefect and had lately gained that of an ex-consul,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL296_405_5" id="target_note_LCL296_405_5"><sup>5</sup></a> a personality equal to the double distinction conferred upon him. After him was placed Camillus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL296_405_6" id="target_note_LCL296_405_6"><sup>6</sup></a> his brother’s son, who, having himself also passed through two high offices, had added fresh lustre alike to his father’s proconsulship and to his uncle’s consulship. Then next to him came Paeonius, and then Athenius,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL296_405_7" id="target_note_LCL296_405_7"><sup>7</sup></a> a man who had played a busy part in the vicissitudes of litigation and revolution. After him came Gratianensis,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL296_405_7" id="target_note_LCL296_405_7"><sup>7</sup></a> a man whom no ill-report ought to touch, inferior to Severinus in rank but having the advantage of him in favour.

of the service; it is from this end that the “right” and “left” sides of the couch are reckoned. The usual form of dining-couch at this time was semicircular (<span class="italic">sigma</span> or <span class="italic">stibadium</span>), being made to fit the round tables which had long been fashionable. The “horns” are the two ends of the couch. In the present case the guests are arranged in a way which seems to have been usual at the time. On the right extremity (or “horn”) reclines Majorian, the host. Opposite him, on the left horn, is the guest of honour (the consul). The other guests are arranged round the couch in strict order of precedence, beginning with Magnus, next to the consul, and ending with Sidonius, who is next to Majorian.
