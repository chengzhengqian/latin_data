Fabricius Luscinus, who as censor in 275 <span class="sc">b.c.</span> expelled from the Senate P. Cornelius Rufinus (an ancestor of the dictator Sulla: Plutarch, <span class="sc">Sull.</span> 1) because he possessed ten pounds (or, according to another account, more than ten pounds) of silver plate. This incident is recalled again and again by writers of later ages (see, for example, the references given by Friedlaender on Juvenal IX. 142), and it, or the law (if there was such a law) on which Fabricius acted, is probably the ultimate source of the custom mentioned here. Such sumptuary restrictions as those of Fabricius and many others were powerless to stem the tide of luxury, but it is interesting to find his action cited even as late as Tertullian in order to lash the extravagance of the times. In <span class="italic">Apol.</span> c. 6, after referring to the expulsion of P. Cornelius from the Senate, he goes on to say that in his time “whole mines of silver” are wrought into dishes.<span class="linebreak"></span>

Nearly everywhere in this paragraph the meaning must be really plural, but if we take it so at the end of the first sentence we shall have to assume that Sidonius was not the only guest staying there at the time; otherwise the words <span class="italic">ad sarcinas . . . referebamus</span> would scarcely be intelligible. This notion, Ferreolus gave up his own bed to him. But the use of the plural above mentioned seems against this view. Again, as Sidonius tells us in § 4 that whenever he entered either vestibule he found games going on, the most natural inference is that he was not staying in either house. In the third place, if he were staying with either of his hosts, surely he would have told us which of them had the pleasure of putting him up, especially as he makes so much in § 3 of their friendly however, seems at first sight to be contradicted by <span class="italic">assecularum meorum</span> in § 8; if there were other guests, their servants as well as those of Sidonius must have been included in the convivial company. But Sidonius would know and recognise his own servants, and it does not really follow that there were no servants of other guests in the indiscriminate crowd. Much difficulty is removed if we assume that the plural verbs have a plural meaning throughout the paragraph; moreover, several parts of this letter seem to imply that there were other guests besides Sidonius. contest for the pleasure of feeding him. In II. 2. 13, however, Dr. Semple’s interpretation of <span class="italic">deversorium</span> may be right.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL296_457_2a').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL296_457_2b-1"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL296_457_2b-1" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">2</sup><span class="italic">Deversorium</span> may be applied to temporary quarters of various kinds. In I. 5. 9 it means “inn” or “boarding-house”; the latter is perhaps the meaning in VII. 2. 6. Here it seems to refer to some such accommodation near the house of Apollinaris. Building was still going on at both houses (§ 8<span class="italic">init.</span>); it was indeed going on at Vorocingus when Sidonius wrote the epilogue to his poems, and his mention of it in <span class="italic">Carm.</span> 24. 54 sq. may have been suggested by what he had recently seen on the visit described here. Thus the inferences sometimes drawn from this letter about the limited accommodation at Gallo-Roman country-houses must not be taken too seriously.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL296_457_2b-1').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL296_457_2b-2"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL296_457_2b-2" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">2</sup>Dr. Semple makes the tempting suggestion that <span class="italic">deversorium</span> both here and in II. 2. 13 means “guest-room.” We should then have to suppose that Sidonius was staying with Apollinaris at Vorocingus, and that after lunching there he simply retired to his own room for the siesta; on the other hand, when he had lunched at Prusianum, one of the sons of</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL296_457_2b-2').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
