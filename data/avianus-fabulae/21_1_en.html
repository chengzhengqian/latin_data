<h2><span class="sc">The Boy and the Thief</span></h2>
<p>A boy sat down in tears at the edge of the water of a well, deceitfully opening wide his mouth in groundless blubbering. A smart thief, on seeing him with tears starting from his eyes, asked what was the cause of his distress now. The boy pretended his rope had parted in two; thereby, he sobbed, his golden pitcher had fallen down the well. At once the rascal’s hand dragged off his hampering garment, and, when stripped, he made straight for the bottom of the well. The youngster, so the story has it, put the cloak round his own little neck, plunged into the brambles and was lost to sight. But when, after encountering danger on a deceptive hope, he had seated himself again on the ground, miserable over the loss of his cloak, the shrewd knave (so the story goes) gave utterance to these laments and made moaning supplication to the high gods: “Henceforth let anyone, whoever he be, who thinks a jar lies hid in clear water,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL434_721_aa" id="target_note_LCL434_721_aa">
<sup>a</sup>
</a> reckon that he has richly deserved to lose his cloak.”</p>
