<h2><span class="sc">The Pig and its Owner</span></h2>
<p>A pig was ruining a farmer’s corn and trampling his fertile fields; so he cut its ear off and let it go, hoping that, carrying home a reminder of the pain suffered, it would remember in future and keep off the tender crops. It was caught again in the crime of grubbing up the soil, and for its thieving lost the ear it had—the one previously spared. Immediately afterwards it thrust its mutilated<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL434_729_a" id="target_note_LCL434_729_a">

</a> head into the aforementioned corn; but the twice-repeated punishment made it a marked trespasser.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL434_729_b" id="target_note_LCL434_729_b">

</a> This time the farmer, having captured it, gave it for its owner’s sumptuous banquet, cutting a great number of slices for the various dishes. But when they had been eating the boar and the owner asked for its heart, which the ravenous cook is said to have purloined, then the farmer soothed his reasonable anger with these words, remarking that the pig was stupid and never had a heart<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL434_729_c" id="target_note_LCL434_729_c">

</a>—for why had it been mad enough to return just to lose parts of its body? why let itself be caught so many times by the same enemy?</p>
<p>This sketch is a warning to those who have ventured too often and never kept their hands off iniquity.</p>
