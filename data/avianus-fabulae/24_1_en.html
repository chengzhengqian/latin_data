<p>When mid-winter stood bristling with thick frost and bound every field in hardened ice, a traveller came to a halt in a heavy barrier of mist; for the losing of his path prevented his advance.

</a> looked upon him wondering the while, and straightway was afeared to see a mortal possess power so great. For, to bring back his chilled limbs to the tasks of life, the traveller had blown into his hands and thawed them with his warm breath. But it was different when he had banished the cold and had delightedly begun to enjoy his host’s generous attentions; since, anxious to show him how they lived in the country, the Satyr kept bringing out and serving all the best that the woodland yielded; he set before him also a bowl full of warm wine so that its pervasive heat might loosen the chilliness of his limbs. The traveller, fearing to touch the glowing cup with his lips, blew this time with a cooling breath. His host was alarmed and astounded at the double miracle, and driving him from the woods bade him begone still further off. “I desire no one,” he said, “ever to approach my cave who owns at the same moment two such different sorts of mouth.”</p>
