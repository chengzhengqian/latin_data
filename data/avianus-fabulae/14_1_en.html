<h2><span class="sc">The Oak and the Reed</span></h2>
<p>An oak was torn up by its roots, a victim of the mad South Wind’s whirling force, and fell down from the mountain heights. A river-channel, flowing below in high spate, took it and bore it off in the headlong current. But after the tall trunk had been thrust from bank to bank, its mighty bulk came to rest among slender reeds. Then it marvelled that a reed, fastening its stalks in but a tiny tuft, should stand firm in the flowing water; it marvelled that, for all its massive trunk, even it could not yet<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL434_707_a" id="target_note_LCL434_707_a">

</a> stand unmoved, while the reed with its slender rind endured the menaces of nature.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL434_707_b" id="target_note_LCL434_707_b">

</a> Presently the creaking reed, answering with meek whisper, declared that its weakness increased its safety. “You,” it said, “scorn the ravening winds and cruel tempests, and fall beneath the onset of their full strength. I keep in dalliance the gradually rising Auster and, with an eye to the future, let myself be swayed by Notus, however light his breath. Against your strength the rain-storm hurls itself sheer; but, baffled by my motion, the breeze sinks into nothing.”</p>
<p>This teaches us that it is in vain we resist the mighty and that it is by slow degrees that we surmount the fury of their menaces.</p>
