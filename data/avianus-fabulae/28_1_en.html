<h2><span class="sc">The Ant and the Grasshopper</span></h2>
<p>[The man that has allowed his youth to go by in idleness and has not taken anxious precautions against the ills of life—that man, foredone with years, will in the presence of burdensome old age often ask in vain, alas, for a neighbour’s help.]</p>
<p>An ant reserved for the winter the fruits of toil snatched during sunny hours and stored them betimes in her tiny hole. But when earth assumed its white robe of hoar frost and fields lay hid beneath unyielding ice, then, quite idle and unfit bodily to face the rain-storms, she picked out the moistened grain in her own abode. A grasshopper in her varied hues, who before had cleft the fields with plaintive note, amid prayers and supplications begged the ant for food. For her part, she said, when the threshing-floor was bruising the ripened harvest, she had worked out the summer days in song. Then with a laugh the tiny ant thus addressed the grasshopper (for their wont is to prolong their life equally)<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL434_735_a" id="target_note_LCL434_735_a">
