<p>Savage Boreas and gentle Phoebus joined strife in the presence of the stars with great Jupiter, to decide which should first achieve his task; and over the midst of the plain it happened a traveller was plying his wonted way. They agree to preface their dispute with this case for trial—to get the man stripped by tearing off his cloak.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL434_689_a" id="target_note_LCL434_689_a">

</a> Straightway with the onset of the wind the sky thunders around, and the chill rain-storm pours down torrents of water. The traveller folds his cloak double and draws it round his sides all the more, because the tempestuous blast pushes the folds aside and tugs at them. But Phoebus had bidden his penetrating rays grow stronger little by little, so that his splendour might emerge in excessive heat,—until the traveller, anxious to rest his weary limbs, threw down his cloak and sat on the ground exhausted. Then in his triumph the Titan taught the assembled gods<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL434_689_b" id="target_note_LCL434_689_b">

</a> that no one can win victory by an advance guard of threats.</p>

<p>[Everyone should take his true measure and be content with his own merits, and not claim for himself his neighbour’s goods, lest the stripping of the finery lead to painful ridicule as soon as he is left in possession of his usual defects.]</p>
