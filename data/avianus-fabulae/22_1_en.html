<h2><span class="sc">The Lion and the Goat</span></h2>
<p>A hungry lion while passing near by had spied a she-goat grazing on a rocky height. He opened conversation with “Ho, there! leave these steeps with their precipitous crags and don’t look for pasture on prickly ridges. No, you should go through the green meadows in quest of the yellow lucerne-flower and pale green willow and sweet thyme.” “Please stop,” said the goat with a groan, “your lying attempts to rouse me from my security with your gentle wiles. Though your advice has truth in it, though you suppress the greater dangers, yet you do not make me trust what you say. For however correct your words be and however sound their meaning, yet a famished counsellor has his meaning under suspicion.”</p>

<h2><span class="sc">The Crow and the Jar</span></h2>
<p>A thirsty crow had spied a huge jar containing a very little water at the bottom. Long did the crow strive to spill this water on the level plain, to banish, of course, thereby her excessive thirst; but, when no valiant effort could provide a way, she lost her temper and with fresh cunning applied all her crafty devices. She threw pebbles in, and the low level of water rose naturally and so supplied an easy way of drinking.</p>
