<p>“Go on and drive your bullocks with the goad through their difficulties, and learn to aid with your hands the sluggish wheels. After you have come to grips and used your strength for greater efforts, then it is allowable also to win the gods over to your wishes. Learn, however, that the deities are not swayed by indolent vows: bring the gods to your help by acting yourself.”</p>

<h2><span class="sc">The Goose that laid the Golden Eggs</span></h2>
<p>A man owned a goose teeming with precious offspring, one that often laid golden eggs in its nest. Nature had ordained this rule for the noble bird, that it should not lay more than one egg at the same time. But the owner, anticipating the disappearance of his greedy expectations,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL434_733_a" id="target_note_LCL434_733_a">

</a> could not brook delays, hateful when his profits were considered;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL434_733_b" id="target_note_LCL434_733_b">

</a> he thought to win a handsome prize by killing the bird, rich as it was in such unfailing bounty. When he plunged his dread knife into its open<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL434_733_c" id="target_note_LCL434_733_c">

</a> breast, and found the bird empty of the usual eggs, he groaned aloud, tricked by the iniquity of so gross a fraud; for thereupon he ascribed the punishment to his own deserts.</p>
<p>So to those wicked enough to ask the gods for everything at once, they refuse the more justly even the prayers of a single day.</p>
