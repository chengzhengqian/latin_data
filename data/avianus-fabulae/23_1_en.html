<h2><span class="sc">The Farmer and his Ox</span></h2>
<p>There once was an ox that chafed at ropes and shirked submitting its rebellious neck to the grip of the yoke. The farmer cut its horns with a knife used slantwise and thought the frenzied animal had abated its rage. Carefully he fastened its neck to the weighty plough (for it was over-ready with horn and hoof), doubtless so that the long pole might obstruct any butting and that its cruel hoof might find it difficult to kick. But when the animal, its neck angrily struggling against the straps, worried the inoffensive earth with impotent hoof, its feet at once churned up the sand broadcast for the North wind to blow into its master’s face as he followed. Then the farmer, while he shook his locks begrimed with unsightly dust, said, in deep discomfiture of heart, “Truly, I needed an instance of a vicious temper to show how anyone could contrive to do mischief.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL434_725_a" id="target_note_LCL434_725_a">
