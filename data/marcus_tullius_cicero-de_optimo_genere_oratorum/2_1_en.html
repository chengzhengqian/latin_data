divide into types, for I am looking for the perfect example. There is only one kind of perfect orator: those who do not belong to this group do not differ in genre as Terence<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL386_357_a" id="target_note_LCL386_357_a"><sup>a</sup></a> differs from Accius,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL386_357_b" id="target_note_LCL386_357_b"><sup>b</sup></a> but though classified with him do not equal him in attainments. The supreme orator, then, is the one whose speech instructs, delights and moves the minds of his audience.

<p>II. For as eloquence consists of language and thought,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL386_357_d" id="target_note_LCL386_357_d"><sup>d</sup></a> we must manage while keeping our diction faultless and pure—that is in good Latin—to achieve a choice of words both “proper” and figurative.

On the other hand, there are as many kinds of thoughts as I said above there are of styles of oratory.
