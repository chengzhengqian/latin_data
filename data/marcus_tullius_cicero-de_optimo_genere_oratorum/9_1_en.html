in a bill, though Demosthenes had not rendered an account of his office, that he should receive a crown of gold, and that the presentation should be made in the theatre before the assembled people, though this was not the place for a legal assembly; and that proclamation should be made that he received the crown for his virtue and the benevolence which he had shown <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">20</span><span class="br"></span>to the people of Athens. Aeschines then summoned this Ctesiphon to court charging him with proposing a bill contrary to the fundamental law in that the crown was to be presented before Demosthenes had rendered his account, and in that the presentation was to be made in the theatre, and because the statement about virtue and benevolence was untrue, since Demosthenes neither was a good man nor had deserved well of the city.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL386_371_a" id="target_note_LCL386_371_a"><sup>a</sup></a></p>
<p>This case in its very nature is far removed from the customary procedure of our courts; still it is important. For it involves a very nice interpretation of the law on both sides, and a comparison of the public services of the two orators which is extremely <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">21</span><span class="br"></span>impressive.

Aeschines instituted this prosecution against Ctesiphon four years before the death of Philip of Macedon, but the trial was held several years later when Alexander was now master of Asia.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL386_371_c" id="target_note_LCL386_371_c"><sup>c</sup></a> The trial
