<p>“You have furnished Brutus with the money in the care
of Apuleius.”</p>
<p>What of it? If the Republic had armed that excellent
person with all its resources, what honest man, I ask you,
would feel disapproval? And he could neither have maintained
an army without money nor taken your brother prisoner
without an army.</p>
<p>“You have commended the execution of Petraeus and<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">33</span><span class="br"></span>
Menedemus, who had been granted Roman citizenship
and were guest-friends of Caesar.”</p>
<p>We have not ‘commended’ something we have not even
heard of. I suppose we have nothing more important to
think about in this national upheaval than a couple of rascally
little Greeks!<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL507_269_61" id="target_note_LCL507_269_61"><sup>61</sup></a></p>
<p>“Theopompus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL507_269_62" id="target_note_LCL507_269_62"><sup>62</sup></a> was stripped bare and expelled by
Trebonius. He fled to Alexandria. You have done nothing.”</p>
<p>Here indeed the senate has committed a serious crime!
We have done nothing about the great Theopompus! And
where in the world he is, what he is doing, whether he is
alive or dead in fact, who either knows or cares?</p>
<p>“You see in your camp Servius Galba still wearing that
same dagger.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL507_269_63" id="target_note_LCL507_269_63"><sup>63</sup></a></p>
<p>I make you no answer about our most gallant and resolute
fellow countryman Galba. He will be present in person.
He himself and the ‘dagger,’ with which you reproach
him, will reply on the spot.</p>
<p>“You have mustered soldiers, either those belonging to
me or veterans, as though to destroy Caesar’s killers, and
you have surprised them into endangering their own (former)
quaestor or imperator<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL507_269_64" id="target_note_LCL507_269_64"><sup>64</sup></a> or their own comrades in
arms.”</p>
