Cato, chief also in virtue among all mankind. Why should I
remind you of the other illustrious figures? You know them
all. I am more afraid of your thinking me long-winded in
the enumeration than of appearing ungrateful in the omission.
What of the ex-aediles, the ex-tribunes of the plebs,
the ex-quaestors! In a word, the rank and number of the
senators were such that any who did not join that camp are
in sore need of an excuse.</p>
<p>Now listen to the rest.</p>

<section class="div2">
<p>[15] “You have treated as your leader the vanquished
Cicero.”</p>
<p>I am the more gratified to hear the word ‘leader’ because
he certainly uses it against his will. As for ‘vanquished,’
that does not trouble me. It is my fate that apart
from the Republic I can neither be vanquished nor vanquish.</p>
<p>“You fortify Macedonia with armies.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL507_265_53" id="target_note_LCL507_265_53"><sup>53</sup></a></p>
<p>Yes, and we have wrenched it away from your brother,
who is quite worthy of the rest of your family.</p>
<p>“You have entrusted Africa to Varus, a prisoner twice
over.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL507_265_54" id="target_note_LCL507_265_54"><sup>54</sup></a></p>
<p>Antonius thinks he’s having a dispute with his brother
Gaius.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL507_265_55" id="target_note_LCL507_265_55"><sup>55</sup></a></p>
<p>“You have sent Cassius to Syria.”</p>
<p>So don’t you perceive that the whole world lies open to
this cause of ours, whereas you have nowhere outside your
fortifications to set your foot?</p>
<p>“You have allowed Casca to hold the tribunate.”<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">31</span><span class="br"></span></p>
<p>And why not? Were we to remove him from public life
like Marullus and Caesetius,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL507_265_56" id="target_note_LCL507_265_56"><sup>56</sup></a> when we have him to thank
that the dismissal of a tribune from office and many similar
proceedings cannot occur in future?</p>
