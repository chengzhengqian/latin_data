flight to (Hither) Gaul. He thought Caesar was in pursuit
with the Martian Legion and the Fourth and the veterans,
whose name made him quake with fear. As he pushed into
Gaul, Decimus Brutus blocked his path, voluntarily letting
himself be surrounded by the billows of the whole war
rather than let Antonius go backward or forward, and using
Mutina to curb his fury like a bridle on a rampant horse.
After Antonius had surrounded the town with works and
fortifications, and neither the dignity of a flourishing colony
nor the majesty of a consul-elect deterred him from his
work of treason, at that point, against my will—I call you
gentlemen and the Roman people and all the presiding
deities of Rome to witness—against my opposition, three
consular envoys were sent to this leader of bandits and
gladiators. Was there ever such a barbarian, such a monster,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">21</span><span class="br"></span>
such a beast? He did not listen, he did not reply. He
treated with scorn and total contempt not only the ambassadors
to their faces, but much more us who sent them.

with crucifixion and torture.</p>

on the one hand and that extremely savage monster on
