the Antonii to be such citizens in the Republic as the Republic
will have in Sextus Pompeius? In him is modesty, responsibility,
moderation, integrity; in them—and when I
name them, I mentally include every member of that robber
band—are lusts, crimes, monstrous audacity stopping
at nothing.</p>
<p>Next, I beg you, Members of the Senate: which of you
does not see what Fortune herself has seen,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL507_239_14" id="target_note_LCL507_239_14"><sup>14</sup></a> who is said
to be blind? With no violation of Caesar’s acts, which we
defend for the sake of concord, Pompeius’ own house will
lie open to him, and he will repurchase it for not less
than Antonius paid for it. I repeat, Gnaeus Pompeius’ son
will repurchase his father’s house. A bitter thought! But
enough tears, and for long enough, have been shed over
these things. You voted Sextus Pompeius a sum of money
equal to that which his father’s property realized for his
victorious enemy<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL507_239_15" id="target_note_LCL507_239_15"><sup>15</sup></a> in the dispersal of the plunder. But I<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">11</span><span class="br"></span>
claim for myself the management of this matter in virtue of
my friendship and close association with his father. Pompeius
will repurchase the suburban estate, the town house,
and certain urban properties now occupied by Antonius.
As for the silverplate, fabrics, furniture, and wine which
that wastrel has squandered, Pompeius will take their loss
philosophically. He will recover the villas at Alba and
Formiae from Dolabella and the villa at Tusculum, again,
