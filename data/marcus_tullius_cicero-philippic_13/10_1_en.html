<p>[8] Still, it may be urged that there is a danger of our being
overwhelmed. I am not afraid that one who cannot enjoy
his own ample fortunes if honest men perish will betray
his own welfare.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL507_247_25" id="target_note_LCL507_247_25"><sup>25</sup></a> Good citizens are made in the first place
by nature, then are aided by Fortune. For while the wellbeing
of the Republic is to the advantage of all honest men,
that is more obviously the case with the fortunate among

than Lepidus, who of sounder mind than he? The Roman
people saw his distress, his tears, at the Lupercalia, saw
how cast down, how crushed he was when Antonius tried
to put the diadem on Caesar and preferred to be Caesar’s

cruel a tyrant as was Antonius in Rome, surrounded by
armed barbarians? Under Caesar’s despotism we used to
come to the senate in safety, if not in freedom. With this pirate

shows Cicero’s distrust of Lepidus. The latter, in the end, cut a
