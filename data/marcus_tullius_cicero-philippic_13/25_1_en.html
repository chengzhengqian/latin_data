a consul-elect. Two consuls are waging war against
you, and the propraetor Caesar with them. All Italy is in
arms against you. Do you call your following a ‘party’
rather than a defection from the Roman people? Is it preferable
for us to avenge Trebonius’ death instead of
Caesar’s? We avenged Trebonius’ death sufficiently by declaring
Dolabella a public enemy; Caesar’s is most easily
vindicated<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL507_277_69" id="target_note_LCL507_277_69"><sup>69</sup></a> with silent oblivion. But notice what he is up
to. Holding that Caesar’s death calls for vengeance, he proposes
death not only for those who did the deed but also
for any whom it did not displease.</p>

He is lucky enough to have deceived you with

deceived Caesar.”</p>
<p>He goes on flinging insults at me as though his previous
efforts in that line had been a brilliant success; but I shall
hand him down to everlasting memory, branded with the
marks of insults which are true to the letter. So I am a ‘gladiator-trainer’?
Yes, and I know my job. I want to see the
bad ones killed off and the good ones win. ‘Whichever go
down,’ he writes, ‘will be a windfall’ for us. A fine windfall,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">41</span><span class="br"></span>
when if <span class="italic">you</span> win—may the gods avert the omen!—happy

torture. He says that Hirtius and Caesar have been ‘deceived’
by me ‘with the same compliments.’ What compliment,
