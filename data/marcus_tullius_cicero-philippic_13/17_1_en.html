would never have set fire to the senate-house,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL507_261_44" id="target_note_LCL507_261_44"><sup>44</sup></a> if he had
not had high regard for the senate. Convicted of that
crime, he returned by force of arms to the city from which
he had been expelled by force of law. That, however, he has
in common with many others of the same stamp as himself.
But in the case of this Plancus, the old saying “he can’t die
unless his legs are broken”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL507_261_45" id="target_note_LCL507_261_45"><sup>45</sup></a> has proved false: they <span class="italic">were</span>
broken, and still he is alive. But let this, like many other
things, go down to Aquila’s credit.</p>

<p>[13] Decius too is there,
a scion, I believe, of the well-known Mures Decii,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL507_261_46" id="target_note_LCL507_261_46"><sup>46</sup></a> which
accounts for his gnawing up Caesar’s gifts. The memory of
the Decii has been revived after a long interval through
this noble fellow. And how can I pass over Saxa Decidius,

of the plebs, though we had never seen him as a citizen?
One of the two Sasernae is there, but they are all so much<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">28</span><span class="br"></span>
of a muchness that I get their first names muddled. Nor
must we leave out Brotherly’s brother, Sextus Titius(?),<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL507_261_48" id="target_note_LCL507_261_48"><sup>48</sup></a> a
quaestor; if I say nothing about this illustrious young man,
it may be thought I was jealous of Antonius. There is also
a certain Asinius, a self-appointed senator, enrolled on
his own authority. He saw the senate-house open after
Caesar’s death. He changed his boots,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL507_261_49" id="target_note_LCL507_261_49"><sup>49</sup></a> and all of a sudden
