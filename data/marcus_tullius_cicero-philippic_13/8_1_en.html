gods that Fortune has chosen to allow the son of Gnaeus
Pompeius to recover his father’s dignity and possessions

<p>[6] There is another point, Members of the Senate,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">13</span><span class="br"></span>
which I think should not be passed over in silence. Our illustrious
envoys, Lucius Paullus, Quintus Thermus, and
Gaius Fannius, whose unflagging, steadfast patriotism you
know well, report that they stopped along the way at Massilia<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL507_243_21" id="target_note_LCL507_243_21"><sup>21</sup></a>
in order to meet with Pompeius and found him perfectly
ready to go to Mutina with his forces, if he were not

lie in their power, even things dishonorable and destructive,
even things quite impermissible? What can be more
dishonorable and ugly and unseemly than to lead an army
against the senate and one’s fellow countrymen and one’s
native land? And what is more blameworthy than to do the
impermissible? Now to no one is it permitted to lead an
army against his native land, if indeed by “permitted” we
mean what is allowed by laws and by the customs and institutions
of our ancestors. It is not permissible for a man to
do everything he is able to do; and even if no opposition is
put in his way, it does not follow that he is allowed. To you,
