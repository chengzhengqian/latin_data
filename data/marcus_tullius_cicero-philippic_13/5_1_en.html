more dear to me than my own life. For when Lepidus by<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">8</span><span class="br"></span>
means of the weight of his prestige induced young Magnus
Pompeius, the illustrious son of so eminent a father, to accept
peace and so delivered the Republic without a sword
drawn from a very grave threat of civil war, I then conceived
myself under more than my individual share of obligation
for the benefit received from him.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL507_237_10" id="target_note_LCL507_237_10"><sup>10</sup></a> Accordingly I
proposed for Lepidus the most ample honors I could, in

No fellow countryman has been harmed by him; many

make peace of the sort he has recently made, whereby the
Republic will see and take into her arms the son of Gnaeus
Pompeius, and not him alone: she will deem that along
