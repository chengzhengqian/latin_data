<p>“You have deprived the Julian Luperci of their revenues.”</p>
<p>Does he dare make mention of the Luperci?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL507_267_57" id="target_note_LCL507_267_57"><sup>57</sup></a> Does he
not shudder at the memory of that day when soaked in
wine, smeared with unguents, and naked he dared to urge
a groaning Roman people into slavery?</p>
<p>“You have abolished by a senatorial decree colonies of
veterans legally established.”</p>
<p>Have we abolished them, or have we not on the contrary
legalized them by a bill passed in the Centuriate
Assembly?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL507_267_58" id="target_note_LCL507_267_58"><sup>58</sup></a> You had best consider whether <span class="italic">you</span> have not

<p>“You are promising to restore to the Massilians what<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">32</span><span class="br"></span>
was taken away from them by the right of war.”</p>
<p>I will not debate about ‘the right of war’ (that would be
more easy than needful), but please observe, Members of
the Senate, what a born enemy Antonius is to this Republic
since he so intensely hates a community that he knows has
always been a most devoted friend to this Republic!</p>

<p>[16] “You keep maintaining that no Pompeian now living
is bound by the Hirtian law.”</p>
<p>Who, I ask you, talks about the Hirtian law<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL507_267_60" id="target_note_LCL507_267_60"><sup>60</sup></a> any more?
I daresay its sponsor disapproves of it no less than do those
against whom it was passed. In my opinion, it is not right to
call it a law at all; and supposing it to be a law, we ought not
to think of it as Hirtius’ law.</p>
