from Antonius. The Ansers,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL507_241_16" id="target_note_LCL507_241_16"><sup>16</sup></a> who are now attacking
Mutina and blockading Decimus Brutus, will be ousted
from the Falernian property. There are quite a few others,
perhaps, but they escape my memory. I also declare that
those who are not in the number of our enemies will restore
Pompeius’ possessions to his son at the price they
paid for them. It was inconsiderate enough, not to say audacious,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">12</span><span class="br"></span>
to touch any one of those items; yet who will have
the effrontery to hold on to such after the restoration of
its illustrious owner? There is a former slave of Gnaeus
Pompeius and freedman of Caesar’s<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL507_241_17" id="target_note_LCL507_241_17"><sup>17</sup></a> who has taken possession
of lands in Lucania, coiled round his master’s property
like a dragon around a treasure: will he not give it
back? And that two hundred million,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL507_241_18" id="target_note_LCL507_241_18"><sup>18</sup></a> which you have
promised the young man, Members of the Senate, will be
so disposed that Gnaeus Pompeius’ son will be seen to
have been established by you in his own patrimony.
This much the senate will do. The Roman people will
attend to the rest in the case of the most illustrious family it
has ever seen:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL507_241_19" id="target_note_LCL507_241_19"><sup>19</sup></a> first and foremost, his father’s place in the
College of Augurs, into which I shall co-opt him by my
nomination, thus returning to the son what I received from
the father.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL507_241_20" id="target_note_LCL507_241_20"><sup>20</sup></a> So which of these two will Jupiter Best and
Greatest, of whom we augurs have been constituted interpreters
and intermediaries, which of them will the Roman
people more willingly ratify as augur, Pompeius or Antonius?
For my part, I think it is by the will of the immortal
