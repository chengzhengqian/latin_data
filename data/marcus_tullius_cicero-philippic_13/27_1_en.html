a new word which does not exist at all in the Latin

<p>“—nor yet to betray Plancus, the partner of my counsels.”<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">44</span><span class="br"></span></p>
<p>Plancus your ‘partner’? Plancus, whose unforgettable,
superhuman manliness is a beacon of hope to the Republic—unless,
perhaps, you think he is coming to help you
with his most brave legions and his host of Gallic horse and
foot!—and is one who will take a leading role in this war,
unless you pay your penalty to the Republic before he arrives.
Though the help that comes first is of greater use to
the Republic, nonetheless, the help that comes last earns
more gratitude.</p>

<p>[20] But now he takes stock and in conclusion begins to<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">45</span><span class="br"></span>
philosophize:</p>
<p>“If the immortal gods help me as I go my way in rectitude
of purpose, which I trust they will, I shall live in good
cheer. But if a different fate awaits me, I joyfully anticipate
what you will suffer. For if the Pompeians are so insolent in
defeat, what they will be like in victory you will find out
rather than I.”</p>
<p>‘Joyfully anticipate’ you may! You are not at war with
Pompeians but with the entire Republic. All gods and
men, the highest, the lowest and those in between, citizens
and foreigners, men and women, free men and slaves, all
hate you. This was proved to us the other day by a false report,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL507_281_76" id="target_note_LCL507_281_76"><sup>76</sup></a>
and any day now will be proved by a true one. If you
reflect on this quietly, you will die with an easier mind and
better consolation.</p>
<p>“Finally, the sum of my judgment is to this effect: I can<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">46</span><span class="br"></span>
bear the injuries done to me by my friends, if they on their
side should be willing to forget that they have done them,
