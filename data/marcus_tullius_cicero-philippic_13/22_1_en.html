<p>Oh, yes indeed, we hoodwinked them, we took them
in! The Martian Legion and the Fourth were ignorant of
what was going on; the veterans did not know! They were
not supporting the authority of the senate and the liberty
of the people, they were out to avenge Caesar’s death,
which they all considered to have been fate-ordained. As

flourishing!</p>

<p>But hear the heaviest charge of all:</p>
<p>“To sum up, what have you not approved or done
which, if he came back to life, would not be done by—”</p>
<p>By whom? No doubt he will produce some exemplary
villain!</p>
<p>“—Gnaeus Pompeius himself—”</p>
<p>We are disgraced indeed if we have made Gnaeus
Pompeius our model!</p>
<p>“—or his son, if he but had the power?”</p>

days’ time he will be moving into his father’s house and
suburban estate.</p>
<p>“Finally, you say peace cannot be made, unless I let
Brutus go or assist him with grain.”</p>
<p>Others issue that ultimatum, but for my part, I do not
think this community will ever have peace with you, even if
you perform those acts.</p>
<p>“Well, does this policy please veterans in your army
who as yet are still quite free to choose,—”</p>
<p>Nothing I have seen could be so free as their choice to
start attacking a commander for whom they have shown
the extent of their hatred with such zeal and unanimity.</p>
