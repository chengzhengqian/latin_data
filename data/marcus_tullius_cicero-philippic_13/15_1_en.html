<p>Yes, he ‘owes,’ and splendidly he pays. If Caesar was
‘the father of the fatherland,’ as you call him<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL507_257_32" id="target_note_LCL507_257_32"><sup>32</sup></a>—never
mind what I think—is not this young man more truly a
<span class="italic">father</span> to whom we assuredly owe our lives which he

<p>You dare call ‘viper’ the man who found the antidote to
your venoms? Yes, you latter-day Hannibal (or any cleverer
general, if there was one), you are besieging him in such a
way that you are besieging yourself, nor can you extricate
yourself from your present situation even if you wish. If
you pull back, they will all be after you from every side; if
you stay put, you will be stuck in a trap. Doubtless you
rightly call ‘viper’ the contriver of the destruction you see
staring you in the face.</p>
<p>“—to give maximum power to Cassius and Brutus.”</p>
<p>You would think he was talking about Censorinus or<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">26</span><span class="br"></span>
Ventidius or even the Antonii themselves. Why should
Hirtius and Caesar begrudge power to men who are not
