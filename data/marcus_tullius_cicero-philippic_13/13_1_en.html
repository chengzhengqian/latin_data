sent by the consul Hirtius. While I read it aloud and briefly
take issue with it sentence by sentence, may I request you,
Members of the Senate, to give me your close attention, as
you have done so far?</p>
<p>“Antonius to Hirtius and Caesar.”</p>
<p>He neither calls himself imperator, nor Hirtius consul,
nor Caesar propraetor. Smart enough, that. Rather than
give them their proper titles, he has chosen to drop one
that is not rightfully his.</p>
<p>“When I learned of Gaius Trebonius’ death, my joy was
no greater than my distress.”</p>
<p>Mark well what he says ‘gave him joy’ and what ‘gave
him distress.’ It will be the easier for you to deliberate
about peace.</p>
<p>“It is a matter for gladness that a criminal has paid his
penalty to the ashes and bones of an illustrious man and
that, before a year has elapsed, the will of the gods has
made itself manifest since punishment for an act of parricide
has already been inflicted or is impending.”</p>
<p>Spartacus! What better name to call you by? Your
abominable crimes make Catiline look tolerable by contrast
in retrospect. Did you dare to write that ‘it is a matter
for gladness that Trebonius has paid his penalty’? That
‘Trebonius was a criminal’? What was his crime, except to
draw you away from the destruction you deserved on the
Ides of March? Well, this gladdens your heart: let us see<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">23</span><span class="br"></span>
what you find hard to bear.</p>
<p>“But it is a matter for lamentation that Dolabella has
been declared by the senate an enemy of the Roman people
on the ground that he put an assassin to death, and lamentable
that the son of a buffoon should seem dearer to
the Roman people than Gaius Caesar, the father of the
fatherland.”</p>
