pray, have I bestowed on Hirtius up till now? As for
Caesar, he deserves more and greater. But do you dare to
say that the elder Caesar was deceived by me? You, yes,

<p>Now observe the high seriousness and resolution of a
great and famous man:</p>
<p>“As for me, I am determined to put up with insult neither<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">42</span><span class="br"></span>
