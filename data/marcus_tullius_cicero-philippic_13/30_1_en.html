land’s dignity and freedom. That leaves no third-best, only
the worst of all, to plumb the lowest depth of dishonor out

<p>In these circumstances, concerning the message and<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">50</span><span class="br"></span>
letter of the illustrious Marcus Lepidus, I agree with Servilius,
and I further propose as follows:</p>
<p>“That Magnus Pompeius, son of Gnaeus, acted worthily
of the spirit and patriotic zeal of his father and ancestors
and of his own former prowess, diligence, and goodwill
in that he promised his services and those of his
companions to the senate and people of Rome; and that his
action is welcome and pleasing to the senate and people of
Rome and will redound to his honor and dignity.”</p>
<p>This can either be conjoined with the senatorial decree
now under discussion or separated and drafted independently,
so that Pompeius may be seen to have been commended
by a decree of the senate special to himself.</p>
