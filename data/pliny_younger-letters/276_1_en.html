deep-rooted dislike of personal gain; success never went to his head, and, in all the various posts he held; he preserved intact his reputation for humanity while applying the same strength of purpose to all his duties, as he now shows in his present retirement. He did indeed once (to his greater glory) return temporarily to active life when he was chosen by our friend Corellius to assist him in the purchase and distribution of land made possible through the generosity of the Emperor Nerva:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL055_557_1" id="target_note_LCL055_557_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and there could be no higher honour than to be the special choice of so great a man from such a wide field for selection.</p>
<p>You can also be assured of Pollioâ€™s respect and loyalty for his friends by the dying wishes of many people, among them Annius Bassus whose merit is well known, and whose memory Pollio preserves and perpetuates in the grateful tribute of a published biography; for he cultivates literature as he does every honest pursuit. Such splendid conduct deserves praise for its very rarity, seeing that the majority of people remember their dead friends only to complain about them. This, then, is the man who so much desires your friendship, so that you should, if you will trust me, welcome him with open arms, or rather summon him to your side with affection as though returning a favour. For, according to the code of friendship, the one who takes the initiative puts the other in his debt and owes no more until he is repaid.</p>
