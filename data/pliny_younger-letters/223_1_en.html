Lustricius Bruttianus had detected his colleague, Montanius Atticinus, in a number of criminal offences and had sent a report to the Emperor. Atticinus then added to his misdeeds by bringing a case against the man he had deceived. The trial came on, and I acted as assessor.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL055_451_1" id="target_note_LCL055_451_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Each side conducted his own case, dealing with the main items one by one, which is the quickest way at arriving at the truth.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL055_451_2" id="target_note_LCL055_451_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Bruttianus produced his will, which he said was written in the hand of Atticinus, as a proof both of the confidence he had placed in their relationship and of the necessity which constrained him to complain about a man who had been so dear to him. He cited a number of shocking charges, all clearly proved; being unable to refute them, Atticinus retorted with counter-charges, but merely proved himself a rogue in his defence and a scoundrel by his accusations. He had bribed a slave belonging to Bruttianusâ€™s secretary, had intercepted certain papers and falsified some of them, and, worst of all, had directed a charge intended for himself against his friend.</p>
<p>The Emperor dealt with him admirably, asking for an immediate verdict not on Bruttianus but on Atticinus, who was found guilty and banished to an island. Bruttianus received a well-deserved tribute to his honesty, and has also won a reputation for determination, for he finished his defence as quickly as he could and then pressed his charges vigorously; thus proving his spirit as well as his honour and good faith.</p>
