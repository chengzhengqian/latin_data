How much longer will you be your own master, stay up when you feel inclined, and sleep as long as you like? How long will your shoes go unworn and your toga stay on holiday, while all your day is your own?

Come and pay your respects to us for a while so as to be better pleased to receive other peoples’, and rub shoulders in the crowd here in order to appreciate your solitude the more.</p>
<p>But it is silly of me to risk discouraging the very person I am trying to persuade; my arguments may well induce you to sink deeper and deeper into retirement, though I am not asking you to give it up, only to interrupt it. If I were giving you a dinner, I should alternate the sweet dishes with piquant savouries to stimulate your palate when dulled and cloyed by too much sweetness; and so I am asking you now to season your pleasant way of living with something a little more stimulating.</p>
