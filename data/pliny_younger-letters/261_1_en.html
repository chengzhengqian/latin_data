She replied that it was. Had she lent Senecio her husband’s diaries? “Yes.” Did her mother know of this? “No.” Not a word in fact did she utter through fear of danger. Moreover, although the Senate was driven through fear of the times to order the destruction of the books in question, she managed to save them when her possessions were confiscated, and took them with her into the exile they had caused.</p>
<p>At the same time she has such friendliness and charm, the rare gift, in fact, of being able to inspire affection as well as respect. Will there be anyone now whom we can hold up as a model to our wives, from whose courage even our own sex can take example, and whom we can admire as much as the heroines of history while she is still in our midst? To me it seems as though her whole house is shaken to its very foundations and is tottering to its fall, even though she may leave descendants; for how can their deeds and merits be sufficient to assure that the last of her line has not perished in her?</p>
<p>A further and more personal pain and grief for me is my feeling that I am losing her mother<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL055_527_2" id="target_note_LCL055_527_2"><sup>2</sup></a> again—to whom I can pay no higher tribute than by calling her the famous mother of a great woman. The mother was restored to us in her daughter, but soon will be taken away with her, leaving me the pain of a re-opened wound to bear as well as this fresh blow. </p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL055_527_1"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL055_527_1" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">1</sup>See Index, Helvidius Priscus (ii) and Herennius Senecio.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL055_527_1').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL055_527_2"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL055_527_2" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">2</sup>The younger Arria.
