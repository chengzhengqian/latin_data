Macedo was brought back to life with difficulty, but only for a few days; at least he died with the satisfaction of having revenged himself, for he lived to see the same punishment meted out as for murder.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL055_215_1" id="target_note_LCL055_215_1"><sup>1</sup></a> There you see the dangers, outrages and insults to which we are exposed. No master can feel safe because he is kind and considerate; for it is their brutality, not their reasoning capacity, which leads slaves to murder masters.</p>
<p>But let us change the subject. What news is there? None, or I would give you it, for I still have some paper, and today’s holiday gives me time to continue. I will only put in a detail in connexion with Macedo which I have fortunately just remembered. He was in one of the public baths in Rome when a remarkable incident occurred which events have proved to be an omen. One of Macedo’s slaves lightly touched a Roman knight to ask him to let them pass; the man turned round and struck not the slave who had touched him, but Macedo himself such a violent slap that he nearly knocked him down. So the baths have been the scene successively of insult to Macedo and then of his death.</p>
