adjournment to get you off for a few days, or one day at least. It isn’t easy but I will try, “for a dream comes from Zeus.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL055_55_1" id="target_note_LCL055_55_1"><sup>1</sup></a> But it makes a difference whether your dreams usually come true or not, for to judge by a dream of my own, the one which has frightened you might well foretell that you will be successful. I had undertaken to act on behalf of Junius Pastor when I dreamed that my mother-in-law came and begged me on her knees to give up the case. I was very young at the time and I was about to plead in the Centumviral Court<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL055_55_2" id="target_note_LCL055_55_2"><sup>2</sup></a> against men of great political influence, some of them also friends of the Emperor; <a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL055_55_3a" id="target_note_LCL055_55_3a"><sup>3</sup></a> any one of these considerations could have shaken my resolve after such a depressing dream, but I carried on, believing that “The best and only omen is to fight for your country”.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL055_55_4" id="target_note_LCL055_55_4"><sup>4</sup></a> (For my pledged word was as sacred to me as my country or as anything dearer than that.) I won my case, and it was that speech which drew attention to me and set me on the threshold of a successful career.</p>
<p>See then if you can follow my example, and give a happy interpretation to your dream; but if you still think there is more safety in the warning given by all cautious folk, “when in doubt do nothing,” you can write and tell me. I will find some way out and deal with the case so that you can take it up when you wish. I admit that your position is different from mine; adjournments are never granted in the Centumviral Court, but in your case it is possible though not easy.</p>
