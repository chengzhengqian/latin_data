<p><span class="sc">You</span> have given me many reasons, as well as every official explanation, for your application for leave of absence, though I should have been satisfied with the mere expression of your wishes. I do not doubt that you will return as soon as possible to your exacting official duties.</p>
<p>You have my permission to set up my statue in the place you have chosen for it; I am generally very reluctant to accept honours of this kind, but I do not wish it to seem that I have put any check on your loyal feelings towards me.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_181_1" id="target_note_LCL059_181_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<span class="label"><span class="sc">Pliny to the Emperor Trajan</span></span>
<p><span class="sc">Words</span> cannot express my gratitude, Sir, for your letter telling me that you have given my therapist Arpocras the additional grant of Alexandrian citizenship, although you had intended to follow the rule of your predecessors and grant it only in special cases. I now inform you that his district is Memphis. I pray you then, gracious Emperor, to send me your promised letter to Pompeius Planta, the prefect of Egypt.</p>
<p>I hope to meet you, Sir, to enjoy the sooner the pleasure of your return<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_181_2" id="target_note_LCL059_181_2"><sup>2</sup></a> which is eagerly awaited here; I beg your permission to join you as far out from Rome as I can go.</p>
