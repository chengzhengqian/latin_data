Charm and persuasion require fullness of treatment and time for delivery, and a speaker who leaves his sting in the minds of his hearers does not stop at pricking them, but drives his point in. And again, another comic poet<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL055_65_2" id="target_note_LCL055_65_2"><sup>2</sup></a> said of Pericles that “he flashed lightning, thundered and confounded Greece.” It is no curtailed and restricted style but a grand oratory, spacious and sublime, which can thunder, lighten, and throw a world into tumult and confusion.</p>
<p>“All the same, the mean is best.” No one denies it, but to fall short through over-compression is to miss the mean just as much as to be diffuse and go beyond it. The criticism “spiritless and feeble” is heard as often as “excessive and redundant,” when one speaker does not cover his ground and another goes outside it. Both fail, through weakness or vitality, but the latter is at least the fault of a more powerful talent, if a less polished one. In saying this I do not mean to praise Homer’s Thersites, “unbridled of tongue,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL055_65_3" id="target_note_LCL055_65_3"><sup>3</sup></a> but Odysseus with his “words like flakes of winter snow”;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL055_65_4" id="target_note_LCL055_65_4"><sup>4</sup></a> and I can also very much admire Menelaus who spoke “at no great length but very clearly.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL055_65_5" id="target_note_LCL055_65_5"><sup>5</sup></a> But, if I were given my choice, I prefer the speech like the winter snows, one which is fluent and vigorous, but also expansive, which is in fact divinely inspired.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL055_65_6" id="target_note_LCL055_65_6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
