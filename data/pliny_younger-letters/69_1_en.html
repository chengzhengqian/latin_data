<p>At the far end of the terrace, the arcade and the garden is a suite of rooms [<span class="sc">x</span>] which are really and truly my favourites, for I had them built myself. Here is a sun-parlour facing the terrace on one side, the sea on the other, and the sun on both. There is also a bedroom which has folding doors opening on to the arcade and a window looking out on the sea. Opposite the intervening wall is a beautifully designed alcove which can be thrown into the room by folding back its glass doors and curtains, or cut off from it if they are closed: it is large enough to hold a couch and two arm-chairs, and has the sea at its foot, the neighbouring villas behind, and the woods beyond, views which can be seen separately from its many windows or blended into one. Next to it is a bedroom for use at night which neither the voices of my young slaves, the sea’s murmur, nor the noise of a storm can penetrate, any more than the lightning’s flash and light of day unless the shutters are open. This profound peace and seclusion are due to the dividing passage which runs between the room and the garden so that any noise is lost in the intervening space. A tiny furnace-room is built on here, and by a narrow outlet retains or circulates the heat underneath as required. Then there is an ante-room and a second bedroom, built out to face the sun and catch its rays the moment it rises, and retain them until after midday, though by then at an angle. When I retire to this suite I feel as if I have left my house altogether and much enjoy the sensation: especially during the Saturnalia<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL055_141_1" id="target_note_LCL055_141_1"><sup>1</sup></a> when the rest of the roof resounds with festive </p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL055_141_1"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL055_141_1" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">1</sup>The week starting 17 December.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL055_141_1').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
