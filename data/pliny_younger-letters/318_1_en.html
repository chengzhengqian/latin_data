<section class="div1 language" lang="en"><header><hgroup><h1>Book VIII</h1></hgroup></header><section class="div2"><p class="noindent">cities, for nothing can serve a city like ordered rule and nothing is so precious as freedom; nor can anything equal the disgrace should order be overthrown and freedom give place to servitude. You are moreover your own rival; you bring with you the excellent reputation you won during your quaestorship in Bithynia, you bring the Emperor’s recognition and your experience as tribune, praetor, and holder of your present office, given you as a reward for your services. You must then make every effort not to let it appear that you were a better, kinder, and more experienced administrator in a remote province than in one nearer Rome, and when dealing with servile rather than free men, when you were elected by lot instead of being the Emperor’s choice, and at a time when you were raw and unknown before being tested and proved by experience. And, besides, as you have often heard and read, it is far more shameful to lose a reputation than not to win one.</p>
<p>Please believe, as I said at the start, that this letter was intended not to tell, but to remind you of your duties—though I know I am really telling you as well, as I am not afraid of letting my affection carry me too far; there is no danger of excess where there ought to be no limits.</p>
