He is also the close friend of Cornelius Tacitus, and you know the sort of man Tacitus is. So, if you think highly of us both, you should feel the same about Rufus, since there is no stronger bond in friendship than similarity of character. He has several children, for here too he has done his duty as a good citizen, and has chosen to enjoy the blessing of a fruitful marriage at a time when the advantages of remaining childless make most people feel a single child a burden. Such advantages he has scorned, and has in fact sought the title of grandfather: and a grandfather he is, thanks to his son-in-law Saturius Firmus, whom you will appreciate as much as I do when you know him as well.</p>
<p>All this is to show you what a large and numerous family you can oblige by a single service, which I am led to seek through my own desires and also by my feeling of good omen for the future. I am anxious for you to hold the consulship next year, and prophesy that you will do so, for both your own merits and the Emperor’s discernment surely point that way.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL055_287_1" id="target_note_LCL055_287_1"><sup>1</sup></a> It happens that this will be the year when Asinius Bassus, Rufus’s eldest son, will be quaestor, and this young man is even better than his father, though I hesitate to say what the father wants me to think and say but the son is too modest to allow. It is difficult for you to take my word (though you always trust me) for the exceptional industry and honesty, learning and ability, application and memory of a man you have not met. but you will discover all when you know him. I only wish our times were rich </p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL055_287_1"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL055_287_1" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">1</sup>Minicius Fundanus was not in fact consul till 107.
