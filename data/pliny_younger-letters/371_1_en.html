<p>I <span class="sc">am</span> well aware, Sir, that no higher tribute can be paid to my reputation than some mark of favour from so excellent a ruler as yourself. I pray you, therefore, to add to the honours to which I have been raised by your kindness by granting me a priesthood, either that of augur<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_185_1" id="target_note_LCL059_185_1"><sup>1</sup></a> or member of the septemvirate as there is a vacancy in both orders. By virtue of my priesthood I could then add official prayers on your behalf to those I already offer in private as a loyal citizen.</p>
