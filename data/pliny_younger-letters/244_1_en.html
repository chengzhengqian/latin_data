Afterwards, when I returned to Rome, I read them to my friends, who were appreciative. Then I made attempts in various other metres whenever I had time, especially when travelling. Finally I decided to do as many authors have done and complete a separate volume of hendecasyllables; and I have never regretted this. My verses are read and copied, they are even sung, and set to the cithara or lyre by Greeks who have learned Latin out of liking for my little book. But I must not boast (though poets are allowed to talk wildly!), even if it is not my own opinion I am quoting but other people’s—which pleases me whether right or wrong. I only pray that posterity will be right or wrong in the same way.</p>
