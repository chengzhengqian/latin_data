He was describing how at the last Races he had sat next to a Roman knight who engaged him in conversation on several learned subjects and then asked if he came from Italy or the provinces. “You know me,” said Tacitus, “from your reading.” At which the man said, “Then are you Tacitus or Pliny?” I can’t tell you how delighted I am to have our names assigned to literature as if they belonged there and not to individuals, and to learn that we are both known by our writing to people who would otherwise not have heard of us.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_125_1" id="target_note_LCL059_125_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>A similar thing happened to me a day or two ago. I had a distinguished neighbour at dinner, Fadius Rufinus, and on his other side was someone from his native town who had come to Rome on his first visit that same day. Pointing to me, Rufinus said to him, “Do you see my friend here?” Then he spoke at length about my work, and the man exclaimed, “It must be Pliny!”</p>
<p>I confess I feel well rewarded for my labours. If Demosthenes had the right to be pleased when the old woman of Attica recognized him with the words “That’s Demosthenes!”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_125_2" id="target_note_LCL059_125_2"><sup>2</sup></a> I may surely be glad when my name is well known. In fact I <span class="italic">am</span> glad and admit it. For I’m not afraid of appearing too boastful when I have other people’s opinions to quote and not only my own, especially when talking to you: for you are never envious of anyone’s reputation and are always furthering mine.</p>
