<p>There is a sizeable lake<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_219_1" id="target_note_LCL059_219_1"><sup>1</sup></a> not far from Nicomedia, across which marble, farm produce, wood, and timber for building are easily and cheaply brought by boat as far as the main road; after which everything has to be taken on to the sea by cart, with great difficulty and increased expense. 〈To connect the lake with the sea<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_219_2" id="target_note_LCL059_219_2"><sup>2</sup></a>〉 would require a great deal of labour, but there is no lack of it. There are plenty of people in the countryside, and many more in the town, and it seems certain that they will all gladly help with a scheme which will benefit them all.</p>
<p>It remains for you to send an engineer or an architect, if you think fit, to make an accurate survey and determine whether the lake is above sea-level. The local experts say that it is forty cubits<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_219_3" id="target_note_LCL059_219_3"><sup>3</sup></a> above. I have looked at the site myself and find there is a canal dug by one of the former kings of Bithynia, though whether this was intended to drain the surrounding fields or to connect the lake with the river I am not sure; it was left unfinished, and again I cannot say if this was because the king died suddenly or despaired of finishing the work. This, however, only fires me with enthusiasm to see you accomplish what kings could only attempt: you will forgive my ambition for your greater glory.</p>

<p>I <span class="sc">may</span> perhaps be tempted to think of connecting this lake of yours with the sea, but there must first
