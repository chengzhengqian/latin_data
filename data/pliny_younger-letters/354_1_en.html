<p>I can imagine how sadly you will lament this ending and how eloquently you will enrich and adorn this tale—though there is no need for you to add any fictitious details; it will be enough if the truth is told in full.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_151_1" id="target_note_LCL059_151_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<h3>XXXIV</h3>

<p><span class="sc">Please</span> settle my doubts. I am told that I read badly—I mean when I read verse, for I can manage speeches, though this seems to make my verse reading all the worse. So, as I am planning to give an informal reading to my personal friends, I am thinking of making use of one of my freedmen. This is certainly treating them informally, as the man I have chosen is not really a good reader, but I think he will do better than I can as long as he is not nervous. (He is in fact as inexperienced a reader as I am a poet.) Now, I don’t know what I am to do myself while he is reading, whether I am to sit still and silent like a mere spectator, or do as some people and accompany his words with low voice, eye, and gesture. But I don’t believe I am any better at mime than at reading aloud. Once more, then, settle my doubts and give me a straight answer whether it would be better to read myself, however badly, than to do or leave undone what I have just said.</p>
