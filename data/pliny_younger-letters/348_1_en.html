<p><span class="sc">Your</span> letters have reached me after a long delay, three in fact at once, all beautifully expressed, warmly affectionate, and such as I ought to have from you, especially when I have been waiting for them. In one you entrust me with the very welcome commission of forwarding your letter to the august lady Plotina:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_139_1" id="target_note_LCL059_139_1"><sup>1</sup></a> it shall be done.

<p>The second letter tells me you are setting down or dictating your impressions of myself. Thank you—I would thank you more if you had been willing for me to read the actual pages as they are finished; as you read my work, in common justice I should read yours, even when someone else is the subject. At the end you promise that, once you have some definite news of my arrangements,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_139_3" id="target_note_LCL059_139_3"><sup>3</sup></a> you will escape from your domestic affairs and take refuge here with me, where I am already forging you fetters which you will never manage to break.</p>
<p>Your third letter mentions that you have received my speech on behalf of Clarius and thought it seemed fuller than when you heard me deliver it. It <span class="italic">is</span> fuller,
