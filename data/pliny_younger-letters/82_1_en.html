A guardian and mentor must be found.</p>
<p>I think then that I cannot do better than to draw your attention to Julius Genitor. The affection I have for him has not blinded my judgement, as it is in fact based on it. He is a man of serious character, quite free from faults: indeed a little too blunt and austere for the licence of our times.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL055_167_1" id="target_note_LCL055_167_1"><sup>1</sup></a> On the subject of his eloquence you have many witnesses you may trust, for ability in speaking is obvious and readily recognized whenever it is displayed; whereas there are many deep secrets and hidden places in a man’s personal life. You may rest assured that I answer for these on Genitor’s behalf. Your son will hear nothing from him but what will benefit him. will learn nothing that would have been better left unknown. Genitor will remind him as often as we do of his obligations to his forbears and the great names he must carry on. So with the gods’ good will you may entrust him to a teacher from whom he will learn right principles of conduct before he studies eloquence—for without principles this cannot be properly learned at all.</p>
