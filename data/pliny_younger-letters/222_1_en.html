I don’t know whether you know the man, but you certainly ought to. He is remarkable for his moral integrity, his intellectual refinement, and his versatility as an author. His iambic mimes are subtle, witty and altogether delightful, in the best style for their type—for there is no type which cannot command the best style if this achieves perfection. He has also written comedies in imitation of Menander and his contemporaries which can be classed with those of Plautus and Terence. This was his first appearance in Old Comedy, though it did not seem like a first attempt. He lacked neither vigour, grandeur, nor subtlety of style, pungency, charm, nor humour; he praised virtue and attacked vice, introduced fictitious names when suitable and made appropriate use of real ones. Only in my own case did his excess of kind feeling lead him to exaggerate, but, after all, poets are not obliged to keep to the truth.</p>
<p>In fact I will get the book out of him and send it to you to read, or rather to learn by heart, for I am quite sure that once you have laid hands on it you will never be able to put it down.</p>
