<p>Here I am up against an argument on the other side, and you will retort that Demosthenes is at fault in the same way as you say I am. But you must see how much greater he is than Aeschines, his critic, and greater in these very passages; he can show vigour elsewhere, but here he stands out as sublime. Besides, was Aeschines himself free from the faults he finds in Demosthenes? “For it is essential, men of Athens, that the orator and the law should speak the same language; but when the law says one thing, and the orator another . . .” Elsewhere he says that “Then he displays himself as especially concerned with the decree,” and again, “But keep watch and lie in ambush as you listen to him, so that you drive him to keep within the limits of the charge of illegality,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_135_2" id="target_note_LCL059_135_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and he is so pleased with this metaphor that he repeats it: “But as in the race track, drive him to keep to the relevant course.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_135_3" id="target_note_LCL059_135_3"><sup>3</sup></a> Nor<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_135_4" id="target_note_LCL059_135_4"><sup>4</sup></a> is his style any more controlled and restrained in this example: “But you reopen old wounds, and are more concerned with today’s speeches than with the welfare of the State”; and he aims high when he asks: “Will you not dismiss this man as a public menace to Greece? Or arrest him as a pirate who infests politics by cruising around the State in his brig of words, and then bring him to justice?”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_135_5" id="target_note_LCL059_135_5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
