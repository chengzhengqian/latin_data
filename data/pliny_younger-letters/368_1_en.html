<section class="div1 language" lang="en"><header><hgroup><h1>Book X</h1></hgroup></header><section class="div2"><p class="noindent">I could set up a temple<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_179_1" id="target_note_LCL059_179_1"><sup>1</sup></a> at my own expense, and they had honoured my proposal by leaving the choice of a site to me. But first my own ill-health, then your father’s illness, and subsequently the responsibilities of the post you have both assigned me,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_179_2" id="target_note_LCL059_179_2"><sup>2</sup></a> have caused delays, so that this seems the first convenient opportunity for me to go there in person. My month on duty finishes at the end of August, and there are a great many public holidays in September.</p>
<p>I pray you then first to permit me to add your statue to the others which will adorn the temple I propose to build, then to grant me leave of absence so that it can be built as soon as possible. But I should fail in sincerity if I concealed from your kindness the fact that my personal affairs will incidentally benefit very much. The farms I own in the district bring in more than 400,000 sesterces, and I cannot postpone letting them, especially as the new tenants should be there to see to the pruning of the vines, and this must be done soon. Moreover, the series of bad harvests we have had are forcing me to consider reducing rents, and I cannot calculate these unless I am on the spot.</p>
<p>If then, Sir, you will grant me thirty days’ leave of absence on both accounts, I shall be indebted to your generosity both for the speedy accomplishment of my act of loyalty and the setting in order of my private affairs. I cannot manage with less than a month, as the town and farms I am talking about are more than 150 miles from Rome.</p>
