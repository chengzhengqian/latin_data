<span class="label"><span class="sc">To Octavius Rufus</span></span>
<p><span class="sc">See</span> what a pinnacle you have set me on, giving me the same power and majesty as Homer gives to Jupiter Best and Highest: “And part the Father granted him, but part denied.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL055_19_1" id="target_note_LCL055_19_1"><sup>1</sup></a> You see I can use the same mixture of assent and denial in answer to your plea. I can very properly agree, especially as you ask me, not to act for the Baetici against a single individual; but it would hardly be consistent with the unfailing sense of duty you admire in me to act <span class="italic">against</span> them, when I have formed a close connexion with their province through so many different services rendered and all the risks I have run on their behalf at various times.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL055_19_2" id="target_note_LCL055_19_2"><sup>2</sup></a> I shall therefore have to steer a middle course, and choose from the alternatives you offer something which will satisfy your good judgement as well as your inclinations. It is not your present wishes which I have to consider so much as your high standards for what will have your permanent approval.</p>
<p>I hope to be in Rome round the middle of October when I can explain my position to Gallus in person, with you to support me; but meanwhile you may assure him of my intentions, “he spoke and bowed his dark brows in assent.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL055_19_3" id="target_note_LCL055_19_3"><sup>3</sup></a> I feel like addressing you in Homeric verses whenever I can, as long as you will not let me quote your own<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL055_19_4" id="target_note_LCL055_19_4"><sup>4</sup></a>—a privilege I covet so much that I believe it would be the only bribe which would induce me to act against the Baetici.</p>
