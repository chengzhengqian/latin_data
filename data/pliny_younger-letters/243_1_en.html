To start at the beginning, I was always interested in poetry and wrote a Greek tragedy at the age of fourteen. What it was like I can’t say—anyway, I called it a tragedy. Later on I was weatherbound in the island of Icaria<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL055_491_1" id="target_note_LCL055_491_1"><sup>1</sup></a> while on my way home from military service, and wrote some Latin elegiacs with the sea and island for theme. I have also occasionally tried my hand at epic verse, but this is my first attempt at hendecasyllables. This is how they came into being. While I was staying in my house at Laurentum I had Asinius Gallus’s works read aloud to me, in which he draws a comparison between his father and Cicero and quotes an epigram of Cicero’s on his favourite Tiro. Then, when I had retired for my siesta (it was summer) and was unable to sleep, I began to reflect upon the fact that all the greatest orators had amused themselves with this kind of writing and had seen merit in doing so. I set my mind to it, and, to my surprise, in spite of being long out of practice, I had soon expressed the very thought which had inspired me to write. This was the result:</p>

<span class="line">Reading the works of Gallus, where he ventures</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">To hand the palm of glory to his father,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">I found that Cicero could unbend his talent</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">To play with polished wit on lighter theme.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">He showed how well the minds of mighty men</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Enjoyed the pleasure of much varied charms:</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Tiro, he says, defrauds and cheats his lover;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Kisses—not many—promised for a dinner</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Are afterwards denied when night-time comes.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
