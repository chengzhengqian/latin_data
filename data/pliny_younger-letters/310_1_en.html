Whatever the reason, there are a great many things in Rome and near by which we have never seen nor even heard of, though if they were to be found in Greece, Egypt or Asia, or any other country which advertises its wealth of marvels, we should have heard and read about them and seen them for ourselves.</p>
<p>I am a case in point. I have just heard of something (and seen it, too) which I had neither seen nor heard of before. My wife’s grandfather had asked me to look at his property in Ameria.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_61_1" id="target_note_LCL059_61_1"><sup>1</sup></a> While going round I was shown a lake at the foot of the hills called Lake Vadimon,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_61_2a" id="target_note_LCL059_61_2a"><sup>2</sup></a> and at the same time told some extraordinary facts about it. I went down to look at it, and found it was perfectly round and regular in shape, like a wheel lying on its side, without a single irregular bend or curve, and so evenly proportioned that it might have been artificially shaped and hollowed out. It is subdued in colour, pale blue with a tinge of green, has a smell of sulphur and a mineral taste, and the property of healing fractures. It is of no great size, but large enough for the wind to raise waves on its surface. There are no boats on it, as the waters are sacred, but floating islands, green with reeds and sedge and the other plants which grow more profusely on the marshy ground at the edge of the lake. Each island has its peculiar shape and size, and all have their edges worn away by friction, as they are constantly knocking against each other and the shore. They all have the same height and buoyancy, each shallow base dipping into the water
