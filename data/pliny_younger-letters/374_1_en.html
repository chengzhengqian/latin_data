<p>I <span class="sc">wish</span> you could have reached Bithynia without any illness yourself or in your party, and that your journey from Ephesus had been as easy as your voyage there. The date of your arrival in Bithynia, my dear Pliny, I have noted from your letter. The people there will appreciate, I think, that I am acting in their own interests, and you too will see that it is made clear to them that you were chosen as my representative for a special mission.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_191_1" id="target_note_LCL059_191_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Your first task must be to inspect the accounts of the various towns, as they are evidently in confusion.</p>
<p>As for land surveyors, I have scarcely enough for the public works in progress in Rome or in the neighbourhood,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_191_2" id="target_note_LCL059_191_2"><sup>2</sup></a> but there are reliable surveyors to be found in every province and no doubt you will not lack assistance if you will take the trouble to look for it.</p>
