sets out the reasons for which the censors may remove senators from office. Certain censors have therefore asked my opinion whether or not it is their duty to expel a senator who is a citizen of another city.</p>
<p>But although the law states that such people may not be elected senators, it says nothing about removing them from the senate for this reason. I therefore felt that I must ask you for your view on what ruling I should follow, especially as I am informed that every city has several senators who hold citizenship elsewhere, and many individuals and cities will be seriously affected by the enforcement of a section of the law which by general consent has long since fallen into disuse. I am sending the relevant sections of the law with this letter.</p>

<p><span class="sc">You</span> had good reason, my dear Pliny, to be uncertain what answer to give to the censors’ question whether senators who are citizens of other cities in the same province should retain their seats in the senate. The authority of the law on the one hand, and the long-established practice against it on the other, would influence you in opposite directions. My own view is that we should compromise; we should make no change in the situation resulting from past practice, so that citizens of any city may remain senators even if their election was not strictly legal; but in future the law of Pompey must be observed. If we tried to enforce it in retrospect it would inevitably lead to great confusion.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_307_1" id="target_note_LCL059_307_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
