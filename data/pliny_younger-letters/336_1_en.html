<h3>XVIII</h3>
<span class="label"><span class="sc">To Statius Sabinus</span></span>
<p><span class="sc">The</span> devoted concentration with which you read and remember my small efforts is clear from your letter; so you are to blame for the task you set yourself by begging and coaxing me to send you as much of my work as I can. I can’t refuse, but I shall send it bit by bit in small doses—grateful though I am to that memory of yours, I don’t want to confuse it by application to too much material at a time and leave it overwhelmed and surfeited, so that it has to sacrifice the parts for the whole and the earlier items for the later.</p>
<h3>XIX</h3>
<span class="label"><span class="sc">To Cremutius Ruso</span></span>
<p>You say you have read in a letter of mine<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_115_1" id="target_note_LCL059_115_1"><sup>1</sup></a> that Verginius Rufus ordered this inscription for his tomb:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<p>Here lies Rufus, who once defeated Vindex and set free the imperial power<span class="linebreak"></span>Not for himself, but for his country.</p>
</p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">You dislike his doing so; Frontinus, you say, showed a better and nobler spirit in forbidding any monument at all to be set up to himself; finally, you want my opinion on both men.</p>
