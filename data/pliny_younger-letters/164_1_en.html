<p><span class="sc">This</span> is a small matter, but likely to go far. A praetorian senator named Sollers asked the Senate for permission to hold a weekly market on his property.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL055_333_1" id="target_note_LCL055_333_1"><sup>1</sup></a> This was opposed by representatives of the town of Vicetia,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL055_333_2" id="target_note_LCL055_333_2"><sup>2</sup></a> with Tuscilius Nominatus acting on their behalf, and the case was adjourned until a subsequent meeting of the Senate. The Vicetians then appeared without anyone to plead for them and said they had been cheated—whether a verbal slip on their part or their genuine opinion I don’t know. Asked by the praetor Nepos<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL055_333_3" id="target_note_LCL055_333_3"><sup>3</sup></a> whom they had instructed to act for them, they replied, “The same as before.” To the question whether he had taken on the case without a fee, they said that they had given him 6,000 sesterces. Had they paid him a second fee? Yes, another 4,000. Nepos then issued a summons to Nominatus to appear before the court. This was as far as the matter went that day, but I can see that it will not end there, for often a mere touch is enough to set things moving with far-reaching consequences.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL055_333_4" id="target_note_LCL055_333_4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
