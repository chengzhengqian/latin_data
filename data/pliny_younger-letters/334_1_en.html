<span class="label"><span class="sc">To Cornelius Tacitus</span></span>
<p><span class="sc">You</span> are never satisfied with yourself, but I never write with such confidence as when I write about you. Whether posterity will give us a thought I don’t know, but surely we deserve one—I don’t say for our genius, which sounds like boasting, but for our application, hard work, and regard for future generations. Only let us continue along the path we have chosen; if it leads few to the full light of fame, it brings many out of the shades of obscurity.</p>

<span class="label"><span class="sc">To Pompeius Falco</span></span>
<p>I <span class="sc">took</span> refuge in Tuscany to be free to do as I liked, but even there it has been impossible. I am beset on all sides by the peasants with all their petitions full of complaints, and these I read rather more unwillingly than my own writings, which I really have no wish to read either. (I am revising some minor speeches of mine, and after a lapse of time it is a tedious and exasperating task.) My accounts are neglected, as if I had not come here to do them. I do, however, mount a horse sometimes and play the part of proprietor, but only to the extent of riding round part of the estate for exercise. Don’t you drop your habit of sending me the city news while I am rusticating in this way!</p>
