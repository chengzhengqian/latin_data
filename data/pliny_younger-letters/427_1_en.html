<h3>CIII</h3>
<span class="label"><span class="sc">Trajan to Pliny</span></span>
<p>I <span class="sc">was</span> glad to hear from your letter that the day of my accession was celebrated under your direction by my fellow-soldiers and the provincials, with due rejoicing and solemnity.</p>

<span class="label"><span class="sc">Pliny to the Emperor Trajan</span></span>
<p><span class="sc">Valerius</span> <span class="sc">Paulinus,</span> Sir, has left a will which passes over his son Paulinus and names me as patron of his Latin freedmen.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_297_1" id="target_note_LCL059_297_1"><sup>1</sup></a> On this occasion I pray you to grant full Roman citizenship<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_297_2" id="target_note_LCL059_297_2"><sup>2</sup></a> to three of them only; it would be unreasonable, I fear, to petition you to favour all alike, and I must be all the more careful not to abuse your generosity when I have enjoyed it on so many previous occasions. The names of the three are Gaius Valerius Astraeus, Gaius Valerius Dionysius, and Gaius Valerius Aper.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Your</span> desire to further the interests of the freedmen entrusted to you by Valerius Paulinus does you very great credit. To speed your purpose I have issued instructions that it is to be officially recorded that I have granted full Roman citizenship to the persons mentioned in your letter, and I am prepared to do the same for any others for whom you may ask it.</p>
