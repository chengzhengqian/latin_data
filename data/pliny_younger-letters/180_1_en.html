This action of Nepos’s had raised doubts in the mind of the president of the Centumviral Court,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL055_365_1" id="target_note_LCL055_365_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and, in order to consider whether to follow his example, he gave us our unexpected holiday.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the edict is the subject of praise or criticism throughout the city. Many people are saying that “We have found someone to set the crooked straight, but were there no praetors before him? Who is he to correct public morals?” The other party says that Nepos has done well; he has learnt the law before taking up office, reads the Senate’s decrees, puts a check on disgraceful bargaining, and will not allow a noble profession to sell its services in this scandalous way. So everyone talks, but events will have to show which view will prevail. Right and wrong intentions are praised and blamed only in so far as their results are good or bad—that is the generally accepted practice, though it is none the less unfair. Hence it generally happens that the self-same actions are variously ascribed to zeal, conceit, independence, or folly.</p>
