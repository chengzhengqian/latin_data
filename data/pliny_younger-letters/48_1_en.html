<span class="label"><span class="sc">To Caecilius Macrinus</span></span>
<p><span class="sc">Yesterday</span> on the Emperor’s proposal the Senate decreed a triumphal statue to Vestricius Spurinna,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL055_99_1" id="target_note_LCL055_99_1"><sup>1</sup></a> an honour granted to many who have never faced a battle, never seen a camp, nor even heard the sound of a trumpet except at the theatre; but Spurinna was one of those heroes whose honours were won by the blood and sweat of action. It was Spurinna who established the chief of the Bructeri in his kingdom by force of arms,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL055_99_2a" id="target_note_LCL055_99_2a"><sup>2</sup></a> and by mere threat of war against a savage people he terrorized it into submission, so winning the finest type of victory. Now he has his reward of merit; and to bring him consolation in grief, the honour of a statue was also granted to Cottius, the son who had died during his absence abroad.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL055_99_3" id="target_note_LCL055_99_3"><sup>3</sup></a> This is rarely granted to a young man, but in this case it was also due to the father whose grievous sorrow needed some special remedy to assuage it. Cottius himself had also given such marked indication of his promise that some sort of immortality was required to extend a life thus cut short. His high principles, his sense of duty and influence were such as to make him rival our elders in merit, and he is now raised to be their equal in honour. And indeed, in granting this honour the Senate would seem to me to have had in mind not only Cottius’s memory and his father’s grief, but also the effect on the public.
