Christians. Consequently, I do not know the nature or the extent of the punishments usually meted out to them, nor the grounds for starting an investigation and how far it should be pressed. Nor am I at all sure whether any distinction should be made between them on the grounds of age, or if young people and adults should be treated alike; whether a pardon ought to be granted to anyone retracting his beliefs, or if he has once professed Christianity, he shall gain nothing by renouncing it; and whether it is the mere name of Christian which is punishable, even if innocent of crime, or rather the crimes associated with the name.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_287_1" id="target_note_LCL059_287_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>For the moment this is the line I have taken with all persons brought before me on the charge of being Christians. I have asked them in person if they are Christians, and if they admit it, I repeat the question a second and third time, with a warning of the punishment awaiting them. If they persist, I order them to be led away for execution; for, whatever the nature of their admission, I am convinced that their stubbornness and unshakeable obstinacy ought not to go unpunished.

<p>Now that I have begun to deal with this problem, as so often happens, the charges are becoming more widespread and increasing in variety. An anonymous pamphlet has been circulated which contains the names of a number of accused persons. Among these I considered that I should dismiss any who denied that they were or ever had been Christians </p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL059_287_1"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL059_287_1" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">1</sup>Action taken by the Romans against foreign cults was usually directed against their associated <span class="italic">flagitia</span>; Plinyâ€™s concern is with what the Christian apologists called <span class="italic">accusatio nominis, i.e.</span> membership of the cult, approved by Trajan in his reply.
