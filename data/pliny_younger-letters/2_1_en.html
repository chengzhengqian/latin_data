which I promised you in my last letter. Please read and correct it as you always do, and the more so because I don’t think I have written before with quite so much spirit. I have tried to model myself on Demosthenes, as you always do, and lately on my favourite Calvus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL055_5_1" id="target_note_LCL055_5_1"><sup>1</sup></a> though only in figures of speech; for the fire of great men like these can only be caught by “the favoured few.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL055_5_2" id="target_note_LCL055_5_2"><sup>2</sup></a> If I may venture to say so, the subject-matter actually encouraged my ambitious effort; for I had to fight my way most of the time,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL055_5_3" id="target_note_LCL055_5_3"><sup>3</sup></a> and this shook me out of my usual lazy habits, as far as anything can shake up a man like me. However, I didn’t altogether abandon the “lavish colouring”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL055_5_4" id="target_note_LCL055_5_4"><sup>4</sup></a> of our master Cicero whenever I felt like making a pleasant deviation from my main path, for I did not want the force of my argument to lack all light relief.</p>
<p>You must not think that I am asking you to be indulgent on this account. To sharpen your critical powers I must confess that my friends and I are thinking of publishing it, if only you cast your vote for the proposal, mistaken though it may be. I must publish something, and I only hope and pray that the most suitable thing is what is ready now—there’s laziness for you! But I want to publish for several reasons, and above all because the books which I have already sent out into the world are still said to find readers although they have lost the charm of novelty. Of course, the booksellers may be flattering me; well, let them, as long as their deception makes me think well of my own work.</p>
