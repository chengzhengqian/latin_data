<p>A charge was brought by the province of Africa against their ex-governor, Marius Priscus.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL055_109_1" id="target_note_LCL055_109_1"><sup>1</sup></a> He pleaded guilty and applied for a commission to assess compensation to be paid. Cornelius Tacitus and I were instructed to act for the provincials, and accordingly thought it our duty to inform the Senate that criminal offences of such monstrosity exceeded the powers of a commission, seeing that Priscus had taken bribes to sentence innocent persons to punishment and even to death. Catius Fronto replied in his defence with a plea for the charge to be limited to the question of restitution of money extorted, and, as he is practised in the art of drawing tears, he was able to fill all the sails of his speech with a breeze of pathos. There was a violent argument and an outcry all round, one side arguing that the Senateâ€™s judicial powers were limited by law, the other that they were free and unlimited and that the defendant should be punished to the full extent of his guilt. Finally Julius Ferox, the consul-elect, whose integrity always commands respect, proposed that Priscus should be provisionally granted a commission, but that the persons named as having given bribes to him to procure the conviction of the innocent should be summoned as witnesses. Not only was this proposal carried but it was in fact the only one to gain much support after all previous argument; experience has shown that appeals for support and sympathy make an immediate strong impact, but gradually lose their fire and die down under the influence of a reasoned judgement. </p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL055_109_1"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL055_109_1" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">1</sup>The second of the five big public trials in which P. took part; cf.
