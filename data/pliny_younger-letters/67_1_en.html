<p>On the other side of the dining-room is an elegantly decorated bedroom [<span class="sc">k</span>], and then one which can either be a large bedroom or a moderate-sized dining-room [<span class="sc">l</span>] and enjoys the bright light of the sun reflected from the sea; behind is another room with an antechamber, high enough to be cool in summer and protected as a refuge in winter, for it is sheltered from every wind. A similar room and antechamber are divided off by a single wall [<span class="sc">m</span>]. Then comes the cooling-room of the bath, which is large and spacious and has two curved baths built out of opposite walls; these are quite large enough if you consider that the sea is so near. Next come the oiling-room, the furnace-room, and the hot-room for the bath, and then two rest-rooms, beautifully decorated in a simple style [<span class="sc">n</span>], leading to the heated swimming-bath [<span class="sc">o</span>] which is much admired and from which swimmers can see the sea. Close by is the ball-court [<span class="sc">p</span>] which receives the full warmth of the setting sun. Here there is a second storey, with two living-rooms below and two above, as well as a dining-room which commands the whole expanse of sea and stretch of shore with all its lovely houses [<span class="sc">q</span>]. Elsewhere another upper storey contains a room which receives both the rising and setting sun, and a good-sized wine-store and granary behind, while below is a dining-room [<span class="sc">r</span>] where nothing is known of a high sea but the sound of the breakers, and even that as a dying murmur; it looks on to the garden and the encircling drive.</p>
<p>All round the drive runs a hedge of box, or rosemary to fill any gaps, for box will flourish extensively </p></section><notes></notes></section>
