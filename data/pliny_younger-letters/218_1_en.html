<p>After my uncle’s departure I spent the rest of the day with my books, as this was my reason for staying behind. Then I took a bath, dined, and then dozed fitfully for a while. For several days past there had been earth tremors which were not particularly alarming because they are frequent in Campania: but that night the shocks were so violent that everything felt as if it were not only shaken but overturned. My mother hurried into my room and found me already getting up to wake her if she were still asleep. We sat down in the forecourt of the house, between the buildings and the sea close by. I don’t know whether I should call this courage or folly on my part (I was only seventeen at the time) but I called for a volume of Livy and went on reading as if I had nothing else to do. I even went on with the extracts I had been making. Up came a friend of my uncle’s who had just come from Spain to join him. When he saw us sitting there and me actually reading, he scolded us both—me for my foolhardiness and my mother for allowing it. Nevertheless, I remained absorbed in my book.</p>

The buildings round us were already tottering, and the open space we were in was too small for us not to be in real and imminent danger if the house collapsed. This finally decided us to leave the town. We were followed by a panic-stricken mob of people wanting to act on someone else’s decision in preference </p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL055_441_1"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL055_441_1" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">1</sup><span class="italic">Aeneid</span> II. 12.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL055_441_1').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL055_441_2"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL055_441_2" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">2</sup>25 August.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL055_441_2').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
