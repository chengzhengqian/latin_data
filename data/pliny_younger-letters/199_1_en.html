<p><span class="sc">Never</span> have I complained so much about my public duties as I do now.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL055_403_1" id="target_note_LCL055_403_1"><sup>1</sup></a> They would not let me come with you to Campania in search of better health, and they still prevent me from following hard on your heels. This is a time when I particularly want to be with you, to see with my own eyes whether you are gaining in strength and weight, and if the pleasures of your holiday and the luxuries of the district are doing you no harm. Indeed, I should worry when you are away even if you were well, for there are always anxious moments without news of anyone one loves dearly, and, as things are, I have the thought of your health as well as your absence to alarm me with fluctuating doubts and fears. I am full of forebodings of every imaginable disaster, and like all nervous people dwell most on what I pray fervently will not happen. So do please think of my anxiety and write to me once or even twice a dayâ€”I shall worry less while I am reading your letters, but my fears will return as soon as I have finished them.</p>
