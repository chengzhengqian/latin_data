<p>I should have been trying long ago not to say too much, had I not suggested that this letter should take you into every corner of the place. I don’t imagine you will find it tiresome to read about a spot which could hardly tire you on a visit, especially as you have more opportunities if you want an occasional rest, and can take a seat, so to speak, by putting down the letter. Besides, I have been indulging the love I have for all the places I have largely laid out myself or where I have perfected an earlier design. In short (for why should I not state my opinion, right or wrong?) I think a writer’s first duty is to read his title, to keep on asking himself what he set out to say, and to realize that he will not say too much if he sticks to his theme, though he certainly will if he brings in extraneous matter. You know the number of lines Homer and Virgil devote to their descriptions of the arms of Achilles and Aeneas:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL055_353_1" id="target_note_LCL055_353_1"><sup>1</sup></a> yet neither passage seems long because both poets are carrying out their original intention. You see too how Aratus traces and tabulates the smallest stars,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL055_353_2" id="target_note_LCL055_353_2"><sup>2</sup></a> but because this is his main subject and not a digression his work does not lack proportion. It is the same with me, if I may “compare small things with great.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL055_353_3" id="target_note_LCL055_353_3"><sup>3</sup></a> I am trying to set my entire house before your eyes, so, if I introduce nothing irrelevant, it is the house I describe which is extensive, not the letter describing it.</p>
