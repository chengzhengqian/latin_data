by coastal boat,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_189_1" id="target_note_LCL059_189_1"><sup>1</sup></a> I was further delayed by contrary winds, so that I did not reach Bithynia until 17 September. I had hoped to arrive earlier, but I cannot complain of the delay as I was in time to celebrate your birthday<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_189_2" id="target_note_LCL059_189_2"><sup>2</sup></a> in my province, and this should be a good omen.</p>
<p>I am now examining the finances of the town of Prusa, expenditure, revenues, and sums owing, and finding the inspection increasingly necessary the more I look into their accounts; large sums of money are detained in the hands of private individuals for various reasons, and further sums are paid out for quite illegal purposes, I am writing this letter, Sir, immediately after my arrival here.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_189_3" id="target_note_LCL059_189_3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<h3>XVII B</h3>
<span class="label"><span class="sc">Pliny to the Emperor Trajan</span></span>
<p>I <span class="sc">entered</span> my province, Sir, on 17 September, and found there the spirit of obedience and loyalty which is your just tribute from mankind.</p>
<p>Will you consider, Sir, whether you think it necessary to send out a land surveyor? Substantial sums of money could, I think, be recovered from contractors of public works if we had dependable surveys made. I am convinced of this by the accounts of Prusa, which I am handling with all possible care.</p>
