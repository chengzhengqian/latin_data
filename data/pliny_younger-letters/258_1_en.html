Look at it in this way: if you are going to talk to a single individual, however well informed, won’t you be less nervous than you are before large numbers who may be quite ignorant? When you rise to plead in court, isn’t that the moment when you have least confidence in yourself, when you wish you could alter most of your speech or indeed the whole? Especially if the scene is imposing and the assembly large, for even the sight of dirty working clothes can be intimidating. If you feel that your opening words are badly received, don’t you falter and break down? I imagine it is because there is some sort of sound collective wisdom in mere numbers, so that, though individual judgements may be poor, when combined they carry weight. Thus it was that Pomponius Secundus, the author of tragedies, if one of his close friends happened to think that some passage should be deleted when he wished to keep it, used to say that he “appealed to the people”: and according to the people’s silence or applause he would act on his own judgement or that of his friend. Such was his faith in public opinion, whether rightly or wrongly it is not for me to say. For I do not invite the general public, but a select and limited audience of persons whom I admire and trust, whom I observe individually and fear as a whole; seeing that I apply to fear what Cicero said about the practice of writing.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL055_521_1" id="target_note_LCL055_521_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Fear is the sternest corrective—the prospect of giving a reading, our entry into the lecture-room, our white faces, our trembling, and our nervous glances, all prompt us to correct our work.</p>
