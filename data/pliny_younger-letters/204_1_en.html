feelings are warmest, and later judgement has not cooled our affection but strengthened it, as anyone who knows either of us at all intimately is aware. Atilius boasts widely of his friendship with me, and I make no secret of my concern for his honour, security, and peace of mind. In fact when he told me he was nervous about the insolent attitude of one of the tribunes-elect, like Achilles I replied that no one should harm him “while I live.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL055_413_1" id="target_note_LCL055_413_1"><sup>1</sup></a> All this goes to show that Atilius cannot be wronged without my being concerned, but you may still wonder what I am leading up to. Well, Valerius Varus has died owing him some money. Varus’s heir is our friend Maximus, and, as you are more intimate with him than I am, I beg, or rather insist, in the name of our friendship, that you will see that Atilius recovers not only his principal intact, but also the accumulated interest of several years. He is a man who never covets other people’s possessions and is careful of his own, and he has no investments to support him, and no income but what he saves out of his frugal way of life; for though he makes such a success of his studies, he pursues them only for pleasure and the reputation they bring him. The slightest loss is serious for him, though it can be worse if one has to recover after a set-back. Do rid him and me of the worry, and let me still enjoy his charm and wit. I can’t bear to see him in distress, when his natural gaiety never lets me be sad. In fact you know his witticisms: please do not let injustice turn them to bitterness and gall. The warmth of his affection should convince you of his passion if offended, and his bold spirit of independence will not submit to loss </p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL055_413_1"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL055_413_1" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">1</sup><span class="italic">Iliad</span> I. 88.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL055_413_1').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
