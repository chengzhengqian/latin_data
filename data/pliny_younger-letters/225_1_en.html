<p><span class="sc">How</span> often we judge actions by the people who perform them! The selfsame deeds are lauded to the skies or allowed to sink into oblivion simply because the persons concerned are well known or not.</p>
<p>I was sailing on our<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL055_455_1" id="target_note_LCL055_455_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Lake Como with an elderly friend when he pointed out a house with a bedroom built out over the lake. “From there,” he said, “a woman of our town once threw herself with her husband.” I asked why. The husband had long been suffering from ulcers in the private parts, and his wife insisted on seeing them, promising that no one would give him a more candid opinion whether the disease was curable. She saw that there was no hope and urged him to take his life; she went with him, even led him to his death herself, and forced him to follow her example by roping herself to him and jumping into the lake. Yet even I, who come from the same town, never heard of this until the other day—not because it was less heroic than Arria’s famous deed,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL055_455_2" id="target_note_LCL055_455_2"><sup>2</sup></a> but because the woman was less well known.</p>
