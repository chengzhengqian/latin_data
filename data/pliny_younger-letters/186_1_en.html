His character is known to me not from the splendid reputation he so justly deserves, but from the close personal experience of many years. Together we have admired and still admire almost every man or woman who is an example to our generation, and this association has been a close bond of intimacy between us. Another link was forged in our public relations; as you know, Cornutus was my colleague as a Treasury official and as consul,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL055_377_1" id="target_note_LCL055_377_1"><sup>1</sup></a> as if in answer to my prayers. It was then that I knew him to the full for the great man he is; I followed him as my teacher and honoured him as a parent as he deserved, for his was the ripe wisdom not of years but of experience. For these reasons I congratulate myself no less than him, for public as well as personal considerations. Now at last men’s merits bring them official recognition instead of the dangers of the past.</p>
<p>I could let my letter run on indefinitely to give free expression to my joy, but I must tum to what I was doing when the news reached me. I was staying with my wife’s grandfather and aunt, meeting friends I had long wished to see; I was going the round of my few acres, hearing the peasants’ many complaints and looking over the accounts—unwillingly and superficially I must admit, for I am devoted to literary documents of a very different order. I had also begun to make preparations for my return, for I am restricted by the shortness of my leave, especially now that the news of Cornutus’s duties is a reminder of my own. I trust that your Campania will let you return about the same time, so that I shall not lose a day of your company once I am back in Rome.</p>
