<h2>BOOK II</h2>
<h3>I</h3>
<span class="label"><span class="sc">To Voconius Romanus</span></span>
<p><span class="sc">It</span> is some years since Rome has had such a splendid sight to remember as the public funeral of Verginius Rufus, one of our greatest and most distinguished citizens whom we can also count a fortunate one. For thirty years after his hour of glory<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL055_79_1" id="target_note_LCL055_79_1"><sup>1</sup></a> he lived on to read about himself in history and verse, so that he was a living witness of his fame to come. He was three times consul, and thus attained the highest distinction short of the imperial power itself; for this he had refused. His virtues had been suspected and resented by certain of the Emperors, but he had escaped arrest and lived to see a truly good and friendly ruler safely established; so that he might have been reserved for the honour of his public funeral we have just seen. He had reached the age of eighty-three, living in close retirement and deeply respected by us all, and his health was good, apart from a trembling of the hands, not enough to trouble him. Only death when it came was slow and painful, though we can only admire the way he faced it. He was rehearsing the delivery of his address of thanks<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL055_79_2" id="target_note_LCL055_79_2"><sup>2</sup></a> to the Emperor <a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL055_79_3" id="target_note_LCL055_79_3"><sup>3</sup></a>
