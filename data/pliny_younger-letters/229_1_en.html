In future I shall have to set bounds to your hospitality myself if you will not, and I have already warned your people that if they bring so much another time they will have to take it all back again. You may say that all you have is mine to use: yes, but that means it is also mine to use in moderation.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Avidius</span> <span class="sc">Quietus</span>, whose good opinion of me I valued as much as his warm affection, had been a friend of Thrasea’s<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL055_463_1" id="target_note_LCL055_463_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and used to tell me many of his sayings. A common one he often quoted was that there were three kinds of case which we should undertake: our friends’, those which no one else would take on, and those which establish a precedent. No explanation is needed to show why we should help our friends; we should undertake the second type, he said, as the best means of showing our generosity and strength of mind, and the third because nothing is so important as establishing the right precedent. To these I will add a fourth type of case, though it may seem presumption on my part: cases which bring fame and recognition, for there is no reason why a speaker should not sometimes act for his honour and reputation’s sake, and so plead his own case. These then (as you ask my opinion) are the limits I would lay down for a person of your high standing and discretion.</p>
