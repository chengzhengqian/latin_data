<h3>CXVI</h3>
<span class="label"><span class="sc">Pliny to the Emperor Trajan</span></span>
<p><span class="sc">It</span> is a general practice for people at their coming-of-age or marriage, and on entering upon office or dedicating a public building, to issue invitations to all the local senators and even to quite a number of the common people in order to distribute presents of one or two denarii. I pray you to let me know how far you think this should be allowed, if at all. My own feeling is that invitations of this kind may sometimes be permissible, especially on ceremonial occasions, but the practice of issuing a thousand or even more seems to go beyond all reasonable limits, and could be regarded as a form of corrupt practice.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_309_1" id="target_note_LCL059_309_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<h3>CXVII</h3>
<span class="label"><span class="sc">Trajan to Pliny</span></span>
<p><span class="sc">You</span> have every reason to fear that the issuing of invitations might lead to corrupt practices, if the numbers are excessive and people are invited in groups to a sort of official present-giving rather than individually as personal friends. But I made you my choice so that you could use your good judgement in exercising a moderating influence on the behaviour of the people in your province, and could make your own decisions about what is necessary for their peace and security.</p>
