Besides, I lacked subject-matter for writing more. You want me to follow Cicero’s example, but my position is very different from his. He was not only richly gifted but was supplied with a wealth of varied and important topics to suit his abilities, though you know without my telling you the narrow limits confining me.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_83_1" id="target_note_LCL059_83_1"><sup>1</sup></a> I might decide to send you a sort of schoolboy’s exercise for a letter, but I can imagine nothing less suitable, when I think of your life under arms, the camps, bugles and trumpets, sweat and dust and heat of the sun.</p>
