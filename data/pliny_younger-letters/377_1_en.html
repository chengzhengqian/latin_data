<p><span class="sc">The</span> public bath at Prusa, Sir, is old and dilapidated, and the people are very anxious for it to be rebuilt. My own opinion is that you could suitably grant their petition.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_197_1" id="target_note_LCL059_197_1"><sup>1</sup></a> There will be money available for building it, first from the sums I have begun to call in from private individuals, and secondly because the people are prepared to apply to building the bath the grants they usually make towards financing the distribution of olive oil. This is, moreover, a scheme which is worthy of the town’s prestige and the splendour of your reign.</p>
