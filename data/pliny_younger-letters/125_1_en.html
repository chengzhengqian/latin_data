He has written an open letter to the town councils asking them to choose one of their number with the best voice to give a public reading of the work; and this has been done.</p>
<p>If he had applied to better ends this force (or whatever we are to call this determination to get one’s own way), think how much good he could have done! And yet good men are less forceful than bad: “Ignorance breeds confidence, reflection leads to hesitation”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL055_255_1" id="target_note_LCL055_255_1"><sup>1</sup></a> as the saying goes, and so diffidence is the weakness of right-thinking minds, while depravity gains strength from reckless abandon. Regulus is proof of this. He has weak lungs, indistinct articulation, and a stammer, he is slow at finding the right word and has no memory, nothing in fact but a perverted ingenuity, and yet his crazy effrontery has won him the popular reputation of being an orator. So Herennius Senecio has cleverly adapted Cato’s well-known definition of an orator to fit him: “This orator is a bad man untrained in speaking.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL055_255_2" id="target_note_LCL055_255_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Cato certainly did not define the real orator so neatly as Senecio has summed up Regulus!</p>
<p>Can you make me a proper return for a letter like this? You can if you will write and tell me whether any of my friends in your town—perhaps yourself—has had to read out this miserable efforts of Regulus’s, shouting in public like a cheap-jack, or, to quote Demosthenes, “bawling in a loud and jubilant strain.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL055_255_3" id="target_note_LCL055_255_3"><sup>3</sup></a> For it is so absurd that it is more likely to meet with laughter than tears; you would think it was written <span class="italic">by</span> a boy rather than about one.</p>
