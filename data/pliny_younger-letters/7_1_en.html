official visit to the praetor;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL055_15_1" id="target_note_LCL055_15_1"><sup>1</sup></a> he came up to me and asked to see me alone. He said he was afraid that something he had once said in court in reply to Satrius Rufus and myself was still rankling in my mind: “Satrius Rufus, who makes no attempt to copy Cicero, and is satisfied with the standard of oratory today.” I replied that now that he admitted it, I realized that the remark was offensive, but that it could have been taken as a compliment. “Personally I do try to copy Cicero,” I said, “and am <span class="italic">not</span> satisfied with the oratory of today. It seems to me foolish not to model oneself on the highest standards. But if you remember this case, why have you forgotten the one where you asked me for my opinion of Mettius Modestus’s loyalty?” He grew noticeably even paler than usual, and then stammered out, “The question was meant to damage Modestus, not you.” (See the cruelty of the man who admits he intended to damage someone in exile.) Then he proffered a fine reason: “He said in a letter which was read out before Domitian that Regulus was ‘the vilest of two-legged creatures.’” Modestus never wrote a truer word!</p>
<p>This practically ended our conversation, for I did not wish to prolong it and have to commit myself before Mauricus arrived. I am well aware that Regulus is hard to come to grips with; he is rich, influential, backed by many people and feared by more, and fear usually brings more support than popularity. However, it is quite possible that these props may collapse and let him down, for a bad man’s popularity
