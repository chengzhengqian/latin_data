the oath of allegiance<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_231_1" id="target_note_LCL059_231_1"><sup>1</sup></a> to your fellow-soldiers in the usual form, and found the provincials eager to take it, too, as a proof of their loyalty.</p>
<h3>LIII</h3>
<span class="label"><span class="sc">Trajan to Pliny</span></span>
<p>I <span class="sc">was</span> glad to hear from your letter, my dear Pliny, of the rejoicing and devotion with which under your guidance, my fellow-soldiers and the provincials have celebrated the anniversary of my accession.</p>
<h3>LIV</h3>
<span class="label"><span class="sc">Pliny to the Emperor Trajan</span></span>
<p><span class="sc">Thanks</span> to your foresight, Sir, the sums owed to public funds have been paid in under my administration, or are in process of being so; but I am afraid the money may remain uninvested. There is no opportunity, or practically none, of purchasing landed property, and people cannot be found who will borrow from public funds, especially at the rate of twelve per cent, the same rate as for private loans.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_231_2" id="target_note_LCL059_231_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Would you then consider, Sir, whether you think that the rate of interest should be lowered to attract suitable borrowers, and, if they are still not forthcoming, whether the money might be loaned out among the town councillors upon their giving the State proper security? They may be unwilling to accept it, but it will be less of a burden to them if the rate of interest is reduced.</p>
