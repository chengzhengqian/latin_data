Consequently, Sir, I felt I must ask you what course you wish me to follow, and also what I am to do with people found still to be in the province, although they were sentenced to banishment and never had their sentences reversed.</p>
<p>A further type of case has also come to me for trial. A man was brought before me who had been sentenced to banishment for life by the governor Julius Bassus.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_235_1" id="target_note_LCL059_235_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Knowing that all Bassus’s acts had been annulled, and that the Senate had granted anyone sentenced by him the right to have a new trial so long as the appeal was made within two years, I asked this man if he had brought his case to the notice of the succeeding governor. He said he had not. So now I am obliged to ask you whether you think that the man should be exiled on his original sentence, or if some heavier sentence, and if so, what, should be given him, and any others we may find in a similar situation.</p>
<p>I append copies of the sentence passed by Calvus and his edict of reversal, and the sentence passed by Bassus.</p>
