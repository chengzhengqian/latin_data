<p>I am waiting for you to strike out certain expressions in this letter (such as “the rudder groans” and “equal to the gods of the sea”) by the same rule as you attack the passages I am quoting; for I am well aware that in seeking indulgence for my past offences I have fallen into the very errors you condemn. Strike then—as long as you will fix an early date for us to discuss both past and present in person. Then you can make me more cautious or I shall teach you to be venturesome.</p>

<span class="label"><span class="sc">To Plinius Paternus</span></span>
<p>I <span class="sc">have</span> often been conscious of the powers of history, its dignity and majesty and inspired authority, but never more so than on a recent occasion. An author had begun a reading of a work of exceptional candour, and had left part to be read another day. Up came the friends of someone I won’t name, begging and praying him not to read the remainder; such is the shame people feel at hearing about their conduct, though they felt none at the time of doing what they blush to hear.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_137_1" id="target_note_LCL059_137_1"><sup>1</sup></a> The author complied with their request, as he could well do without loss of sincerity, but the book, like their deeds, remains and will remain; it will always be read, and all the more for this delay, for information withheld only sharpens men’s curiosity to hear it.</p>
