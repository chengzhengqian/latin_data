Both proposals found many supporters, especially the second one, being less severe, or if you prefer, more lenient; for there were some who seemed to be in agreement with Cornutus but went over to Collega when he spoke after them. But, when the division was taken, first the members standing by the consuls’ chairs proceeded to go over to Cornutus’s side, then those who were letting themselves be counted with Collega crossed the floor, so that Collega was left with scarcely anyone. He complained bitterly afterwards about those who had led him on, especially Regulus, who had actually told him what to say and then deserted him. (Regulus’s instability generally leads him into rash ventures which he afterwards regrets.)</p>
<p>So ended this important trial. There is still a minor matter, though not unimportant, concerning Priscus’s deputy, Hostilius Firminus, who was implicated in the charge and, indeed, very heavily involved. It was proved from the accounts of Marcianus and from a speech made by Firminus in the town-council of Lepcis that he had helped Priscus in a particularly shocking piece of work, and had also bargained with Marcianus to receive 200,000 sesterces; and he had in fact been paid 10,000 under the disgraceful head of “cosmetics”—an entry quite in keeping with his dandified elegance. The Senate adopted Cornutus’s proposal to refer his case to the next session; for, either by chance or through knowledge of his guilt, Firminus was not present.</p>
