<span class="label"><span class="sc">Trajan to Pliny</span></span>
<p>I <span class="sc">can</span> see, my dear Pliny, that you are applying all your energy and intelligence to your lake; you have worked out so many ways of avoiding the danger of its water draining away, and so increasing its usefulness to us in future. You choose then the way which best suits the situation. I am sure Calpurnius Macer will not fail to send you an engineer, and there is no lack of such experts in the provinces where you are.</p>
<h3>LXIII</h3>
<span class="label"><span class="sc">Pliny to the Emperor Trajan</span></span>
<p>I <span class="sc">have</span> received a letter, Sir, from your freedman Lycormas, telling me to detain, pending his arrival, any embassy which may come here from the Bosporos on its way to Rome. None has come to Nicaea as yet, at least while I have been here, but a courier has arrived from King Sauromates.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_247_1a" id="target_note_LCL059_247_1a"><sup>1</sup></a> I thought I should seize this unforeseen opportunity to send him on with the courier who travelled here ahead of Lycormas, so that you could have both letters together in case they contained news of equal importance to you.</p>
