<p><span class="sc">The</span> other day, when I had just finished addressing a joint session of the four panels of the Centumviral Court, I remembered a speech which I had made as a young man in the same court. As usual my thoughts travelled on, and I began to reckon up the people with whom I had worked on the present occasion and the earlier one. I was the only person present who had spoken in both cases; such are the changes due to mortal frailty or the fickleness of fortune. Some of those who had spoken then are dead, others are in exile: age and ill-health has silenced one man, another has chosen to enjoy the blessings of retirement, another holds a military command, and another has given up his career to become the Emperor’s personal friend.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL055_307_1" id="target_note_LCL055_307_1"><sup>1</sup></a> In my own case I have known many changes. My profession brought me advancement, then danger, then advancement again; I was helped by my friendship with honest men, then injured by it, and now am helped again.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL055_307_2" id="target_note_LCL055_307_2"><sup>2</sup></a> If you add up the years it would not seem very long, but it would be a lifetime if you count the changes of fortune. </p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL055_307_1"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL055_307_1" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">1</sup><span class="italic">i.e</span>. a member of the Emperor’s <span class="italic">consilium</span>; see IV. 22, and note.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL055_307_1').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL055_307_2"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL055_307_2" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">2</sup>See III. 11; <span class="italic">Pan</span>. 95. 3.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL055_307_2').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
