<p><span class="sc">When</span> I was inspecting the accounts of the city of Byzantium,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_221_2" id="target_note_LCL059_221_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Sir, where expenditure has been very heavy, I was informed that a delegate was sent annually to offer you a loyal address and allow 12,000 sesterces for his expenses. Remembering your wishes, I decided to send on the address but no delegate to convey it, so that the citizens could reduce expenses without failing in their official duty towards you. In the same accounts there is an entry of another 3,000 sesterces under the head of annual travelling expenses for the delegate sent with an official greeting to the governor of Moesia. This, too, I thought should be cut down in future.</p>
<p>I pray you, Sir, to think fit to give me your opinion, and either confirm my decision or correct me if I am at fault.</p>
