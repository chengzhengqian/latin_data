<p>You can judge how much I value your opinion from the fact that I have preferred to submit the whole work to your criticism rather than pick out passages for you to admire, though admittedly these lose some of their excellence if they show signs of monotony. Moreover, an intelligent and discerning reader should not compare totally different passages, but should judge each one on its own merits, nor think one inferior to another if each is perfect of its own kind. Here I will stop, for to excuse or recommend my follies in a long preamble would be the height of folly. One thing I think I must tell you now: I intend to give these trifles of mine the title of “hendecasyllables,” which refers only to the metre in which they are written. You call them what you like—epigrams, idylls, eclogues, or simply “short poems,” which is the popular name, but I shall stick to my “hendecasyllables.” Please be honest, and tell me now what you are likely to say about my book to someone else. It is not much to ask, for if this little work were my chief or sole effort it might possibly seem unkind to tell me to “find something else to do”; but there is nothing unkind in the gentle reminder that I “<span class="italic">have</span> something else to do.”</p>
