Three or four hours after I first wake (but I don’t keep to fixed times) I betake myself according to the weather either to the terrace or the covered arcade, work out the rest of my subject, and dictate it. I go for a drive, and spend the time in the same way as when walking or lying down; my powers of concentration do not flag and are in fact refreshed by the change. After a short sleep and another walk I read a Greek or Latin speech aloud and with emphasis, not so much for the sake of my voice as my digestion, though of course both are strengthened by this. Then I have another walk, am oiled, take exercise, and have a bath. If I am dining alone with my wife or with a few friends, a book is read aloud during the meal and afterwards we listen to a comedy or some music; then I walk again with the members of my household, some of whom are well educated.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_155_1" id="target_note_LCL059_155_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Thus the evening is prolonged with varied conversation, and, even when the days are at their longest, comes to a satisfying end.</p>
