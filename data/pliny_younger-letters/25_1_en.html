<p>He also writes verses in the style of my favourite Catullus and Calvus <a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL055_51_1" id="target_note_LCL055_51_1"><sup>1</sup></a> which might indeed be theirs, for these are full of wit and charm, bitterness and passion; and, though he sometimes strikes a harsher note in the even flow of his measures, it is done deliberately and in imitation of his models. He has recently read me some letters which he said were written by his wife, but sounded to me like Plautus or Terence being read in prose. Whether they are all really his wifeâ€™s as he says, or his own (which he denies), one can only admire him either for what he writes or for the way he has cultivated and refined the taste of the girl he married.</p>
<p>So all my time is spent with him. If I have something of my own to write I read him first, and again afterwards; I read him also for recreation, and he never seems the same. I do urge you to read him too. The fact that he is still alive should not detract from his work. If he had been one of the writers before our own time we should be collecting his portraits as well as his books; are we then to let him languish without honour or popularity, as if we saw too much of him, just because he is living today? It is surely perverse and ungenerous to refuse recognition to one so deserving because we have the good fortune to enjoy his company and conversation, and can demonstrate our affection for the man as well as our appreciation of his work.</p>
