Certus was not present at these proceedings; either he suspected something of the sort or he was ill—the excuse he gave. It is true that the Emperor brought no motion against him before the Senate, but I won my point. The consulship was given to Certus’s colleague, and Certus was removed from his Treasury post, so that my concluding demand was fulfilled that “he should give back under the best of Emperors the reward he received from the worst.”</p>
<p>Afterwards I set down what I could remember of my speech, and made several additions. By coincidence, though it seemed no mere coincidence, a few days after the speech was published Certus fell ill and died. I have heard it said that always in his mind’s eye he had a vision of me threatening him with a sword. Whether this is true I shouldn’t like to say, but it helps to point a moral if it is accepted as true.</p>
<p>Here you have a letter as long as the speeches you have read, if you think what the length of a letter should be—but you weren’t satisfied with the speeches and have only yourself to blame.</p>
