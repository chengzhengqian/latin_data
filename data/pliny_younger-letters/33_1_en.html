<p>“But a lot of people like a short speech.” So they do, if they are lazy, but it is absurd to take their idle whim as a serious opinion; if you followed their advice you would do best not in a short speech but saying nothing at all.</p>
<p>This is the view I have held up to now, though I can modify it if you disagree; only please give me your reasons if you do. I know I should bow to your authority, but on an important question like this I would rather yield to a reasoned argument than to authority alone. So if you think I am right, you need only tell me so in as short a letter as you like, as long as you will write to corroborate my opinion. If you think me wrong, make it a long one, and I only hope this does not look like bribery—to demand a short letter if you agree with me, and a very long one if you don’t.</p>

<p>I <span class="sc">have</span> the highest possible opinion of your judgement and critical eye, not because your taste is so <span class="italic">very</span> good (don’t flatter yourself) but because it is as good as mine. Joking apart, I think the slaves you advised me to buy look all right, but it remains to be seen if they are honest; and here one can’t go by a slave’s looks, but rather by what one hears of him.</p>
