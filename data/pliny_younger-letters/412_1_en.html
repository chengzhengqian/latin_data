anyone who has held office under the age of thirty can be admitted to the senate by the censors,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL059_267_1" id="target_note_LCL059_267_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and, if so, whether the law can be similarly interpreted so that persons who have not actually held office can be admitted to the senate at the age when they were eligible to do so. This has been the practice hitherto, and is considered unavoidable because it is so much more desirable to choose senators from the sons of better-class families than from the common people.</p>
<p>When asked my opinion by the censors-elect, I told them that I thought it would be in accordance with both the edict of Augustus and the law of Pompey if anyone who had held civil office under the age of thirty were admitted to the senate, seeing that the edict allowed office to be held before the age of thirty, and the law laid down that all ex-officials should become senators; but that in the case of persons who had never held a civil office, although they had reached an age to make them eligible, I had some doubts. That is why, Sir, I am asking your advice on what you wish me to do. I append the relevant sections of the law of Pompey, and also the edict of Augustus.</p>
