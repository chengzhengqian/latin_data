<p>Only one thing is needed to complete the amenities and beauty of the house—running water; but there are wells, or rather springs, for they are very near the surface. It is in fact a remarkable characteristic of this shore that wherever you dig you come upon water at once which is pure and not in the least brackish, although the sea is so near. The woods close by provide plenty of firewood, and the town of Ostia supplies us with everything else. There is also a village,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL055_143_1" id="target_note_LCL055_143_1"><sup>1</sup></a> just beyond the next house, which can satisfy anyone’s modest needs, and here there are three baths for hire, a great convenience if a sudden arrival or too short a stay makes us reluctant to heat up the bath at home. The sea-front gains much from the pleasing variety of the houses built either in groups or far apart; from the sea or shore these look like a number of cities. The sand on the shore is sometimes too soft for walking after a long spell of fine weather, but more often it is hardened by the constant washing of the waves. The sea has admittedly few fish of any value, but it gives us excellent soles and prawns, and all inland produce is provided by the house, especially milk: for the herds collect there from the pastures whenever they seek water and shade.</p>
<p>And now do you think I have a good case for making this retreat my haunt and home where I love to be? You are too polite a townsman if you don’t covet it! But I hope you will, for then the many attractions of my treasured house will have another strong recommendation in your company.</p>
