<p><span class="sc">Out</span> of a sum of money I have inherited I have just bought a Corinthian bronze statue, only a small one, but an attractive and finished piece of work as far as I can judgeâ€”though in general maybe my judgement is limited, and certainly very much so here. But this is a statue that I feel even I can appreciate, for being nude it does not hide any defects it may have nor fail to reveal its merits. It represents a standing figure of an old man; the bones, muscles, sinews, and veins and even the wrinkles are clear and lifelike, the hair is sparse and receding from a broad brow, its face is lined and neck thin, and it has drooping shoulders, a flat chest, and hollow stomach. The back view, within its limits, gives the same impression of age. The bronze appears to have the true colour of a genuine antique; in fact every detail is such as to hold the attention of an artist as well as delight the amateur, and that is what persuaded me to buy it, novice though I am.</p>
<p>However, my intention was not to keep it in my house (I have not any Corinthian bronzes there yet) but to place it in some public position in my native town, preferably in the temple of Jupiter;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL055_181_1" id="target_note_LCL055_181_1"><sup>1</sup></a> it is clearly a gift well worthy of a temple and a god. Will you then carry out a commission for me as you always do, and give immediate orders for a pedestal to be made? Choose what marble you like, and have it inscribed with my name and official titles if you think they should appear too. I will send you the statue </p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL055_181_1"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL055_181_1" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">1</sup>A temple served as a museum for displaying works of art; cf.
