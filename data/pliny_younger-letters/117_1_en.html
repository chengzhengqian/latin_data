<span class="label"><span class="sc">To Cornelius Priscus</span></span>
<p>I <span class="sc">am</span> distressed to hear that Valerius Martial is dead. He was a man of great gifts, with a mind both subtle and penetrating, and his writings are remarkable for their combination of sincerity with pungency and wit. I had made him a present of his travelling expenses when he retired from Rome,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL055_237_1" id="target_note_LCL055_237_1"><sup>1</sup></a> in recognition of our friendship and the verses he wrote about me. It was the custom in the past to reward poets who had sung the praises of cities or individuals with gifts of office or money, but in our day this was one of the first things to fall out of fashion along with many other fine and honourable practices; for, now that we do nothing to merit a poetâ€™s tribute, it seems foolish to receive one.</p>
<p>You will want to know the verses which won my gratitude, and I would refer you to the book had I not some of them by heart. If you like these, you can look up the others in his published works. The poet is addressing the Muse, telling her to seek my house on the Esquiline and approach it with respect:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL055_237_2" id="target_note_LCL055_237_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
