<p><span class="sc">You</span> say that the distinguished Roman knight Robustus travelled as far as Ocriculum<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL055_457_2" id="target_note_LCL055_457_2"><sup>2</sup></a> with my friend Atilius Scaurus, and then completely vanished, and you want Scaurus to come and see if he can put us on the scent. He shall come, though I fear it may be no use. I suspect something has happened to Robustus of the same sort as once befell my fellow-townsman Metilius Crispus. I had obtained his promotion to the rank of centurion and had given him 40,000 sesterces for his outfit and equipment when he set out, but I never had a letter from him afterwards, nor any news of his death. Whether he was killed by his slaves or along with them, no one knows: at any rate, neither Crispus nor any of them were seen again, any more than the slaves of Robustus. But let us try, and send for Scaurus—this much we can do in answer to your request and the very proper entreaties of the worthy young man who is showing intelligence as well as devotion to his father in the way he is organizing the search. I pray that with the gods’ help he will be as successful in finding his father as he was in discovering the man who travelled with him.</p>
