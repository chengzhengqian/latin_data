dishonour, distortion, and confusion can be quoted, than that the whole of our slave population, liberated by permission of a magistrate, should have been let loose upon one stage and given control of another, with the result that the audience of one was exposed to the mercy of slaves, while that of the other was composed of slaves alone? Had a swarm of bees come upon the stage or into the auditorium at the games, we should think it necessary to summon soothsayers from Etruria; and do we feel no alarm when not a man of us but sees such numerous swarms of slaves launched suddenly upon the Roman people packed within the walls of a building? Indeed, were a swarm of bees actually in question, the soothsayers might perchance warn us, after reference to their Etrurian books, to beware of our slave population. <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">26</span><span class="br"></span> Were this warning manifested to us by some alien and allegorical portent we should take precautions accordingly; and, when the portent is itself what it portends, and when an event is at once an augury of peril and a peril in itself, are we not terrified? Was it after this fashion that your father held the Megalesia, or your uncle?

Those who of old were separated from the free upon a heraldâ€™s proclamation, at your games separated the free from themselves not by proclamation but by force.</p>
