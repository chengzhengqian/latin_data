learn in what human misdoings this dishonour consists. “The games have been performed with laxity, and have been desecrated.” What games? I appeal to you, Lentulus, for to your sacred office belong the processional chariots and cars, the preliminary chant, the games, and the libations and banquets attached thereto, and to you, pontiffs, to whom all faults of ceremonial omission and commission are reported by the sacred stewards of Jupiter Best and Greatest, and upon whose judgement those ceremonies are recommenced and repeated.

You will answer on behalf of yourselves and your colleagues, and indeed of the whole Pontifical College, that there has been no oversight due to anyone’s neglect, no desecration due to anyone’s crime; all the prescriptions and regulations of the games have been observed with irreproachable scruple and punctilious ceremony.</p>
