tribune, let loose a flood of informers from prison upon the forum, him at whose mandate alone the dagger and the poisoned draught go about their work, him who made out the notes of hand with Hermarchus the Chian, whether he has any knowledge of the fact that Theodosius,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL158_361_a" id="target_note_LCL158_361_a"><sup>a</sup></a> the bitterest of all the enemies of Hermarchus, was stabbed with a dagger when acting as the ambassador of a free community to the senate. I am perfectly sure that this act was no less shameful in the eyes of the immortal gods than the murder <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">35</span><span class="br"></span> of the Alexandrians. Not that I now impute all these crimes solely to you.

He would not stain his axes with the blood of outrage; but he defiled the name of the Roman people with outrage so foul, that there are no means of expiating it save by the condign punishment of the perpetrator. What manner of men are we to think are his executioners, when he employs even his physicians not to save life, but to take it?</p>
