above us, and we are enrolled into the citizenship and freedom of a fixed home. Clodius by adopting the name of Fonteius has wiped out the name, the religion, the memory, and the clan of his parents; by his inexpiable crime he has trampled upon the fires of the gods, their thrones, their tables, their enshrined and mystic hearths, and their secret rites, which are forbidden not merely to the gaze but even to the hearing of males; and he has burned the temple of the very goddesses whose gifts are <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">58</span><span class="br"></span> employed to quench ordinary conflagrations<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL158_395_a" id="target_note_LCL158_395_a"><sup>a</sup></a> And what of his dealings with his fatherland? In the first place, by armed violence and by menaces he banished from the city and from all the protection his country could have afforded him a citizen whom you repeatedly pronounced to be that country’s preserver; then, having worked the downfall of one<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL158_395_b" id="target_note_LCL158_395_b"><sup>b</sup></a> whom I have always described as the senate’s friend, and whom he asserted to be its leader, he overturned the senate itself by fire and massacre; he abolished two laws, the Aelian and the Fufian,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL158_395_c" id="target_note_LCL158_395_c"><sup>c</sup></a> which were of supreme service to the state; he swept away the censorship, he removed the right of veto, he annulled the auspices, he equipped the consuls, who were his partners in crime, with funds, provinces, and an army; native governors who were kings he sold, those who were not he so entitled; he drove Gnaeus Pompeius to his house by force of arms, he overturned the monuments of generals,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL158_395_d" id="target_note_LCL158_395_d"><sup>d</sup></a> he demolished the houses of his enemies, upon your monuments he inscribed his own name.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL158_395_e" id="target_note_LCL158_395_e"><sup>e</sup></a> The catalogue of the crimes which he let loose upon his country is without end.
