<p>XII. Accordingly, in the following year, when <span class="marginNote right"><span class="sc">b.c.</span> 359–358</span>
Marcus Popilius Laenas and Gnaeus Manlius were consuls, a hostile expedition set out from Tibur and arrived in the first silence of the night, at the walls of Rome. It was terrifying to be suddenly waked out of sleep by a surprise and a night alarm; moreover
many of the people knew not who their enemies were nor whence they had come; nevertheless the call to arms was quickly given, and watches were set at the gates and the walls were manned. And when the first light showed the enemy before the City to be in no great force, and only the men of Tibur, the consuls sallied out at two gates and assailed them on both flanks as they were now drawing near the walls. It was evident that in coming they had relied more on opportunity than on courage, for they scarcely withstood the first shock of the Roman onset. In fact their expedition was confessedly a good thing for the Romans, and the fear occasioned by so near an enemy repressed a quarrel that was already in the air, between the patricians and the plebs.</p>
<p>Another hostile incursion was more terrifying to the countryside. The Tarquinienses, bent on plundering, ranged over the Roman territory, particularly
that part which adjoins Etruria; and demands
for reparation proving futile, the new consuls, Gaius Fabius and Gaius Plautius, declared war against them, as commanded by the people. This campaign fell to Fabius, that against the Hernici to Plautius.</p>
