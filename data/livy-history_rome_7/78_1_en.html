The men were incensed at Salonius because he had always opposed their mutinous schemes, and had fled from Lautulae that he might not share in them. And so, when this one provision would have failed of enactment by the senate, out of consideration for Salonius, he himself besought the Fathers not to think more highly of his distinction than of harmony in the state, and induced them to pass this also.
