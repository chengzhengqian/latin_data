provided in other plebiscites that no one might hold the same office twice within ten years, nor two
offices in one year; and that it should be legal for both consuls to be chosen from the plebs. If all these concessions were made to the commons, it is evident that the revolt possessed no little strength. Other annalists have recorded that Valerius was not made dictator, but that the whole affair was managed through the consuls, and that it was not before they came to Rome, but in Rome, that this great company of conspirators was dismayed into arming; further, that the night attack was made, not on the farm of Titus Quinctius, but on the town house of Gaius Manlius, and that it was he whom the conspirators seized and made their leader. Thence they proceeded—according to this account—to the fourth milestone, where they entrenched a camp. Nor was it the leaders who suggested a reconciliation, but suddenly, when the two armies had marched out in battle array, salutations were exchanged, and the soldiers, mingling together, began tearfully to clasp hands and embrace each other, so that the consuls, seeing the men to be in no mood for fighting, had been compelled to lay proposals before the senate for the re-establishment of harmony. Thus in no single instance do the ancient authorities agree, except that there was a sedition, and that it was composed.</p>
<p>The report of this sedition, in conjunction with the dangerous war entered upon with the Samnites, caused several nations to forsake their alliance with the Romans, and not only were the Latins unfaithful to the treaty—as they had been for some time—but the Privernates even, in a sudden raid, laid waste the neighbouring Roman colonies of Norba and Setia.</p>
