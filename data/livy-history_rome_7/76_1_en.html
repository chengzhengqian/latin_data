merely towards the plebs. But what have you heard that I said or did, when consul, more tyrannical than my words and deeds as tribune? In that same spirit I administered two subsequent consulships; in that same spirit shall this dictatorship with its dread power be administered; so that I shall be no gentler to these my soldiers and the soldiers of my country, than to you—I shudder to say the word,—our enemies. You shall therefore sooner draw sword on me than I on you. It is on your side that the trumpets will sound, on your side that the battle-cry will be raised and the attack begin, if fight we must. Steel your hearts to do that which neither your fathers nor yet your grandfathers could resolve upon—neither those who seceded to the Sacred Mount, nor those who later encamped upon the Aventine.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL172_507_1" id="target_note_LCL172_507_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Wait until to each of you—as once to Coriolanus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL172_507_2" id="target_note_LCL172_507_2"><sup>2</sup></a>—your mothers and wives come forth from the City with dishevelled hair.

Let your men ask what is reasonable, and receive it; yet must we rather put up with what is not, than join together in impious strife.”</p>
