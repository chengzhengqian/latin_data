This was a new departure for a warlike people, whose only exhibitions had been those of the circus; but indeed it began in a small way, as most things do, and even so was imported from abroad.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL172_361_2" id="target_note_LCL172_361_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Without any singing, without imitating the action of singers, players who had been brought in from Etruria danced to the strains of the flautist and performed not ungraceful evolutions in the Tuscan fashion.
