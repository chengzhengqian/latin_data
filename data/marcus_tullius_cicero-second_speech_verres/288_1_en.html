<p>LXVIII. Now, gentlemen, my only purpose in reading you this
gaol-bird’s letter was that you might learn from it the rules and
principles and methods of the whole gang. You see him instructing Apronius in
the methods he must use and the gifts he must make, so as to worm himself into
favour with Metellus, seduce Volteius, and bribe clerks and attendants into
acquiescence. His teaching is based on experience; he is instructing an outsider
in the wisdom he has learnt himself at home. But he makes one
mistake—in thinking that the one road will lead equally well to the
favour of everyone. I have good reason to be <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">158</span><span class="br"></span>
angry with Metellus; but none the less I will be honest, and say this. So far as
Metellus himself is concerned, Apronius could not seduce him, as he seduced
Verres, by means of money and dinnerparties and women and vile filthy
conversation—methods whereby he had not crept quietly and
imperceptibly into Verres’ affection, but had rapidly secured the
complete mastery of Verres, as a man and as a governor. And as for the staff of
Metellus, to which he refers, why should he try to seduce it, when none of its
members were being appointed to hear charges against the farmers? And when he
says <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">159</span><span class="br"></span> that Metellus has a young son, he is
making a very bad mistake: not all the sons of governors are open to the same
inducements. The son whom Metellus has with him, my good Timarchides, is no mere
boy, but a young man, and an upright and modest young man worthy of the rank and
name he bears; whereas the behaviour of that young boy of yours <a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL293_195_a" id="target_note_LCL293_195_a"><sup>a</sup></a> in Sicily is
