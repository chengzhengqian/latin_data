to secure it, there was no plunder for him to get. He arrived at a plan: and what was it? Oh, nothing ingenious; nothing that anyone could describe as “Dishonest, yes, but clever.” You are to look for no artful dodge, nothing of the wily old bird, from Verres. You will find everything quite plain and obvious, nothing but stupid reckless impudence. “If the ward secures the contract, my prey is<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">142</span><span class="br"></span> snatched from my grasp. How do we stop that, then? How? why, let us prohibit the ward from bidding for it.” What now becomes of the practice, observed universally by consuls, censors, praetors, and even quaestors, in selling property upon personal and landed security<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL221_275_a" id="target_note_LCL221_275_a"><sup>a</sup></a>—the practice of allowing most favoured treatment to the owner of the property, who stands to lose by its sale? Verres here excludes from the right of bidding that person alone to whom alone, one might almost say, the right should be allowed. Why, what does this mean? Can anyone be hoping, or trying, to lay hands in spite of me upon my own money? Here is a contract to be made for doing a repair for which I shall have to pay; and I undertake myself to do it. You, who let out the contract, can see that the work is done properly: personal and real security is given<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL221_275_b" id="target_note_LCL221_275_b"><sup>b</sup></a> to the state: and even if you think the security insufficient, does that mean that you, as praetor, may give anyone you please leave to plunder my property, without allowing me to make a move to protect my own pocket?</p>
<p>LV. It is worth your while, gentlemen, to note<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">143</span><span class="br"></span> the text of the contract: you will recognize the author of that clause in the edict relating to inheritance. <span class="italic">Text of the Contract.</span> “<span class="italic">In the matter of the ward Iunius.</span> . . .” (Kindly read it more distinctly.)
