<p>LXXVII. There is indeed, gentlemen, a new and special fact brought into
prominence by this charge, such a fact as finally confirms the previous charge
connected with the tithes. Even should I let pass the point that a great many
farmers had no corn for that second tithe, for those 800,000 pecks they were to
supply for sale to the Roman nation, and that they had to buy it from your
agent, in other words from Aproniusâ€”which shows clearly enough that
you had left those farmers with no corn at all: even if I pass over this fact of
which many witnesses have given clear evidence, can there be any fact more
certain than that for three years all the corn of Sicily, all the harvests of
the tithe-paying land, were in your granaries and under your control? For when
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">179</span><span class="br"></span> you exacted money from the cities in lieu
of corn, where did you find corn to send to Rome, unless you had it all shut up
under lock and key in your own keeping? Thus the first profit you made from this
corn was that part of the corn itself which you forced out of the farmers, and
the other profit came from the way in which you took all that you so
unscrupulously acquired during those three years, and sold exactly the same corn
not once but twice, and not for one price but two, first to the cities for 15
sesterces a bushel, and then precisely the same corn to the Roman nation, which
you cheated of 21 sesterces for every bushel of it.</p>
<p>It will be argued that you did pass the corn of <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">180</span><span class="br"></span>
Centuripa, Agrigentum, and perhaps some other places as well, and that you did
pay these communities their money. Well, granted that a certain number of cities
belong to the class of those whose corn you consented to pass, what then? were
these </p></section><notes></notes></section>
