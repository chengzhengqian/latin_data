<p>LVIII. But where, on what statues,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">142</span><span class="br"></span> has all that money of yours in fact been spent? It <span class="italic">will</span> be so spent, you will answer. We are to wait, I take it, for the five legal years of grace to elapse; and if he has not so spent it meanwhile, then will come our time to prosecute him for extortion in connexion with these statues! He stands here charged now with a great number of serious offences; and we find that, under this one head, he has laid hold of twenty thousand pounds. If you are found guilty, it will not, I imagine, be your object to have this money spent on statues within the next five years; and if you are acquitted, no one will be such a fool, after your escape from all these grave charges, as to arraign you five years later for your behaviour about the statues. So, if the money has not yet been spent, and if it is also obvious that it is not going to be spent, we can now see that a method has been discovered whereby Verres, in this one department, collected and stole £20,000, and whereby all other governors, if this one’s conduct receives your sanction, will be able to steal as large sums as they choose on the same pretext; so that we shall palpably not be deterring people from stealing, but, by our sanction of stealing of particular kinds, applying respectable names to villainous actions. For surely, if Verres<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">143</span><span class="br"></span> had simply demanded the sum of a thousand pounds from, shall we say, the people of Centuripa, and taken that sum away from them, there could really be no doubt that the proof of this fact must lead to his conviction. Well then, now that he has, from those very people, demanded, extracted, and taken away two thousand pounds, he will surely not be acquitted simply because a note has been added
