<p>XXIII. On arriving at the wealthy, prosperous and <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">50</span><span class="br"></span>
reputable town of Catina, he sent for Dionysiarchus, who was
President—that is to say, the chief magistrate—of the
town, and openly ordered him to see that all the silver plate in all the houses
in Catina was looked out and brought to him. You have heard Phylarchus, by
birth, wealth and character the first man in Centuripa, swear to
Verres’ having ordered him to undertake the task of looking out all
the silver plate in Centuripa—easily the largest and richest
community in all Sicily—and of ordering it to be brought together to
him. In the same way, by his orders, the Corinthian bronzes of Agyrium were
carried off from there to Syracuse by the agency of Apollodorus, to whose
evidence you have listened. And there is something splendid about the way in
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">51</span><span class="br"></span> which our active painstaking governor, when
he reached Haluntium, refused to make the steep and troublesome ascent to the

only in Haluntium but in all Sicily, and gave him instructions to have all the
figured silver plate in Haluntium, and even all the Corinthian bronzes,
immediately carried down from the town to the seashore. Archagathus went up to
the town again. This eminent man, who valued the affection and esteem of his own
people, was much distressed by the task that Verres imposed upon him. But he
could not help himself; he announced the order given to him, and bade everyone
produce their possessions. Great alarm was felt; for his majesty himself was
still close at hand, reclining in his litter on the shore </p></section><notes></notes></section>
