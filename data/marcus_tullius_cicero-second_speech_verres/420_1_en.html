collect evidence against you.—It was next agreed, and not by a small
majority but almost unanimously, to rescind the eulogy already decreed for Gaius
Verres. This resolution had not only been voted upon, but <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">146</span><span class="br"></span> even written out and entered in their records, when notice was
