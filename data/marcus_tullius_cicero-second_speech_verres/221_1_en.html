collector’s summons wherever the collector chose, that he must not
move his corn from the floor before settling terms with the collector, that he
must have his tithes transported to the coast by the first of
August—all these orders I assert that you made in your third year of
office after the tithes were already sold. Had their object been the public

the misfortunes of each of his victims one by one. I will, therefore, by your
leave, merely relate typical instances.<span class="italic">
