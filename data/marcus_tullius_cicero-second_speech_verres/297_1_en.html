Amestratus, Tyndaris, Herbita, and many other cities as well as these. May I ask
what has happened to make the land of these communities, while you are governor,
for the first time in history bear corn of a quality unfit to be passed by you
or by the nation, in spite of the fact that the agents have already conveyed to
Rome, as tithe,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL293_213_a" id="target_note_LCL293_213_a"><sup>a</sup></a> corn grown on the same land in the same year?
What has happened to allow the tithe corn to pass and cause the purchase corn
out of the same barn to be rejected? The whole of this refusal of yours to pass
the corn is quite clearly a scheme devised for extracting money.</p>
<p>Well, well, you refuse to pass the Halaesa corn, <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">173</span><span class="br"></span>
but there is corn from some other nation available, which you can pass. Purchase
the corn that satisfies you, then, and let those go whose corn you have refused

exact a sum of money enough to purchase the amount of corn you ordered them to
supply.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL293_213_b" id="target_note_LCL293_213_b"><sup>b</sup></a> I see, from the public records of Halaesa, that
the city paid you 15 sesterces for every bushel. I will prove, from the accounts
of the wealthiest farmers, that no one in Sicily sold his corn at that time for
more than that.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL293_213_c" id="target_note_LCL293_213_c"><sup>c</sup></a></p>
<p>LXXV. Now what sort of scheme, or rather what
sort of madness, have we here? You refuse to pass corn grown in the place from
which the Roman Senate and people said they would have it purchased, corn taken

to buy good corn elsewhereâ€”a loan to be repaid later from the
