Gentlemen, it was simply a special new device for securing plunder. The poets
tell us of men who infested inlets of the sea, or occupied precipitous cliffs or
headlands, so as to be able to kill seafarers who were wrecked there: Verres,
with a like purpose, threatened every part of the sea from every point in
Sicily. Every ship that arrived from Asia or Syria, from Tyre or Alexandria, was
promptly seized by his special band of spies and watchmen: the voyagers were all
flung into the Stone Quarries, the cargoes and merchandise were carried off to
the governor’s residence. After long years Sicily was once more the
prey—no, I will not say of a Dionysius, of a Phalaris, of one of the
many cruel tyrants the island once produced, but rather of a new and monstrous
creature, as savage as those that are said to have haunted those regions in
ancient days. Indeed, I conceive that neither Charybdis nor Scylla <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">146</span><span class="br"></span> was as dangerous as he was to the mariners navigating
those straits; he was more dangerous, because he had girt himself about with

Cyclops only occupied Aetna and the adjoining regions.</p>
<p>And what reason for this abominable cruelty was put forward by Verres at the
time? The same, gentlemen, as that which will be brought up by his advocates
now. All persons who landed in Sicily with any considerable store of goods he
