favour of a worthless woman? Sulla, for whose benefit the people of Rome passed
a law that gave his own will and pleasure the force of law, is nevertheless
condemned, in this single matter, by the solemn sanctions of the laws of old;
and yet have you, a man liable to punishment for breaking every law in the
