happened, then? Did you wish to save writing-paper?—No; the fool
never thought of it; he imagined that robbing a cupboard would be less noticed
than robbing a chapel. And how was the robbery effected? I cannot tell you this
more clearly than Heius himself has told it to you. When I asked him if any of
his other possessions had passed into Verres’ hands, he replied that
Verres had sent him word to send the tapestries to him at Agrigentum. I asked if
he had sent them; he replied, as he was bound to reply, that he had obeyed the
governor’s orders, and had sent them. I inquired if they reached
Agrigentum; he told me that they did. I asked how they came back to him; he
stated that so far they had not come back. The audience laughed; and you,
gentlemen, were all startled.—Now did it not then occur to you,
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">28</span><span class="br"></span> Verres, to order Heius to enter in his books
the sale of these things too to you for £65? Were you afraid of
running into debt if you paid £65 for what you could easily sell for
£2000? I assure you, it would have been worth doing; you would have
had a defence to offer; no one would have inquired what the things were worth;
if only you could state that you bought them, you would easily have justified
yourself and your behaviour in anyone’s eyes; whereas now you have no
way of clearing yourself about these tapestries.</p>

nobly-born Phylarchus of Centuripa in the matter of the beautifully wrought
bosses that are said to have belonged once to King Hiero? Did you simply take
them, may I ask, or did you buy them? What I was told when I was in Sicily, both
by the Centuripans </p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL293_313_a"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL293_313_a" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">a</sup>For a purely nominal price.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL293_313_a').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
