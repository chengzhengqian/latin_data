seen such men decorate the Forum and colonnades not with the plunder of our
provinces but with the treasures of their friends, with what their hosts had
lent them and not with what their guilty hands had stolen; and none the less did
they return these statues and art treasures to their several owners. They did
not carry them off from the cities of our friends and allies, pretending, as
aediles, to be borrowing them for a four-day festival, and then transport them
to their own town-mansions and country-houses. But Verres, gentlemen, carried
off <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">7</span><span class="br"></span> all the statues I have mentioned from the
chapel of Heius; I assure you, he left not one of them behind, nor indeed
anything else except one ancient figure of wood, which I believe represented
Good Fortune—this he was not by way of having in his house.</p>
<p>IV. What, in the name of all that is just and holy, have we here? Was ever such
an impudent rascal accused of such a thing before? Until the statues I speak of
were carried off by you, no governor ever came to Messana without going to see
them. Of all those governors of Sicily, praetorian and consular, in time of
peace and in time of war; of all those governors, good and bad—nay,
passing over the honest, the blameless, the conscientious, I will speak only of
the greedy, the immoral and the unscrupulous; of all these men, not one
conceived himself so determined, so powerful, or so illustrious, as to venture
to demand, to remove, to lay one finger upon, any object in that chapel. And
shall Verres carry off from place after place the most beautiful things that it
holds? shall no one else be suffered to keep anything? shall all those wealthy
houses go to fill his single house </p></section><notes></notes></section>
