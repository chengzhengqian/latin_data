Sentenced, do I say? name me one against whom a claimant sought to proceed under
the terms of your edict. It would appear that none of the farmers could complain
of illegal treatment; that none of the collectors claimed a grain more than was
really due to them. So far from that, Apronius used to seize and carry away as
much corn as he chose from everyone, and all over the country there were farmers
declaring that he had robbed and plundered them; and in spite of that, it will
be found that no actions were brought against him. Now what <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">30</span><span class="br"></span> does this mean? why did all these fine, honourable,
influential men,—all these Sicilians, all these Roman
knights—after being thus injured by this dirty scoundrel, why did
they not seek to exact the eightfold penalty that without question had been
incurred? Why was it? what was their reason? They had one reason,—and
you, gentleman, see what it was. It was that they knew they would lose, and
would come away from the hearing mocked and insulted into the bargain. For
indeed, what manner of hearing would it have been that a trio of these so-called
Judges of Claims sat down to conduct, satellites of Verres taken from his filthy
and vicious following, men not even passed on to him by his father, but
recommended to him by his wretched mistress? The farmer would have been pleading
his <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">31</span><span class="br"></span> case, of course, relating how Apronius had
left him no corn at all, how his belongings had been plundered as well, how he
himself had been cudgelled and beaten. Those worthy gentlemen would have been
putting their heads together, talking about some drunken revel, or about the
chance of getting hold </p></section><notes></notes></section>
