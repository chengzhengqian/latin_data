All that corn is extorted and handed over by your orders. That is not
enough: a money payment is ordered as well. The payment is made—and
<span class="italic">that</span> will not do. A further sum of money is extorted
for the tithes of barley, for which you order the presentation of a bonus of
£300. And so we find this tyrannical governor, by the use of threats
and violence, officially robbing a single town of 33,000 bushels of wheat and
£600<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL293_89_d" id="target_note_LCL293_89_d"><sup>d</sup></a>
into the bargain.</p>
<p>Are these things hidden? Could they be hidden, though all the world should seek
to hide them? You have done them openly. The people of the district heard your
orders given. Your extortions were effected before the eyes of the public. The
officials and the five chief citizens of Agyrium, whom you hailed into court in
order to enrich yourself, went home and reported your actions and your orders to
their own senate. That report, in accordance with the local law, was entered in
their public records. The men of high standing who represent them are here in
Rome, and have stated in the witness-box what I have stated here. I ask the
Court to listen to <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">74</span><span class="br"></span> that official entry in the
records, and then to the official evidence of the town.—Read them,
please. <span class="italic">The passage from the town records, and the official
evidence of the town, are read aloud</span>.—You will have noticed,
gentlemen, when these witnesses were speaking,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL293_89_e" id="target_note_LCL293_89_e"><sup>e</sup></a>
how Apollodorus Pyragrus, the chief citizen of his community, wept as he
gave his evidence.
