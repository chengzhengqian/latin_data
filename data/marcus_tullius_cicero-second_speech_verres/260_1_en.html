the lowest figure, since we are reckoning 90,000 bushels as the amount, we must
add 90,000 sesterces (£900) for this villainous innovation.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL293_139_a" id="target_note_LCL293_139_a"><sup>a</sup></a>
And now will the <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">117</span><span class="br"></span> man still dare to tell me that
he sold the tithes for a high price, when he has appropriated for himself double
the amount that he sent from the same area for the use of the Roman
people?—You sold the Leontini tithes for 216,000 pecks. A high price,
if your methods had been legal; but if they were such as to make your own wanton
pleasure the test of legality—such as to make the nominal 10 per cent
into 50 per cent—then the price was a low price, for the
year’s harvest in Sicily could have been sold for a much higher
price, had the Senate and People of Rome bidden you do thus.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL293_139_b" id="target_note_LCL293_139_b"><sup>b</sup></a>—And in fact the tithes have often been sold for as much,
under the code of Hiero, as they have now been sold for under the code of
Verres.—Let us have, if you please, the record of tithe-sales under
Gaius Norbanus. <span class="italic">The statement is read</span>.—And yet
men were not then prosecuted for the returns of acreage they made; nor was
Cornelius Artemidorus a judge of claims; nor had the local magistrate to make
the farmer pay over whatever amount of corn the collector announced was due; nor
was the collector entreated to be so very kind as to agree to a settlement at
three bushels an acre; nor was the farmer compelled to pay additional fees in
cash or supplementary percentages of corn. And in spite of that, plenty of corn
used to be sent for the use of Rome.</p>
<p>L. What, too, is the meaning of those percentages <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">118</span><span class="br"></span> and those additional fees in cash? By what legal right, or indeed by what
moral right, did you exact </p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL293_139_a"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL293_139_a" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">a</sup>As before, the <span class="italic">accessio</span> was probably demanded as an
