his manager for making his farm bring in so large a return. But when he heard
presently how everything on which the fertility and cultivation of his farm
depended had been taken off and sold, he would think himself badly treated, and
would punish that manager most severely. Not otherwise does the Roman nation,
when told that Gaius Verres has sold the tithes for more than his upright
predecessor Gaius Sacerdos, imagine itself to have had a good caretaker and
manager in charge of its cornlands and its harvests. But when it is fully aware
that Verres has sold all the farmers’ gear and all our sources of
revenue; that his greed has bereft us of all hope for the years to come; that he
has converted our revenueproducing farms and fields into a barren and empty
desert; and that by his robberies he has made vast profits for himself: then it
will recognize that it has been treated most foully, and will hold the man <span class="italic">to</span> deserve the severest punishment.</p>
<p>LI. How, you may ask, can the truth of what I <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">120</span><span class="br"></span>
say be recognized? Most clearly from the fact that, owing to Verres’
greed, the tithe-paying lands of the province of Sicily were deserted. What
happened was not merely that those who did stay on their land continued their
farming on a much smaller scale,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL293_143_a" id="target_note_LCL293_143_a"><sup>a</sup></a> but that a great
many well-to-do men, the active cultivators of extensive properties, abandoned
their broad and fertile acres, and left their farms completely derelict. The
truth of this statement can be confirmed with ease from the public records of
the various communities, because by a law of the code of Hiero an official
return of the number of farmers is made to the local magistrates every year.</p>
