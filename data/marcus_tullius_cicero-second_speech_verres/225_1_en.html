to the other there were these onslaughts from the collectors, these plunderings
of the farmers; the savagery of Verres, and the tyranny of Apronius. Verres
despised the Sicilians—thought of them as hardly
human—believed that they themselves would show no vigour in seeking
satisfaction, and that you would hear of their wrongs with little concern.</p>
<p>XXIV. Well, well; he had a false conception of them,	<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">59</span><span class="br"></span>
and an unflattering conception of you; but at least, ill as he served the
Sicilians, of course he courted the Roman citizens there, was indulgent to <span class="italic">them</span>, did his best to satisfy and conciliate <span class="italic">them</span>. Did he indeed? Why, he hated them and persecuted
them beyond all other men. I say nothing of the chains and prisons, of the
floggings, of the executions; I pass over the crucifixion whereby he sought to
express to the Roman citizens his clemency and goodwill towards them; of all
these things, I repeat, I say nothing—I reserve them for another part
of my speech. I am discussing corn-tithes, and the treatment of Roman citizens
on their farms; and how they were handled, gentlemen, you have heard from their
own lips; they have told you how they were robbed. Still, in so <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">60</span><span class="br"></span> good a cause,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL293_69_a" id="target_note_LCL293_69_a"><sup>a</sup></a>
such things must be endured—that justice should go for nothing,
and established custom for nothing; and as for material injuries, gentlemen,
none are so serious that a brave man, a man of high and generous disposition,
finds them unendurable. But what now if, while yonder man was governor, Roman
knights—not obscure and unknown, but eminent and distinguished Roman
knights—had violent hands laid upon them by Apronius without the
smallest hesitation? Is that not enough for you? is </p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL293_69_a"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL293_69_a" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">a</sup>Presumably the enrichment of Verres.
