full: for in the course of the few hours during which the first part of this
trial lasted, I made the whole world pronounce Verres guilty. What still remains
on trial? Not my honesty—that has been approved; not
Verres’ conduct—that has been condemned. It is the members
of this Court; and also, to be candid, it is yourself.—</p>
<p>And now, in what circumstances is that trial to take place? this is a point that
deserves the most serious thought; for in politics, as in everything else, the
position and tendency of affairs at any given time is of great practical
importance. It will take place, as you are aware, at a time when the nation is
eager to transfer judicial authority to a new type and class of man, and when
the text has been published of a bill for reconstituting the courts and their
membership. Now the publication of this bill is not really due to the person<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL293_665_a" id="target_note_LCL293_665_a"><sup>a</sup></a>
whose name you see attached to it; it is the work of the man who stands accused
before you; it is this man’s hopes of your help, this
man’s estimate of your character, that have caused this bill to be
drafted and published. It had not been published <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">178</span><span class="br"></span> when this case began; there was no talk of it at the time when Verres,
intimidated by your stern demeanour, had told us, by many indications, why he
meant to offer no defence; the moment of its publication was immediately after
he was observed to have recovered his spirits and confidence. That you are so
distinguished a body of men is a strong argument against its becoming law; it is
the illusory hopes and extravagant impudence of Verres that secure it most
support. Let any member of this Court be guilty of any kind of reprehensible
conduct, </p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL293_665_a"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL293_665_a" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">a</sup>The praetor Lucius Aurelius Cotta.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL293_665_a').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
