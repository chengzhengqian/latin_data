in his official capacity, he has pronounced, as he was charged and required to
do; though, even so, you remember his reply when he was questioned about that
cargo-ship—that the workmen who built it were got together officially
and employed officially, and that a Messanian senator had been officially put in
charge of its building. This same man, gentlemen, as a private person, implores
your help, appealing to that common stronghold of our allies, the law under
which this Court is constituted.—But though that law provides for the
recovery of moneys extorted, he tells us that his aim is not to recover the
money that was extorted from him—he feels this a relatively trifling
loss: it is his sacred family heirlooms that he seeks to recover, it is the gods
of his house and his fathers that he bids you, Verres, give back to him. Have
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">18</span><span class="br"></span> you no sense of shame? no fear of God? no
concern for your safety? You have stayed at Messana in Heius’s house,
you have seen him perform divine service in his own chapel before those gods
almost every day: well, the loss of his money does not trouble him, nor indeed
does he so much long for the objects that were purely decorative—keep
his Basket-bearers if you will, but restore to him the images of his
gods.—And because he said this; because, the opportunity being
offered him, this friend and ally of Rome quietly submitted his grievance to
this Court; because his fear of heaven inspired not only his demand for the gods
of his fathers but the very evidence that he gave as a witness upon oath: you
must know that Verres has sent back to Messana one of the deputation, the very
man who was officially put in charge of the building </p></section><notes></notes></section>
