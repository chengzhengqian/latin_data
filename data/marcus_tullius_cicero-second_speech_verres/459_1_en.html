I repeat, was the invariable practice, and not in Sicily only, but in all our

Verres was the first person since our empire was established to require all this

difficult and troublesome task that at the same time exposed you to suspicion
and charges of misconduct.—Other devices for making money were then
set going; and observe, gentlemen, how many the fleet alone supplied:
communities would pay him to exempt them from having to supply sailors; he would
