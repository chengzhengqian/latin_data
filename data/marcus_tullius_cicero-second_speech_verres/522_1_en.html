dangerous than you suppose. Because you
are consul <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">175</span><span class="br"></span> elect and have held all the other
offices of state, you may think yourself absolved from anxiety for your
reputation; but believe me, it is as hard a matter to keep as it was to gain
these honours that the Roman people has graciously bestowed upon you. The
country endured the despotic control by you and your friends<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL293_663_a" id="target_note_LCL293_663_a"><sup>a</sup></a> of the
law-courts and of public affairs generally, so long as it was possible and
necessary to endure it; but on the day on which the tribunes of the plebs were
given back to the Roman nation, all this power, though you may not yet be aware
of the fact, was at one blow taken away from you. At this very moment, the eyes

from the straight path, be it never so little, and the result will not be the
silent disapproval that you and your friends have been accustomed to ignore, but
vehement and outspoken condemnation at the hands of the Roman people.
Quintus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL293_663_b" id="target_note_LCL293_663_b"><sup>b</sup></a> this man is not your kinsman, he is not your
personal friend; of the pleas by which you have often in the past, in one trial
or another, excused your lack of impartiality, none are at your disposal in your
defence of Verres. When he was governing his province he used to say, openly and
frequently, that he was doing what he was doing because he had confidence in
you; and unless you are very careful, it will be thought that he had good reason
for saying so.</p>
