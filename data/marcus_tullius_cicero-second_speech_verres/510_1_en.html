satisfaction of this Court that
Herennius had been a Sertorian.</p>
<p>LX. What shall be said of those who were led forth <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">156</span><span class="br"></span> in large numbers to be executed, among the captured pirates, with their heads
covered?—What is the meaning of this novel precaution of yours, and
what made you devise it? Can it be that you were shaken by the cries of distress
that your treatment of Herennius drew from Flavius and the others? Or was it the
deep respect felt for the strong character and high standing of Marcus Annius
that made you a little less careless and reckless than usual? I mean the Annius
who a day or two ago testified on oath that a man who was no casual foreigner
just come from abroad, but a Roman citizen born at Syracuse and known to all the
Roman citizens in Syracuse, was beheaded by your orders.—After those
men’s outcry, <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">157</span><span class="br"></span> after that outrage had
become known to and resented by everyone, Verres proceeded to execute his
victims not indeed less brutally than before, but more cautiously; he took to
having his Roman citizens led forth to die with their heads covered, while
having them nevertheless put to death in public because the people in that
district, as I have already told you, were making an inconveniently careful
estimate of the number of pirates missing.—Was this the treatment
decreed for honest Romans, when you were governor of Sicily? was this the
prospect that their occupation afforded them? was this all the respect in which
their rights and their lives were held? Are the perils and accidents that all
traders must inevitably face so sadly few that such further terrors as these
must threaten them, in Roman provinces and at the hands of Roman
governors?— </p></section><notes></notes></section>
