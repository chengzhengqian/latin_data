in the market-place at Syracuse—I
say this lest I should by some chance be thought to be charging Verres with
something of which no one knows, and building up a case out of circumstantial
evidence——in the market-place at Syracuse, I repeat, with
tears in his eyes calling on God and man to be his witness, the prince in a loud
voice declared that a lamp-stand wrought of precious stones, which he was
intending to send to the Capitol, and which he had meant to be a lasting token
in that most famous temple of his own alliance and friendship with the Roman
nation, had been taken from him by Gaius Verres; he was not concerned for his
other works of art, in gold or precious stones, that were in Verres’
hands, but that this one should be taken from him was a shame and a scandal.

been consecrated, yet he declared that then and there, before that assembly of
Roman citizens, he gave and offered it, hallowed and consecrated it, to Almighty
and Most Gracious Jupiter, and called the divine Father himself to witness his
solemn and sacred purpose.</p>

which had always had the friendliest relations with his father, his grandfather
and his ancestors, the ancient and famous sovereigns of a rich and mighty
kingdom; and this man was now flung out headlong from a Roman
province.—What feelings did you suppose <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">68</span><span class="br"></span>
