regard themselves as bound to Rome not only by permanent alliance and friendship
but also by ties of blood. Long ago, when Segesta was independently at war with
Carthage on its own account, the town was assaulted, captured and destroyed by
the Carthaginians, and everything in it that might add-to the beauty of the city
of Carthage was carried away thither. There was in the town a bronze image of
Diana, regarded from very ancient times as highly sacred, and moreover, a work
of art of extremely fine workmanship. Its removal to Carthage was no more than a
change of home and worshippers; the reverence formerly felt for it remained, for
its exceptional beauty made even an enemy people feel it worthy of the most
devout adoration. In the third Punic War, some centuries <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">73</span><span class="br"></span> later, Publius Scipio captured Carthage. In the hour of
victory—I would have you observe his scrupulous uprightness, that you
may rejoice in the noble patterns of upright conduct that our countrymen afford
to us, and may hold Verres’ incredible lack of scruple the more
detestable on that account—knowing that Sicily had repeatedly and for
long periods been ravaged by the Carthaginians, he called all the Sicilians
together, and ordered a general search to be made, promising to do his utmost
for the restoration to the several communities of all that was once theirs. Then
it was that the treasures formerly removed from Himera were, as I have already
related, given back to the people of Thermae; others to Gela; others to
Agrigentum, including the famous bull said to have belonged to Phalaris, the
most cruel of all tyrants, in which he tortured men by thrusting them into it
alive and lighting a fire underneath it.</p>
