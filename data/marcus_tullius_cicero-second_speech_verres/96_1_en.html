thieving but the precise names of his victims, let me put some evidence before you that may help you to appreciate the unique quality of his unscrupulous behaviour.</p>
<p>The day he landed in Sicily—mark how Rome’s<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">19</span><span class="br"></span> prophetic interpretation of his name was borne out by his full preparations to sweep the province clean on arrival—he promptly sent off from Messana to Halaesa a letter which I conceive he had written in Italy, for he dispatched it the moment he had stepped ashore. In this letter he summoned Dio of Halaesa to appear before him without delay; he intended, he said, to investigate a legacy received by Dio’s son from a relative, Apollodorus Laphiro. This legacy,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">20</span><span class="br"></span> gentlemen, was a very large sum of money. Dio, you should know, has now the rank of a Roman citizen, conferred on him by Quintus Metellus; and it was he, as was made clear to you at the first hearing of this case by the personal and written evidence of a number of witnesses of high standing, by whom the sum of ten thousand pounds was paid over to secure from Verres a judgement in his favour on an issue admitting not the smallest shadow of doubt. Besides this, his herds of thoroughbred mares were taken from his fields, and his house plundered of all the silver and tapestries it contained. Thus Dio lost ten thousand pounds simply through having received a legacy. Now who was praetor<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL221_313_a" id="target_note_LCL221_313_a"><sup>a</sup></a> when this legacy came to Dio’s<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">21</span><span class="br"></span> son?

Then did no one make trouble for Dio at that time? No one, any more
