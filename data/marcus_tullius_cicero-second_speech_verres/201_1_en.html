forbidding the
guardians and relatives of a minor to take steps to save him from being stripped
of all he possessed; you who cut down the time allowed for completing a
contract, in order to debar everyone else from undertaking it, while not holding
your own contractor to any fixed period at all. I am <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">17</span><span class="br"></span> consequently not surprised that you should have devised a new law
for corn-tithes, after showing so much judgement, and gaining so much
experience, with praetors’ edicts and censors’
regulations: I am not surprised, I repeat, at your working out some such idea.
The charge that I do as prosecutor bring against you is that you tampered with
the rights of the Sicilian province on your own responsibility, without orders
from the people of this country or the authority of the Senate.</p>
<p>During the consulship <span class="italic">
<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL293_21_a" id="target_note_LCL293_21_a"><sup>a</sup></a>
</span> of Lucius Octavius and <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">18</span><span class="br"></span> Gaius Cotta, the
Senate did authorize the sale at Rome, hitherto always conducted in Sicily by
the quaestors, of the right to collect tithes of wine, oil and minor crops, and
made for this business such regulations as it thought fit. When notice of sale
was given, the tax-farmers asked the Senate to make certain additions to these
regulations; all of them, be it noted, in accordance with the regulations made
by the censors for our other provinces. This request was opposed by a man who
happened to be in Rome at the time—a man who was your host, Verres;
your host, I repeat, and your familiar acquaintance—Sthenius of
Thermae, now here present. The consuls held an inquiry; and after consulting the
most eminent and important men in Rome, they declared that in accordance with
these men’s advice they would have the sale conducted in accordance
with the law of Hiero.</p>
