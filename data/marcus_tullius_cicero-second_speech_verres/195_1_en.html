the most
sacred thing in life help hating a man who, being as quaestor admitted to his
consul’s secrets, given the charge of his money, trusted in every
way, then did not scruple to rob and desert him, to betray him and fight against
him? Can one who reverences modesty and chastity contemplate with indifference
that man’s daily adulteries, his school of mistresses and his
household of panders? When one who seeks to maintain the sanctions of religion
meets this universal plunderer of sanctuaries, this shameless maker of profit at
the expense even of the wheels of the sacred coaches, how can he fail to hate
him? Shall one who believes in equal justice for all not be your bitter enemy,
Verres, when he thinks of your judicial pronouncements, shifted to suit your
wanton pleasure? Shall one who deplores our allies’ wrongs and our
provinces’ misfortunes feel no resentment towards you for stripping
Asia, and making havoc of Pamphylia, and plunging Sicily into tears and
mourning? Shall one who would have the rights and liberties of Roman citizens
held sacred everywhere not inevitably be your enemy, and more than your enemy,
when he remembers how you dealt with Roman citizens, scourging them, beheading
them, setting up crosses to crucify them? Why, had the man by some <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">7</span><span class="br"></span> decision of his in some respect wronged me in my private
purse, you would allow, Hortensius, that I was justified in hating him: his
whole career has wronged the purses and attacked the principles, damaged the
interests and outraged the feelings, of every honest man—and then do
you ask why I should hate this man who is loathed by the Roman nation? I, of all
men, who must be ready to serve the nation’s will by undertaking even
heavier tasks </p></section><notes></notes></section>
