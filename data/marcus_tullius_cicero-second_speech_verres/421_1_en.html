Syracusans to furnish me with a copy of their decree of the day before. He
firmly refused, adding that I had behaved improperly in addressing a Greek
senate: and to have talked to a Greek audience in its own language was, it would
appear, something quite intolerable. I made the only answer that I could or
should or would have made. I remember telling him, among other things, that it
was easy to discern the difference between this Metellus and that true and

and entertainers at Syracuse, or entirely defenceless and abandoned. A man
called Theomnastus took the tablets and held on to them—an amusingly
