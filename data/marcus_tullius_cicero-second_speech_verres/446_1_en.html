then—but when, as I say, your election was declared, did not the very
sound of the crier’s voice, as he announced your endowment with that
high office by the votes of all those senior and junior divisions of the
electors, arouse in you the feeling that you had been entrusted with a share in
the government of your country, and for that one year must cease to frequent a
harlot’s dwelling? When the lot gave you the duty of administering
the law, did you never reflect how troublesome, how burdensome this duty was,
nor consider—if it were possible for you so far to come to your
senses—that functions hard enough to discharge with the help of
exceptional wisdom and integrity had been assigned to the most foolish and
corrupt of men? No; and so far from forbidding Chelidon your house during your
year of office, you transferred your office bodily to the house of Chelidon.
Then came your provincial government, during which <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">39</span><span class="br"></span> it never crossed your mind that those rods and axes, that crushing weight of
authority, that position of majestic splendour, were not given you in order that
you might use their force and their authority to break through every barrier of
decency or duty, or that you might treat all men’s property as your
prey, or that it might be impossible for anyone’s possessions to be
safe, anyone’s house secure, anyone’s life defended, or
anyone’s chastity guarded, against your cupidity and your
unscrupulous wickedness. Such, throughout that period, has been your conduct
that you must seek refuge, in this argument about a slave rebellion, from the
conviction that your unqualified guilt ensures you. And now you are aware that
this is so far from providing you a defence </p></section><notes></notes></section>
