same sculptor who made the
similar Cupid at Thespiae which is what people go to Thespiae to see, there
being no other reason to go there. I may add that the celebrated Lucius Mummius,
though he took away from that town all the unconsecrated statues, including the
“Ladies<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL293_287_a" id="target_note_LCL293_287_a"><sup>a</sup></a> of Thespiae” now standing beside the
