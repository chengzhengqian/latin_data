had instructions from his senate
to buy the tithes, or he would have bought them <a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL293_109_a" id="target_note_LCL293_109_a"><sup>a</sup></a>: if, then, he had
no such instructions, how can he have paid that money of his own free
will?—Well, he reported that he had paid this money to Cassius: you
shall hear his <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">89</span><span class="br"></span> report as entered in the records
of the town.—Read it, please. <span class="italic">It is
read</span>.—By what order of the town senate was its representative
authorized to do this? No such order was given. Why, then, did he do it? He was
forced to do it. Who says he was forced to do it? The whole
community.—Read us the official evidence. <span class="italic">It is
read</span>.—The year following, money was extorted from this same
town in a similar fashion and given to Sextus Vennonius, as you have already
learnt from this piece of evidence. And after selling the tithes of these people
of Amestratus—who were poor men, remember—for 800 bushels
to the temple slave Bariobalis (do but note the names of these taxfarmers!) you
forced them to add a bonus that came to more than the sale price of the tithes,
high as that price was. They gave Bariobalis 850 bushels, plus £<span class="italic">15</span> in money. Most certainly Verres would never have been
such a lunatic as to allow a temple slave to receive a larger share of corn,
grown on Roman soil, than went to the Roman people, unless all that plunder,
nominally the slave’s, came to Verres himself in the end.</p>
<p>The tithes of Petra were knocked down at a high <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">90</span><span class="br"></span>
figure: but none the less, very much against its will, Petra was forced to pay
£520 to an utter scoundrel called Publius Naevius Turpio, who was
found guilty of assault and battery during the praetorship of Sacerdos. Do you
mean to say that you sold those tithes so recklessly that they went for 3000
bushels </p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL293_109_a"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL293_109_a" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">a</sup>The reasoning is, that Verres cannot claim that the transfer of the tithes
was voluntary, a substitute for that purchase at the auction which the town
had instructed him to effect. <span class="italic">Had</span> it been voluntary,
the payment of the bonus would have been voluntary too.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL293_109_a').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
