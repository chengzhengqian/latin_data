Tyndaris, and to the province as a whole, were the most recent and extensive,
ordered Sopater to be set astride on it and bound fast to it—Sopater,
a man of high rank in his community, and the holder of its highest office. It
must be evident to all what agony <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">87</span><span class="br"></span> he underwent,
bound naked to the metal surface amid all the rain and cold. Yet this cruel
outrage continued until the cries of the whole crowd of the assembled people,
overcome by the brutality of the deed and their pity for its victim, forced the
senate to promise Verres the statue of Mercury. The gods above, they cried,
would one day avenge their own wrongs: meanwhile an innocent man must not be
allowed to die. Thereupon the senate in a body waited upon Verres, and promised
him the statue; and so it was that, already nearly frozen stiff, Sopater was
removed half-dead from the statue of Gaius Marcellus.</p>
<p>I cannot, if I would, prosecute Verres in any systematic fashion: to do so would
require no mere ability, but a quite exceptional ingenuity.</p>
<p>XLI. This <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">88</span><span class="br"></span> matter of the Mercury of Tyndaris may appear to be a
single charge, and as such do I put it forward; but it is in fact a group of
charges, and I do not know how I can distinguish them or treat them separately.
I may charge him with extorting money, for he has robbed our allies of a statue
worth much money; with public embezzlement, for he has not scrupled to carry off
a statue that belonged to the Roman nation, was part of the plunder taken from
Rome’s enemies, and was erected by the authority of a Roman general;
with treason, for he has dared to pull down and remove from the country a
memorial of our country’s </p></section><notes></notes></section>
