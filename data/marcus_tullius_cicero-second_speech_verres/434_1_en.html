 the facts of which
are more notorious throughout Sicily, or more shameful, or more unmistakable.
Upon reaching Panhormus, Verres sent for him—issued, indeed, an
official summons against him, in the hearing of a large and crowded gathering of
the Roman community.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL293_487_a" id="target_note_LCL293_487_a"><sup>a</sup></a> At once people began to talk like this:
“I was wondering how a well-to-do man like Apollonius had escaped our
friend yonder so long; he has thought out some scheme or other, and got it
going; it certainly means something when Verres suddenly issues a summons
against a rich man.” Everyone was waiting anxiously to know what was
afoot, when Apollonius suddenly hurried in, breathless with anxiety, and
accompanied by a young man who was his son—his old father had been
bedridden for some time. Verres named a slave who was, <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">17</span><span class="br"></span> he said, Apollonius’s head shepherd, and alleged that he
had formed a conspiracy and had been stirring up the slaves on various estates.
There was in fact no such slave at all on the estate of Apollonius. Verres,
however, ordered him to be produced; and when Apollonius insisted that he had no
slave at all of that name, Verres gave orders to run him out of the court and
throw him into prison. As they were hurrying him off, the poor wretch kept
crying out that he was innocent, that he had done no wrong, that all his money
was invested and he had no ready cash available. It was just when he was
proclaiming this fact in the hearing of a large crowd, so that anyone could see
that this cruel wrong was being done to him simply because he would not pay
up—it was, I say, just when he was calling out thus about his money
that he was thus thrown into prison.</p>
