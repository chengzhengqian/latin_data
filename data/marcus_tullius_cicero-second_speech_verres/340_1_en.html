indeed the foremost of their citizens. Will not his loyalty to his public duties
make him silent<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL293_299_a" id="target_note_LCL293_299_a"><sup>a</sup></a> about his private wrongs? Though I saw this and
took account of it, <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">16</span><span class="br"></span> gentlemen, I ventured none

Halaesus and Tyndaris, Henna and Agyrium and all the other cities of Sicily, are
conspiring to overthrow you? It is your own Messana that does
this—your second home, as you used to call it—your own

debaucheries, harboured the proceeds of your thefts and robberies. Her most
eminent citizen is here with us, sent hither to attend this trial, </p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL293_299_a"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL293_299_a" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">a</sup><span class="italic">Ne forte . . . reticeat</span> is best taken as depending on
