the Rupilian statutes, and most strictly of all those that relate to judicial procedure: then could you dare to let all these solemn facts count for nothing when balanced against the prospect of plunder for yourself? Could law and conscience, sense of shame and fear of judgement, be so utterly banished from
your mind? Could you let no man’s opinion weigh with you, no man’s actions make you follow his example?</p>
<p>But to resume my narrative: defying the law and<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">41</span><span class="br"></span> the constitution, allowing no challenges and drawing no lots, he appointed these five judges, choosing the men he wanted, not to investigate the facts, but to give the verdict he bade them give. That day nothing was done; they were summoned for the day 
following.</p>
<p>XVII. Heraclius meanwhile, seeing that every sort of treacherous device to undo him was being employed by the chief magistrate, took the advice of his friends and kinsmen, and resolved not to appear in court. That night, accordingly, he fled from Syracuse. The following morning Verres rose much earlier than he had ever risen before, and ordered the court to be summoned. On learning that Heraclius was not present, he proceeded to direct the judges to find against the defendant by default. They requested him to be good enough to follow his own regular practice, and to wait till four o’clock before directing a judgement by default in favour of the party present; and this he allowed. In the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">42</span><span class="br"></span> interval he was a good deal upset, both he and his friends and counsellors beginning to feel troubled because of Heraclius’s flight. They felt that a judgement against him by default, especially with so large a sum involved, would cause far more ill-feeling than if he had been present when the judgement was given.
