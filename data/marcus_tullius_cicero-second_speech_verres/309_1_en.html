attack it. We may well think the man who behaves thus a greedy fellow: to
prosecute him on this account is less easy, for it is held that our magistrates

therefore is a thing that, I dare say, has been done often enough: though not so
often but that the truly scrupulous men of whom we know or have heard have

which sort of behaviour you think of comparing the behaviour of Verres.
Doubtless, with the behaviour of those whose good-nature made them grant to the
communities, as an act of grace and favour, permission to pay cash instead of

sesterces a peck, asked leave to pay cash instead of corn at the rate of 12

those two places; I know how long the journey takes; I know that it suits the
