the Messanians from this duty
also, light and universal though it was. You will tell us that the Messanians
were not bound to supply corn. In what sense not bound to supply it? Not bound
to sell it to us? This kind of corn was not the kind to be exacted as a tribute,
but the kind to be bought and paid for. I see: if we are to take your opinion
and accept your explanations, the Messanians were not bound to assist the Roman
nation even by trading and doing business with it. Then pray what community

further demanded from them the 60,000 pecks that you had let the Messanians
keep. And I do not mean to say that it was wrong to require these supplies from
all the other towns. What I do say is this, that the Messanians were on the same
footing as the rest; that all previous governors had required corn from them as
from the rest, and had paid them for it as is directed by the decree of the
Senate and the law concerned; and that therefore it was wrong to let them
off.</p>
