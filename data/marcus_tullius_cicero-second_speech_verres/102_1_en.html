praetor, exercising his authority without appeal, were to appoint the members of the court as he chose, and a worthless and irresponsible court were to give the verdict that the praetor said must be given. And if in addition to this the praetor<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">31</span><span class="br"></span> states the issue in such a form of words that not even a man so well versed in the law and in his duty as (shall we say) Lucius Octavius Balbus could, as a member of the court, alter the issue in his verdict—if the directions to the court are of this type, <span class="italic">Case to come before Lucius Octavius: If it shall appear that Publius Servilius is the lawful owner by Roman law of the estate at Capena in question And if the said estate shall not be restored to Quintus Catulus, etc.</span>,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL221_325_a" id="target_note_LCL221_325_a"><sup>a</sup></a> will not Octavius, as judge of the Court, have to compel Servilius to “restore” the estate to Catulus, or failing that have to inflict an unjustified penalty?

His courts were composed, if the parties were Sicilians, of Roman citizens, though the law of the country required the appointment of Sicilians; and of Sicilians, if the parties were Roman citizens.
