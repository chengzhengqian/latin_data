hoping—though I have sought nothing of the kind—to advance
myself at the expense of this one man Verres, then his acquittal, which can only
occur if a great many men have acted like criminals, will indeed enable me to
advance myself at the expense of those many.</p>
<p>LXVIII. But the truth is, gentlemen, that for your sake, and for the sake of our
country, I would not have so grave an offence committed by a body of men so
carefully chosen as yourselves; I would not have the members of this Court, whom
I have myself selected<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL293_661_a" id="target_note_LCL293_661_a"><sup>a</sup></a> and approved, going about in our city so defiled

take place within those walls, if you think to pervert the course of justice in
any way by the help of artifice or ingenuity or power or favouritism or
Verres’ money, then I counsel you earnestly to forgo your purpose;
and as for the attempts at corruption which Verres has already set going, and
which I have tracked down and discovered, I advise you to crush them and let
them go no further. Misconduct in this trial will be very dangerous to yourself,
