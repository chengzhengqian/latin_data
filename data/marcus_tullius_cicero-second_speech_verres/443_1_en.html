as this was a great military leader? do you seek to screen his thefts and
robberies, his greed and cruelty, his arrogance and impudence and wickedness,
with eulogies of his great deeds and his fame as a commander? Are we now to
fear, as your speech for the defence nears its close, that you will bring into
