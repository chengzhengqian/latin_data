The clerk’s share in the business is not so laborious or so valuable
as to entitle him to receive, in addition to his salary, so large a share of the
money itself. “The clerk’s profession” you tell
us “has a high standing.” Who denies that? and what has it
to do with the matter in hand? It has, in fact, a high standing because its
members are entrusted with the public accounts and the reputations of our
magistrates. Go then to those clerks who are worthy members of their profession,
honest and reputable family men, and ask them what those two-fiftieths
deductions mean. You will soon find that all of them regard the whole thing as a
scandalous innovation. But please let me refer the question <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">184</span><span class="br"></span> to such clerks as these. Do not consider the men who

playhouse rowdies to the second rank in the public service. On the charge before
us you and I must take the opinion of clerks who resent the membership of such
men as that: though the fact is that, when we find a number of unfit persons in
a profession intended for men of industry and character, we can hardly wonder
that some people should disgrace themselves in a position that is open to anyone
who will pay for it.—</p>
<p>LXXX. As for you, Verres, when you confess that
your clerk appropriated £13,000 of public money with your consent,
can you conceive that any further defence of yourself is possible? can you
