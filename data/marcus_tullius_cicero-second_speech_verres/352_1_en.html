Timarchides to reckon up the value of the silver, and to undervalue it as
thoroughly as any man ever did when making a present to an actor.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL293_323_a" id="target_note_LCL293_323_a"><sup>a</sup></a>—But really it is absurd of me to have spoken at such length
about your purchases, and asking whether you did or did not buy this or that,
and how you bought it and how much you paid for it, when a single word will
settle the matter. Produce me a <span class="italic">written</span> statement of the
silver plate you acquired in Sicily, and of the vendor and price of the several
articles. Well? Not that I ought to <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">36</span><span class="br"></span> be asking
you for such documents: I ought to have your accounts already and to be
producing them. Well, you tell us that for a part of these three years you have
kept no accounts. Come, satisfy my request so far as the silver is concerned,
and perhaps I may forgo the rest. “I have no statement written, and I
can produce none.” What is to be done about it, then? What do you
suppose the members of this Court can do? Even before you became praetor, your
town house was full of beautiful statues, many more were placed in your
country-houses, many more stored in the houses of your friends, many more
presented as gifts to other people; and you have no accounts to show that any of
them were bought. All the silver plate in Sicily has been swept off, nothing
left to any man that he would care to have called his own. The disreputable
defence is concocted that our governor secured all this silver by purchase, and
there are no written accounts by which even that can be proved true. If in such
accounts as you do produce there is no entry to show how you come to possess
what you do possess, </p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL293_323_a"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL293_323_a" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">a</sup>The law that prescribed the maximum value of such presents might be evaded by
