hear that, from a man so distinguished as Marcus Octavius Ligus in position and rank and name, in character and ability and fortune, he did not hesitate to demand a bribe in return for his decision in court?</p>
<p>XLIX. His conduct in dealing with the maintenance <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">128</span><span class="br"></span> of public buildings I need hardly describe. Some of his victims have already described it, and there are others who can. Facts, notorious and convincing, have been produced, and more shall follow. The knight Gnaeus Fannius, own brother of the Quintus Titinius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL221_261_a" id="target_note_LCL221_261_a"><sup>a</sup></a> who is one of your judges, has testified to his having paid you money. Read the evidence. <span class="italic">Evidence of Gnaeus Fannius.</span> Gentlemen, do not believe what Fannius says: Quintus Titinius, do not, I repeat, believe what Gnaeus Fannius your own brother says. For he says what is unbelievable; he is attempting to charge Gaius Verres with unscrupulous greed for money—a charge that we feel is appropriate to anyone else rather than to him. We have heard Quintus Tadius, an intimate friend of Verres’ father, and not unconnected, by birth and name, with Verres’ mother: Tadius has produced his own accounts, showing that he has paid money to Verres. Read these. <span class="italic">Accounts of Quintus Tadius.</span> And this. <span class="italic">Evidence of Quintus Tadius.</span> Are we not to trust the accounts, or the evidence, even of Tadius? What, then, do we mean to go upon in trying a case? If we should set everyone free to commit every kind of offence and injury, how otherwise should we do it than by refusing to accept the evidence given by respectable persons, and the accounts kept by honourable gentlemen?</p>
<p>And now how shall I deal with a thing that was<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">129</span><span class="br"></span> day after day the subject of indignant discussion
