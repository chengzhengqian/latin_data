loot.—And further, why <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">202</span><span class="br"></span> is this
commutation system of yours to be applied to corn of one description only, if it
be a just and a tolerable system? Sicily has to pay tithes of corn to Rome: why
not let her keep the corn and pay us 12 sesterces for every peck of it? You
received one sum of money to buy corn for your own maintenance, and another sum
to buy corn from the Sicilian communities and send it to Rome. The money
received for your own purposes you keep, and you appropriate a very large
additional sum that you allege to be due to yourself. Very well. Treat in the
same way the corn due to the Roman nation, exact money at the same rate from the
communities, pay the proceeds into the Roman treasury—and the Roman
treasury will be fuller than it has ever been before.
“Yes,” <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">203</span><span class="br"></span> you may reply,
“but in connexion with the national corn Sicily could not have borne
the strain, whereas in connexion with my own corn she has borne it.”
Why, is your system of commutation fairer when it profits yourself than when it
profits the nation? What I suggest involves a larger sum of money than what you
have done involves, but the injustice is of precisely the same kind.</p>
<p>But the truth is that the Sicilians cannot possibly bear the strain even of your
own maintenance. Even if all else were conceded them—even if they
were delivered henceforth from all the disastrous wrongs they have suffered
during your years of office—even so, they tell us, they cannot
possibly bear the strain of your maintenance and your commutations.</p>
