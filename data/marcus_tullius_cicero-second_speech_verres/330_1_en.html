pleasantness of the life rather than the profits actually earned. Year by year
so much labour and so much money is definitely expended for an indefinite and
variable result. Further, the market-price is never high unless the harvest is a
failure; when an abundant crop has been gathered in, a low selling price is the
consequence; so you find that in a good year you have to sell cheap, and if you
can sell for a good price you have had a bad harvest. And farming is throughout
a thing whose profits depend not on intelligence and industry but on those most
uncertain things, wind and weather. Since from those profits one tithe is
deducted by law and ancient custom, and by recent legislation another tithe is
exacted because of the scarcity of corn, and every year a further amount of corn
must be sold to the government, and lastly, still more is demanded for the
maintenance of our magistrates and their assistants, how much power is left to
the farmer and owner to dispose freely of his own crop, and how much of the crop
itself is left free for him to dispose of? <a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL293_279_a" id="target_note_LCL293_279_a"><sup>a</sup></a> And if they endure
all these exactions—if <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">228</span><span class="br"></span> their toil
and expense and labour serve you and your country better than them and their own
advantage—must they also endure these unheard-of edicts and demands
issued by our governors, the tyranny of men like Apronius, the thefts and
robberies of temple slaves? instead of selling their corn, must they supply it
for nothing? even when they are eager to supply maintenance corn for nothing,
must they pay a vast sum of money as well? and must they even submit to having
all these forms of damage and loss accompanied by the most unjust and insulting
treatment? </p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL293_279_a"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL293_279_a" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">a</sup>The text (<span class="italic">quid aut quantum . . . solutum?</span>) is obscure
