precluded from the plea by means of which
you have always counted on being able to cover up all your thefts and
rascalities—the plea that you sold the tithes dear, that you
forwarded the interests of the Roman populace, that you took steps to make corn
plentiful. That cannot be said by a man who cannot deny that he sold the tithe
of a single district for 30,000 pecks less than he might. So that even if I

been saying, and I hope with all my heart that you will offer this
defence)—but even granted this, you still cannot proclaim as a
glorious achievement your sale of the tithes at a high price, when you admit
that there was a man ready to pay a much higher one.</p>

already proved, and proved unmistakably. And now, if what I have been saying is

Verres had turned into his own friends by means of his own famous Universal
Elixir, a summons was issued against Apronius to appear before the governor. It
was issued by Gaius Gallus, a man of high rank and a senator, who applied to
Metellus for permission to prosecute Apronius, in accordance with the
governor’s own edict, on the charge of “Robbery with
Violence or Intimidation,” a form of action, instituted by
Octavius,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL293_185_a" id="target_note_LCL293_185_a"><sup>a</sup></a> which Metellus had accepted as valid when in Rome
