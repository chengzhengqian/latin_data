Verres that even if he were not an honest man we should attach importance to
anything he said against him, and who is so honest a man that even if he were
Verres’ worst enemy his evidence ought to be trusted. Our friend is
surprised, I see, and wonders what <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">167</span><span class="br"></span> Vettius
means to say. He will say nothing devised for this occasion, nothing intended to
suit his own purposes, though he might, surely, have said either with propriety.
