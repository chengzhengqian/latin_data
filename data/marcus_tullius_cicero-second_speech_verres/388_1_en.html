the token of his honour the
means of torturing the very men who thus honoured him? And as to the future,
what, may I ask, did you think would happen to your own
statues?—Perhaps what did happen to them: he had ordered the people
of Tyndaris to erect a statue to him near those of the Marcelli, on a still
loftier pedestal, and as soon as they heard that his successor had arrived, they
threw it to the ground.</p>
<p>XLII. Well, the good fortune of Sicily has assigned
Marcellus as one of your judges: under your governorship, Sicilians were bound
to his statue; and now we deliver you, yourself bound hand and foot, for him to
do justice upon you.</p>
<p>I may add, gentlemen, that Verres originally <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">91</span><span class="br"></span>
asserted that the people of Tyndaris had sold this statue of Mercury to Marcus
Marcellus Aeserninus, who is here in court, and that he hoped, moreover, that
Marcus Marcellus himself would support him by saying so. It never seemed likely
to me that a young man of his rank, who was a protector of Sicily, would thus
lend his name for the purpose of shifting the charge off Verres’
shoulders. In any case, I have had the foresight to take such complete
precautions in this affair that, however eager we might find Marcellus to take
upon himself censure and prosecution for what Verres did, he would be bound to
fail completely. I have brought over witnesses from Sicily, and brought with me
written documents, that will make the facts of Verres’ conduct clear
to everyone. There are <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">92</span><span class="br"></span> official statements that
the Mercury was conveyed to Messana at the public expense; they will tell you
what that expense was, and that one Poleas was officially appointed to see to
this business. And where is Poleas? here in court, as a witness.</p>
