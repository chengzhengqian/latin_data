there was war in Italy, so close to Sicily,
and yet in Sicily there was none. Is that remarkable? in just the same way, when
there was war in Sicily, equally close to Italy, nothing of it crossed over to

prove? that our enemies could easily enter Sicily? or that there was a danger of
the infection of revolt spreading to it? For men wholly unprovided with ships,
