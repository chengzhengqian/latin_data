are far fewer than they
were; but they stayed, fearing to lose, if they went, all the means of
livelihood yet left them. But you will find that those whom Verres had left with
nothing to lose fled not only from their farms but from their countries. Even
those who remained on their farms, a bare tenth of the whole number, intended to
go, and would have gone, had not Metellus told them in a letter from Rome that
he would sell the tithes as required by the code of Hiero, and entreated them to
sow as freely as possible—as they always had done on their own
account, without anyone’s asking them to do it, so long as they could
feel that they were sowing seed, and spending money, and working hard, to
benefit themselves and the Roman nation instead of Verres and Apronius.</p>
<p>And now, gentlemen, though you pay no heed to <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">122</span><span class="br"></span>
these Sicilians’ fate, and the treatment of Roman allies by Roman
magistrates cause you no concern, yet I bid you accept the task of protecting
the common interests of the Roman nation. I assert that those farmers have been
driven out by Verres, that the lands that produce our revenues have been ravaged
and converted into desert, that our province has been despoiled and devastated.
I establish the truth of these assertions by the written statements of the
towns, I demonstrate it by the official evidence of the most important of these
towns and by the private evidence of the most notable individuals.</p>
<p>LIII. What more would you have? Do you expect that Lucius Metellus, who used his official
authority to deter many other persons from giving evidence against Verres,
should nevertheless himself testify from Sicily to Verres’ shameless
and criminal wickedness? </p></section><notes></notes></section>
