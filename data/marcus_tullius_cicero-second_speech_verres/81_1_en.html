1st of December, or a week later, or a fortnight later: in fact Verres had left for his province some time before the work was completed. After his prosecution, he first said for some time that he could not certify that the work had been duly carried out; then, when Habonius pressed him, he referred him to me, saying that I had the memorandum-book under seal. Habonius asked me for it, and sent his friends to support him: his request was granted at once. Verres did not see what to do. If he refused to give the certificate, he thought he might thus have some sort of defence for himself<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL221_283_a" id="target_note_LCL221_283_a"><sup>a</sup></a>: but then he was aware that Habonius was likely in that case to expose the whole business—though what could be clearer than it now is? To have one less witness against him, he gave Habonius his certificate—in the fourth year after the date prescribed for the completion of the work!
