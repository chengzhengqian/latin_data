you will find this novelty in Verres’ case, gentlemen. We have heard of a man’s never keeping any accounts; that is what is widely believed about Antonius,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL221_185_a" id="target_note_LCL221_185_a"><sup>a</sup></a> though incorrectly, for he kept very careful accounts; still we may admit that this sort of tiling occurs, and it is far from satisfactory. We have also heard of a man’s not keeping accounts to begin with, but doing so from a certain date onwards; and that too one can to some extent understand. But what we have here is a ridiculous novelty: I demanded his accounts, and he told me that he had kept them duly up to the consulship of Marcus Terentius and Gaius Cassius,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL221_185_b" id="target_note_LCL221_185_b"><sup>b</sup></a> but stopped keeping them after that.

of this elsewhere; for the moment I am not concerned with it, as I have both your own accounts, Verres, and your father’s, for the period with which I am now dealing. You cannot deny that you brought away a large number of beautiful statues and a large number of fine paintings. I only wish you would deny it! Show me the record, either in your own accounts or your father’s, of your buying a single one of these things, and I surrender. You cannot show that you have bought even those two beautiful statues which are standing now beside the rainpool in your hall, and stood for many long years before the doors of Juno in Samos—those two, I mean, that are now left lonely in your house, waiting for the dealer,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL221_185_c" id="target_note_LCL221_185_c"><sup>c</sup></a> deserted and abandoned by all the others.</p>
<p>XXIV. But we are no doubt to understand that<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">62</span><span class="br"></span>
it is in these directions only that the man’s greedy desires were free from all restraint or control, and that there was some limit or check imposed upon
