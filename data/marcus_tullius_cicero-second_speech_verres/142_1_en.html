have heard what that distinguished young champion of Sicily, Gnaeus Lentulus, had to tell you about this: that when the Sicilians were putting before him the issue on which he was to support their interests in the Senate, they denounced the treatment of the unhappy Sthenius, and that it was precisely this wrong done to Sthenius that made them resolve to present the petition I speak of. In the face of all this, how could<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">104</span><span class="br"></span>
you be possessed with such frantic recklessness as to alter an official document that stated a fact so clearly true, so fully confirmed, and by your own action so widely known? And how did you effect the alteration? Why, in such a fashion that your own tablets would be enough to convict you without a word said by any of us here. Let us have the volume, please; carry it round, and show it to the Court. Do you see, gentlemen, how the whole passage that states that Sthenius was there when prosecuted is written over an erasure? What was written there before? what was the slip corrected by that erasure? Why should this Court feel that we must prove this charge? We hold our tongues; the documents are before you, proclaiming themselves altered and interpolated. Do you think to escape our pursuit here, where we are<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">105</span><span class="br"></span> tracking you with the help not of vague conjectures but of your own footprints, left clear and fresh on this official document? Do I find that the man who without trial convicted Sthenius of altering an official record is a man who cannot deny that, dealing with this same Sthenius, he has altered an official record himself?</p>
<p>XLIII. Next note another piece of folly; note how,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">106</span><span class="br"></span>
trying to free himself, he entangles himself further. He assigns Sthenius an attorney; and who is it?
