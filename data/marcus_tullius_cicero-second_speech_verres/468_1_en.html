country; the enemy of Rome is to be preserved as a prisoner in a private house!
Why, even triumphing generals, who keep enemy leaders alive for some time in
order to have them led in the triumphal procession, so as to enable the people
of Rome to enjoy the fine sight and reap the reward of victory—even
they, as their chariots swing round to leave the Forum for the Capitol, bid
