believes in consequence that all
governors are amenable to the same methods.—Why did you rascals find
it such child’s-play to get what you wanted out of Verres? Because
you had so varied an acquaintance with the little chap’s
games.—“Metellus and Volteius have had it impressed upon
them that it was you who ruined the farmers.”—Who ever
blamed Apronius for it, when he ruined this farmer or that? or blamed
Timarchides, when he took a bribe to secure some verdict or decree, or to get
someone ordered to do this or excused from doing that? or blamed Sextius the
lictor, when he cut off the head of this or of that innocent man? Nobody:
everyone blamed then the man whom they hope to see found guilty
now.—“People have dinned it into his ears <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">157</span><span class="br"></span> that you were in partnership with the
governor.”—Now can you see, Verres, how obvious that fact
is and has been, when even Timarchides is thus afraid of it? Will you admit that
this charge against you is no invention of ours, but one to meet which your
freedman has, for months past, been trying to discover some defence? Your
freedman and attendant, a man joined by the closest ties of every kind to you
and your children, says in a letter to Apronius that the partnership of Apronius
with yourself in the tithe business is a fact to which everyone has repeatedly
drawn attention. “Make him see what rascals the farmers are. They
shall sweat for it themselves, D.V.” What, in God’s name,
are we to make of this violent and savage hatred of the farmers and what has
aroused it? What great wrong have the farmers done Verres, that even his
freedman and attendant should feel and write with so much fury against them?</p>
