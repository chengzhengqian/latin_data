us descriptions of the beauty of these doors. Perhaps they admire and extol such
things unduly; well, granted that they do, still, it is more creditable to our
country that what they think beautiful should have been left in their keeping by
the commander of our army in war-time than that it should be taken from them by
our governor in time of peace. Upon those doors were various scenes carved in
ivory with the utmost care and perfection: Verres had all these removed. He
wrenched off, and took away, a lovely Gorgon’s face encircled with
serpents. With all this, he showed that it was not only the artistic quality of
these objects but their cash value that attracted him; for there were a number
of massive golden knobs on these doors, all of which he carried off without
hesitation; and it was not the workmanship but the weight of these that appealed
to him. And thus he left those doors in such a state that, instead of serving as
before chiefly to adorn the temple, they now seemed to have been made only to
shut it up. Even those reed <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">125</span><span class="br"></span> spears (I noticed,
gentlemen, that you were much interested by the evidence of a witness on this
point), things without any art or any beauty, or anything but their incredible
size—which it is quite enough merely to hear of, and more than enough
to see more than once—did your greed, Verres, extend even to
this?</p>

of course, may very reasonably be defended: it almost seems an action that
deserves to be allowed and overlooked. To this choice and highly-finished
