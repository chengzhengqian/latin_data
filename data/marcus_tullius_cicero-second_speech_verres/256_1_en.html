<section class="div1 language" lang="en"><header><hgroup><h1>Against Verres</h1></hgroup></header><section class="div2"><p class="noindent">Mnasistratus, you are not to expect to see
the rest of the citizens here, who cannot suffer agriculturally even from the
weather, let alone from Apronius. Indeed, they have not only suffered no harm
from those Apronian forays; they have been by way of making a positive profit
out of them.</p>
<p>Since, therefore, for the reason given, no support, <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">110</span><span class="br"></span> no representatives from the city of Leontini have come to help me,
I must devise my own plan, and discover a way for myself of arriving at the
facts about the gains made by Apronius, or rather, about our
governor’s gigantic and monstrous depredations. In his third year of
office, the tithes on that district were sold for 36,000 bushels; that is, for
216,000 pecks. A high price, gentlemen, a high price: I certainly cannot deny
that. It must follow that the collectors who paid it have lost, or at least made
very little by it: that is the usual fate of those who pay a high price. What
then if I prove that on <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">111</span><span class="br"></span> this single transaction
the buyer made a profit of one hundred—of two hundred—of
three hundred—of four hundred thousand pecks of wheat? can you feel
doubtful any longer whose were the coffers into which the proceeds of this vast
robbery went? It may be thought unfair to argue from the size of the profit to
the fact of theft and robbery. Well then, gentlemen, what if I prove that those
who gained 400,000 pecks would have <span class="italic">lost</span> but for the
intervention of your gross injustice, Verres, and of your Court of Claims chosen
from your staff? In the face of such profits and such injustice, will it not be
at once clear to everyone that your wickedness was the cause of your vast
profits, and the vastness of the profits the motive of your wickedness?</p>
