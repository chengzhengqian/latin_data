<p>IX. You utter fool, what did you look for? That <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">19</span><span class="br"></span>
your request would be granted? Did you not know how much Heius was valued, and
how greatly he was respected, by his fellow-citizens? And suppose that your
request shall be granted; suppose that the Messanians agree to inflict some
heavy penalty upon Heius: how much weight do you expect to be attached to their
eulogy of you, after their decreeing the punishment of the man who has
admittedly spoken the truth as a witness? But, in any case, it is a poor sort of
eulogy when cross-examination is bound to turn your eulogist into your enemy.
And are not your eulogists my witnesses? Heius is your eulogist, and his
evidence has done you the gravest harm.—Suppose I call the others:
they will be glad to hold their tongues so far as they can, but they will say
what they must say, however reluctantly. Are they to deny that a large
freight-ship was built for Verres at Messana? Let them deny it, if they can. Are
they to deny that a Messanian senator was officially put in charge of the
construction of that ship? I should like to hear them do that. Nor is this all;
but of what remains I prefer to say nothing at present, wishing to afford these
persons as little time as may be for the concoction and corroboration of false
evidence.—And now, is this an eulogy likely to <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">20</span><span class="br"></span> chime in with your purposes? are such men as these capable of
giving you impressive support? men who should not help you if they could, and
could not help you if they would; men whom you have wronged and insulted as
individuals again and again, and in whose town you have brought lasting shame on
family after </p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL293_303_a"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL293_303_a" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">a</sup>ἀτιμία evidently on the ground of misconduct as
