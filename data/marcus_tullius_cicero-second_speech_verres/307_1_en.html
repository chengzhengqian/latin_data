<p>LXXXI. I have now dealt, gentlemen, with the <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">188</span><span class="br"></span>
tithe corn, and I have dealt with the purchased corn: it only remains for me to
deal with the commuted corn. This is a matter where the great sum stolen, and
the foul wrong done, may well stir any man’s heart to anger: and all
the more so because this charge is being met not with any ingenious proof of
innocence, but with an unblushing avowal of guilt. Verres was entitled, by law
and by decree of the Senate, to receive corn for his own maintenance <a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL293_233_a" id="target_note_LCL293_233_a"><sup>a</sup></a>;
and whereas the price fixed by the Senate for this corn was four sesterces for a
peck of wheat and two for a peck of barley,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL293_233_b" id="target_note_LCL293_233_b"><sup>b</sup></a> he added his
amount of barley to his quantity of wheat,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL293_233_ca" id="target_note_LCL293_233_ca"><sup>c</sup></a> and then required
the farmers to commute this corn for money at the rate of twelve sesterces <a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL293_233_d" id="target_note_LCL293_233_d"><sup>d</sup></a>
for a peck of wheat.—The charge is not that he took money instead of
corn, Hortensius: it is vain for you to contemplate replying that many good
upright honest men have many a time set a price on the maintenance corn due to
them from farmers or from communities, and instead of their corn taken their
money. I know what is usual; I know what is permissible; and there is here no
attack upon any part of Verres’ action that has hitherto been part of
honest men’s customary behaviour. The attack I do make is this: that
whereas <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">189</span><span class="br"></span> a peck of wheat was then locally worth
2 sesterces

strictly honest, or else (by an abuse which, since Cicero says no more
of it, must have been recognized) he reckoned each peck of barley as a
peck of wheat. The calculation was, in any case, merely the first step in stating the amount
of money claimed instead of corn of any kind.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL293_233_ca').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL293_233_d"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL293_233_d" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">d</sup>4 <span class="italic">sestertii—</span> 1 <span class="italic">denarius.</span></a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL293_233_d').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
