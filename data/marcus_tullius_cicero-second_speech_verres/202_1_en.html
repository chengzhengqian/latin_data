<p>VIII. Here is a contrast indeed! These men of ripe <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">19</span><span class="br"></span> judgement, whose opinions all must respect, to whom the Senate had given, and
the Roman People confirmed, full authority to make regulations for the sale of
these tax-collecting rights—these men, because a single Sicilian
protested, refused to change, even nominally, the law of Hiero, though to do so
meant increased returns from taxation. And yet you, who are a man of no
judgement, whose opinions no one respects, have without any authorization by
Senate or People abolished the law of Hiero completely, immensely lessening, if
not altogether ending, the productiveness of the taxes, and this in the face of
protests from the whole of Sicily.</p>
<p>And I bid you note, gentlemen, the character of <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">20</span><span class="br"></span>
the law with which he tampers, which in fact he wholly abolishes: note the
ability and care with which it was framed. It subjected the farmer to all
possible safeguards, and gave the tax-collector such power over him that,
whether the corn were in the field, or on the floor, or in the barn, or being
taken to the coast, or being exported, he could not, without incurring the
heaviest penalties, defraud the collector of a single grain. The carefulness of
this law’s provisions shows that its author had no other resources of
taxation; their shrewdness shows him a Sicilian, their severity an autocrat.
None the less, it would be in the interests of the Sicilian farmer; for
carefully as the rights of the tithe-collector are secured by it, the farmer
cannot be forced to hand over more than the amount of the tithe.</p>
<p>And now after all these years, nay, centuries, <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">21</span><span class="br"></span>
behold, Verres has arisen, not merely to interfere with these admirable
arrangements, but to overthrow </p></section><notes></notes></section>
