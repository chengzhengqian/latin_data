recent years they have been treated? Then why am I wasting my labour here, why
do you still sit on, why do you not rise and go while I am still addressing you?
Would you, on the other hand, do something to reduce the unscrupulous and
unprincipled villainy of such men as that? Then waver no longer between the

done,” his hearers expect to be told of precedents drawn from the
annals of the past, recorded by the sculptor’s chisel and the
historian’s pen, clothed with all the dignity of bygone days; for
