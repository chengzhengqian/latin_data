of the crews as still remained on duty
were undermined by lack of food and all other necessaries. I affirm that none of
them were to blame; or, if blame must be held to attach to one of them, that it
should have been assigned chiefly to the man who had the most efficient and
well-manned ship and was in command of the whole fleet; or else, if they were
all to blame, that Cleomenes should not have been put among the spectators while
the rest were put to a cruel death. And I also affirm that in actually executing
them it was a monstrous thing to charge fees to their weeping friends, fees for
the blows that mangled them, fees for the right to be buried in a grave. If,
therefore, you choose to answer my <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">135</span><span class="br"></span> charges,
what you must say is this: that the fleet was fully manned and equipped, none of
the marines away from duty, none of the oars towed along<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL293_615_a" id="target_note_LCL293_615_a"><sup>a</sup></a> for lack of
oarsmen, plenty of corn on board; that the statements of the captains, the
statements of all those responsible cities, nay, the statements of all Sicily,
are falsehoods; that Cleomenes, when he told us how he went ashore at Pachynus
to take soldiers aboard from there, was guilty of a treacherous lie; that what
the captains needed was not more men, but more courage, and that they abandoned
and deserted Cleomenes while he was fighting the enemy bravely; that nobody was
paid a penny for the burial of the dead. And if you do say this, you will be
proved a liar; whereas if you say anything else my charges against you will be
unanswerable.</p>
<p>LII. Will you now still dare to say “So-and-so <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">136</span><span class="br"></span> among my judges is my personal friend, and so-and-so is a friend
of my father’s”? The more closely a man is connected with
you, the more ashamed you </p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL293_615_a"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL293_615_a" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">a</sup>Not astern, but hanging from the rowlock pegs, probably.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL293_615_a').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
