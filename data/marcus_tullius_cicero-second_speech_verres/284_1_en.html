the application, on the ground that he was unwilling, by allowing the case to be
heard, to have judgement pronounced in advance on the capital charge now being
brought against Verres. The whole of his staff showed their gratitude<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL293_187_b" id="target_note_LCL293_187_b"><sup>b</sup></a>
by appearing to support Apronius; and Gaius Gallus, a senator like yourselves,
was refused leave, in spite of his close acquaintance with Metellus, for a trial
that was authorized by the governor’s edict. I do not blame Metellus:
he did his best for <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">153</span><span class="br"></span> a man who was his friend,
and indeed—as he has himself said in my hearing—his
intimate friend. I do not <span class="italic">blame</span> Metellus, I repeat; but
what does surprise me is this: when he refused to allow that court to pronounce
an advance judgement on Verres, how could he help thereby pronouncing an advance
judgement himself, nay, a final judgement of the most weighty and emphatic kind?
For, in the first place, if he thought Apronius would be acquitted, he had no
reason to be afraid of any advance judgement; and in the next, if, Apronius
being found guilty, everyone would regard the fate of Verres as bound up with
his, Metellus at any rate was certainly pronouncing the judgement that the fate
and fortunes of the two men were bound up together, when he laid it down that
the conviction of Apronius would be an advance judgement of Verres. And we find
at the same time one fact proving two other facts—that the farmers
were forced or terrified into giving Apronius far more than was due from them,
and that Apronius was acting nominally for himself but really for
Verres—when we find Metellus certain that the conviction of Apronius
must carry with it the condemnation of Verres’ criminal
wickedness.</p>
