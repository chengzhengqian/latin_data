To what end has
Sicily been our near neighbour and loyal dependency, the home of our faithful
allies and our honoured countrymen? to what end has she always gladly welcomed
every citizen of Rome who would dwell within her borders? Has it been only for
this, that men who were sailing back from the furthest coasts of Syria and
Egypt, whose Roman dress had procured them no small measure of honour even among
barbarous peoples, who had escaped the clutches of lurking pirates and the
perils of storm and tempest, should fall slain by the headsmanâ€™s axe
in Sicily when they felt themselves already safe at home?</p>

be spoken! Nay, of sorrow, indeed, my heart has no lack; rather it is voice and
eloquence wherewith I must strive to equip myself in a measure befitting my
theme and the sorrow that I feel. Such is the charge I now bring that when I was
first told of the facts I could not see myself making use of them; aware though
I was of their complete truth, I could not imagine that they would be believed.
Constrained by the tearful entreaties of all the Roman citizens who are business
men in Sicily, and encouraged by the testimony of the worthy inhabitants of
Vibo<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL293_641_b" id="target_note_LCL293_641_b"><sup>b</sup></a> and by that of the whole population of Regium, and by that of a
number of Roman knights who as it happened were at the time in Messana, in the
first part of this trial I called no more witnesses than might suffice to
convince everyone of the facts. What am I to do now? <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">159</span><span class="br"></span> Hour after hour I have been handling the single topic </p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL293_641_a"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL293_641_a" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">a</sup>The name and position of this Italian <span class="italic">municipium</span>
