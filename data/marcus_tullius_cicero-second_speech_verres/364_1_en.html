of such men as this who have really
earned the name of prosecutor, by running their thefts to earth with no more
than their scent or their faintly-traced footmarks to guide them. What does my
own chase of Verres <a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL293_347_a" id="target_note_LCL293_347_a"><sup>a</sup></a> amount to—this hog, the print of whose
whole body shows me where he has been wallowing in the mud? It is indeed a
formidable undertaking to assail a man who, as he passes by a town, has his
litter set down for a while, and then, not by sleight of hand, but by the open
use of his official power, by a single official decree, plunders the whole town,
