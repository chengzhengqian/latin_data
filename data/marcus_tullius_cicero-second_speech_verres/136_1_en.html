arrived in the afternoon at the hour appointed, and ordered Sthenius to be summoned. Finding that his victim was absent, in a wild outburst of disappointed fury he dispatched police-messengers to the house of Sthenius, and sent others off on horseback to make the round of his estates and farm-houses; and he waited so long for news from these men that the evening was half gone before he left the courthouse. The next morning he arrived early, sent for Agathinus, and bade him prosecute Sthenius for forgery in his absence.

The words were hardly out of his mouth when Verres pronounced sentence, “Sthenius is found guilty of forgery of an official document”: to which this devotee of Venus added, without any usage or precedent to support him, “I will exact as penalty the payment of £5000 from the estate of Sthenius to Our Lady of Eryx;” whereupon he took steps at once to have the belongings of Sthenius sold up; and sold up they would have been, had there been the smallest delay in paying him that £5000. The payment completed,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">94</span><span class="br"></span> he was not satisfied with this outrage of justice. From his chair of office on the tribunal he announced publicly that if anyone should think fit to prosecute Sthenius in absence on a capital charge, permission to prosecute would be granted; and with that he began urging his new host and connexion, Agathinus, to come forward and undertake such a prosecution.
