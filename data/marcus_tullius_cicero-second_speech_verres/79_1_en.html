moved up to each of those pillars that you can now see freshly whitened; they were taken down and replaced, without further expense, stone for stone as before. This was the undertaking for which your contractor received £5600! Yes, and I assert that of those pillars there are some that he never touched: I assert that there is one from which he merely scraped off the old stucco<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL221_279_a" id="target_note_LCL221_279_a"><sup>a</sup></a> and applied fresh.
