the fact is that they had not only better brains than the advocates of to-day but also better luck. For in those days no man was such an offender that no grounds were left for a defence of him; no man lived so evil a life that every part of it was utterly foul; no man was caught misconducting himself so unmistakably that the shamelessness of his act would be thought less than the shamelessness of his denying it.

do? Is he to palliate the charges of greed against his client by eulogizing his respectability? Why, that client is an immoral, licentious, filthy scoundrel. Is he to divert your attention from his scandalous immorality by dwelling upon his bravery? Why, a lazier man, a greater coward, a fellow who so plays the man among women and the degraded contemptible woman among men, is not to be produced anywhere. Is it said that he is good-natured? No one is more rude and unfeeling and overbearing. Is it said that his bad points do no hurt to anyone? No one was ever more harsh and treacherous and brutal. With such a client, and with such a case, what would any Crassus or Antonius do? So much as this, surely, Hortensius: they would not undertake the case at all, nor lose their name as men of honour for the sake of a man who sticks at nothing.
