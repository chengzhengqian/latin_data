<p>XXI. There is a man of Centuripa named Nympho, an active, hard-working man, a
careful and experienced farmer. He had a large farm, which he held as leasehold,
a common practice in Sicily even for well-to-do persons such as he is; and he
had invested a large sum in equipment to keep the place going. But he was
treated by Verres with such overwhelming injustice that he not only deserted his
farm, but actually fled from Sicily, and came here to Rome, along with many
others whose exile was due to Verres. Verres had caused a collector to state
that Nympho had not made any return of the acreage he had under crop, as was
required by that precious edict of his, the sole purpose of which was to secure
gains of this kind for him. Nympho having declared his readiness to <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">54</span><span class="br"></span> defend his conduct before an impartial court, Verres
appointed some excellent fellows to try the case: that same medico of his,
Cornelius <span class="italic">alias</span> Artemidorus, who in his own town of Perga
had formerly been Verres’ leader and instructor in the spoliation of
Diana’s temple there; his diviner Volusius, and his crier Valerius.

To what penalty, you may ask. The edict fixed no penalty—and he was
sentenced to pay all the corn he had on his threshing-floors. Thus did this
tithe-collector Apronius carry off from Nympho’s farm not the due
tithe, not some portion of corn removed to a hiding-place, but 7000 good bushels
of wheat, as a penalty for infringing the edict, and not by any right his
contract gave him.</p>
<p>XXII. The wife of a well-born citizen of Menae <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">55</span><span class="br"></span>

Cicero tacitly admits, in any case, that Nympho had not made the prescribed return.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL293_63_a').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
