for me not only to say nothing of the memorials of the Scipios, but to rejoice
over the good fortune of Scipio Africanus in finding after his death kinsmen of
his own to protect his famous memory, so that he needs no help from outside
sources. If, however, your friendship with Verres ties your hands, if you think
what I bid you do no part of your duty, then I will step in as your substitute
to discharge your office, and will undertake to play what I have looked upon as
another man’s part. And if I do, let the illustrious aristocracy of
which you are a member cease to complain that the Roman nation is, and always
has been, glad to entrust active men of humble birth with public office. No man
should complain that character counts for more than anything in Rome, when it is
character that makes Rome the mistress of the world. Let not the Scipios alone
possess the portrait of Scipio Africanus, nor them alone derive lustre from the
great hero’s renown: he was such a man, and so served Rome, that not
one family but the whole country has the right to protect his fame. In this
right I myself have a share, as a citizen of the empire whose proud and glorious
fame is due to him; the more so because I do my best to follow him in the path
where he leads the way for us all, the path of justice and temperance and
strenuous endeavour, as the champion of the distressed and the enemy of the
wicked; and the kinship of aims and pursuits that I thus have with him is hardly
less close than the kinship of name and blood that is so precious to
yourselves.—</p>
