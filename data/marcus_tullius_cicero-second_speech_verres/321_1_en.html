Sicily entitle her
to special favour: on what grounds do you prescribe for her conditions of
special injustice? But take Sicily if you will. Even here I <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">212</span><span class="br"></span> shall not look far afield for a precedent: I can find
precedents in this assembly here present. Gaius Marcellus, I appeal to you. As
proconsul you governed the province of Sicily: during your term of office, were
any sums of money exacted in lieu of maintenance corn? I would not praise you on
that account. Praise, and the highest praise, is due to the quite different
measures that you devised and executed, thereby restoring vigour and health to
that crushed and broken province. But even your pre decessor Lepidus had never
behaved thus about the maintenance corn.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL293_261_a" id="target_note_LCL293_261_a"><sup>a</sup></a> What precedents,
then, for such behaviour in Sicily can my learned friend put forward, if the
conduct not only of Marcellus but even of Lepidus provides him with no answer to
the charge I bring? Can he mean to refer me to the way in <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">213</span><span class="br"></span> which the corn was valued, and money exacted instead, by Marcus
Antonius? “Yes,” he replies, “Marcus
Antonius”-—I take his nod of assent to mean this. So then,
Verres, out of all the praetors, consuls and commanders of Rome it is Marcus
Antonius you have chosen as your model—and the worst thing that even
Marcus Antonius ever did! And now need I hesitate to assert, or my hearers to
agree with me, that during his period of command with unlimited powers Marcus
Antonius so conducted himself that it must do Verres far more harm to state that
he deliberately copied the worst of Antonius’s misdeeds than if he
could plead that he had never in his life imitated Antonius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL293_261_b" id="target_note_LCL293_261_b"><sup>b</sup></a> at all? Men
