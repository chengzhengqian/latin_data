Gnaeus Pompeius, wherein,
on behalf of Sicily as a whole, he set forth, with impressive fulness of detail,
the lamentable distress of the farming class; and nothing in this speech stirred
greater indignation in his hearers, who were present in large numbers, than his
remark that a matter in which our Senate had treated the farmers especially well
and kindly by fixing a generous and liberal price was made the occasion of
plunder for the praetor and ruin for the farmers, and that this was not merely
done but done as if it were a lawful and permissible thing to do.</p>
<p>What will Hortensius reply to this? That the <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">205</span><span class="br"></span>
charge is false? He will never say that. That the sum of money acquired by this
method was a small one? He will not say that either. That the people of Sicily,
the farmers of Sicily, have not been wronged? And how can he possibly say that?
What, then, will his reply be? That other men have done the same thing. What can
this mean? Is the purpose to rebut the charge against Verres, or is it to secure
him companions in his exile? With public affairs in such
disorder—with misconduct so popular, and indeed (owing to the abuses
prevalent till to-day in our courts of law) so freely permitted—will
you, Hortensius,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL293_253_a" id="target_note_LCL293_253_a"><sup>a</sup></a> defend against my attacks this behaviour of
Verres, not as being within his rights, not as being fair, not as being legal,
not on the ground that it was incumbent upon him or permissible for him to act
thus, but on the ground that someone has acted thus already? For that matter,
other men have <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">206</span><span class="br"></span> acted ill in many other
ways—why confine your present line of defence to this one
charge?—Some of your crimes, Verres, are altogether peculiar to
yourself—they could not be alleged against any </p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL293_253_a"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL293_253_a" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">a</sup><span class="italic">Tu</span> may refer to Verres, not Hortensius.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL293_253_a').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
