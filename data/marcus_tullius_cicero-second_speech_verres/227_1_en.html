dinnertable he had had spread for him in the market-place of Aetna. Lollius was
made to stand upright before those ruffians as they began carousing at that
early hour. I assure you, gentlemen, I should disbelieve <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">62</span><span class="br"></span> the truth of this story, even after hearing it everywhere, unless
the old man, when thanking me with tears in his eyes for my readiness to
undertake this prosecution, had told me of it himself in a way that completely
convinced me. This old Roman knight of nearly ninety was made to stand, as I
tell you, before this festive gathering of Apronius, who meanwhile proceeded to
smear his own head and face with perfume. “What’s all
this, Lollius?” says he; “can’t you do the
proper thing unless you are punished and made to?” The poor fellow,
in spite of his great age and the respect in which he was held, could not tell
what line to take, whether to reply or to hold his tongue, or in fact what to
do. As he stood there, Apronius was ordering in the dinner and drinks; and his
slaves, men just like their masters in character, birth and antecedents, were
carrying in everything past the nose of Lollius, amid the laughter of the guests
and loud guffaws from Apronius himself—not much chance, you will
agree, that he was not laughing while he was drinking and amusing himself, if he
cannot restrain his laughter even now when he is threatened with ruin. Well, to
cut the story short, gentlemen, you are to know that Quintus Lollius was
constrained, by this humiliating treatment, to fall in with the terms and
conditions imposed by Apronius. Age and infirmity have prevented his being able
to <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">63</span><span class="br"></span> come here and give his evidence. But the
evidence of Lollius is not needed. Everyone knows this story </p></section><notes></notes></section>
