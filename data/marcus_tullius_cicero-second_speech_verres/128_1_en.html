<p>XXXI. Save Verres, gentlemen! save him for<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">76</span><span class="br"></span> Rome! spare him, and keep him safe! You need such a man on the Bench. You need him in the Senate, to give his disinterested voice for peace or war. This latter consideration, to be sure, of how his voice will be given in the Senate, concerns us, and concerns the country, comparatively little. For how much weight will his opinion have? When will he have the courage, or the ability, to utter it? And when, unless it be in February,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL221_377_a" id="target_note_LCL221_377_a"><sup>a</sup></a> will such an indolent profligate come near the House?

It is against this that Romans protest; it is to this that they cannot submit. If you, they cry, delight in such a man as this, if you choose to select persons of this type to add lustre to your order and distinction to your House, you may keep him, by all means, as a fellow-senator; nay, if you will have it so, you may keep him as a judge—to judge yourselves; but we who are not members of your order, we whom the great laws of Sulla do not permit even to challenge more than three of our
