whole province is a witness to the fact, since men come regularly from every
part of it to Syracuse to attend the sales of tithe. Confess it now, or have it
proved against you hereafter—can you not see how numerous, and how
unmistakable, are the facts here proved against you? In the first place, that
this was your affair, and that the plunder came to you. Had it been otherwise,
why would you have the Leontini tithes go not to Minucius but to Apronius, who
was being talked of by everyone as being <span class="italic">your</span> agent in
the tithe-farming and conducting <span class="italic">your</span> business? Next, it
is proved that the profit made was immense, enormous; for even if that 30,000
had no effect on you, Minucius would undoubtedly have been glad to pay Apronius
the same amount as a bonus if Apronius would have accepted it <a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL293_183_a" id="target_note_LCL293_183_a"><sup>a</sup></a>; we can
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">150</span><span class="br"></span> therefore conceive what hopes of plunder
were before the eyes of a man who could contemptuously despise so vast an
immediate profit, to be obtained without exertion. In the next place, Minucius
himself would certainly not have been willing to pay so much for the tithes, if
you had been selling them in accordance with the code of Hiero: it was because
he saw that your new and iniquitous orders and regulations would enable him to
take a good deal more than his tenth of the corn—that was why he went
so much further. Now Apronius was always allowed to take a great deal more than
even your regulations allowed. We can therefore imagine the amount of profit
made by this man who had unlimited licence, when a man who, if he had bought the
tithes, would not have had the same licence was ready to pay so large a bonus to
secure them. And finally, you are at any rate <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">151</span><span class="br"></span>
