one instance: in the
others I shall not spend long in asking what the reasons were. Servilius had
talked rather freely about Verres’ rascality and wickedness. This was
reported to Verres, who immediately served the man with a summons bidding him
appear at Lilybaeum to answer a charge brought against him by a temple
slave.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL293_623_a" id="target_note_LCL293_623_a"><sup>a</sup></a> He obeyed, and appeared there; but no one came
forward to prosecute. Verres thereupon set about compelling him to accept a
challenge from one of his lictors, involving the sum of £10, to prove
that Verres<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL293_623_b" id="target_note_LCL293_623_b"><sup>b</sup></a> was making money by robbery, saying that he would
appoint a court to try the case from among his own staff. Servilius protested
earnestly against being tried for a capital offence,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL293_623_c" id="target_note_LCL293_623_c"><sup>c</sup></a> before a
prejudiced court, when no one had appeared to prosecute him.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL293_623_d" id="target_note_LCL293_623_d"><sup>d</sup></a> In the midst
of his appeal he was <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">142</span><span class="br"></span> surrounded by six lictors,
muscular fellows who had had plenty of practice in assaulting and flogging
people, and who now proceeded to beat him savagely with rods; till finally the
senior lictor Sextius, a man whom I have already often mentioned, took the butt
end of his stick, and began to strike the poor man violently across the eyes, so
that he fell helpless to the ground, his face and eyes streaming with blood.
Even then his assailants continued to rain blows on his prostrate body, till at
last he consented to accept the challenge. Such was the treatment he then
received; and having been carried off for dead at the time, very soon afterwards
he died. And yonder devotee of Venus, from whom radiates every imaginable grace
and seductive charm, spent his victim’s money on a silver Cupid,
which he dedicated in the temple of Venus: thus foully misusing even the
property of others to secure the gratification of his nocturnal lusts.</p>
