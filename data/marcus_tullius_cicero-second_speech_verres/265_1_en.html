Presumably not. Yet
Verres’ successor, it may be argued, has had exceptional
opportunities for learning of it. He has: but personal friendship ties his
hands. Still, you urge, he ought to inform you of the present state of the
province. He ought: <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">123</span><span class="br"></span> but at the same time he is
not compelled to do so. Does anyone wish that Metellus had given evidence
against Verres? No. Or demand that he should? No, I take it. Well, then, if I

letter that he wrote, what will you say? That what he wrote is false, or that he
