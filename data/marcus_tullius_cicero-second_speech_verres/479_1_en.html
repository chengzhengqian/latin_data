<section class="div1 language" lang="en"><header><hgroup><h1>Against Verres</h1></hgroup></header><section class="div2"><p class="noindent">people of Rome and all Italy—how these
men, the natives of Ceres’ own island, where corn, they tell us, was
first discovered, had had to eat the wretched food from which, by the discovery
of corn, their forefathers rescued themselves and all the world beside. Sicilian
soldiers fed on palm roots, Sicilian corn was the food of
pirates—when you were governor of Sicily!—Think of that
pitiful, miserable scene! think <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">100</span><span class="br"></span> of the glory of
Rome, the honour of the Roman people, the multitude of Roman<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL293_577_a" id="target_note_LCL293_577_a"><sup>a</sup></a> citizens
dwelling there, mocked and insulted by that pirate galley! think of that pirate
celebrating his victory over the Roman fleet by a triumphal procession in the
harbour of Syracuse, his oars dashing spray in the face of this indolent
scoundrel of a governor!</p>
<p>When the pirates had sailed out of the harbour again—not frightened
away, but simply satiated—people began to ask what had led to this
disaster. Everyone said, and argued quite openly, that with all those oarsmen
and soldiers exempted from service, with the rest of them broken down through
want of food and necessaries, and with the governor spending day after day on
drinking-bouts with his women, this shameful and deplorable occurrence was only
to have been expected. These attacks on Verres’ conduct <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">101</span><span class="br"></span> and character were supported by the captains of the
ships, to the command of which they had been appointed by their several
communities. Each of these captains who had escaped to Syracuse after the loss
of the fleet stated the number of men whom he knew to have been exempted from
service in his own ship. The whole thing was plain enough; Verres’
shameless misconduct was proved beyond doubt not only by circumstantial evidence
but by direct testimony.</p>
