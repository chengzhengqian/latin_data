What then is left for you but to confess that you sent to Rome corn purchased
with the Sicilians’ money, and diverted the public money into your
own purse?</p>
<p>What pleasures habitual wrongdoing provides for men without principle or sense of
shame, when they have escaped punishment and found themselves given a free hand!
This is not the first time that <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">177</span><span class="br"></span> Verres has been
found thus robbing the state, though it is only now that his guilt is proved. We
have seen how money was paid to him as quaestor from the treasury for the
maintenance of a consular army, and we have seen how a few months later army and
consul were despoiled of that money;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL293_219_b" id="target_note_LCL293_219_b"><sup>b</sup></a> but it all
disappeared in the fog and darkness that at that time overspread the whole
country. Once again he held the office of quaestor—this time
inherited <a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL293_219_c" id="target_note_LCL293_219_c"><sup>c</sup></a>—and embezzled a large sum of money
from Dolabella; but he got the responsibility for this connected with
Dolabella’s conviction.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL293_219_d" id="target_note_LCL293_219_d"><sup>d</sup></a> And now when all
this money was entrusted to him as governor, you will not find the man licking
cautiously and delicately at these wicked gains; without hesitation, he
swallowed all that public money at a gulp. The opportunity for habitual
misconduct has developed his natural viciousness, until he has become incapable
of setting bounds to his own impudence. Well, his guilt is being <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">178</span><span class="br"></span> brought home to him at last, the guilt of deeds as
monstrous as they are manifest. And I look on him as entrapped thus by the will
of heaven, so that he may not only pay the just penalty of his most recent
deeds, but atone likewise for his former crimes against Carbo and Dolabella.</p>
