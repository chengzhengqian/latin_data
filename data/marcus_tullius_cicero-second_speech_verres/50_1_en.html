of his ward’s slaves who were skilled workmen in his house, and those who were good-looking and well-educated in attendance upon himself, he gave out that they were his own, that he had bought them. The boy’s mother and grandmother asked him repeatedly to tell them at least how much money belonging to Malleolus he had brought away with him, even if he would not hand it over or furnish a statement of account; and appeals from many quarters at last made him own up to £10,000. After this, on the last leaf of the account-book,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL221_221_a" id="target_note_LCL221_221_a"><sup>a</sup></a> he inserted a final entry over a disgraceful erasure, showing £6000 as received from his ward Malleolus and paid over to his slave Chrysogonus.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL221_221_b" id="target_note_LCL221_221_b"><sup>b</sup></a> How that £10,000 has become £6000; how that £6000 works out so exactly in the same way that it becomes the same total as the £6000 balance in the Carbo account;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL221_221_c" id="target_note_LCL221_221_c"><sup>c</sup></a> how that money came to be entered as paid to Chrysogonus; and why that item is at the foot of the page and written over an erasure: all this you, gentlemen, will judge for yourselves.

as received from Malleolus, not £500 was paid back<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL221_221_d" id="target_note_LCL221_221_d"><sup>d</sup></a>; some of the slaves were handed over, after this case against him began, but others are being withheld even now, and their private possessions and their own slaves are also all being withheld.</p>
<p>XXXVII. This is the edifying story of his guardianship. Here is the man to whom to entrust your children! Here is loyalty to the memory of a dead friend, and respect for the opinion of the living! With all Asia offered you to harry and plunder, Verres, and all Pamphylia at the mercy of your piratical raids, did such riches as that not satisfy
