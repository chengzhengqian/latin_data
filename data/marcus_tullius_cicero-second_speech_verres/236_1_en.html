 Never, he told you, since the name of Rome
had been a familiar sound in Sicilian ears, had the people of Agyrium once
spoken or acted against the humblest Roman citizen—the people whose
great wrongs, and whose sharp sufferings, were now forcing them to bear public
testimony against a Roman governor. By God, Verres, this single town is enough
to beat down your defence, so impressive is these men’s loyalty, so
sharp the pain of their wrongs, so scrupulous their testimony. But indeed not
one town only, but all the towns of Sicily have been crushed with similar wrongs
and injuries, and have sent their representatives and their public testimonies
to assist your prosecutors.</p>

and see how Verres despoiled and ravaged that reputable and hitherto prosperous
community. What good folk they are! excellent farmers; men to whom the disputes
and litigations of city life are things unknown.—You foul rascal,

Herbita with an escort of temple slaves, and a lodging was provided for him at
the expense of the town. Thereupon the town was forced to give him a bonus of
38,800 pecks of wheat—when the tithes had been sold for 18,000 pecks!
It was forced as a community to pay him that huge bonus at a time when the
individual farmers had already fled from their farms, plundered and driven away

Sicilian bushel. The purchaser of the tithe did not pay a sum of money to
the State and then keep all the corn himself: he bound himself to collect
and hand over a given amount of corn, and made his profit by collecting as
much more as he could.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL293_91_a').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
