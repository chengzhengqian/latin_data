of high rank in his
own community, who has been sent as an official deputy to attend this trial,
along with two others, both men of standing, Artemo and Meniscus. At a meeting
of the senate of Entella, in the course of a long speech, addressed to me, about
Verres’ oppressive acts, he said this: that if Verres’
conduct in connexion with this commutation of maintenance corn should be allowed
to pass, the Sicilians would willingly promise our Senate maintenance corn
gratis, to prevent future decrees entitling our officials to such vast sums of
money. I feel sure that <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">201</span><span class="br"></span> you perceive how
greatly this would help the Sicilians, not indeed to secure fair treatment, but
to embrace the least of possible evils. For the man who, out of his own share of
his harvest, had supplied Verres gratis with a thousand pecks of corn for
maintenance, would have paid him £20, or £30 at most; and
as it is, that man has been forced to pay £80 instead of that same
quantity of corn. It is certain that no farmer can have managed to make such
payments, for three successive years, out of the produce of his harvests: he
must have had to sell his gear and stock. And if agriculture can indeed support
the imposition of such a tax—if Sicily, in other words,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL293_249_a" id="target_note_LCL293_249_a"><sup>a</sup></a>
can bear this burden—let her bear it for the benefit of Rome, and not
of Roman officials. It means a large sum of money, a large addition to our
revenues: a splendid addition, if we can acquire it without injuring our
province and oppressing our allies. Our officials are to lose nothing; let as
much be supplied for their maintenance as always has been supplied; what further
amount Verres demands let the farmers refuse to supply, if they cannot supply
it, and if they can, let it add to the nation’s revenues </p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL293_249_a"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL293_249_a" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">a</sup>It is implied that the whole wealth of Sicily depends on her
