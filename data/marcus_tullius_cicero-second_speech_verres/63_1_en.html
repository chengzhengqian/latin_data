clause for his edict so worded that anyone can see how it was framed to meet the case of one particular person. Everything is there but the person’s name. He gives the whole case, indeed, in detail: what he neglects is law, usage, equity, and all preceding edicts. <span class="italic">Extract from the city edict.</span> “<span class="italic">If the succession to an estate shall be disputed... unless the party in possession shall agree to the contract proposed.</span>”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL221_247_b" id="target_note_LCL221_247_b"><sup>b</sup></a> Now how can it affect the praetor which of the two parties <span class="italic">is</span> in possession?

You do not, then, eject the man in possession, because he is in possession: would you then refuse the same man possession if he were not? That point you nowhere deal with; nor does your edict provide for anything else at all besides the case for which you got paid. Here now is an absurdity. “<span class="italic">If the succession to an</span><span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">117</span><span class="br"></span>
