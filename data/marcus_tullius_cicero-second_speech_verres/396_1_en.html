when he was told where they came
from, he dispatched a chosen body of men in a large warship to restore the tusks
to their place; and upon the tusks was engraved an inscription in Punic
characters, recording how king Masinissa had received them unwittingly, and on
learning the truth had caused them to be brought back and put in their place

<p>XLVII. In God’s name, what manner of man am I prosecuting? against
whom am I invoking the laws, and the rights this Court should uphold? concerning
whom are you, gentlemen, to record your verdicts? The representatives of the
people of Melita state officially that the temple of Juno has been robbed, that
Verres has left nothing behind in that most holy sanctuary; that the place where

find the gods’ images stolen, their sanctuaries plundered, whole
cities stripped to the skin; of all these deeds Verres has not left himself
either grounds </p></section><notes></notes></section>
