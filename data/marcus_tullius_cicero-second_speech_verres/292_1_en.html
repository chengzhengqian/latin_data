with you: I will not indulge in
fancies, nor hope that anyone will believe anything, because I say it, unless I
have already come to believe it myself.—Gentlemen, <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">165</span><span class="br"></span> his thefts of this government money were of the three
following kinds. In the first place, the money being in the hands of companies
on whom he was to draw for its payment, he lent it to them—at 24 per
cent.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL293_203_a" id="target_note_LCL293_203_a"><sup>a</sup></a> Secondly, to a great may cities he paid nothing
at all for their corn. Finally, from any payment he did make to any city he
deducted as much as he liked, and never paid the full amount due to any of
them.</p>
<p>LXXI. To begin with, I will ask you a question. We know that it was you to whom
the tax-farmers passed a vote of thanks because of what Carpinatius wrote to
them.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL293_203_b" id="target_note_LCL293_203_b"><sup>b</sup></a> But when public money had been assigned to you
from the treasury, when orders had been made for its payment, out of the
nation’s revenues, for the purchase of corn—is it true

discreditable—and dangerous. And it is a charge <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">166</span><span class="br"></span> very troublesome for me to substantiate. For what
evidence can I produce? That of the tax-farmers? You have treated them
handsomely, and they will say nothing. That of their records? By a vote of the
tithe-collectors, these have been destroyed. How then shall I proceed? Am I to
pass over conduct so scandalous, effrontery so unblushing, and fail to press my
charge, because I lack witnesses and documents?—Not so, gentlemen. I
have a witness to produce: and who is it? It is a most distinguished and
respected member of the equestrian order, Publius </p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL293_203_a"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL293_203_a" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">a</sup>The high rate of interest is not the offence—the loan was not
forced on the companies. But either the money should not have been lent at
all, or not for so long, but paid promptly to the farmers; or at least the
State, and not Verres, should have received the interest. <span class="italic">Binis centesimis</span> means literally “for two
