empty state to which Verres had by now reduced his well fitted and furnished home; still, he shared his unhappiness with nobody; the outrages of a governor must, he felt, be borne in silence, and those of a guest with calmness. Verres, in the meantime, with the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">85</span><span class="br"></span> cupidity for which he is notorious all over the world, fell in love with certain very fine and ancient statues which he saw standing in some public part of Thermae, and began pressing Sthenius to promise him his assistance in getting hold of them. Sthenius, however, refused; and more than that, pointed out that these ancient statues, memorials of Scipio Africanus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL221_385_a" id="target_note_LCL221_385_a"><sup>a</sup></a> could not by any possibility be carried away from the town of Thermae so long as Thermae and the Roman Empire remained intact.</p>

Now after the destruction of Himera, those of its citizens who had survived the horrors of war had settled at Thermae, within the territory of the ancient city, and not far away from it; and as they watched their ancestral treasures being set up in their town, they felt themselves beginning to regain the prosperity and importance enjoyed by their forefathers.
