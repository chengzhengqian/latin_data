that I am telling you is there in the accounts of these cities, which show no

<p>LXXVI. Now, Verres, you have deprived yourself even of the plea that it was
merchants who were concerned with these transactions, merchants who refused to
pass the corn, merchants who made the cities arrange to pay that money; that
these persons had money from you to pay the cities, and subsequently themselves
