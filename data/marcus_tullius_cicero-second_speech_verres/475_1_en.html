reached the coast at Helorus—had
already hurried ashore and left his great ship afloat. The captains of the other
ships, finding their admiral disembarked, and aware that they could not possibly
themselves either beat off the enemy or escape by sea, put in at Helorus and
followed Cleomenes. Thereupon the pirate chief Heracleo, thus suddenly and
unexpectedly victorious, though not through his own valour but through the

<p>What a pitiful miserable episode in Sicilian history! <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">92</span><span class="br"></span> what calamity and ruin for hundreds of innocent men! what a
matchless piece of foul wickedness on the part of Verres! On one and the same
night we see the Roman governor burning with the vile fires of lust, and the
Roman fleet with the flames that those pirates kindled. The bad news of this
disaster reached Syracuse late at night, and there was a rush to the
governor’s residence, to which he had returned not long before from
the scene of his brilliant festivities, escorted by the women to the sound of
singing and band music. Even though it was night, Cleomenes dared not show

to comfort him in his trouble. As <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">93</span><span class="br"></span> for this
illustrious general of ours, discipline in his household was so strict that even
at such a crisis, even with such serious news to report, no one was allowed
access to him, no one dared either to wake him when asleep or to interrupt him
when awake. But presently the facts became generally known, and a vast crowd
gathered from all parts of the city. </p></section><notes></notes></section>
