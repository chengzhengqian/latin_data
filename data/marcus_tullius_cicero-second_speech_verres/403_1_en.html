performed by our forefathers, were introduced and adopted by them from
abroad—rites which they decreed should be called
“Greek,” as indeed they were: how then can we, if we

<p>LII. There is still one city, Syracuse, the richest and fairest of all, the tale
of whose plundering I will bring forward and relate to you, and thus round off
and complete at last all this portion of my speech. There can hardly be any
among you who has not often heard, and on occasion read in the history books,
how Syracuse was captured by Marcus Marcellus. Compare, then, this time of peace
with that time of war; the visits of this Roman governor with the victory of
that Roman general; this man’s filthy retinue with that
man’s invincible army; this man’s self-indulgence with
that man’s self-control: and you will say that Syracuse was founded
by the man who captured it, captured by the man who took it over a well-ordered
community. For the moment I say nothing <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">116</span><span class="br"></span> of
matters with which I shall deal, or have dealt, separately in many parts of my
speech: of how the market-place of Syracuse, saved from the stain of bloodshed
when Marcellus entered the city as conqueror, ran red with the blood of innocent
Sicilians when Verres arrived there as governor: of how the harbour of Syracuse,
closed in those days against the fleets of both Rome and Carthage, was free and
open, when Verres was governor, to a Cilician galley and its pirate crew. I say
nothing of the rape of free-born persons and the forcing of married women,
outrages not committed in these days when the city was taken, however much the
passions of war-time, military licence, the custom of war and the right of the
conqueror </p></section><notes></notes></section>
