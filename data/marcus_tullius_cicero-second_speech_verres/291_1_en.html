regarding them.</p>
<p>By decree of the Senate and under the provisions of the corn law of the year of
Terentius and Cassius,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL293_201_a" id="target_note_LCL293_201_a"><sup>a</sup></a> it was Verres’ duty to make purchases
of corn in Sicily. There were two kinds of purchase to be carried out, the first
of a tithe, the second an additional purchase to be distributed fairly among the
various communities.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL293_201_b" id="target_note_LCL293_201_b"><sup>b</sup></a> The amount of the former was to be the same as
that yielded by the original tithes; that of the latter—the
“requisitioned” corn—was to be 800,000 pecks of
wheat each year. The price fixed was 3 sesterces a peck for the tithe corn and
3½ sesterces a peck for the requisitioned corn. Verres was therefore
assigned £28,000 a year to pay the farmers for the requisitioned
corn, and about £90,000 a year to pay for the second tithe. Thus the
amount paid over to Verres in each of his three years for this purchase of corn
in Sicily was nearly £120,000.</p>
<p>This great sum of money, given to you from a <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">164</span><span class="br"></span>
needy and depleted Treasury—given you to get corn, that first
necessity for life and existence—given you to pay the farmers of
Sicily on whom the state was imposing so heavy a burden—upon this
money I assert that you made such inroads that I could, if I chose, make my
hearers believe that you diverted the whole of it into your own coffers; for
indeed you have handled the whole of this business in such a fashion that the
least prejudiced member of this Court might believe no less than that. But I
will not forget the trust that is reposed in me. I will not forget the spirit
and the purpose with which I have undertaken the defence of the
nation’s interests. I will not use the licence of a prosecutor in
dealing </p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL293_201_a"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL293_201_a" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">a</sup>73 <span class="sc">b.c.</span></a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL293_201_a').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL293_201_b"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL293_201_b" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">b</sup><span class="italic">i,e</span>., all the corn-growing cities of Sicily, not
