do so, then you would be free to set up this precedent, if you chose, that a man
who was not known to yourself, and could not produce some person of substance to
vouch for him, might be put to death on the cross, even if he were a Roman
citizen.</p>
<p>LXVI. But I need say no more about Gavius. <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">169</span><span class="br"></span> It
was not Gavius against whom your hate was then displayed: you declared war upon
the whole principle of the rights of the Roman citizen body. You were the enemy,
I say again, not of that individual man, but of the common liberties of us all.
What else was the meaning of your order to the Messanians, who had followed
their regular custom by setting up the cross on the Pompeian Road behind the
town, to set it up in the part of the town that looks over the Straits? and why
did you add words that you cannot possibly deny having used, words that you said
openly in the hearing of all—that you purposely chose this spot to
give this man, since he claimed to be a Roman citizen, a view of Italy and a
prospect of his home country as he hung on his cross? That is the only cross,
gentlemen, ever set up in this spot in all Messana’s history; and you
now see <span class="italic">why</span>. This place with its view of Italy was
deliberately picked out by Verres, that his victim, as he died in pain and
agony, might feel how yonder narrow channel marked the frontier between the land
of slavery and the land of freedom, and that Italy might see her son, as he hung
there, suffer the worst extreme of the tortures inflicted upon slaves. To bind a
Roman <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">170</span><span class="br"></span> citizen is a crime, to flog him is an
abomination, to slay him is almost an act of murder<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL293_655_a" id="target_note_LCL293_655_a"><sup>a</sup></a>: to crucify him

“parricide,” “unnatural
murder.” But Long argues plausibly for the meaning
“murder.” The actions <span class="italic">vincire,
verberare, necare</span> are spoken of as the action of a <span class="italic">magistrate</span>. That a magistrate should officially
execute a Roman citizen in any manner is, Cicero says, nearly as bad as
that one private person should murder another. Cicero does not mean us
to think of Roman citizens actually convicted of crime: but even such
persons were not normally bound, flogged or executed, so that even
applied to them the dictum is not a gross or obvious exaggeration.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL293_655_a').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
