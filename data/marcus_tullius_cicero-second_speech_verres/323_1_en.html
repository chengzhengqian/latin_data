nothing. Antonius used to say that he had fixed the same rate as Sacerdos; nor
was this false; but by fixing this same rate, which was yours also, Sacerdos
helped the farmers and Antonius crushed them. And I may observe that, unless the
whole question of corn-values had to be regarded in relation to the seasons and
the current market-prices, and not simply as a matter of numbers and quantities,
those 3 half-pecks a head of yours, Hortensius, would never have been so
welcome, which you measured out in such sparing proportions and distributed to
the people of Rome to the great satisfaction of everyone; for the high
market-price made your gift, which seems a small thing in itself, seem large
because of the circumstances. Had you chosen to bestow the same quantity on the
people of Rome when corn was cheap, your benefaction would have excited laughter
and contempt.</p>
<p>XCIII. Do you say, then, that Verres has done <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">216</span><span class="br"></span>
the same as Sacerdos did, seeing that he did not do it at the same season of the
year nor when the current price was the same? Rather you must
say—since you now have a suitable precedent to quote—that
what Antonius did in respect of a single visit and rations for barely a month,
this Verres did for a period of three years: the conduct of Antonius is the
precedent by means of which you must justify the conduct of your client. You
certainly cannot appeal to that of the excellent and upright Sextus Peducaeus,
against whom no farmer ever brought any complaint, and who is universally
regarded as the most upright and conscientious governor yet known. He governed
the province for two years,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL293_265_a" id="target_note_LCL293_265_a"><sup>a</sup></a>
