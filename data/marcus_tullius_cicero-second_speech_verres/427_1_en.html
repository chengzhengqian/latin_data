are therefore bound to demonstrate is not that you have done great things as a
soldier, but that you have kept your hands off other men’s property.
I will not, I repeat, deal with you thus. I will inquire, as I gather that you

measures saved Sicily from the war with the revolted slaves? A most praiseworthy
