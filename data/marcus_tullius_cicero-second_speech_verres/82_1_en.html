<p>LVIII. I may add that in this connexion Hortensius,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">151</span><span class="br"></span> during the first hearing, complained of the young Iunius having been brought into court for you to see, wearing his boy’s dress, and having stood beside his uncle as the latter gave his evidence. Hortensius insisted loudly that I was playing to the gallery, and trying to arouse ill-feeling,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL221_285_a" id="target_note_LCL221_285_a"><sup>a</sup></a> by thus bringing the boy forward. Now may I ask, Hortensius, what there was about the lad calculated to appeal to the public and excite its ill-will?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL221_285_a" id="target_note_LCL221_285_a"><sup>a</sup></a> One would think I had brought forward the son of some man like Gracchus or Saturninus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL221_285_b" id="target_note_LCL221_285_b"><sup>b</sup></a> that his very name, and recollections of his father, might inflame the passions of the unsophisticated multitude.
