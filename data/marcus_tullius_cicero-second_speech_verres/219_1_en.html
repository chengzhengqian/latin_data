anything to have or even to hope for: will you then conceive yourself able to
gain applause by telling us that you got more than anyone else for the rights of
collecting tithe? One would think that this was what the nation desired, that
this was what the Senate instructed you to do, from the way in which, after
tearing the farmers’ whole livelihood from them under the pretext of
those tithes, and robbing Rome of all her profit and advantage from the growing
of corn in the years to come, you then imagine that, if you have added some
portion of your plunder to the amount the tithes bring in, you have done good
service to the state and to the people of Rome.</p>
<p>Now I am speaking as though the reason for inveighing against the
man’s misconduct were merely that, thirsting for the glory of having
outstripped certain other governors in the total sum he secured for corn-tithe,
he introduced an over-harsh law and over-severe regulations by edict, and
refused to be guided by the judgement of all his predecessors. You sold the
tithe-rights for a high price, did you? <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">49</span><span class="br"></span> Well
then, if I prove that you diverted into your own coffers not less than you sent
under the heading of tithe-profits to Rome, how much applause is your plea
likely to win for you, after your appropriating for yourself, from a province
that belongs to the nation, as much as you sent home for the nation’s
benefit? If I further prove that you embezzled twice as much corn as you sent
home for the nation, shall we even then look to see your advocate, when he
handles this charge, indulge in theatrical gestures and in appeals to the fringe
of spectators present?— </p></section><notes></notes></section>
