If he were to adjourn the trial now, he saw that when the court met later, with those members present whom he had got rid of, Sopater would be acquitted; if on the other hand he now condemned this unfortunate and guiltless man, having himself presided without a council and having left the accused without advocate or supporters, and reversing thereby the decision of Sacerdos, he felt that he would be unable to face the hatred that such an action would entail. In an agony of indecision, he kept shifting first this way and then that, not only mentally but physically, so that all those present could see how fear was contending in his mind with cupidity. There was a great crowd present—dead silence—breathless anxiety as to what line of attack his greed would adopt. His attendant Timarchides kept bending down to whisper in his ear.

Thereupon he abruptly ordered the witnesses to be called; two or three of them gave hurried evidence; there was no cross-examination; the court crier declared the case over. Verres leapt up from his chair as eagerly as if he were afraid that Petilius had finished or adjourned his hearing of the civil suit and would reappear in court with the others; and that innocent man, whom Sacerdos had acquitted, and whose case had not been tried, was, with the concurrence of a clerk, an apothecary, and a soothsayer, pronounced Guilty.</p>
