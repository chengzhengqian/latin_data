paid up. “Well now, what offers for making an end of your son with
one blow of my axe—no long suffering, no repeated blows, no feeling
of pain as he gives up the ghost?” Yes, the lictor got his money for
this too. Think of that unbearable burden of pain, <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">119</span><span class="br"></span> of the anguish that racked those unhappy parents, thus compelled
to purchase for their children by bribery not life but a speedy death. Nay, the
poor lads themselves discussed the fatal blow, the single stroke of the axe,
with their good Sextius, and their last petition to their fathers and mothers
was that money might be paid to the lictor to have their suffering
lightened.</p>
<p>Well, we see many forms of torture devised for those parents and
relatives—many indeed, and horrible; but these will surely end with
their children’s death? They will not. Why, is there any way for
cruelty to go further still? A way will be found: when the axe has fallen and
killed the lads, their corpses will be flung to the beasts; or if that
distresses their parents, let their parents pay for permission to bury them. You
have heard Onasus, a <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">120</span><span class="br"></span> well-known citizen of
Segesta, testify that he paid money to Timarchides for leave to bury the captain
Heraclius. It is thus useless to argue that of course the bereaved fathers
attending this trial are exasperated by their loss<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL293_597_a" id="target_note_LCL293_597_a"><sup>a</sup></a>; for here we have
the statement of a gentleman of the highest standing who is not one of those
fathers. And here is a thing that everyone then at Syracuse heard of and knows
to be true, that these burial bargains were struck with Timarchides even by the
victims themselves before they died. They discussed the matter with the man
openly: all of them called in all their relatives to help them, and arranged
while yet alive for their own funeral rites.</p>
