how it subsequently came back to Verres by a back door I will show you, gentlemen, by means of documentary and personal evidence.</p>
<p>XXI. This piece of wicked injustice, gentlemen—this bestowal of that plundered property on a number of Syracusan individuals against the wishes of the Syracusan Senate and people—is well matched by<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL221_349_a" id="target_note_LCL221_349_a"><sup>a</sup></a> the crimes committed through Theomnastus and Aeschrio, Dionysodorus and Cleomenes, crimes which Syracuse resented bitterly. To begin with, as I intend to tell you in another part of my speech, the whole city was stripped of its treasures; with the help of the persons whom I have named, he carried off from the temples in the city every statue, every ivory carving, every painting, and every sacred image on which he chose to lay his hands. And then, what happened in the Senate-house at Syracuse
—the <span class="italic">bouleuterion</span>, as they call it there? A revered spot, full of glorious memories for them; a place where stands the bronze statue of the great Marcus Marcellus himself, the man who might, by the custom of war and conquest, have taken the place away from them, but instead of that protected and restored it. In that place they<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL221_349_b" id="target_note_LCL221_349_b"><sup>b</sup></a> erected a gilded statue of Verres, and another in honour of his son, that, so long as their memory of the man lasted, the senators of Syracuse might be unable to sit in their Senate-house without tears and groans. With the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">51</span><span class="br"></span> help of these same men, who shared with him thefts, outrages, and wives, and by his orders, the Marcellus Festival was suppressed at Syracuse, to the grief and distress of the whole community. This festival was being partly kept as an acknowledgement of the recent favours shown them by Gaius Marcellus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL221_349_c" id="target_note_LCL221_349_c"><sup>c</sup></a>
