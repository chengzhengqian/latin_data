<p>—And now, please, read us the return of the number of farmers in the
Leontini district when Verres arrived in Sicily. 84. Now the number who returned
themselves in his third year. 32.—Fifty-two farmers, we observe, cast
out in such a fashion that nobody so much as came in to take their
places.—How many farmers were there in the Mutyca district when you
were on your way to Sicily? Let us consult the official record: 187. Next, how
many in your third year? 86.—Through the oppression of Verres, one
single district mourns the loss of one hundred and one farmers: nay, since it is
the revenues of the Roman nation that we speak of, it is our own country itself
mourns the loss of all these men and their families, and demands their
restoration. The Herbita district had 252 farmers in his first year, 120 in his
third: 132 of its householders left their homes and fled
elsewhere.—The farmers of the Agyrium district—fine,
estimable, substantial fellows they are—numbered 250 in the first
year of your governorship. And now, how many in your third year?
80—as you, gentlemen, have heard from the representatives of Agyrium,
who read the statement from their official records.—</p>

thus ejected 170 farmers, could a strict and just Court acquit
you?—It is the one district of Agyrium, gentlemen, that is the
emptier by 170 farmers: this will enable you to judge what befell Sicily as a
whole. And you will find this state of things repeated throughout the
tithe-paying areas. You will find some men left behind, men who even now have
been left with some fraction of the wealth they inherited; their equipment is
reduced, their oxen </p></section><notes></notes></section>
