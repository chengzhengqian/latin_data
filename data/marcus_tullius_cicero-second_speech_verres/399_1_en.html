In the consulship<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL293_417_a" id="target_note_LCL293_417_a"><sup>a</sup></a> of Publius Mucius and Lucius Calpurnius a
terrible political crisis had arisen: Tiberius Gracchus had been slain, and
prodigies indicated that fearful dangers were threatening us. The Sibylline
Books were consulted; and from them it was discovered that “the most
ancient Ceres” must be placated. Thereupon, although there was a
splendid and beautiful temple of Ceres here in our own city, yet priests of the
Roman state, members of the distinguished body of Decemvirs,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL293_417_b" id="target_note_LCL293_417_b"><sup>b</sup></a> left Rome to

have visited Henna have seen the marble image of Ceres, and that of Libera in
the other shrine. These are works of great size and notable beauty, but not so
very old. But there was a bronze one, of moderate size and unique workmanship,
in which the torches were shown; this was very old—far the oldest,
indeed, of all the treasures in this sanctuary. This Verres stole—and
was not satisfied even with taking this. In a wide open space <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">110</span><span class="br"></span>
