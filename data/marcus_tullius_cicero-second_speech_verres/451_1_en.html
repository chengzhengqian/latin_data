This, the Messanians having none, you officially ordered the town of Regium to
supply, as its citizens themselves tell us—not that you could deny
the fact in any case.</p>
<p>XIX. Now if both the material to build the ship and the
men who built it were procured by your official authority and not by your money,
where, may I ask, are we to discover the expenditure that you tell us was met
out of your own purse? It is argued that <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">48</span><span class="br"></span> nothing
appears in the city accounts of Messana. But I observe, in the first place, that
possibly no money was paid out of the city treasury: even with the Capitoline
temple, as built in the days of our ancestors, it proved possible, by officially
impressing masons and conscripting workmen, to construct and complete it for
nothing. In the next place, as I perceive clearly, and as I shall prove, when I
put the persons concerned in the witness-box, from their own accounts, large
sums of money paid over to Verres were falsely entered as paid in connexion with
contracts that never existed. Nor indeed is it at all wonderful that the
Messanians should have kept out of their accounts entries that might ruin the
man who had done them the utmost service, and whom they knew to be a better
friend to themselves than he was to the Roman nation. In any case, if the
Messanians’ having no entry of any money paid to you is a proof that
none was paid, your inability to produce any entry of any purchase or contract
made by yourself must be a proof that the ship cost you nothing.</p>
<p>You tell us that your reason for not requiring the <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">49</span><span class="br"></span> Messanians to furnish a ship was that they have special treaty privileges.
Oh, thank Heaven! here </p></section><notes></notes></section>
