and
hope Apronius will be sentenced to make eightfold restitution. What precisely is
the farmer’s petition? simply the right to sue for eightfold
restitution as the edict directs. Apronius? quite willing. The governor? he
orders the selection of a court. “May I have the names of the
panel?” <span class="italic">

be chosen from my own staff.” “Oh, and who are the members
of your staff?” “Why, Volusius my diviner, and Cornelius
my medico, and those hounds you see licking the steps of my seat of

it might have happened through inadvertence as well as greed. It was bound to
happen repeatedly. I assure you, indeed, that every one of them carried off
more, and a great deal more, than his ten per cent.—Very well: name
me one of them, during your three years of office, </p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL293_33_a"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL293_33_a" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">a</sup>The plaintiff expects to be allowed to challenge certain names from a list of Sicilians out of whom the praetor will, he assumes, select the members of the court: which is what the praetor ought to do.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL293_33_a').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
