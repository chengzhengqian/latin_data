<p>XXXII. For indeed, if it is a<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">78</span><span class="br"></span> wicked thing—and to me it seems the foulest and vilest thing in the world—that a judge should accept a bribe, that he should make money the master of his honour and his conscience, how much more wicked and vicious and shameful still it is that he should condemn a man from whom he has taken money to acquit him; that he, a magistrate, should have even less care to keep his pledged word than is customary among a gang of bandits! It is a crime to take money from an accused man: how much worse to take it from his prosecutor, how much worse still to take it from them both! You exposed your honour for sale in your province, and the man swayed you most who paid you best; well, never mind—there may now and then have been someone who did something of the same description. But when your honour and conscience is already another man’s property and the price is already paid, will you then transfer that honour and conscience to his opponent who pays you more? Will you cheat them both and choose your own purchaser, and not even give your victim his money back? Talk not<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">79</span><span class="br"></span> to me of Bulbus or Staienus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL221_379_b" id="target_note_LCL221_379_b"><sup>b</sup></a>; what such unnatural prodigy have we ever seen or heard of as this man who makes one bargain with the accused and then concludes another with the accuser, who banishes and expels from his court the respectable men who know the facts, condemns unsupported the already acquitted man whose money he has taken, and refuses to give that money back? Shall we have such a man as this among our judges? Shall this man’s name appear again in a panel<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL221_379_c" id="target_note_LCL221_379_c"><sup>c</sup></a> of senators?
