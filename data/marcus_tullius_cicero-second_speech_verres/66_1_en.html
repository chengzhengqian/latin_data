at other times he would, without the least scruple, deliver in one case a judgement directly opposed to that which he had delivered in the previous case a few minutes before. Hence those people whose indignation<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">121</span><span class="br"></span> went so far as to make them humorists: some of these made the remark you have often heard repeated, that <span class="italic">ius verrinum</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL221_253_a" id="target_note_LCL221_253_a"><sup>a</sup></a> was of course poor stuff: others were still sillier, only that their irritation passed them off as good jesters, when they cursed Sacerdos<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL221_253_b" id="target_note_LCL221_253_b"><sup>b</sup></a> for leaving such a miserable hog behind him.

Cruelty is admittedly the more terrible and savage quality. Well then, do you think, gentlemen, that this audience has forgotten Verres’ way of having ordinary Roman folk flogged till the blood ran? The thing was brought before a public meeting by a tribune of the plebs, who then produced before the eyes of the Roman people a man whom Verres had had flogged.
