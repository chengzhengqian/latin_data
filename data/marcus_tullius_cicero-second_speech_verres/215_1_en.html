preferring to show them your face without speaking a word, you may claim as much
ability as you choose for yourself and your advocates. How then did you achieve
the result you speak of? You deserve great credit if you have surpassed your
predecessors in competence and left your successors aprecedent for their
guidance. Very likely there has been no one good enough to be a model for
yourself, whereas you, as the deviser of sound methods and the chief authority
for them, will be the model for us all. What farmer, during your <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">42</span><span class="br"></span> term of office, paid ten per cent of his crop? or
twenty per cent? What farmer did not think himself very kindly treated if he got
off with thirty per cent instead of tenâ€”except for a few of them who,
by being your accomplices in robbery, paid nothing at all? Compare your savagery
with the benevolence of the Senate. When a national emergency obliges the Senate
to order the exaction of an additional tithe, its decree prescribes the payment
of money to the farmers for this second tithe, in order that the amount taken
beyond what is due may be looked on as a purchase and not as an impost. You
exacted the tithe, you tore it from them, many times over; your authority was
not the Senate, but your own edicts, with their abominable regulations such as
no one ever heard of before: and then do you count it a great achievement to
have got a higher price than was got by Lucius Hortensius the father of Quintus

departure from what was fair, legal and recognized custom?</p>
