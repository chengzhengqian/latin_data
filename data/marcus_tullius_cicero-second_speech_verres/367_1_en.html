 Titius, a Roman citizen and the head of a
family, had that ring dragged off his finger.</p>
<p>There is another thing for which he had an incredible passion; and one would have
thought he had got himself a mighty liberal supply of it, even if, for each of
his dining-rooms, not only in Rome but in his country-houses too, he had aimed
at completely furnishing thirty <a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL293_353_a" id="target_note_LCL293_353_a"><sup>a</sup></a> couches with
coverings and all accessories for the use of his guests. There was not one
wealthy house in Sicily where he did not set up a weaving establishment. At
Segesta there <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">59</span><span class="br"></span> is a lady of wealth and rank named
Lamia, who for three years had her house full of looms making woven fabrics for
him, and the whole of them dyed with purple. There was the wealthy Attalus at
Netum, Lyso at Lilybaeum, Critolaus at Aetna, Aeschrio and Cleomenes and
Theomnastus at Syracuse, Archonidas at Helorus—time is too short to
give you all their names. “He provided the purple himself; his
friends supplied the labour only.” Well, possibly; parts of his
misconduct I am willing for the present to pass over; and one would think it
enough for me to accuse him of being able to provide all that purple, of
planning to take so much out of the country, and finally of doing what he admits
he did—making use of his friends’ workpeople for such
purposes as this. Besides which, do <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">60</span><span class="br"></span> you imagine
that bronze-covered couches and bronze lamp-stands were ever made at Syracuse,
during those three years, for anyone but Verres? He paid for them? Perhaps he
did: all I am doing, gentlemen, is to give you an account of his conduct as
governor of his province; I should not like any of you to regard him as having
been wanting in energy, </p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL293_353_a"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL293_353_a" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">a</sup>Instead of the usual <span class="italic">three.</span></a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL293_353_a').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
