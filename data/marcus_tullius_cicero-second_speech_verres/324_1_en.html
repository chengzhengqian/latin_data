very dear: and no farmer ever paid him one penny when it was cheap, nor
complained of the rate of his commutation when it was dear. You may reply that
when it was dear, he did very well out of his rations.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL293_267_a" id="target_note_LCL293_267_a"><sup>a</sup></a> Very likely; but
