this shameless
and unquestionable act of theft and embezzlement—for what other name
are we to give the lending of public money for your own benefit? He tells us
that the accounts of this loan were kept by your clerk; and the directors in
their letter threaten your clerk as well as yourself—it so happened
that two of the directors, colleagues of Vettius, were clerks themselves.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL293_207_a" id="target_note_LCL293_207_a"><sup>a</sup></a>
They feel it intolerable that they should have the 24 per cent taken from them.
And they are justified in feeling this. For what other magistrate has ever done,
or indeed tried to do, or thought it possible to do, anything so impudent as
this? Whereas the Senate has frequently helped tax-farmers by allowing them

taking interest from them!—This man would certainly have no chance of
escape if this Court were composed of tax-farmers—in other words, of
Roman knights. His chance should be still smaller as it is, with you, <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">169</span><span class="br"></span> gentlemen, investigating the case: the more so that
the resentment of other men’s wrongs is a more creditable motive than

will you plead that your action was lawful? Deny its truth—how can
you? will you attempt it, only to be refuted by all these convincing documents
and the evidence of all these tax-farmers? And how can you plead that your
action was lawful? Why, good heavens, were I to prove that you, while governor
of a province, had been lending out your own money there, even that would be
enough to convict you. But it was public money, money voted for corn purchase,
