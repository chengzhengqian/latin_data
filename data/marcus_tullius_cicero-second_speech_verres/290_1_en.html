hope to see a more delightful creature than
that boy of yours, if he is your son by birth, your pupil by training, and your
imitator by disposition? For my own part, gentlemen, I should be quite ready to
let the boy turn out a thoroughly stout and honest fellow; I am not disturbed by
the thought of possible future enmity between him and myself. For if I remain

should be such, and, if our courts do their duty, will be such, that personal
enmities shall be as inevitable for the guilty as they are harmless for the
innocent. And therefore there is no reason why I should not wish this lad to get
himself clear of his father’s shames and vices; and hard as that must
be for him, it may perhaps be possible, especially if the guardians set over him

been cheated, and the farmers robbed, of a quantity of corn that defies
calculation.</p>
<p>LXX. My next business, gentlemen, is to put before you the huge and impudent
thefts connected with the purchase of corn. I ask for your attention </p></section><notes></notes></section>
