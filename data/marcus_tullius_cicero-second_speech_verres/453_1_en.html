and dispatch it, if so ordered, even as far as the Atlantic Ocean, at their own
cost and risk; and they bribed you to exempt them so completely from their
obligations under the treaty and as our subjects that they might not even have
to patrol the waters of the strait in front of their own roofs and homes, or to
defend their own walls and harbours.—When this <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">51</span><span class="br"></span> treaty with the Messanians was being drawn up, think, gentlemen,
how much trouble and toil and money they would gladly have devoted to escape
having the clause about this bireme inserted, if it had been at all possible to
secure this concession from our ancestors; the imposition of so heavy a burden
as this upon the community somehow added to this treaty of alliance the
suggestion of a symbol of servitude. Here is a privilege that they failed to
obtain from our ancestors by agreement, although they had recently done us good
service, no precedent blocked the way, and Rome’s resources were not
strained; yet they now, after all these years, obtained this privilege from
Gaius Verres by bribery, although they have done us no fresh service, our
imperial rights in the matter have been exercised every year and maintained
without a break, and our naval resources are strained most severely. Nor did
they obtain only the privilege of not supplying a ship: during the three years
of your governorship, have the Messanians supplied one single sailor, or one
single soldier either for service afloat or for garrison duty ashore?</p>
