from what I had been told at Rome by Verres’ friends, that Syracuse
was quite as friendly to him, because of the legacy of Heraclius,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL293_447_a" id="target_note_LCL293_447_a"><sup>a</sup></a>
as Messana was because of its partnership in all his thefts and robberies; and
at the same time I was afraid that, if I sought to collect information from the
Syracusan records, I should be opposed by his popularity with the women of rank
