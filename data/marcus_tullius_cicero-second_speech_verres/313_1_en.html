are going to keep for yourself the cash which the Senate meant you to give me,
and then instead of paying me, as you ought, at the rate of 4 sesterces, to take
twice as much from me, and describe this act of plunder and robbery as
“maintenance”?—It needed <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">198</span><span class="br"></span> but this piece of calamitous injustice, when you were governor of
Sicily, to complete the farmers’ ruin. What resources could be left
to a man forced by this outrage not only to lose all his harvest but to sell all
his gear and stock? And what else could he do? What surplus had he from which to
find the money to pay you? He had had taken from him, as a so-called tithe, as
