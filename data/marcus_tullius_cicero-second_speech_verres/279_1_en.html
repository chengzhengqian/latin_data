still be those who can pretend to ignore and neglect all these facts? I have
brought to your notice challenges on the subject of Verres’
partnership in tithe-farming, made in the presence of Verres himself, and by
Verres himself prevented from being investigated: and for what plainer proof
than this can any man possibly ask me?</p>
<p>Gentlemen, I have no doubt that you are satisfied by what you have heard from me.
None the less, I will go further: not, believe me, in order to increase the
certainty that I am quite sure you already feel; but to make Verres at last
abandon his impudent tactics, and cease at last to fancy that he can purchase

£5000 for another, £3000 for the cheapest! And when
someone said to this that it could not be done, that plenty of witnesses would
appear against him, and moreover that I was going to do my best as prosecutor,
“Good Lord,” he says, “let them all say what
they like: after what we have done, unless such plain facts are brought up that
there is no answer to make to them, we have won.” Very good, Alba: I
