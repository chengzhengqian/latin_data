its exiles, cancelling the
sentences pronounced in its courts of law. When this happens, everyone knows
that the country is tottering to its fall; where such things come to pass,
nobody believes that there is any hope of escaping calamity. The effect of such
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">13</span><span class="br"></span> measures, wherever they are taken, is that
certain persons, whether democrats or aristocrats, have their sentences of
execution or exile revoked; but even so, not by the actual pronouncer of those
sentences, nor instantaneously, and not if they have been convicted of crimes
endangering the lives and fortunes of all their countrymen. Here, we have a new
thing, a thing so monstrous that we believe it possible more because of the
character of the criminal than because of the facts of the crime. The men thus
let go were slaves; they were let go by the man who had sentenced them; they
were let go instantaneously, and while their sentence was already being carried
out; they were slaves condemned for a crime that endangered the persons and the
lives of all free men. A truly great commander this! Let us compare <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">14</span><span class="br"></span> him no longer with the gallant Manius Aquilius: he is a
Paulus, a Scipio, a Marius. What profound judgement he showed in that hour of
fearful danger for the province! Observing the unrest among the slaves of Sicily
that was caused by the servile war in Italy, how effectively he frightened them
into keeping quiet! He has ordered arrests to be made—that must have
terrified them all; he has summoned their masters to their trial—what
can alarm slaves more than that? He has pronounced the accused men <span class="italic">Guilty,</span> and thus, by sentencing a few persons to a
painful death, has quenched the flames of rebellion. What is the next step? The
