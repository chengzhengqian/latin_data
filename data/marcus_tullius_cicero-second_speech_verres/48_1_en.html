You have always reckoned, and in Sicily more than anywhere, that you would find yourself adequately secured against attack, if you either forbade a fact to be entered in the public records, or compelled its removal if entered already. How futile this belief is you learnt, to be sure, at the first hearing, from not a few of the states of Sicily, but you may learn it a little better from this same state Miletus. They certainly obeyed the order given them so long as the man who gave it was on the spot; but the moment he went away, they not only made the prohibited entry, but added the reason why it was not made at the time.

These await with misgiving the month of February,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL221_217_b" id="target_note_LCL221_217_b"><sup>b</sup></a> knowing as they do the names of the consuls-elect<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL221_217_c" id="target_note_LCL221_217_c"><sup>c</sup></a>;
