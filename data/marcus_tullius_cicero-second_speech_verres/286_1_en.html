them” and “push your hardest”: one sees him
producing from his former master’s cellar expressions so applicable
to every type of wickedness.—“I hope, old chap, you will
trust your little brother.”—Yes, he is his own
father’s son when it comes to money-making and thieving, his twin and
his double in immorality and rascality and effrontery.—</p>
<p>LXVII. “The staff<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL293_191_a" id="target_note_LCL293_191_a"><sup>a</sup></a> will be devoted to
you.”—And what do you mean by that? Teach your
grandmother! Did Apronius get on to Verres’ staff<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL293_191_b" id="target_note_LCL293_191_b"><sup>b</sup></a> because you
showed him the way, or on his own account?—“Let everyone
have as much as may be necessary.”—Imagine the
man’s shamelessness in the days of power, when he is so unprincipled
in the days of exile. Everything can be managed with money, he says; you must
give money, you must pour it out, if you mean to win. What troubles me is not so

who is governor now.—“Metellus, as you know, is an old
wiseacre.”—Now this is really intolerable—that
the ability of so great a man as Metellus should be derided and scorned and
despised by a gaol-bird like Timarchides.—“Get Volteius to
help, and you will find the whole business
child’s-play.”—Here Timarchides is emphatically
mistaken, in supposing either that Volteius can be bribed, or that
Metellus’s administration is under any one man’s control.
But his mistake is an inference from his own experience. He has seen that for
many people it was child’s-play to manage Verres, directly or through
others; and </p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL293_191_a"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL293_191_a" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">a</sup>That of Metellus.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL293_191_a').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL293_191_b"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL293_191_b" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">b</sup><span class="italic">Vestram cohortem</span> means “the staff to which
