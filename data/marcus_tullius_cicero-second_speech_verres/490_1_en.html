<p>All these negotiations being concluded and settled, they were taken from prison
and bound to the stake.—</p>
<p>XLVI. And who now was so stony-hearted, who
so <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">121</span><span class="br"></span> inhuman, save yourself alone, as not to be
moved with pity for the unhappy fate of these young men whom all knew so well?
Was there anyone who did not weep—who did not feel those
men’s calamity as a blow that struck himself and menaced the lives of
all? The axe fell on them; a cry of grief went up; you alone rejoiced and
triumphed, happy in the removal of those witnesses to your cupidity. But you
were wrong, Verres, wildly wrong, in thinking to wash away the plague-spots of
your thefts and debaucheries in the blood of those guiltless allies of ours. It
was the headlong folly of a madman to suppose that the damage your greed had
done you could be cured by the application of cruelty. Those witnesses to your
wickedness are indeed no more: none the less, their kinsmen turn their backs
neither on them nor on you; and none the less, some of those same captains are
alive and here in court; preserved by destiny, as I must think, to appear in
this trial and to avenge their innocent comrades. Phylarchus of Haluntium is
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">122</span><span class="br"></span> with us, who did not run away when
Cleomenes did, and was in consequence caught and captured by the
pirates—a disaster that saved him, for unless the pirates had
captured him, he would have fallen a prey to this buccaneer who has plundered
all Sicily. He has told us in his evidence of the exemption of sailors from
duty, of the food shortage, of how Cleomenes ran away. And Phalacrus of
Centuripa is with us, a distinguished citizen of a distinguished city; and his
testimony agrees with that of Phylarchus in every detail.</p>
