that you will hardly mention the faint survivals of the slave war in Italy, or
that unlucky reverse<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL293_513_a" id="target_note_LCL293_513_a"><sup>a</sup></a> at Tempsa: chance threw this in your way, giving
you your opportunity, if there had been one spark of manhood or energy in you;
but you proved yourself to be what you have always been.</p>
<p>XVI. A deputation from
the town of Valentia <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">40</span><span class="br"></span> approached you, and its
spokesman, a man of eloquence and high standing named Marcus Marius, asked you
to deal with the situation: you had the authority and rank of
praetor—would you not take the lead, and see to the destruction of
that small band of men? Not only did you shirk this duty, but at that very time
there you were on the sea-coast with that woman of yours, Tertia, whom you were
taking off home with you, in full view of everyone; and when you gave your
answer to the people of a town so famous and important as Valentia, you were
wearing a dark tunic and a Greek cloak.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL293_513_b" id="target_note_LCL293_513_b"><sup>b</sup></a>—You may
easily conceive how the man behaved when leaving for his province<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL293_513_c" id="target_note_LCL293_513_c"><sup>c</sup></a>
and when he was there, since you see him on his way home, not to receive a
triumph but to face a trial, ready to disgrace himself even by conduct that
could give him no pleasure. How admirably just <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">41</span><span class="br"></span>
were those murmurs of dissent at that crowded meeting of the Senate in the
temple of Bellona! You will remember, gentlemen, how, late in the afternoon, the
news of the reverse at Tempsa having just been reported, we could think of no
one possessing military authority whom we could send there, and someone observed
that Verres was not far from Tempsa, and how universal the murmurs of protest
were, and how openly our chief speakers opposed the suggestion. </p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL293_513_a"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL293_513_a" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">a</sup>Nothing is known of this.

be that Verres, on his return journey, ran away from a situation of some
slight danger, in spite of the appeal made to him by the people of
Valentia.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL293_513_a').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL293_513_b"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL293_513_b" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">b</sup>See p. 348 note <span class="italic">a</span>.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL293_513_b').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL293_513_c"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL293_513_c" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">c</sup>Probably this refers to the second of the two pieces of misconduct
