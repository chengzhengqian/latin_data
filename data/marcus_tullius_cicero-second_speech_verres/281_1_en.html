difference to the farmer how high a price was secured. For the position is not
that if the price secured is high more is due from the farmers, and less if the
price is low. The amount of tithe sold corresponds to the yield of the harvest,
and it is to the advantage of the farmer to have crops so heavy that the tithes
may fetch the highest prices: so long as the farmer hands over no more than his

wheat. If I prove that you might have sold them for appreciably more than that,
and refused to knock them down to those who were bidding against Apronius, and
handed them over to Apronius for much less than you might have sold them for to
others—if I prove this, will Alba himself, your oldest friend and

along with others of his own class, was prepared to pay, for the tithes of the
Leontini district, not one, nor two, nor three thousand pecks of wheat beyond
the amount the tithes were sold for, but thirty thousand more, simply for the
tithes of one single district; and that he was not allowed the opportunity of
buying them, in order that Apronius might not be deprived of them. Deny
