not guard against this action, since it belongs to the same class? Because your wording is not meant to apply to a class, but to an individual: which shows at once that your motives have not been legal, but financial. Had your edict been made to apply to the future only, it would have been less abominable; it would still have been wrong; but in that case, while it might have been censured, it could not have been attacked as criminal, for nobody would have transgressed it. As the matter stands, the character of the clause would show anyone that it was put in to benefit not the community but the reversionary heir of Publius Annius. That is why, after all the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">111</span><span class="br"></span>
verbiage and the profit-hunting preamble with which you adorned the clause, no subsequent praetor, you will find, has reproduced it in his edict. Not only so, but nobody has even been afraid of this being done. Since your praetorship there are many who have made their wills in the same fashion<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL221_241_a" id="target_note_LCL221_241_a"><sup>a</sup></a>: among these is a wealthy woman named Annaea, who, not having been registered, with the approval of many of her family made her daughter her heir.

Gaius Verres devises a regulation of his own, and nobody has been afraid of finding any praetor inclined to carry that regulation on! You, Verres, are indeed the one known case of a man who has not been content with improving the wills of the living, but must also annul the wills of the dead. You yourself removed the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">112</span><span class="br"></span>
clause from your Sicilian edict, merely expressing your intention to apply the principles of your city edict to meet any unforeseen contingencies. What you meant to be a reserve line of defence in future
