his favourite fatal charge of not making a proper return of acreage. Xeno denied
liability; the estate, he pointed out, had been let to another person. Verres
directed the court to find Xeno guilty <span class="italic">if it shall appear that
the acreage of the farm in question exceeds the area stated by the

land—which was in itself a valid defence—but that he was
not the owner or the lessor of the estate in question; that it belonged to his

defence was conducted by Marcus Cossutius, a man of high distinction and held in
great respect. Verres none the less committed him for trial, fixing the penalty

proceeding, and to bring him before himself as soon as it was settled; adding
that Xeno might be rich enough to be indifferent to the penalty if he were found
guilty, but would probably not be indifferent to a flogging as well. Intimidated
by this violence, Xeno paid the collectors as much as he was ordered by Verres
to pay.</p>
