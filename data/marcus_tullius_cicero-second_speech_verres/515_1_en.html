how your case is going and what the result for you will be, I will deal thus
with you. You declare all of a sudden that Gavius had been a spy.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL293_649_a" id="target_note_LCL293_649_a"><sup>a</sup></a>
Well, I will prove that you had thrown him into prison in the Stone Quarries at
Syracuse. And I will not prove this merely by quoting the Syracusan prison
records: you shall not be able to say that I found the name Gavius in those

whom you shall make your choice, to testify that this man and no other was
thrown into the Quarries at Syracuse by you. I will also put forward
fellow-townsmen and intimate friends of his from Consa, who will show you and
your judges, too late for you but not for them, that the Publius Gavius whom you

told by Gaius Numitorius, </p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL293_649_a"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL293_649_a" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">a</sup><span class="italic">Repentinum</span> really applies to <span class="italic">dicis</span> (graphic present for <span class="italic">dixisti</span>).
