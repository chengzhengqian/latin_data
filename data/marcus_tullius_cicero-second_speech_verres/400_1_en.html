before the shrine of Ceres there are two
statues, one of Ceres and the other of Triptolemus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL293_419_a" id="target_note_LCL293_419_a"><sup>a</sup></a> both of great
size, and very beautiful. Their beauty endangered them, but their size saved
them; their demolition and removal seemed likely to be extremely difficult. But
in the right hand of the Ceres there stood a large and exquisite statuette of
Victory; and this Verres caused to be wrenched away from the statue of Ceres and
carried off.</p>
<p>L. And now I ask, what feelings must be aroused in this man by the recollection
of his impious deeds, when I myself, who do but tell of them, am not only
perturbed in spirit, but feel my very body shake and tremble? I think of that
sanctuary, that sacred spot, that solemn worship: before my eyes rises the
picture of the day when I visited Henna, my reception by the priests of Ceres
wearing their fillets and carrying their sacred boughs,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL293_419_b" id="target_note_LCL293_419_b"><sup>b</sup></a> my address to the
assembled townsfolk, in which my words were heard amid such groans and weeping
as showed the whole town to be a prey to the bitterest distress. It was
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">111</span><span class="br"></span> not the cruel exaction of tithes, not the
plundering of their goods, not the injustice of the courts, not this
manâ€™s acts of savage lust, not his violence and his insolent
outrages, of which these crushed and tormented folk now complained: it was the
sin against the holiness of Ceres, against her ancient worship and venerated
sanctuary, that they would see atoned for by the punishment of this utterly
unscrupulous and wicked man: all else, they said, they were ready to endure
without resentment. So extreme was their distress that one might fancy that the
king of the shades had come to Henna once more, and not abducted Proserpina but
carried Ceres herself away.</p>
