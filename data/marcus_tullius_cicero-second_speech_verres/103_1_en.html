<p>XIII. The legal rights of the Sicilians are as follows. Cases between two citizens of the same city should be tried in that city’s courts and by that city’s laws. For cases between two Sicilians of different cities, the praetor should appoint a court, choosing its members by lot in accordance with the statutes known in Sicily as the Rupilian law, which were enacted by Publius Rupilius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL221_327_a" id="target_note_LCL221_327_a"><sup>a</sup></a> on the recommendation of the Commission of Ten.
