myself seem eager to annul your sentence
against Apollonius, by pleading the cause of my friend and entertainer. I will
say nothing about his honesty, his excellence, his industry. I will also pass
over the fact of which I have already spoken—that his fortunes were
invested in labourers, live-stock, farmhouses and loans to others, in such a way
