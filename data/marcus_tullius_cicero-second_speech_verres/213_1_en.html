<p>However, for making profit out of false actions there was another especially
ingenious method devised, the regulation that farmers should make returns of
their acreage of land under crop. This, as I will explain, was highly effective
for compelling unjust settlements with the collectors, and tended in no way to
the public advantage; but besides that, it was effective in involving all whom
Apronius chose to involve in these false actions. No sooner did a man <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">39</span><span class="br"></span> express opposition to his wishes than a summons was
applied for against him on the charge of making an untrue return of acreage: and
fear of prosecution on this charge led to large quantities of corn being carried
off, and large sums of money extorted, from a great many people. Not that there
was any difficulty about returning the acreage as what it was or even as more
than it was; that was of course safe enough. No, but the charge alleged in the
application for the summons was that the regulation had been disobeyed and no
return made at all. You cannot but be aware of what sort of hearing such charges
would get when Verres was praetor, if you bear in mind the character of his
staff and personal following.</p>
