You,
gentlemen, have already heard these facts. But you may have heard them only on
the authority of rumour and popular talk. Let me now inform you of the immense
sums of money seized under the heading of corn-tithe. As you listen you will
appreciate the force of the scoundrel’s impudent remark that his
gains from tithe alone would buy him protection against all his perils.</p>
<p>XX. We have been told long before this—I am <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">50</span><span class="br"></span> sure, gentleman, that every one of you has been told many

gain nothing? I will go further, and press this point.—You sold those
tithe-rights on unjust conditions in order to sell them dearer. Why, when they
were knocked down and sold already, when it was now too late to get more for
them, though not too late to get much more for yourself, did those new emergency
regulations suddenly spring into existence?
