<p>Now what, in God’s name I ask you, are your feelings <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">123</span><span class="br"></span> and thoughts, gentlemen, as you sit there and hear me
speak these words? Is my own judgement astray? are the calamities that have
befallen our unhappy allies distressing me more than is reasonable? Or are the
agonies of pain and grief inflicted on these innocent persons causing yourselves
equal distress? For my own part, when I tell you of men of Herbita and Heraclia
dying by the executioner’s axe, my imagination is stirred vividly by
the shameful injustice of their fate.</p>
<p>XLVII. Citizens of the states, born and
brought up amid the fields, from which year by year, through their toil and
labour, corn in vast abundance is procured to feed the populace of Rome, have
they been reared and trained by their parents with the fairest hopes from Roman
rule and Roman justice, only to fall the victims of this man Verres’
inhuman wickedness and his executioner’s hideous axe? When I think of
the <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">124</span><span class="br"></span> captains from Tyndaris and Segesta, my
thoughts dwell on the privileges that Tyndaris and Segesta have enjoyed and the
services that they have rendered. Scipio judged that the spoils of war might
fitly be applied to making these cities even fairer than they were: the wicked
villainy of Verres has robbed them not only of those things of beauty but of her
noblest sons as well. Thus might the people of Tyndaris be proud to speak of
themselves: “We are counted among the seventeen loyal states of
Sicily; we, throughout the Punic and Sicilian wars, never broke our ties of
friendship with the Roman nation; we have never ceased to supply the Roman
nation with all that might contribute to its success in time of war and its
prosperity in time of peace.”</p>
