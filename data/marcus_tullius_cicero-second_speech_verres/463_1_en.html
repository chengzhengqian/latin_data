<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">69</span><span class="br"></span> flung a number of Roman citizens into prison
in this place, and had also ordered the rest of the pirates to be put away
there, he saw that if he also sent that counterfeit<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL293_545_a" id="target_note_LCL293_545_a"><sup>a</sup></a> pirate captain to
this same spot for custody the absence of the real captain would be noted by a
number of persons in the quarries. Therefore he did not dare to commit this man
to that best and safest of prisons; indeed, no part of Syracuse seemed safe to
him, and he sent the man off—where, please? To Lilybaeum, perhaps?
oh, very well—after all, he is not really afraid of the people who
live on the coast? No, gentlemen, not there. To Panhormus, then? why, that will
do; not but what, as the man was captured in Syracusan waters, Syracuse was the
right place for his imprisonment, if not for his execution. But no, not to
Panhormus either. Where <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">70</span><span class="br"></span> was it, then? Why, where
do you suppose? To a place whose inhabitants had the least possible reason to
feel any fear or concern about the pirates, and had nothing to do with
sea-faring or maritime matters: to Centuripa, which has a wholly inland
population of excellent farmers, to whom no sea-going pirate’s name
had ever been a name of fear—their one and only dread, while you,
Verres, were governor, was that pirate chief of the dry land Apronius. And to
let everyone perceive without trouble his purpose in this, which was to enable
the substitute to pass himself off without difficulty or trouble as the man he
was not, he gave orders to the people of Centuripa to have the fellow supplied
with food and all other comforts on the most ample and generous scale.</p>
