<p>XXXIX. Verres was
informed that all day long the whole attention of the market-place and the Roman
citizen community was devoted to questioning the captains about how the fleet
was lost, and these men in reply were telling one person after another that it
was due to the exemption of so many rowers from duty, the starvation of the
remainder, and the cowardly flight of Cleomenes. This information set him
thinking. As you heard him say himself during the first part of this trial, he
had already made up his mind, before this happened, that he was sure to be

written record would do him no service, and that in fact a governor’s
taking such excessive precautions would be a further reason for believing the
charge justified. It was by no means the first time that he had employed this
stupid device, even ordering the official deletion or insertion of passages in
