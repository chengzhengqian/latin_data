those who have given themselves into fortune’s hands, who have had
experience of her inconstancy and its attendant perils. But in this disaster of
yours fortune has played no part. Men make trial of the fortunes of war on the
battle-field, and not at the dinner-table: it is not the god of war, but the </p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL293_611_a"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL293_611_a" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">a</sup>On this point see §§ 83-85 and § 124.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL293_611_a').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
