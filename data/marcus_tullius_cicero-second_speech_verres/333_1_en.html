<p>Well, can I do better than begin with the city that <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> was your favourite, Verres, the city you loved above all others, and by a
selection from the very persons who are your eulogists? We shall find it all the
easier to appreciate your behaviour towards those who are your enemies, your
assailants and your prosecutors, when we have discovered the impudent way in
which you have plundered the people of your own Messana.—</p>
<p>II. Gaius Heius of Messana, as all who have visited that city will readily allow,
is in all respects its chief and its wealthiest citizen. His house is perhaps
the finest in the place, and at any rate the best known, and its hospitable
doors the most widely open to our own countrymen. It was, until Verres arrived,
so full of beautiful things as to add much to the beauty of Messana, whose charm
