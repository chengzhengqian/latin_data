<p>For indeed the town of Henna is thought of as no mere town, but as
Ceres’ sanctuary: its people believe that Ceres dwells in their
midst, and I therefore think of them not as the citizens of a city, but all of
them as the priests, all of them as the servants and ministers of
Ceres.—And it was from Henna that <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">112</span><span class="br"></span>
you dared to remove the image of Ceres? at Henna that you went about to pluck
Victory from Ceres’ hand, robbing one goddess of another goddess? And
this although men whose every tendency was to impiety rather than religion
shrank from desecrating, nay, from touching, these holy things. In the
consulship of Publius Popilius and Publius Rupilius,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL293_421_a" id="target_note_LCL293_421_a"><sup>a</sup></a> the place was in
the hands of slaves—deserters, savages, public enemies. Yet they were
less the slaves of their masters than you the slave of your lusts; less
deserters from their masters than you from what is just and legal; less savages
by birth and speech than you by disposition and character; less the enemies of
mankind than you of the gods in heaven.—What plea for mercy, then, is
left for a man, more degraded than a slave, more reckless than a deserter, more
impious than a savage, more cruel than an enemy in war?</p>
<p>LI. Gentlemen, you have heard the statement of <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">113</span><span class="br"></span>
Theodorus, Numenius and Nicasio, the representatives of Henna, about the
instructions officially given them by their fellow-citizens. They were to
approach Verres and request him to restore the images of Ceres and Victory. If
successful, then they were to abide by the traditional practice of the people of
Henna: devastator of Sicily though Verres was, yet none the less, in accordance
with the custom inherited from their forefathers, they were to give no official
evidence </p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL293_421_a"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL293_421_a" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">a</sup><span class="italic">132</span>
