threatens your utter ruin,
bidding him rebut the statement that he has been talking of you as his partner
in tithe-farming. The public waits eagerly to see how deeply this challenge
disturbs you, what steps you mean to take to vindicate yourself and establish
your innocence in the eyes of the world. Will you, even here, appoint your
medico or diviner or crier to judge the issue, or even Papirius Potamo, that
inflexible adherent of the ancient tradition of the knights,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL293_169_a" id="target_note_LCL293_169_a"><sup>a</sup></a> whom you had

Well, Scandilius declared that he would not open his mouth before a court made
up of men like Artemidorus.—At the same time, he made you the most
generous and liberal of offers, if you would only accept it: should you decide
that no man could be found in all the province of Sicily fit to try this case,
by himself or with others, he requested you to send on the case to be heard at
Rome. And at that, if you please, <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">139</span><span class="br"></span>
