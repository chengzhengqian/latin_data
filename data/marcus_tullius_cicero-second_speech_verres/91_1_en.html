Romans. Verres is the first man against whom their<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">9</span><span class="br"></span>cities have officially sent witnesses to testify.

But finding his luxury and his cruelty, his greed and his insolence, beyond their power of endurance; finding all the privileges and rights and benefits ever granted them by the Roman senate and nation reft from them by this one unscrupulous scoundrel: they made up their minds to one of two things; either to prosecute their oppressor, and secure revenge, if you would help them; or else, if you should count them unworthy of receiving your aid and succour, to abandon their cities and their homes—their countryside they had already abandoned, driven from it like game by their oppressor.</p>
