<p>I must be honest with you, gentlemen. I do fear <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span>
that the outstanding merit of Gaius Verres in the military sphere may gain him
impunity for doing all the things that he has done. I remember, in the trial of
Manius Aquilius,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL293_471_a" id="target_note_LCL293_471_a"><sup>a</sup></a> how impressive, and how decisive, the speech of
