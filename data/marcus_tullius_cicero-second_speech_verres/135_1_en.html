Sthenius made application as follows: Whereas he was charged, by his fellow-citizens, with forging an official document; and whereas the laws of Thermae provided a form of trial for that offence; and whereas the Senate and People of Rome, considering the unbroken amity and loyalty of the people of Thermae, had restored to them their city, their lands, and their own laws; and whereas the right of citizens to proceed against one another under their own laws was thereafter laid down in the laws made for the Sicilians by Publius Rupilius, in conformity with a decree of the Senate and the recommendations of the Commission of Ten; and whereas Verres in his Edict had confirmed this right: That on all the aforesaid grounds Verres would send his case for trial under the laws of the city.
