the greatest of favours, that they got Apronius to grant their petition so far
as concerned those of them who were even then intact. And the petition thus
granted, be it noted, was a petition to be allowed to pay three tithes instead
of one!—Why, had all this not been for your own benefit, they would
have petitioned <span class="italic">you</span> that they might not pay more than one
tithe—not Apronius that they might not pay more than
three.—And now, to pass over for the moment the royal—or
rather the tyrannical—measures of Apronius against those farmers; and
to make no reference to those whom he stripped of all their corn, or those whom
he left not merely with none of their harvest but with none of their belongings,
let me show you the profit made out of these payments of three bushels an acre
that he so kindly allowed as a favour.</p>
<p>XLIX. The return of acreage under crop in the <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">116</span><span class="br"></span>
district was about 30,000 acres. This gives us 90,000 bushels, or 540,000 pecks,
of wheat. Subtract 216,000 pecks, the price for which the tithes were sold, and
we have 324,000 pecks. Add to this 6 per cent of the total amount of 540,000
pecks, which comes to 32,400 pecks—for an additional 6 per cent was
exacted from everyone <a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL293_137_a" id="target_note_LCL293_137_a"><sup>a</sup></a>—and we now have a total of nearly
360,000 pecks.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL293_137_b" id="target_note_LCL293_137_b"><sup>b</sup></a>. Well, but did I not say that the profit made
came to 400,000? Yes: for in the above reckoning I have not taken account of
those who were <span class="italic">not</span> allowed to get off with 3 bushels an
acre. However, to make up the promised total without taking this into account,
let me tell you that cash fees were exacted as well, 2 sesterces a bushel from
many farmers, 1 ½ from many others, and 1 </p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL293_137_a"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL293_137_a" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">a</sup>On what pretext?
