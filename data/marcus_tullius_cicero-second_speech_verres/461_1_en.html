was spent unloading the ship. The pirate captain himself, who ought to have been
executed, was nowhere to be seen. Everyone to-day believes—you must
draw your own inferences as to how far they are right—that Verres was
secretly bribed by the pirates to spare this pirate captain.</p>
<p>XXVI. This is merely an inference? No man can <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">65</span><span class="br"></span> be
a competent judge who is unaffected by convincing circumstantial evidence. You
know your man; and you are aware of the universal custom—how gladly
the captor of a hostile general or private chief permits him to be exposed
freely to the public gaze. Gentlemen, in all that populous city of Syracuse I
found not one man who claimed to have set eyes on the captured pirate leader,
although there was the usual gathering of the whole population, and the
customary eager inquiries from would-be spectators. What led to this
man’s being so thoroughly concealed that no one was able to get even
a casual glimpse of him? The seafaring folk of Syracuse, who had often heard and
often trembled at his name, longed to feast their eyes and satisfy their souls
with the spectacle of his torture and execution, and none of them was allowed
even to look at him. Publius Servilius captured more pirate <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">66</span><span class="br"></span> chiefs alive than all his predecessors together; and
was anyone forbidden to enjoy the consequent satisfaction of seeing the
captives? Far from it. Wherever Servilius journeyed, he provided the public with
the delightful sight of its captured enemies in chains; and crowds gathered in
consequence from every quarter to meet him, and came to see the spectacle not
only from the towns through which the prisoners passed, but from the
neighbouring towns as well. </p></section><notes></notes></section>
