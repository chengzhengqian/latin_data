thus, that this
same man has the sum required in cash or in town property. When this or that
burden is laid on a farmer, one is not to take account of such other resources
as the individual may possess, but to consider the relative capacity of his farm
in itself, asking how heavy a load it can and should carry, how large a profit
it can and should bring him. In point of fact, even such men as that<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL293_247_a" id="target_note_LCL293_247_a"><sup>a</sup></a>
Verres has sucked dry and ruined in every conceivable way: but apart from this,
what you have to determine is how great a public burden you expect the farmer,
as a farmer, to perform and undergo. You impose tithes on them, and they submit
additional tithes, and they feel they must serve you in your time of need; you
bid them supply further corn for purchase, and if you wish for it they will
supply it. How onerous <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">200</span><span class="br"></span> these demands
are—how little, after all these subtractions, can remain untouched
for the use of the original growers—you, gentlemen, can I think,
guess for yourselves, knowing what you spend on your country estates and how
much they yield you. Now reckon in with the rest Verres’ orders and
regulations and oppressive acts; reckon in the tyranny and the robberies of
Apronius and the temple slaves throughout the tithe-paying areas. Yet with all
this I am not now concerned. I am speaking of the maintenance corn only. Would
you have the Sicilians supply your officials with maintenance corn gratis?
Nothing could be more improper or more unfair: and now let me assure you that,
when Verres was governor of Sicily, the farmers might well pray and implore to
be treated thus.</p>
