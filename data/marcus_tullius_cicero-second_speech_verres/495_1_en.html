undertook the weary
journey to Rome, not in the hope of recovering some fraction of his property,
but that his eyes, having once beheld the blood gushing from his
son’s neck, might now behold you in the hour of your
conviction.—And the mothers, gentlemen, <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">129</span><span class="br"></span> and the sisters of those hapless men were eager to come too, if
only Lucius Metellus had let them come. One of them came to meet me, as I was
approaching Heraclea one evening; with her were all the married women of the
city, many of them bearing torches in their hands. Addressing me as her own
saviour, calling Verres her own executioner, with pitiful appeals to the memory
of her son, the poor creature prostrated herself before me as if it were in my
power to raise her son from the dead. In the other towns the aged mothers, yes,
and the little children of these poor lads, behaved in the same fashion, age and
youth alike establishing their claims on my zeal and industry, on your honour
and compassion. And so it is, <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">130</span><span class="br"></span> gentlemen, that
Sicily has bidden me tell this tale of wrong as well as the others, a tale for
whose telling pity, and not ambition, has been the motive. It is my purpose that
the condemnation of the guiltless, that chains and prison, that the scourge and
the axe, that the agony of our allies and the blood of their innocent sons,
that, worst of all, the bloodless corpses of the dead and the grief of their
parents and their kinsfolk, shall not be allowed to be the means of enriching
Roman magistrates. If, gentlemen, your honour and integrity shall enable me, by
the condemnation of this scoundrel, to rid Sicily of her fear that such things
may happen, I shall feel that my own conscience, and the wishes of those who
begged me to do what I am doing, are fully satisfied.—</p>
