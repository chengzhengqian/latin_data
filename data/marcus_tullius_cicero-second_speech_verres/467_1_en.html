with what precedent, for
what reason was it so long? For what reason, I repeat, when those Roman citizens
whom the pirates had captured were executed on the spot, did you suffer a pirate
himself to enjoy the light of day so long? Be it so, however; let us allow you a

now have to say? “He lived in my house, he was in my company; I kept
him alive and unharmed against the day of my trial, to help me to explain away
the charge my enemies would bring against me.” So that is it! You
mean to save yourself by endangering the safety of the public; you will exact
the penalty of death, incurred by our defeated enemies, </p></section><notes></notes></section>
