Metellus, I should not have been able to secure the presence of so many of them at this trial.</p>
<p>XXVII.<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">65</span><span class="br"></span> But let us return to what I began to tell you of our allies’ unhappy position. Heraclius and Epicrates, with all their friends, came out a long way to meet me, thanked me with tears as I approached Syracuse, and expressed their eagerness to go off to Rome with me.
