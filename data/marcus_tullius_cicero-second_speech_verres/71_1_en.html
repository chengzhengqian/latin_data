throughout Romeâ€”that impudent theft of his, or rather, that unheard of and extraordinary act of open robbery? To think of the temple of Castor, that famous and glorious memorial of the past, that sanctuary which stands where the eyes of the nation may rest upon it every day, in which the Senate not seldom meets, and which is daily thronged with those who come to take counsel upon matters of high import: and then to think that there Verres has a memorial of his criminal audacity graven for ever upon the lips of men!</p>
<p>L. From the consulship of Lucius Sulla and Quintus<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">130</span><span class="br"></span> Metellus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL221_263_a" id="target_note_LCL221_263_a"><sup>a</sup></a> gentlemen, the contractor for the upkeep of the temple of Castor had been one Publius Iunius. He died, leaving a young son, not yet of age. Lucius Octavius and Gaius Aurelius during their consulship b had made contracts for temple maintenance, the execution of which they had not had time, in all cases, to certify, nor had the two praetors, Gaius Sacerdos and Marcus Caesius, to whom this duty had been assigned. The Senate therefore decreed that Gaius Verres and Publius Caelius, the new praetors, should examine and pronounce upon those contracts not already dealt with. How Verres misused the powers thus entrusted to him you have already learnt from Gnaeus Fannius and Quintus Tadius. But open and unashamed as all his depredations were, he chose to leave us an especially striking demonstration of his methods of robbery; something that we might not hear of now and then, but daily see for ourselves. He inquired who was responsible <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">131</span><span class="br"></span> for handing over the temple of Castor in good repair; Iunius himself he knew was dead, and he wanted to know on whom the duty now devolved.
