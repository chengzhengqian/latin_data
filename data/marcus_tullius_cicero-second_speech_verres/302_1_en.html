 cities paid for their corn all the
money due to them? Find me one community, find me one single
farmer—search, inquire, look round everywhere, and see if there is a
single one, in this province you governed for three years, who does not hope for
your ruin; of all those farmers who subscribed for your statue,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL293_223_a" id="target_note_LCL293_223_a"><sup>a</sup></a> show me a

been paid to him. I tell you, gentlemen, not one of them will say so.</p>
<p>LXXVIII. From the full sum that you should have <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">181</span><span class="br"></span>
paid to those farmers deductions, under this head or that, were regularly made.
The first was for “inspection and exchange,” the second
for something called “wax-money.” All these terms,
gentlemen, are not names for real things<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL293_223_b" id="target_note_LCL293_223_b"><sup>b</sup></a>: they are names
for impudent pieces of theft. How can there be any exchange, where a single
coinage is in universal use? And as for
“wax-money”—why, how can such a term have any
connexion with magistrates’ accounts and public money<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL293_223_c" id="target_note_LCL293_223_c"><sup>c</sup></a>? The third
kind of deduction, on the other hand,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL293_223_d" id="target_note_LCL293_223_d"><sup>d</sup></a> wore the air of
being permissible—of being desirable—of being entirely
necessary. Two-fiftieths of the whole of the payments made were subtracted under
the heading “clerk.” Who gave you leave for that? what
law, what authority from the Senate, and moreover what principle of justice,
gave leave for your clerk to carry off all that money, whether from the
farmers’ resources or from the revenues of the Roman nation? If that
amount <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">182</span><span class="br"></span> can be deducted without injustice to the
