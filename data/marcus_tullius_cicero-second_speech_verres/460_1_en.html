And in spite of the activity of the pirates and the danger of the province, the
crazy madman did all this so openly that the pirates themselves knew of it, and

<p>Now although as the result of the man’s cupidity <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">63</span><span class="br"></span> the Sicilian fleet was a fleet in name only, and in
fact consisted of empty ships, better fitted to put gold into the
governor’s purse than to put fear into the pirates’
hearts, yet while Publius Caesetius and Publius Tadius were cruising about with
their ten half-manned vessels, they did fall in with one of the
pirates’ ships, which they cannot be said to have captured, for
already it was completely overpowered by the heavy load it carried, but at least
they towed it off. It was full of handsome young captives, and of silver plate
and silver coin, together with a quantity of woven stuffs. This one ship our
fleet discovered—one cannot say captured—off the coast of
Megara, a place not far from Syracuse. When the news was brought to Verres, he
was lying drunk on the sea-coast with those women of his; however, he got on to
his feet, and immediately sent off several of his guards to his quaestor and
assistant-governor, with instructions that everything was to be brought intact
without delay for his inspection. The ship was <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">64</span><span class="br"></span>
brought into Syracuse. Everyone was looking to see justice done; but Verres
behaved less like a captor of pirates than like a pirate receiving his booty. He
treated as public enemies<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL293_539_a" id="target_note_LCL293_539_a"><sup>a</sup></a> all of his prisoners<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL293_539_b" id="target_note_LCL293_539_b"><sup>b</sup></a> who were old or
