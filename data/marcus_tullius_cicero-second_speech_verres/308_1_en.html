 according to Verres’ own letter
to you, or 3 sesterces at the most, as has been demonstrated alike by the
evidence of all our witnesses and by the farmers’ accounts, Verres
nevertheless exacted from the farmers 12 sesterces for every peck of wheat.</p>
<p>LXXXII. That is the charge. It is based—let me make this plain to
you—not on his taking money instead of corn, not on his taking 12
sesterces a peck, but on his taking it as he did when the market-price of corn
was what it was.</p>
<p>The fact is, gentlemen, that the original reason for this practice of commutation
was not the advantage of our praetors and consuls, but that of the communities
and the farmers. No magistrate, at the outset, being entitled to corn, was
shameless enough to demand money instead. Without question, the practice began
with the farmer, or with the community, to whom the requisition was sent. They
had sold their corn, or they wished to keep it, or they were unwilling to
transport it to the place specified; so they asked, as a favour and a kindness,
to be allowed, instead of supplying the corn, to pay over what the corn was
worth. From such a source it was—from the good-nature of obliging
magistrates—that this practice of commutation came in. There
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">190</span><span class="br"></span> followed magistrates of a greedier sort:
yet these men, with all their greed, discovered not only a way of enriching
themselves, but a line of defence where by to save their skins. They introduced
the device of always requiring delivery of their corn at the remotest spots, to
which its conveyance would cause the utmost trouble, so that the difficulty of
transport might enable them to fix their own terms for commutation. Now it is
easier to think ill of such conduct </p></section><notes></notes></section>
