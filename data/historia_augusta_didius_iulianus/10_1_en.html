And as for Crispinus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_367_1" id="target_note_LCL139_367_1"><sup>1</sup></a> he met with Severus’ advance-guard and was put to death by Severus on the advice of Julius Laetus. The decrees of the senate, moreover, were torn down, and when Julianus called a meeting of the senate and asked their opinions as to what should be done, he could get nothing definite out of them.
