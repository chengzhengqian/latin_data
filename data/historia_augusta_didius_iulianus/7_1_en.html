Besides this, legates of consular rank were sent by the senate to the soldiers to persuade them that they should reject Severus and let him be emperor whom the senate had chosen. Among others of the legates was Vespronius Candidus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_361_1" id="target_note_LCL139_361_1"><sup>1</sup></a> an old man of consular rank, now for a long time repugnant to the soldiers because of his harsh and penurious rule. Valerius Catullinus was sent as Severus’ successor,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_361_2" id="target_note_LCL139_361_2"><sup>2</sup></a> as if, in sooth, it were possible to appoint a successor to a man who already had an army devoted to himself.

<p>VI. All the while, Severus was approaching the city with a hostile army; but in spite of that, Didius Julianus accomplished nothing with his praetorian troops, and the populace hated and laughed at him more and more every day. And although he had escaped from Commodus’ clutches by the aid of Laetus, nevertheless, unmindful of this great favour, Julianus ordered Laetus to be put to death in the expectation that he would side with Severus.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_361_5" id="target_note_LCL139_361_5"><sup>5</sup></a> He gave orders likewise that Marcia should be put to death at the same time.</p>
