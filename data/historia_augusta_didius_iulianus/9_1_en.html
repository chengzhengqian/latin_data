himself of the following: “I vote that Didius Julianus be declared emperor,” Julianus prompted “Say also Severus,” the name of his grandfather and great-grandfather, which he had added to his own.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_365_1" id="target_note_LCL139_365_1"><sup>1</sup></a> However, there are some who say that Julianus never planned to slaughter the senate, because it had passed so many decrees in his favour.</p>
<p>After the senate had passed this decree, Didius Julianus forthwith despatched<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_365_2" id="target_note_LCL139_365_2"><sup>2</sup></a> one of the prefects, Tullius Crispinus, and he also created a third prefect<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_365_3" id="target_note_LCL139_365_3"><sup>3</sup></a> in the person of Veturius Macrinus, whom Severus had already notified by letter that he was to be prefect. Nevertheless, the people avowed and Severus suspected that this peace was merely a strategem and that Tullius Crispinus, the prefect of the guard, was commissioned to murder Severus. Finally, in accordance with the general wish of his soldiers, Severus declared that he would rather be Julianus’ enemy than colleague; he at once, moreover, wrote to a great number of men at Rome, and secretly sent proclamations, which were posted up. Julianus, furthermore, was mad enough to perform a number of rites with the aid of magicians, such as were calculated either to lessen the hate of the people or to restrain the arms of the soldiers. For the magicians sacrificed certain victims that are foreign to the Roman ritual<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_365_4" id="target_note_LCL139_365_4"><sup>4</sup></a> and chanted unholy songs, while Julianus performed rites, which took place, so we are told, before a mirror, into which boys are said to gaze, after bandages have been bound over their eyes and charms muttered over their heads. And in this performance one lad, it is said, saw the arrival of Severus and the retirement of Julianus.</p>
