<p>I. Didius Julianus, who gained possession of the empire after Pertinax, was the great-grandson of Salvius Julianus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_349_1" id="target_note_LCL139_349_1"><sup>1</sup></a> a man who was twice consul, prefect of the city, and an authority in jurisprudence—which, more than anything else, had made him famous. His mother was Aemilia Clara, his father Petronius Didius Severus, his brothers Didius Proculus and Nummius Albinus; another Salvius Julianus was his uncle. His father’s father was an Insubrian from Milan, his mother’s came from the colony of Hadrumetum.</p>

It is improbable that Didius was related to Salvius Julianus, for his family came from Milan, and since an inscription which connected Salvius with this city has been shown to be a forgery, there is no reason for supposing that he was a native of Milan.
