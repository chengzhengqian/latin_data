<p>While Julianus was engaged in these activities, however, Severus seized the fleet stationed at Ravenna;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_363_1" id="target_note_LCL139_363_1"><sup>1</sup></a> whereupon the envoys of the senate who had promised their services to Julianus passed over to Severus.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_363_2" id="target_note_LCL139_363_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Tullius Crispinus, the prefect of the guard, who had been sent to oppose Severus and lead out the fleet, failed in his attempt<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_363_3" id="target_note_LCL139_363_3"><sup>3</sup></a> and therefore returned to Rome.
