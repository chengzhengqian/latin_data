<p>II. Up to this point, Gaius Caesar, Quintus Ligarius stands clear of all blame. So far from leaving his home at the call of war, he left it when there was not the remotest suspicion of war; he went out as legate in time of peace, and in an utterly peaceable province he so bore himself that peace was its highest interest. His departure at least can give you no just cause of affront. And what of his remaining? Far less this; for while his departure implied an inclination which did him no discredit, his remaining was due to an honourable necessity.
