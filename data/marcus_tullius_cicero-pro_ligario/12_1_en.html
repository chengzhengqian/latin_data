have been approved by you. But I now dismiss the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">24</span><span class="br"></span>
whole topic, not so much to avoid offending your long-suffering ears as that it may not appear that Tubero would ever have done what it never entered his head to do.</p>
<p>Well, you and your friends, Tubero, were going to Africa, a province which was peculiarly and preeminently embittered against Caesar’s successes, where there was an all-powerful king<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL252_481_a" id="target_note_LCL252_481_a"><sup>a</sup></a> who hated his cause, where the general feeling was adverse to it, and where there were strong and influential citizen-corporations.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL252_481_b" id="target_note_LCL252_481_b"><sup>b</sup></a>
What, I ask, were you going to do there? Yet can I have any doubt what you were going to do, since I see what you in fact did? You were debarred from setting foot in your province—debarred
too with the deepest affront. How did you<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">25</span><span class="br"></span>
submit to this? Before whom did you lay a complaint of the affront you had received? Why, before that very compelling personality your adherence to whom had induced you to share the fortune of his wars. Had it been in Caesar’s cause that you meant to visit that province, it would surely have been to him that you would have appealed when you were excluded from the province. You appealed to Pompeius. And what complaint is this to bring to Caesar’s ears—plaintively to arraign the man who debarred you from waging war against Caesar! In this connexion I give you full leave to boast, even with lies if you will, that you would have handed the province over to Caesar. Even if you were excluded by Varus and others, still I will readily avow that the blame belongs to Ligarius for having robbed you of the opportunity of winning so rich a glory.</p>
