Menenius and Lucius Valerius Publicola (for the <span class="marginNote right"><span class="sc">b.c.</span> 387</span>third time). These men took office at the conclusion of the interregnum.</p>
<p>In that year the temple of Mars vowed in the Gallic war was dedicated by Titus Quinctius, duumvir for sacrifices.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL172_213_1a" id="target_note_LCL172_213_1a"><sup>1</sup></a> Four additional tribes were formed out of the new citizens, the Stellatina, Tromentina, Sabatina, and Arniensis; these filled up the number of tribes to twenty-five.</p>
<p>VI. The question of the Pomptine territory was <span class="marginNote right"><span class="sc">b.c.</span> 386</span>brought up by Lucius Sicinius, a tribune of the plebs, in popular meetings which were now more numerously attended, and by men more easily induced to covet land, than had been the case before. The senate talked also of war with the Latins and the Hernici, but dread of a greater war—Etruria being up in arms—caused them to defer it.</p>
<p>The government passed to Camillus, as tribune of the soldiers with consular authority. He was given five colleagues: Servius Cornelius Maluginensis, Quintus Servilius Fidenas (for a sixth term), Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus, Lucius Horatius Pulvillus, and Publius Valerius. Early in the year the general concern was diverted from the Etruscan war, when a band of fugitives from the Pomptine district suddenly appeared in Rome with tidings that the Antiates were in arms. The Latin communities, so they reported, had sent their soldiers to help in the war, but asserted that their government was not involved, since they had merely, as they said, not forbidden their young men to serve, as volunteers, where they liked.</p>
