that all measures, warlike and peaceful, at home and <span class="marginNote right"><span class="sc">b.c.</span> 368</span>in the field, are carried out with auspices, who does not know? Who then control the auspices, by the tradition of our fathers? The patricians, to be sure; for no plebeian magistrate is elected under auspices; the auspices belong so exclusively to us, that not only are the patrician magistrates whom the people elect no otherwise elected than with auspices, but we ourselves even—without the people’s suffrage—take auspices and nominate an interrex; and have, as private citizens, the right of taking them, which you plebeians have not even in your magistracies. He therefore deprives the state outright of auspices, who by electing plebeian consuls deprives the patricians of them—for they alone can take them. They may jeer now, if they like, at religious scruples. ‘After all,’ they will say, ‘what difference does it make if the sacred chickens<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL172_345_1" id="target_note_LCL172_345_1"><sup>1</sup></a> will not feed; if they are slow to come out from the coop; if a bird utters an ill-omened cry?’ These are trivial things; but because they did not scorn these trivial things, your fathers were able to build this great republic; and now we, as though we had no further use for Heaven’s favour, are polluting all the ceremonies.
