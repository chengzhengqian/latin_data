<h2>II<span class="linebreak"></span><span class="sc">A Hymn in Honour of the Passion of the Most Blessed Martyr Lawrence.</span></h2>
<p><span class="sc">Rome</span>, thou ancient mother of temples, but now given up to Christ, Lawrence has led thee to victory and triumph over barbarous worship. Thou hadst already conquered haughty kings and held the nations in check; now thou dost lay the yoke of thy power on unnatural idols. This was the one glory lacking to the honours of the city of the toga, that it should take savage paganism captive and subdue its unclean Jupiter, not with the tempestuous strength of Cossus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL398_109_a" id="target_note_LCL398_109_a"><sup>a</sup></a> or Camillus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL398_109_b" id="target_note_LCL398_109_b"><sup>b</sup></a> or Caesar, but by the battle in which the martyr Lawrence shed his blood. The faith fought in arms, not sparing her own blood, for by death she destroyed death and spent herself to save herself.</p>

Lawrence was his principal deacon (<span class="italic">cf.</span> 37 ff. Augustine calls him <span class="italic">archidiaconus</span>). The term <span class="italic">sacerdos</span> is often applied to bishops, especially when they are contrasted with deacons (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> VI, 10–15, 43). In spite of what Prudentius says here it is probable that Xystus was not crucified but beheaded (Allard, <span class="italic">Les Dernières Persécutions du IIIme Siècle,</span> 4th ed., Paris, 1924, App. C). Four of his deacons were executed at the same time; Lawrence was spared for the moment, probably because the authorities wished to get possession of the treasure of which he was in charge.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL398_109_c').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
