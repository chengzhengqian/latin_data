<p>Tradition tells that there was a pit which had been opened by command in the midst of a piece of level ground and filled nearly to the brim with smoking lime, the heated stones pouring out fire, the snow-white dust hot, capable of burning anything it touched and killing with the smell of its breath. They say an altar was set up by the top of the pit and the order was that the Christians must either offer in sacrifice a grain of salt or a sow’s liver, or else throw themselves into the depths in the midst of the pit. Three hundred together sprang forward eagerly with a quick rush and sank in the powdery gulf, where the dry sea swallowed them, enveloping the plunging mass in its lowest depths. Whiteness possesses their bodies, and whiteness carries their souls to heaven. “The White Throng” justly gained its name from that day forth for ever more.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL398_335_aa" id="target_note_LCL398_335_aa"><sup>a</sup></a></p>

Augustine in his Exposition of Psalm xlix gives the number of these martyrs as “more than 153,” but his point is only that they outnumbered the 153 fishes of John xxi, 6–11. He does not mention the manner of their death, but one of the “supposititious” sermons attributed to him (no. 317) implies that they were put to death by the sword. The place of their death was Utica, not Carthage. They came to be known as “Martyres Candidae Massae,” and Augustine (in Sermon 306) explains the phrase as derived from their large number (<span class="italic">massa</span>) and the splendour of their cause (<span class="italic">candida</span>), whereas Prudentius makes the adjective refer to the whiteness of the lime which covered them. It has been suggested (<span class="italic">cf.</span> Allard, <span class="italic">op. cit.,</span> p. 116) that they were massacred and the bodies buried in quicklime, and that this gave rise to the tradition which Prudentius knew. It has also been conjectured that Candida Massa may have been a place-name (“Whitelands”?), since in later Latin <span class="italic">massa</span> often means a demesne; but if this had been the force of the name Augustine would surely have known it.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL398_335_aa').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
