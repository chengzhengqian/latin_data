<p>Believe ye now, ye Vascones, once dull pagans, how holy was the blood which cruel superstition sacrificed? Believe ye that the victims’ spirits were taken back to God? See how clearly here<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL398_107_a" id="target_note_LCL398_107_a"><sup>a</sup></a> wild devils are subdued, which like wolves capture and devour men’s hearts, choking their very minds and mingling with their senses. For then the maniac possessed by his enemy is presented here foaming at the mouth and rolling his blood-shot eyes, to be cleansed by the trial of sins which are not his own. You may hear woeful cries of agony though no torturer is here; his body is cut with lashes though you see no whip; he is slung on the rack and his limbs are stretched<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL398_107_b" id="target_note_LCL398_107_b"><sup>b</sup></a> with cords invisible. In such wise does the virtue that is in the martyrs beat down the filthy devil, constrain, torture, burn, enchain him, till the plunderer is so harried that he slips out of his victim’s marrows and departs. He leaves his prey unharmed, fleeing with bloodless jaws; from the tip of his toe to the hair of his head he gives back all uninjured, while he confesses that he himself is burning, for he is a dweller in hell. I need not tell how bodies whitened by lasting diseases have been cleansed of them, cases in which a cold shivering shakes limbs that have lost their colour, how in one a swelling leaves the face, or in another the natural hue returns. This blessing the Saviour himself bestowed for our advantage when He consecrated the martyrs’ bodies in our town, where now they protect the folk who dwell by Ebro’s waters.</p>
