Let the choir sing of Publius and tell again the story of Frontoâ€™s victory, of the sufferings good Felix bore, and brave Caecilianus, of the much blood that dyed thy warfare, Evotius, and thine, Primitivus; and let eager praise rehearse thy triumphs, Apodemius. It still remains to exalt the name of four though my metre refuses. Old times of long ago tell that they were each called Saturninus. Love of their golden names makes light of the rules of verse,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL398_167_a" id="target_note_LCL398_167_a"><sup>a</sup></a> and concern to speak of the saints is never incorrect nor barbarous. The measure of art is full if we recite to Christ the forms of the names as they are written down and contained in the book of heaven which shall be opened at the due time. Then shall the angel in presence of the Father and the Son rehearse the names of the eighteen saints who hold the governance of a single city in right of their burial here. And over and above the ancient number will be brought in the girl who lived on after exemplary suffering, and the death of Vincent, whose blood and glory draw from here; with Gaius and thee, Crementius, for you twain are not to be passed over;</p>

In line 163 the poet deliberately violates the Sapphic metre by beginning with a spondee in order to admit the name. Eugenius of Toledo in a poem on the basilica of the eighteen martyrs contrives to get all the names in by writing successive lines in different metres. He does not mention the name Saturninus, but four in his list which are not in that of Prudentius are Cassianus, Januarius, Matutinus and Faustus. These may have borne the name Saturninus also.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL398_167_a').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
