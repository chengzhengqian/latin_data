Death contended with God while He wore the body, but in attacking what belongs to us it retired before that which is immortal. You think this foolishness, you wise men of the world, but the supreme Father chose the foolish things of the world so that he who is foolish in respect of the world might be wise in the knowledge of God. You repeat the tale of ancient days about Romulus and Mars’ she-wolf<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL398_271_a" id="target_note_LCL398_271_a"><sup>a</sup></a> and the first omen of the vultures;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL398_271_b" id="target_note_LCL398_271_b"><sup>b</sup></a> but if you reject events of modern times, there is nothing so recent as these.
