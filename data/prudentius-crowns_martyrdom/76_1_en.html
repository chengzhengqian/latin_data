a divinity in them, there is a divinity in leeks as well. But, you say, the graven image in bronze is a thing of beauty. What curse shall I call down on the studios of Greece, which have created gods for foolish nations? Myron’s<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL398_249_a" id="target_note_LCL398_249_a"><sup>a</sup></a> tongs and Polyclitus’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL398_249_a" id="target_note_LCL398_249_a"><sup>a</sup></a> hammer are the substance and source of your heaven-dwellers.

And because they see Diana with her dress girt up for easy movement they are afraid of the huntress-maid’s bow; or if it chance that the molten metal with its rippling flow has moulded the features of Hercules to look rather grim, he is believed to be menacing men with his club unless he be worshipped. Again, what terror seizes the hearts of shrinking men if it has made a finished, lifelike figure of an angry Juno! As if she were looking askance and turning her face from the victim offered by her worshipper, the stone with its stern visage counterfeits menaces. I wonder you pagans have not deified Mentor<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL398_249_d" id="target_note_LCL398_249_d"><sup>d</sup></a> himself and that Phidias<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL398_249_e" id="target_note_LCL398_249_e"><sup>e</sup></a>
