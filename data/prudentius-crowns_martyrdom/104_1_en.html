<p><span class="sc">Countless</span> are the graves of saints I have seen in the city of Romulus, Valerian, Christ’s dedicated servant. You ask for the inscriptions cut on their tombs, and their individual names, but it is hard for me to be able to repeat them. Such great multitudes of the righteous did ungodly rage devour while Trojan Rome still worshipped the gods of her fathers. Many a grave is lettered and tells the martyr’s name or bears some epitaph, but there are mute marbles too, which shut up the tombs in silence and only indicate the number; you may learn what masses of men’s bodies lie gathered together in heaps, but read the name of none of them. I remember finding that the remains of sixty persons were buried there under one massive stone, whose

He seems indeed certainly to have been the theologian whose burial-place on the Via Tiburtina is known, and who was a presbyter at Rome, where he was opposed to bishop Callistus. In 235 he was banished to Sardinia, and it is commonly supposed that he died there soon afterwards. Prudentius seems to have derived his statements partly from an inscription set up by Damasus (Pope 366–384) at the burial-place (see <span class="italic">Anthologiae Latinae Supplementum, Damasi Epigrammata,</span> ed. Ihm, Leipzig, 1895, no. 37), partly from a picture which he saw there (<span class="italic">cf</span>. lines 123 ff.). Damasus himself says that he relied on purely oral tradition which he does not guarantee (“haec audita refert Damasus; probat omnia Christus”). He attributes to Hippolytus, as does Prudentius (19 ff.), adherence to the Novatian schism, which he is said to have repudiated on his way to martyrdom; this would imply that he returned from exile and lived till the middle of the century. Damasus says nothing about the manner of his death. There is no reason to doubt that Prudentius saw and correctly interpreted the picture which represented him as having been torn to pieces by wild horses, like the Hippolytus of the Greek mythology (see <span class="italic">Contra Symm.,</span> II, 53 ff.), but the picture may have owed its inspiration only to the identity of the name. There is also confusion in Prudentius, though not in Damasus, with a martyr Hippolytus of Portus (39 f.), who is mentioned in the Martyrology falsely ascribed to Jerome. Portus was a town which had grown up round the new harbour begun by Claudius and completed by Trajan, north of Ostia. For discussions see d’Alès, <span class="italic">La Théologie de S.
