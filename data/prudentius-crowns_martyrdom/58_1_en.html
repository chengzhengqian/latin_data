Here in the city let the gilded roofs re-echo, there a winning sound arise from the shore, and the seas keep holiday and make song. One day will come a time when in the dissolution of the world Fructuosus will free thee, Tarraco, from sore distresses, covering thee from fire; and perchance under Christ’s favour he will deign to give relief to my torments too, as he recalls my sweet hendecasyllables.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL398_213_a" id="target_note_LCL398_213_a"><sup>a</sup></a></p>
