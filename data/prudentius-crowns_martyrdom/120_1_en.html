<p>Meanwhile Thascius,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL398_337_a" id="target_note_LCL398_337_a"><sup>a</sup></a> gladdened by his people’s end, was brought out<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL398_337_b" id="target_note_LCL398_337_b"><sup>b</sup></a> to face the proconsul’s ungovernable rage. Bidden to declare his way of life, he said: “I am a worshipper of one God, and I teach the holy mysteries of Christ our Saviour.” Whereupon the other cried: “Guilt enough! Thascius himself admits it, and denies Jupiter’s thunderbolt. Get ready the steel, ye executioners. Let this enemy of idols pay the penalty by the sword.” Cyprian gave God due thanks and sang in triumph.</p>
<p>Africa wept in sorrow at the departure of the man whose teaching advanced her in cultivation, and of whose eloquence she boasts of having been the pupil. Afterwards with tears she raised a tomb and consecrated his ashes. Weep no more for this great blessing! He has attained to the realms of heaven, yet none the less he moves over the earth and does not leave this world. He still discourses, still holds forth, expounding, teaching, instructing, prophesying; and not only does he direct the peoples of Libya, but goes forth to the east and the west, nurturing the Gauls, training the Britons, keeping guard over Italy, spreading the knowledge of Christ in farthest Spain. Indeed he is both teacher on earth and martyr too in heaven; here he instructs men, from there as their patron gives them gifts in love.</p>
