on the waves. There the shepherd himself nurtures his sheep with the ice-cold water of the pool, for he sees them thirsting for the rivers of Christ.</p>
<p>“Elsewhere the Ostian Road keeps the memorial church of Paul, where the river grazes the land on its left bank. The splendour of the place is princely, for our good emperor<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL398_327_a" id="target_note_LCL398_327_a"><sup>a</sup></a> dedicated this seat and decorated its whole extent with great wealth. He laid plates on the beams so as to make all the light within golden like the sun’s radiance at its rising, and supported the gold-panelled ceiling on pillars of Parian marble set out there in four rows. Then he covered the curves of the arches with splendid glass of different hues, like meadows that are bright with flowers in the spring.</p>

See, the people of Romulus goes pouring through the streets two separate ways, for the same day is busy with two festivals. But let us hasten with quickened step to both and in each get full enjoyment of the songs of praise. We shall go further on, where the way leads over Hadrian’s bridge,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL398_327_b" id="target_note_LCL398_327_b"><sup>b</sup></a> and afterwards seek the left bank of the river. The sleepless bishop performs the sacred ceremonies first across the Tiber,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL398_327_c" id="target_note_LCL398_327_c"><sup>c</sup></a> then hurries back to this side and repeats his offerings.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL398_327_d" id="target_note_LCL398_327_d"><sup>d</sup></a> It is enough for you to have learned all this at Rome; when you return home, remember to keep this day of two festivals as you see it here.”</p>
