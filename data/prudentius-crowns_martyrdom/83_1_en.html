The violence of the claws digging into one’s side is less than the piercing pain with which the dire disease of the lungs assaults it. The skin when it is branded with the metal plates does not burn as hot as the fever that consumes the veins with its black gall, or the fire that spreads over the surface of the skin and roasts it, while the raging inflammation raises pustules and it is like being burned with hissing irons. You think it a wretched fate that I am hanging here stretched out, with my arms twisted behind me, that my feet are being pulled away from me and my joints make noises as the tendons crack; but it is just the same when men cry out in distress that their bones are being torn asunder because knotty gout or arthritis tortures them.
