<p>60. Concurrently the contest at Zama was being waged with great fury. Wherever each of the deputy commanders or tribunes was in charge, there the struggle was the fiercest, and no one placed hope more in another than in himself. The townspeople showed equal energy; men were fighting or making preparations at all points; each side was more eager to wound the other than to protect itself. There was a din of mingled encouragement, exultation, and groaning; the clash of arms also rose to heaven; missiles flew on both sides. But whenever the besiegers relaxed their assault ever so little, the defenders of the walls became intent spectators of the cavalry battle.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL116_301_193" id="target_note_LCL116_301_193"><sup>193</sup></a> As Jugurtha’s fortunes shifted, you might have seen them now joyful, now alarmed; and acting as if their countrymen could see or hear them, some shouted warnings, others shouted encouragement or gesticulated with their hands or strained with their bodies, moving both this way and that as if dodging or hurling weapons.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL116_301_194" id="target_note_LCL116_301_194"><sup>194</sup></a></p>
<p>When Marius perceived this—he was in charge in that area—he purposely slackened his efforts and pretended to be discouraged; he allowed the Numidians to view their king’s battle without disruption. When they were preoccupied with their zeal for their countrymen, he suddenly assaulted the wall with the utmost violence. Our soldiers, mounting on scaling ladders, had almost reached the top of the wall, when the townsmen rushed to the spot and sent down a rain of stones, flaming objects, and other missiles besides. At first our men resisted; then, as ladder after ladder was shattered and those who stood upon them were dashed to the ground, the rest made off in whatever way they could, a few unharmed but a significant number badly wounded. At last, night ended the combat on both sides.</p>
