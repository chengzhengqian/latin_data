me to brave the power of this clique. Certainly I shall be putting to the test freedom which is my inheritance from my father; but whether I shall do so in vain or to good purpose lies in your hands, Citizens. I do not urge you to resort to arms in response to the injuries done you, as your ancestors often did; there is no need for violence, none for secession.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL116_235_98" id="target_note_LCL116_235_98"><sup>98</sup></a> What is necessary is for those culprits to go to ruin each in his own way. After the murder of Tiberius Gracchus, whom they accused of trying to make himself king,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL116_235_99" id="target_note_LCL116_235_99"><sup>99</sup></a> trials were instituted against the Roman commons.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL116_235_100" id="target_note_LCL116_235_100"><sup>100</sup></a> After the slaughter of Gaius Gracchus and Marcus Fulvius, many mortals of your order were put to death in the prison house.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL116_235_101" id="target_note_LCL116_235_101"><sup>101</sup></a> In both cases bloodshed was ended, not by law but at the pleasure of the victors.</p>
<p>“But let’s assume that restoring to the commons their entitlements was the same thing as aspiring to kingship. Suppose that whatever cannot be avenged without shedding the blood of citizens<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL116_235_102" id="target_note_LCL116_235_102"><sup>102</sup></a> was justly done. In former years you were silently indignant that the treasury was being pillaged, that kings and free peoples paid tribute<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL116_235_103" id="target_note_LCL116_235_103"><sup>103</sup></a> to a few nobles, that those nobles possessed supreme glory and vast wealth. Still, they were not satisfied with having committed with impunity such crimes as these; and so at last the laws, your sovereignty, and all things human and divine have been handed over to our foreign enemies.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL116_235_104" id="target_note_LCL116_235_104"><sup>104</sup></a> And they who have done these things are neither ashamed nor sorry, but they strut in grandeur before your eyes, flaunting their priesthoods and consulships, some their triumphs, just as if they possessed these as marks of honor and not as plunder.</p>
