<p>There was in the midst of huge waste lands a large, strong town called Capsa,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL116_365_266" id="target_note_LCL116_365_266"><sup>266</sup></a> whose reputed founder was the Libyan Hercules.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL116_365_267" id="target_note_LCL116_365_267"><sup>267</sup></a> Under Jugurtha’s authority its citizens were held exempt from tribute, with a mild rule, and consequently were regarded as most loyal, being protected from their enemies not only by walls and armed men, but still more by the harshness of their locale. For, except in the vicinity of the town, all else is desolate, wild, lacking water, and infested by serpents, whose violence, like that of all wild creatures, is fiercer as a result of the scarcity of food. Moreover, their deadly disposition is especially aggravated by thirst. Marius had been seized with a great desire to gain control of that town, not only on account of its practical value in war, but also because the undertaking seemed hazardous and Metellus had gained great renown by the capture of Thala,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL116_365_268" id="target_note_LCL116_365_268"><sup>268</sup></a> a town similar in its situation and defenses, except for the fact that there were some springs not far from Thala, while the people of Capsa had but one source of ever-flowing water (and that within the town itself); otherwise they depended upon rain water. This scarcity of water was the more readily endured both there and in all Africa where<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL116_365_269" id="target_note_LCL116_365_269"><sup>269</sup></a> the people live a less civilized existence far from the sea because the Numidians consumed chiefly milk and game and sought neither salt nor other stimulants of the palate; for from their perspective, food served to ward off hunger and thirst, not as a means of luxurious self-indulgence.</p>
