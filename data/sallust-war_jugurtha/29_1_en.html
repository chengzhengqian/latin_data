After this letter had been read aloud in the senate, some were in favor of sending an army to Africa and rendering aid to Adherbal as soon as possible, recommending that in the meantime the senate take up the question of Jugurtha’s failure to obey the envoys. But those same partisans of the king<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL116_223_71" id="target_note_LCL116_223_71"><sup>71</sup></a> did their best to prevent the passing of such a decree.
