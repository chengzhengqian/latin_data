and friend of the Roman people, I am now being held in a state of siege for the fifth month,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL116_221_68" id="target_note_LCL116_221_68"><sup>68</sup></a> and neither the kindnesses of my father Micipsa nor your decrees avail me; it is hard to tell whether sword or famine presses harder on me.</p>
<p>“My plight discourages me from writing more about Jugurtha (and I have some time ago experienced that too little confidence is bestowed upon those in wretched circumstances); still, I perceive that that man is aiming at a higher mark than myself, and that he does not hope at the same time for your friendship and my kingdom. Which of these two he thinks of greater weight is hidden from no one; for he first killed Hiempsal, my brother, and then drove me from my father’s kingdom. These acts, granted that they were certainly personal injuries to me, have nothing to do with you. But now he holds <span class="italic">your</span> realm by force of arms; he is blockading and besieging me, whom you set up as commander over the Numidians.

<p>“But since I was born merely to serve as an advertisement of Jugurtha’s crimes, I no longer pray to be spared death or sorrows, but only that I may escape the domination of an enemy and bodily torment. Consult, just as you please, the interests of the kingdom of Numidia, which is yours; but snatch me from impious hands, I implore you by the majesty of your dominion and by the trust placed
