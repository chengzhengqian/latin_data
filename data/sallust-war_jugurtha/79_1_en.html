Nabdalsa set out for his army, which he was keeping, according to his orders, between the winter encampments of the Romans<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL116_323_228" id="target_note_LCL116_323_228"><sup>228</sup></a> so as to prevent the enemy from ravaging the country with impunity. When, overcome by anxiety at the enormity of the proposed crime, he did not appear at the appointed hour and his dread thwarted their enterprise, Bomilcar was eager to carry out his design and at the same time disconcerted by his accomplice’s fear in case he might abandon their former plan and look for a new one.
