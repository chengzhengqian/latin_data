what place am I above all to draw near in my troubles? All defenses afforded by family have been wiped out. My father, as was inevitable, has yielded to the law of nature. My brother has had his life wickedly taken from him by a man who should have been to last person to commit such a crime,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL116_197_31" id="target_note_LCL116_197_31"><sup>31</sup></a> his kinsman.
