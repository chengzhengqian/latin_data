Marius promptly carried out his instructions. As for Jugurtha, hampered as he was by the fortifications of the camp (since some of his men were hurling themselves headlong over the ramparts, while others, trying to hurry in the crowded spaces, were getting in each other’s way) withdrew to a defensible position with considerable losses.
