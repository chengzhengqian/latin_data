slain, and eager for glory, they strove to reach the wall; booty did not slow down any one at all. Thus Marius’ rashness was made good by pure chance and found glory out of blame.</p>

<p>95. While this campaign was in progress, the quaestor Lucius Sulla arrived<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL116_379_281" id="target_note_LCL116_379_281"><sup>281</sup></a> in camp with a large force of horsemen which he had been left in Rome to muster from the Latins<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL116_379_282" id="target_note_LCL116_379_282"><sup>282</sup></a> and from allied communities. And since the subject matter has brought to our attention such a great man, it seems fitting to say a few words about his nature and manner of life. For I am not going to speak elsewhere of Sulla’s deeds,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL116_379_283" id="target_note_LCL116_379_283"><sup>283</sup></a> and Lucius Sisenna,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL116_379_284" id="target_note_LCL116_379_284"><sup>284</sup></a> who has done the best and most competent job of all writers who have treated those deeds, has not, in my opinion, spoken with sufficient frankness.</p>
<p>Sulla, then, was a noble of patrician stock, of a family which had almost faded away to nothingness thanks to the inactivity of his ancestors.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL116_379_285" id="target_note_LCL116_379_285"><sup>285</sup></a> He was versed alike in Greek and Roman literature, very high spirited, fond of pleasure but more fond of glory. Though a man of luxurious leisure, nevertheless, pleasure never slowed him down in his undertakings, except that he could have taken a more honorable decision concerning his wife.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL116_379_286" id="target_note_LCL116_379_286"><sup>286</sup></a> He was eloquent, clever, and easygoing in his friendships. His mind possessed a depth beyond belief in putting up pretenses; he was generous with many things, especially with money.
