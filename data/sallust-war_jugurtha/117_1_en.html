friends whom Jugurtha had left unbribed, chose out of the entire body of those closest to him five who were known to be faithful and possessed preeminent ability. These he ordered to go as envoys to Marius and then, if Marius agreed, to Rome; he gave them complete freedom of action and permission to end the war in any way at all. These envoys quickly left for the Romans’ winter quarters; then, on route they were set upon and robbed by Gaetulian bandits and fled in terror and disarray to Sulla, whom the consul had left as commander in his place when setting out on his expedition. Sulla did not treat them as enemies of no account, just as they deserved,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL116_399_303" id="target_note_LCL116_399_303"><sup>303</sup></a> but with respect and generosity. As a result, the barbarians regarded the Romans’ reputation for avarice as undeserved and regarded Sulla as their friend because of his liberality toward them. For even at that comparatively late date many men<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL116_399_304" id="target_note_LCL116_399_304"><sup>304</sup></a> had no experience of calculated openhandedness; no one who was generous was suspected of insincerity; all gifts were regarded as indications of kind feeling. Therefore they made known to the quaestor<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL116_399_305" id="target_note_LCL116_399_305"><sup>305</sup></a> Bocchus’ instructions; at the same time, they begged him to help them as a supporter and advisor. In a speech, they extolled the military forces, integrity and greatness of their sovereign and other aspects which they thought were useful for making their case or likely to produce goodwill. Then, after Sulla had promised to do all that they asked and had instructed them how to address Marius and the senate, they lingered there for about forty days.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL116_399_306" id="target_note_LCL116_399_306"><sup>306</sup></a></p>
