upon a given signal, some of the cavalry and infantry began to cut down the crowd that had poured from the town; others hurried to the gates, while a part seized the towers; anger and hope for plunder counted for more than their weariness.</p>
<p>Thus for only two days after their treachery did the people of Vaga take delight. Their large and prosperous community was entirety given over to vengeance and plunder. Turpilius, the prefect of the town, who, as I indicated above, was the only one to escape, was ordered by Metellus to plead his case, and being unable to clear himself, he was found guilty and put to death after being scourged; for he was a citizen possessing only Latin status.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL116_321_225a" id="target_note_LCL116_321_225a"><sup>225</sup></a></p>
