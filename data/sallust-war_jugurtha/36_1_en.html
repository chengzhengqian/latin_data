<p>“Slaves bought for cash do not put up with the unjust power of their masters; do you, Citizens, born to power, endure slavery with resignation? But who are these persons who have taken possession of our country? Wicked men, with gory hands, of monstrous greed, guilty, and at the same time arrogant, who have made good faith, reputation, a sense of duty, in short everything honorable and dishonorable, a source of gain.
