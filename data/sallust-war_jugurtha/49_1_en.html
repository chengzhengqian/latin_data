<p>42. For example, after Tiberius and Gaius Gracchus, whose forefathers had added greatly to the power of the nation in the Punic and other wars,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL116_263_147" id="target_note_LCL116_263_147"><sup>147</sup></a> began to assert the freedom of the commons and expose the crimes of the oligarchs, the nobility—guilty and for that reason panic-stricken—opposed the activities of the Gracchi, now through the allies and those having Latin status,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL116_263_148" id="target_note_LCL116_263_148"><sup>148</sup></a> at times through the Roman Knights, who had been estranged from the commons by the hope of an alliance with the senate. And first Tiberius, then a few years later Gaius, who was following in his brother’s footsteps—the one a tribune, the other a member of the Board of Three for founding colonies—were cut down with the sword along with Marcus Fulvius Flaccus. And the Gracchi, to be sure, lacked sufficient restraint in their eagerness for victory; but it is preferable for a good man to be defeated than to triumph over a wrong in a wicked manner.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL116_263_149" id="target_note_LCL116_263_149"><sup>149</sup></a></p>
<p>And so, the nobles abused their victory to gratify their passions; they put many mortals out of the way by the sword or by banishment; and for the future they gained for themselves a greater measure of intimidation than of power. It is this spirit which has commonly sent great nations crashing down, when one party desires to triumph over another by any means at all and to take vengeance on the vanquished with excessive cruelty. But if I should be prepared to discuss in detail, or according to the importance of the theme, the partisan spirit of the political factions and the character of the state as a whole, I shall sooner run out of time than material. Therefore I return to my subject.</p>
