people and senate of Rome together managed political affairs between them peacefully and with moderation. There was no strife among the citizens either for glory or for mastery; fear of the enemy abroad kept the state within the bounds of good morals. But when that dread departed from the minds of the people, there arose, of course, those vices which tend to be fostered by prosperity: promiscuity and arrogance. Thus the peacetime for which they had longed in time of adversity, after they had gained it, proved to be more cruel and bitter than adversity itself. For the nobles began to abuse their standing and the people their liberty, and every man took, pillaged, and plundered for himself. Thus the community was split into two rival groups, and the state, which had formerly been shared, was torn to pieces.</p>
<p>Still, the nobles had greater dominance thanks to their faction, while the strength of the commons was less powerful because it was incompact and divided among many. Affairs at home and in war were managed according to the will of a few, in whose same hands were the treasury, the provinces, public offices, opportunities for winning glory and triumphs. The people were burdened with military service and poverty. The generals divided the spoils of war with a few friends. Meanwhile, the soldiersâ€™ parents or little children, just as each happened to be a neighbor of a more powerful individual, were driven from their abodes. Thus, along with power, unlimited and unrestrained greed arose; it violated and devastated everything, respected nothing, and held nothing sacred until it finally brought about its own downfall. For as soon as there were discovered among the nobility those who preferred true glory to unjust power, the state began to be disturbed and civil dissension to arise, like an upheaval of the earth.</p>
