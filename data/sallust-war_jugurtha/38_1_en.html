contradictory attitudes? So I warn and urge you not to let such wickedness go unpunished. It is not embezzlement of the treasury, nor has money been extorted from our allies—serious crimes, to be sure, yet as a result of their frequency they are regarded as of no consequence.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL116_241_110" id="target_note_LCL116_241_110"><sup>110</sup></a> Rather, the senate’s dignity has been sold out for the benefit of a ruthless enemy, as has your sovereignty; the interests of your country have been offered for sale at home and abroad.
