with fluttering strings and my soul, even now aware of what shall be, quakes with foreboding lest, shackled with paltry cares for the body and weighted with a load of business, if perchance the awful trump should peal from the opened heaven, it should fail to raise itself on light pinions into the air to meet the Lord,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL115_147_1" id="target_note_LCL115_147_1"><sup>1</sup></a> flitting in Heaven amid glorified thousands of the saints, who through the void up to the stars on high shall with unlaborious effort uplift light feet, unshackled with the world’s fetters, and wafted on soft clouds shall pass amid the stars to worship the Heavenly King in mid air and join their glorious companies with Christ whom they adore.</p>
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">316</span><span class="br"></span><p>This is my fear, this my task, that the Last Day overtake me not asleep in the black darkness of profitless pursuits, spending wasted time amid empty cares.

<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">324</span><span class="br"></span><p>Wherefore, that neither doubt of the truth, nor love of this present life with delight in worldly things and anxious toil should bring this on me, I am resolved to forestall calamity by my plan of life, to end anxieties while life remains, awaiting with untroubled heart fierce Death, the general doom of things for ages yet to come.</p>
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">320</span><span class="br"></span><p>If this thou dost approve, rejoice in thy friend’s rich hope: if otherwise, leave me to be approved by Christ alone.</p>
