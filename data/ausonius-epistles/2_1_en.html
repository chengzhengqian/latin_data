<p>But in this I think you are excessively modest, that you complain of me for playing traitor to your book. For it is easier to hold hot coals in one’s mouth than to keep the secret of a brilliant work. Once you have let a poem out of your hands, you have renounced all your rights: a speech delivered is common property.
