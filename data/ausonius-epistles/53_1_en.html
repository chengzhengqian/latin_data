would I clasp thee, ready to my embrace, and the air of my complaint would be breathed into thy ears.</p>
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">87</span><span class="br"></span><p>Now for thee beyond the Alps and stony Pyrenees, Saragossa is thy home,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL115_107_1" id="target_note_LCL115_107_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Tyrrhenian Tarragona<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL115_107_2" id="target_note_LCL115_107_2"><sup>2</sup></a> is near by, and Barcelona built above the oyster-bearing sea: me hills, me rivers in triple array<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL115_107_3" id="target_note_LCL115_107_3"><sup>3</sup></a> part from Bordeaux and from the common throng, and in my leisure the vine-clad hills engage me, the rich glebe with its blithe peasantry, now the green meads, now the copse with its dancing shades, the church<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL115_107_4" id="target_note_LCL115_107_4"><sup>4</sup></a> thronged with crowding villagers, and all those my domains hard by each other in Novarus village, which enjoy such change at the various seasons throughout the year, that the chill winters are warm for them and in the furious summer heats soft north winds breathe over them a gentle coolness. Yet without thee the year advances, bringing no grateful change. The rainy Spring flits by lacking its flower, the heat-bringing Dog-Star parches, Pomona brings not variety of sweet autumn fruits, and with outpoured water Aquarius makes gloomy all the winter. Dost, thou perceive thy fault, my dearest Pontius? For my loyalty remains steadfast and, never to be changed, my regard for the Paulinus of old days endures, even as the harmony betwixt my sire and thine. If Ulysses’ bow was easy to be strung by any man, or if Achilles’ spear could be wielded save by its lord, then shall the queen of Rhamnus loose us from so long a bond.</p>
