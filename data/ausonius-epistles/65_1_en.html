training, honours, learning, my pride of eloquence, of civil rank, of reputation, being by thee advanced, fostered, and instructed, my patron, tutor, father.</p>

It is expedient, or ’tis necessary, or ’tis my pleasure: whichever of these it be, it will be pardonable. Forgive me, as I love thee, if I do what is convenient; be thankful if I live as pleases me.</p>
<span class="label"><span class="sc">Paulinus to Ausonius</span></span>
<p>That I shall be absent from my native land full three years’ space, and that I have traversed another world in aimless wanderings, forgetful of that fellowship in thy life, once cherished—thou dost reproach me with complaints hallowed by the love whence they spring. I welcome with reverence due the emotions of a father’s heart and the anger which claims my gratitude leaving affection unimpaired. Yet for my return, my father, I would rather thou should’st ask it there where it can be granted. Shall I believe that thou canst call me back to thee while thou pourest forth barren prayers to beings not divine, suppliant to the Castalian Muses while God turns from thee? Not through such deities wilt thou bring me back to thee and to my country. Thou call’st the deaf, implorest things of naught—a light breeze will bear away what is addressed to a nothing—the Muses, who are names but nonentities. The stormy winds whirl away ineffectual such prayers as these, which, not addressed to God, catch in the empty clouds nor make their way into the starry court of the King of Heaven.</p>
