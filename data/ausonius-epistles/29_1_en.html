Ninety days without thee have I dragged out, my dearest comrade; add further, summer days: this makes them nearly twice as long for me. Wouldst have me say that nine times ten days or ten times nine are gone? A fourth part of the year is passed away. Sixty hours and two thousand and a hundred beside without thee have I spent—without whom even an hour hangs heavy. Miles twice nine hundred the laws’ appointment bids men accused traverse to full reckoning in so many days.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL115_59_2a" id="target_note_LCL115_59_2a"><sup>2</sup></a> By this time could I have gone afoot to Rome, and afoot returned, since the time when a few miles have parted thee from me. Has a thatched cot at Dumnitonus such charms for a bard? My villa Pauliacos<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL115_59_3" id="target_note_LCL115_59_3"><sup>3</sup></a> would not weigh so with me.

So either send back now forthwith the aforesaid <span class="italic">louis</span> and buy back thy freedom slothfully to linger, or I will freely give as many more besides, provided I behold the face of one so dear, however poor he be.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL115_59_5" id="target_note_LCL115_59_5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
