official robe grows shabby in some mouldering shrine; whereas in fact it hangs in the renowned city of Roman Quirinus along with the imperial palm-broidered robes, trophies of like distinction, there gleaming, long venerable, with unfrayed gold, keeping fresh the glorious bloom of thy deathless achievement? Or when thou art lodged under the roof of Lucanus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL115_143_1" id="target_note_LCL115_143_1"><sup>1</sup></a> thy country house, inhabiting a pile vying with the halls of Rome, shall we take the pretext afforded by the place which gives its name to the vicinity, saying thou dwellest in the hamlet of Condate<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL115_143_2" id="target_note_LCL115_143_2"><sup>2</sup></a>?</p>
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">260</span><span class="br"></span><p>Let much admit of jests, let sportive fiction also be allowed; but with a smooth tongue to strike against an aching tooth, to sport with stinging compliments, and to season jests ill-relished with the vinegar of tart satire, oft befits a poet, never a father. For loyalty and natural affection demand that what slander-spinning Rumour instils into guileless ears, that the good-hoping mind of a father should not suffer to take hold and gain firm lodgment in the heart. Even the common herd, malignant in its brutal sneers towards habits formerly observed, does not always hold it crime to alter one’s life: for to alter wisely is accounted praise. When thou hearest I am changed, ask what is my pursuit and my business. If ’tis a change from right to wrong, from godliness to wickedness, from temperance to luxury, from honour to baseness, if I live slothf I, sluggish, ignoble, take pity on a comrade strayed into evil; a gentle father well may be stirred with anger to restore a fallen friend to right living and by stern reproof to bring him back to better things.</p>
