Pylades would have left Orestes, and Sicilian Damon would not have kept his bond! What general delight, what good men’s prayers have thus been cheated of their looked-for gain! They all were speaking words of congratulation: already they were about to enter our names in the lists of friends belonging to nobler days of old.
