essence of every great mind in the realm of the liberal arts?</p>
<p>My lord, my son Symmachus, I do not fear that you may think I speak thus of you more smoothly than truly. Indeed, you have proved how truthful I am both in thought and word while the two of us, so ill-matched in years, lived at court, where you, a recruit, earned a veteran’s pay, while I, already a veteran, went through my recruit’s training. At court I was truthful with you: much less when I am away from it should you think I tell stories. At court, I repeat, which bares the face and veils the heart<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL115_9_1" id="target_note_LCL115_9_1"><sup>1</sup></a>—there you felt that I was a father and a friend and, if anything can be dearer than either, then something dearer still. But let us leave this matter, lest such a reminder seem too like the fear felt by Sosias.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL115_9_2" id="target_note_LCL115_9_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Now for that matter which I almost passed over. What mock humility of yours is this, that you add a request for me to send you some didactic work or hortatory discourse? Shall I teach you when I myself need teaching<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL115_9_3" id="target_note_LCL115_9_3"><sup>3</sup></a> were I of an age to learn? Shall I counsel you, whose mind is so alert and vigorous? As well exhort the Muses to sing and advise the waves to flow, the breezes to blow freely, fire to give heat, and where anything occurs naturally, whether we will or no, to urge it forward with superfluous zeal! Enough this one mistake that a work of mine has, to my regret, become public property; though by good fortune it has fallen into the hands of friends. For had it been otherwise, not even you would convince me that I can give satisfaction.</p>
