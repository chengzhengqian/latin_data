<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Maurenbr., building on a suggestion of Kritz that the fragment might concern complaints by a tribune against the Sullan constitution (</span>servitium <span class="italic">also being the word used by the tribune of the plebs Licinius Macer to describe the reforms imposed by Sulla, 3.15.1), saw a reference to the demand of the tribune Sicinius in 76 for the restoration of the tribunate. Alternatively, the “slavery” could be literal and refer to the aim of Spartacus and the gladiators when they made their escape from Capua in 73 (so de Brosses and Gerlach), or it could describe some oppressed nation suffering at the hands of Mithridates or the Romans.</span></p>

Alternatively, it could refer to the activity of the Gracchi (so de Brosses and Gerlach), or to any number of revolutionary designs, or to simply a change in the course of action being pursued (see note below).</span></p>
