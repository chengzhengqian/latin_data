On the contrary, Kritz and Dietsch, rejecting Servius’ interpretation of the expression, assumed that it formed part of S.’s description of the</span> <span class="italic">mythical whirlpool Charybdis (treated in fr. 4.19), which was said to undergo each day three cycles of absorption and regurgitation (Hom</span>.
