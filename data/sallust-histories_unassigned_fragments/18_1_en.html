<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Lack of context makes it impossible to say whether </span>inferior<span class="italic"> (lit., “more lowly”) refers to a physical situation (e.g., a military force trying to make its way through mountain passes occupied by the enemy: so La Penna) or is applied metaphorically to a person lacking the resources or standing to compete on a level playing field in politics or business and therefore sought his objectives by any means possible.</span></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Lack of context and the brevity of the text make it impossible to say whether S. was referring to strength that was of body or of spirit.

It presumably once contained some form of the word </span>verus, <span class="italic">since the scholiast quoted S. to give an example of that word with the meaning “useful.” Italics in the translation signifies that the text is uncertain.</span></p>
