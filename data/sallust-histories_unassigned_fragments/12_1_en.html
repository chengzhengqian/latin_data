<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">A threatening gesture: possibly that made against the consul C. Piso in 67 when he tried to prevent the tribune C. Cornelius from reading the text of his bill despite the veto of a tribunician colleague (so Maurenbr. citing Ascon. p. 58C, </span>cum ille eos qui sibi intentabant manus prendi a lictore iussisset, <span class="italic">“when Piso had ordered his lictor to seize those who were threatening him with their fists”).</span></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">The occasion is apparently the return of some general to Rome, since the temple of Bellona lay in the Campus Martius, near the Circus Flaminius, outside the pomerium, and for that reason was a frequent meeting place of the senate when it was desirable for a commander possessing military imperium to attend. Possibly the person returning was Pompey, after the completion of the first phase of his campaign in 67 to eradicate piracy (so Maurenbr. citing Plut. </span>Pomp.<span class="italic"> 27.1–2). If so, this fragment provides the sole piece of evidence that S. gave a reasonably full account of Pompey’s eradication of the pirates.</span></p>
