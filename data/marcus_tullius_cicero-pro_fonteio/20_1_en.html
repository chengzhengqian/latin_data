without doubt, yet levelled and alleged by his opponent they were. How numerous were the indictments to which Manius Aquilius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL252_347_a" id="target_note_LCL252_347_a"><sup>a</sup></a> had to listen in his trial! or Lucius Cotta<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL252_347_a" id="target_note_LCL252_347_a"><sup>a</sup></a>! or Publius Rutilius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL252_347_a" id="target_note_LCL252_347_a"><sup>a</sup></a>! the last of whom, condemned though he was, seems to me worthy of a place among the best and most irreproachable of men. Yes, that model of uprightness and continence heard laid to his charge much that implied suspicion of adulterous and licentious conduct. There is extant a speech delivered by one who was,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">39</span><span class="br"></span>

When Gracchus ordered that he should be summoned before the assembled people, and when the attendant asked which Piso (for there were several who bore the name), he remarked, “You force me to say—My opponent, Piso the Honest.” Yes, the man whom even his enemy could not sufficiently indicate without praising, whose bare surname alone declared not only his identity but his character, was yet called upon to meet a false and unjust charge of scandalous conduct.

Fonteius has been arraigned in two trials without anything being alleged against him from which the slightest taint of licentious, headstrong, cruel, or unscrupulous conduct can be inferred. So far from adducing any crime that he has committed, they have not even laid hold of any word of his as blameworthy.</p>
