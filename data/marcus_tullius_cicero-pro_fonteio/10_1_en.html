most important and the most damaging of all. The terms in which the charge has been stated by Plaetorius
are as follows: it was not in Gaul that Marcus Fonteius first conceived the idea of imposing a transit-duty<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL252_327_a" id="target_note_LCL252_327_a"><sup>a</sup></a> on wine, but the plan was suggested to him in Italy before he left Rome. Accordingly it is alleged that Titurius exacted at Tolosa four denarii on every amphora of wine under the head of transit-duty; that at Crodunum Porcius and Munius exacted three <span class="italic">victoriati</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL252_327_b" id="target_note_LCL252_327_b"><sup>b</sup></a>; while at Vulchalo Servaeus exacted two <span class="italic">victoriati</span>; also that in these districts transit-duty
was exacted from any who turned aside at Cobiomachus (a village between Tolosa and Narbo), not wishing to proceed to Tolosa; and that at Elesioduli
they exacted six denarii on each amphora from those who conveyed wine to the enemy. I realize,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">20</span><span class="br"></span> gentlemen, that this is a grave charge—grave not only in its actual nature—for it is alleged that a tax has been imposed on our produce, and I admit that vast sums might have been raised by this method—but grave also in the odium it must arouse; for our enemies have done their best to spread this imputation by common talk as widely as possible. But, in my opinion, the heinousness of the outrage committed by the inventor of a charge which is proved to be false is great in proportion to the gravity of the offence alleged; for by the very enormity of the charge he aims at so hypnotizing the minds of his hearers as to leave but a difficult access to the truth hereafter.</p>
