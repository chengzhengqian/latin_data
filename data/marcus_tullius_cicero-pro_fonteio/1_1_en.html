<p>I. . . . that he ought to have . . .; or did he pay<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1</span><span class="br"></span>
as all the others paid? For my defence, gentlemen of the jury, of Marcus Fonteius, my contention is that, since the enactment of the Valerian Law,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL252_309_a" id="target_note_LCL252_309_a"><sup>a</sup></a> from his quaestorship until that of Titus Crispinus no one has ever paid otherwise; I assert that my client followed the example of all his predecessors, while all my client’s successors have followed his. What<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> accusation do you make? What fault can you find? For with regard to the prosecutor’s statement that in the account-books where the abatements of three-fourths
and additions of one-fourth were made,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL252_309_b" id="target_note_LCL252_309_b"><sup>b</sup></a> which he says were established by Hirtuleius,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL252_309_c" id="target_note_LCL252_309_c"><sup>c</sup></a> he finds Fonteius to have failed in his duty, I cannot conclude whether he is himself mistaken, or wishes to lead you, gentlemen, astray. I put it to you, Marcus Plaetorius: can you bring yourself to admit that we have made good our case, if Marcus Fonteius, in that whereof you accuse him, has followed the lead of Hirtuleius in whose praises you are so loud, while in that for which you praise Hirtuleius, Fonteius has done exactly the same? You censure the method
