<p>VI</p>
<p><span class="italic">Ulysses meeting with Nausicaa:</span></p>
<p>Diomedes: ‘Amplector.’ But this was altered in form by people of olden time, who constantly said ‘amploctor’ . . .—

<p><span class="italic">Nausicaa tells Ulysses he must wait near the city until she is ready to go there:</span></p>
<p>Charisius: ‘Donicum ‘for ‘donec’ So Livius . . .—

<p>VIII</p>
<p><span class="italic">Ulysses in Alcinous’ palace. During the pauses in Demodocus’ recital, Ulysses in grief wipes his eyes:</span></p>
<p>Festus: ‘Noegeum.’ Some say that this is a kind of cloak fringed with purple, while others say it is white, translucent, derived as it were from ‘naucum,’ which is the very thin and whitish peel of certain fruits. So Livius writes in <span class="italic">The
Odyssey</span>—
</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line indent1">as soon as he wiped away with the mantle the</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">tears from his face,</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">‘noegeo,’ that is, with a white<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL314_33_a" id="target_note_LCL314_33_a"><sup>a</sup></a> mantle.</p>

Livius by ‘noegeum’ means simply the φᾶρος, or cloak; in Homer, Odysseus covers his head to hide his grief, wipes his eyes, and again uncovers his head. Homer does not make Odysseus dry his tears with the cloak.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL314_33_a').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
