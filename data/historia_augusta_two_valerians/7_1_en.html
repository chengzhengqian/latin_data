<p>Nothing further, I think, should be demanded concerning either older or younger Valerian. And since I fear to exceed the proper limit of a volume, if I add to this book Valerian’s son Gallienus, concerning whom we have already said much, and perchance too much, in the life of his father, or even Gallienus’ son Saloninus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_15_1" id="target_note_LCL263_15_1"><sup>1</sup></a> who is called in the history of his time both Saloninus and Gallienus, let us now pass, as we are bidden, to another volume. For, indeed, we have ever submitted to you and to Fame, to whom we can make no refusal.</p>
