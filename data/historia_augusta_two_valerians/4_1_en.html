in the public services of Valerian, I will cite the decrees of the senate,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_9_1" id="target_note_LCL263_9_1"><sup>1</sup></a> which will make it clear to all what judgement concerning him was always expressed by that most illustrious body.</p>
<p>In the consulship of the two Decii, on the sixth<span class="marginNote right">27 Oct., 251</span>
day before the Kalends of November, when, pursuant to an imperial mandate, the senate convened in the Temple of Castor and Pollux,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_9_2" id="target_note_LCL263_9_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and each senator was asked his opinion as to the man to whom the censorship<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_9_3a" id="target_note_LCL263_9_3a"><sup>3</sup></a> should be offered (for this the Decii had left in the power of the most high senate), when the praetor had first announced the question, “What is your desire, Conscript Fathers, with regard to choosing a censor?” and then asked the opinion of him who was then the chief of the senate<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_9_4" id="target_note_LCL263_9_4"><sup>4</sup></a> in the absence of Valerian (for at that time he was in military service with Decius), then all, breaking through the usual mode of giving the vote, cried out with one voice:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_9_5" id="target_note_LCL263_9_5"><sup>5</sup></a> “Valerian’s life is a censorship. Let him judge all, who is better than all. Let him judge the senate, who is free from guilt. Let him pronounce sentence on our lives, against whom no reproach can be brought. From early childhood Valerian has been a censor. All his life long Valerian has been a censor. A wise senator, a modest senator, a respected senator. The friend of the good, the enemy of tyrants, the foe of crimes, the foe of vices. He it is whom we all accept as censor, whom we all desire to imitate. Foremost
