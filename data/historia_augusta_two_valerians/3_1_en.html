Romans or subject to them. So, then, you have captured one old man but have made all the nations of the world your bitterest foes, and ours too, perhaps, for we have sent you aid, we are your neighbours, and we always suffer when you fight with each other.”</p>
<p>IV. The Bactrians, the Hiberians,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_7_1" id="target_note_LCL263_7_1"><sup>1</sup></a> the Albanians,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_7_2" id="target_note_LCL263_7_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and the Tauroscythians<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_7_3" id="target_note_LCL263_7_3"><sup>3</sup></a> refused to receive Sapor’s letters and wrote to the Roman commanders, promising aid for the liberation of Valerian from his captivity.</p>
