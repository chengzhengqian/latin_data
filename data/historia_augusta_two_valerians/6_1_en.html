necessity of passing judgement on the people, the soldiers, the senate, and all judges, tribunes and generals the whole world over. It is for this that you have the name of Augustus. You it is on whom the office of censor devolves, for no commoner can duly fill it. Therefore I ask to be excused from this office, to which my life is unequal, my courage unequal, and the times so unfavourable that human nature does not desire the office of censor.”</p>
<p>VII. I could, indeed, cite many other senatorial decrees and imperial judgements concerning Valerian, were not most of them known to you, and did I not feel ashamed to extol too greatly a man who was vanquished by what seems a destined doom. Now let me turn to the younger Valerian.</p>
<p>VIII. Valerian the younger,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_13_1" id="target_note_LCL263_13_1"><sup>1</sup></a> the son of a different mother from Gallienus, conspicuous for his beauty, admired for his modesty, distinguished in learning for one of his years, amiable in his manners, and holding aloof from the vicious ways of his brother, received from his father, when absent, the title of Caesar and from his brother, so says Caelestinus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_13_2" id="target_note_LCL263_13_2"><sup>2</sup></a> that of Augustus. His life contains nothing worthy of note, save that he was nobly born, excellently reared, and pitiably slain.</p>
<p>Now since I know that many are in error, who have read the inscription of Valerian the Emperor on a tomb, and believe that the body of that Valerian who was captured by the Persians was given back again, I have thought it my duty, that no error might creep in, to set down in writing that it was this younger Valerian who was buried near Milan and that by Claudius’ order the inscription was added: “Valerian the Emperor.”</p>
