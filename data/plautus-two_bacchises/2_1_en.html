<span class="italic">The beginning of the play has been lost, together with a plot
summary. Nevertheless, it is quite clear what the beginning
must have contained (see the general introduction to this play).
It is also relatively certain that the lost passage can hardly have
been longer than two hundred to three hundred verses, otherwise
the play would have been excessively long.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="italic">Not only do we have a good idea of the contents and the
length of the lost passage, but we can also reconstruct some of its
structure. The Codex uetus Camerarii has preserved traces of
an algebraic notation of speakers; the first speaker to appear is
A, the second B, and so on. Since Bacchis is abbreviated A, we
can assume that she was the first to appear in the play. Interestingly,
she was also the first person to appear in Menander’s original,
of which we know half of the opening line (fr. 1 Sandbach).
The second speaker in the</span> Bacchides <span class="italic">was Bacchis’ servant, so
the first scene was probably a dialogue between the two. The
third speaker in Plautus’ play was Pistoclerus. Since he is the
character who knows most of the background to the play, he
presumably delivered a delayed prologue. The fourth speaker
was the soldier’s servant, who is likely to have accompanied the
fifth speaker, Bacchis’ sister.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="italic">Various Roman scholars have preserved quotations from
the lost beginning of our play because they are interesting to
grammarians or lexicographers.</span>
