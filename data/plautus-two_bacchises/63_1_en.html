<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">sis</span><p class="lineGroup">One of them has certainly already been fleeced twice today.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">bac</span><p class="lineGroup">They’re old, * * *.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">sis</span><p class="lineGroup">But I believe they used to be good.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">bac</span><p class="lineGroup">Please, can you see how they’re casting sidelong glances?<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1130</span><span class="br"></span>
</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">sis</span><p class="lineGroup">Yes, but I think they’re without any wickedness.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">phil</span><p class="lineGroup">(<span class="italic">to Nicobulus</span>) This serves us right for coming here.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">bac</span><p class="lineGroup">(<span class="italic">to her sister</span>) They really ought to be driven inside.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">sis</span><p class="lineGroup">I don’t know what that would be good for: they have neither
milk nor wool. Let them stand there like this.
They’ve yielded what they were worth, all their produce<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1135</span><span class="br"></span>
is finished. Can’t you see how they’re wandering around,
dispersed [lonely, free]? I even think that they’re dumb
because of their age. They aren’t even bleating despite
being away from the rest of the flock. They seem silly, but
not bad.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">bac</span><p class="lineGroup">Let’s go back in, my sister.<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1140</span><span class="br"></span>
</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">nic</span><p class="lineGroup">(<span class="italic">to the girls</span>) Stay where you are, both of you: these sheep
want to speak to you.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">sis</span><p class="lineGroup">(<span class="italic">to Bacchis</span>) This is an omen: the sheep are addressing us
with human voice.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">nic</span><p class="lineGroup">These sheep will give you the good thrashing they owe
you.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">bac</span><p class="lineGroup">If you owe us one, I’ll let you off the hook. Have it for
yourself, I’ll never demand it from you. But what’s the
reason for threatening us with a thrashing?</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">phil</span><p class="lineGroup">Because they say our two lambs are locked up there.<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1145</span><span class="br"></span>
(<span class="italic">points to Bacchis’ house</span>)</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">nic</span><p class="lineGroup">And besides these lambs my dog is secretly in there, a
real biter. Unless these are produced for us immediately
and let out, we’ll be ferocious rams and attack you this instant.</p></div>
