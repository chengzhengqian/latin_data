character they find their own curse; they’re friends to
nobody, they themselves have all people as their enemies.
And these idiots think they’re fooling others, when
they’re just fooling themselves. This is what the man is
like whom I believed to be as much a friend to me as I am
to myself. He took as much care as he could to do as<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">550</span><span class="br"></span>
much bad to me as he was able to and to trick me out of
all I had.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">pis</span><p class="lineGroup">He must be a reprobate.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">mne</span><p class="lineGroup">I think so.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">pis</span><p class="lineGroup">Please tell me who it is.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">mne</span><p class="lineGroup">He lives on good terms with you. If it weren’t like this, I’d<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">554</span><span class="br"></span>
ask you to do him every bad turn you could.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">pis</span><p class="lineGroup">Just tell me who he is. If I don’t do him a bad turn somehow,

<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">pis</span><p class="lineGroup">Tell me all the more who he is. I care little for the favor of
a crook.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">mne</span><p class="lineGroup">I see that I can’t help telling you his name. Pistoclerus,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">560</span><span class="br"></span>
you’ve utterly destroyed me, your friend.</p></div>

<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">mne</span><p class="lineGroup">What is it? Didn’t I send you a letter about my girlfriend
from Ephesus, telling you that you should find her for
me?</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">pis</span><p class="lineGroup">I admit that this has happened and I’ve found her.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">mne</span><p class="lineGroup">Well then? Didn’t you have a whole range of other prostitutes
in Athens who you could have an affair with, without
yourself beginning to make love to the one I had
entrusted to you and without stabbing me in the back?</p></div>
