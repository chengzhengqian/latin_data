<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">chry</span><p class="lineGroup">I honestly don’t think so; but in truth, I don’t know the
truth. In fact, as far as the gold is concerned, all I know is:
“I don’t know.” Now you have to take the ship there yourself<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">325</span><span class="br"></span>
so as to get that gold home from Theotimus. (<span class="italic">after a
brief pause</span>) Oh, one more thing.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">nic</span><p class="lineGroup">What do you want?</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">chry</span><p class="lineGroup">Make sure you remember to bring along your son’s ring.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">nic</span><p class="lineGroup">What’s the ring needed for?</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">chry</span><p class="lineGroup">Because that’s the sign with Theotimus: he is to return
the gold to the man who’ll bring it.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">nic</span><p class="lineGroup">I’ll remember, and it’s a good thing you’re mentioning it.
But is that Theotimus rich?<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">331</span><span class="br"></span>
</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">chry</span><p class="lineGroup">You even ask? He has the soles nailed to his shoes with
gold!</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">nic</span><p class="lineGroup">Why is he so high and mighty?</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">chry</span><p class="lineGroup">He has such great wealth, he doesn’t know what to do
with the gold.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">nic</span><p class="lineGroup">I wish he’d given it to me. But in whose presence was this<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">335</span><span class="br"></span>
gold given to Theotimus?</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">chry</span><p class="lineGroup">In the presence of the whole populace; there’s no one in
Ephesus who doesn’t know.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">nic</span><p class="lineGroup">That at least my son did wisely, giving the gold to a rich
man to guard; from him we’ll be able to collect it even
without giving him notice.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">chry</span><p class="lineGroup">Yes, he’ll never delay you ever so slightly; you’ll have it<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">340</span><span class="br"></span>
the day you get there.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">nic</span><p class="lineGroup">I thought I’d escaped life at sea so that I wouldn’t go on
ship any more at <span class="italic">this</span> age, as an old man. I understand I’m
not allowed a choice, thanks to what my charming friend<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">345</span><span class="br"></span>
Archidemides did. So where’s my son Mnesilochus now?</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">chry</span><p class="lineGroup">He went to the market to greet the gods and his friends.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">nic</span><p class="lineGroup">But I’ll go to him so I can meet him as quickly as possible.</p></div>
