<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">chry</span><p class="lineGroup">Whenever you wish to, read it out. I put my ears under

to read through it. (<span class="italic">begins to read</span>) “Father, please
give two hundred Philippics to Chrysalus, if you want me

me to. I’m already suspected enough when I’m free of
guilt.</p></div>

your life from your crime.</p></div>

don’t desert me if I’ve gone astray in my stupidity. I had a<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1015</span><span class="br"></span>
passionate heart and untameable eyes. I was persuaded
to do a deed which I now feel ashamed of.” Well then,
