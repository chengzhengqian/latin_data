it is also the arrangement adhered to by Lindsay and the
most recent editor of the play, Cesare Questa. Questa does not
actually believe that the traditional order of the fragments reflects
the order in the text as Plautus wrote it, but he prefers to
leave it unchanged because there are too many uncertainties.</span>

<span class="italic">Some uncertainties will always remain, but we can at least
establish a modest amount of order. We know that most Plautine
plays begin in senarii, followed by a sung passage, which in its

passage was three hundred lines long, there is room only for a
single passage in senarii, a single song, and a single passage in
long verses. Thus we can at least arrange the fragments into
three groups, although some fragments are metrically unclear
and the order within the three groups is not without problems
either.</span>
