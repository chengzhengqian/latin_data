secret.</p></div>

<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">bac</span><p class="lineGroup">(<span class="italic">to her sister</span>) I’m handing that old chap over to you,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1150</span><span class="br"></span>
the one further away (<span class="italic">points to Philoxenus</span>), so that you
soften him up beautifully; I will go up to this angry one
(<span class="italic">points to Nicobulus</span>) to see if we can entice them in here.
sis I’ll take care of my task beautifully, although it’s tedious
to embrace a corpse!</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">bac</span><p class="lineGroup">Do do it.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">sis</span><p class="lineGroup">Be quiet. You do your part; I won’t change what I said.</p></div>

<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">phil</span><p class="lineGroup">Anyway, I’ve decided to entrust to you, my friend, what I
want. I’m worthless.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">nic</span><p class="lineGroup">I’ve known that for a long time. But in what way are you
worthless? Tell me that.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">phil</span><p class="lineGroup">I’m completely caught in bird-lime; my heart’s being
pierced with a cattle-prod.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">nic</span><p class="lineGroup">Heavens, it would be much more appropriate if your hip
were. But what is it? Well, I think I myself am already<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1160</span><span class="br"></span>
close to knowing what it is. But I’m keen to hear it from
you.</p></div>
