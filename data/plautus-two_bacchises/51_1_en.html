The parallels are fairly loose. Plautus puts emphasis on the individual image rather than on a coherent narrative; thus he compares himself to Agamemnon as well as to Ulysses. The background to this passage is as follows: Agamemnon and Menelaus, the sons of Atreus, started the Greek (Achaean) expedition against Troy (also called Ilium and Pergamum here, although the latter term strictly refers to the cita- del of Troy). The purpose of this expedition was to get back Helen, the
wife of Menelaus, who had run off with Paris (also called Alexander),
one of the fifty sons of Priam, the king of Troy (naturally, he did not have
all these sons with Hecuba, the queen). Since at first the Greeks were
unsuccessful, Ulysses devised a strategy: he had Epius build a huge
wooden horse filled with Greek soldiers; Sinon, pretending to be a deserter,
entered Troy and claimed that this horse was a gift to the gods;
once the horse was inside the city, the Greeks came out of the horse and
let the remaining Greeks into the city, which was subsequently sacked.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL060_463_41a').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
