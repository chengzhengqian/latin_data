<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">pis</span><p class="lineGroup">What if by any chance a lunch or a drinks party or a dinner
suddenly took place at your establishment, as it normally
happens in those resorts, where would I lie then?<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">81</span><span class="br"></span>
</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">bac</span><p class="lineGroup">With me, my darling, so that a lovely lover is lying with a
lovely lady. However suddenly you might come, here at
our place there’s always a free space. When you want to
have a lovely time, say to me, “my rose, give me some
fun”; I’ll give you a lovely place where you can have some
fun.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">pis</span><p class="lineGroup">(<span class="italic">half aside</span>) This is a rapid stream, it can’t be crossed carelessly<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">85</span><span class="br"></span>
here.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">bac</span><p class="lineGroup">(<span class="italic">aside</span>) And, good god, you’ll have to lose something at
this river. (<span class="italic">to Pistoclerus</span>) Give me your hand and follow
me.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">pis</span><p class="lineGroup">No, not a bit of it.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">bac</span><p class="lineGroup">Why not?</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">pis</span><p class="lineGroup">Because nothing more enticing can happen to a young
man than that: night, a woman, and wine.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">bac</span><p class="lineGroup">Go on now, it’s not important to me, except for your sake.
The soldier will take her away. Don’t help me if you don’t<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">90</span><span class="br"></span>
want to.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">pis</span><p class="lineGroup">(<span class="italic">aside</span>) Aren’t I useless, being unable to control myself?</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">bac</span><p class="lineGroup">What is it that you’re afraid of?</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">pis</span><p class="lineGroup">(<span class="italic">after a pause</span>) It’s nothing, nonsense. Madam, I surrender
myself to you. I’m yours, I’m giving you my attention.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">bac</span><p class="lineGroup">You’re a sweetie. Now I’d like you to do this: I want
to give my sister a welcome dinner today. I’ll have the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">95</span><span class="br"></span>
money brought out to you in a moment. You mind that a
rich meal is bought for us.</p></div>
