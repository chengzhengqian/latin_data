out from my own experience: after I went away to Ephesus
(that was roughly two years ago), I sent a letter from
Ephesus to my friend Pistoclerus here, telling him
he should find my girlfriend Bacchis. I understand he’s<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">391</span><span class="br"></span>
found her: so my slave Chrysalus has told me. Splendid
of Chrysalus, what a trick he played on my father about
the gold, so that I, the lover, would have the supplies.
[But look, I can see him walking along.] To my mind
there’s nothing more worthless than an ungrateful man.
It’s better to let off a malefactor than to leave a benefactor<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">395</span><span class="br"></span>
in the lurch. It’s far better for you to be called prodigal
than ungrateful; the good will praise the first, and even
the bad themselves will find fault with the second. For
that reason I need to be all the more careful and keep my
eyes open. Now, Mnesilochus, the test is being tested,
now the fight is being fought, whether or not you are as
you ought to be, bad or good, whatever way, just or unjust,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">401</span><span class="br"></span>
mean or generous, pleasant or unpleasant. Be careful,
will you, that you don’t let a slave outdo you in doing
good. Whatever you’re like, I remind you, you won’t keep
it secret. (<span class="italic">spotting people in the distance</span>) But look, I can
see the father and the tutor of my friend walk along. I’ll
eavesdrop from here what they’re up to. (<span class="italic">withdraws a
