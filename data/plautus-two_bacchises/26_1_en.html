<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">lyd</span><p class="lineGroup">Mnesilochus; he’s a friend of your son. He has a completely
different nature from that chap who is lying in the
brothel. O happy Nicobulus, who brought up that son for<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">455</span><span class="br"></span>
himself!</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">phil</span><p class="lineGroup">(<span class="italic">approaching Mnesilochus</span>) Hello, Mnesilochus, I’m
glad you’ve arrived safely.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">mne</span><p class="lineGroup">May the gods love you, Philoxenus.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">lyd</span><p class="lineGroup">(<span class="italic">to Philoxenus</span>) Yes, this chap’s been brought up properly
by his father: he goes to sea, looks after the family assets,
guards the home, and follows and obeys his father’s ways
and commands. He was Pistoclerus’ friend already when<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">460</span><span class="br"></span>
the two were boys. The age difference between them,
which one’s older, isn’t even three days, but one has a
maturity that’s more than thirty years above that of the
other.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">phil</span><p class="lineGroup">Watch out for trouble and stop maligning him.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">lyd</span><p class="lineGroup">Be quiet, it’s stupid of you to find it hard to bear that
someone is talked about badly who behaves badly. Well,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">465</span><span class="br"></span>
I’d rather have him give me my punishment than my
money.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">phil</span><p class="lineGroup">How so?</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">lyd</span><p class="lineGroup">Because if he were to give me my punishment, he’d decrease
it each day.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">mne</span><p class="lineGroup">Lydus, what are you scolding my friend for, your pupil?</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">lyd</span><p class="lineGroup">Your friend has died.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">mne</span><p class="lineGroup">May the gods forbid.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">lyd</span><p class="lineGroup">It’s just as I tell you. I even saw him when he was dying,
I’m not blaming him on account of rumors.</p></div>
