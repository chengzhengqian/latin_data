from there, the race court and the sports ground, you’d
sit down on a chair by your teacher, clad in a loincloth;
when you were reading your book, if you got a single syllable
wrong, your skin would become as spotted as a
nurse’s shawl.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL060_411_26" id="target_note_LCL060_411_26">

<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">mne</span><p class="lineGroup">(<span class="italic">aside</span>) Dear me, I’m deeply upset that these things are<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">435</span><span class="br"></span>
now being said against my friend on my account. Though
innocent, he’s being subjected to this suspicion for my

<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">lyd</span><p class="lineGroup">That I know for sure. Yes, in the olden days a man would

“Hey, you worthless old fogey, don’t you touch the boy for<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">445</span><span class="br"></span>

They go away from there after the judgment has been
pronounced. Can a teacher exert authority here under
such conditions, if he himself is the first to get a thrashing?</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">mne</span><p class="lineGroup">(<span class="italic">aside</span>) This is a harsh complaint. Judging from his words,
I’d be surprised if Pistoclerus hadn’t punched Lydus with<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">450</span><span class="br"></span>
his fists.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">lyd</span><p class="lineGroup">(<span class="italic">spotting Mnesilochus</span>) But who’s this I can see standing

the gods favorably disposed to me to seeing him.</p></div>
