Mnesilochus is Alexander, who will be the end for his father’s
wealth. He carried off Helen, for whose sake I’m
now besieging Ilium. Well, I’ve heard that Ulysses there
was bold and bad, just as I am. I was caught in my tricks,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">950</span><span class="br"></span>
while he almost got killed when he was discovered as a
beggar while spying on the Trojans’ plans; I had a very
similar experience today. I was tied up, but I freed myself
with my tricks; in the same way he saved his skin with his
tricks. I’ve heard that Ilium had three fates which would

other three: first, when a while ago I told our old man a lie
about his friend, the gold, and the boat, I took away the
statue from the citadel. Two fates still remained then and
I hadn’t taken the city yet. Next, when I brought the letter<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">960</span><span class="br"></span>
to the old man, I killed Troilus, when a while ago he
believed Mnesilochus was with the soldier’s wife. I barely
escaped on that occasion; and for this danger I find a parallel
