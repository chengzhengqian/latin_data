<span class="italic">have the house cleaned in preparation for Sister’s arrival (fr. i–ii);
in this scene the reason for the identical names is also discussed
(fr. iii–v). Then Pistoclerus arrives but gets a cool reception
from Bacchis (fr. vi). He is the speaker of the prologue (fr.
vii–viii). The soldier’s servant appears with Sister and delivers a
“good slave’s speech” in which he praises himself and speaks of
the punishments in store for bad slaves (fr. ix–x); this is the beginning
of the first song. What follows is a dialogue between this
servant and Sister, who dismisses the soldier and speaks of her
love for Mnesilochus (fr. xi–xiv). Pistoclerus overhears the conversation
and realizes that Sister is the woman he was looking
for (fr. xv). The soldier’s servant recites part of Sister’s contract;
contracts are always in senarii, so the abrupt change of metre
from song to senarii is not problematic. Sister mocks him (fr. xi).
When she meets Bacchis, long verses begin. Sister praises Athens
(fr. xviii) and asks Bacchis for help (fr. xviii). The last two
fragments consist of one word each, which means that their
place in the lost passage is unclear.</span>
