fortified by divine hand, after ten years with their
weapons, horses, army, renowned warriors, and a thousand-
strong fleet of ships. That wasn’t worth a blister on
one’s feet compared with how I shall conquer my master
without a fleet and without an army and such a great
number of soldiers. [I took the gold by storm for master’s<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">931</span><span class="br"></span>
lovesick son from his father.] Now before the old man
comes here, I wish to lament until he comes out. O Troy,
o father-land, o Pergamum, o aged Priam, you have perished;
you’ll be balefully and badly beaten and punished
with the loss of four hundred gold Philippics: these tablets,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">935</span><span class="br"></span>
which I’m carrying signed and sealed, aren’t tablets,
but the wooden horse which the Achaeans sent. The
letters which are written here are the well-armed and
courageous soldiers in this horse. So far my plan’s been
successful. And this horse will attack not a stronghold,
but a strongbox. This horse will turn into the death,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">944</span><span class="br"></span>
destruction, dislodgement of the old man’s gold today.
Pistoclerus is Epius: the tablets were taken from him.
Mnesilochus is Sinon the abandoned, he isn’t lying on the
tomb of Achilles, but on a couch.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL060_465_42" id="target_note_LCL060_465_42">

</a> He has a Bacchis with
him. That one of old once had a fire to give a sign, but this
one burns himself. I am Ulysses, according to whose plan
they’re doing this. This stupid old man of ours, I’ll definitely<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">945</span><span class="br"></span>
give him the name Ilium. The soldier is Menelaus,
I am Agamemnon, but also Ulysses, son of Laertes.
