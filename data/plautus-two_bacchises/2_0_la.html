<p>Athenis</p>
<p class="noindent">The stage represents a street in Athens. There are two houses
on it, with an altar of Apollo in between: the house on the left
belongs to Bacchis; the one on the right belongs to Mnesilochus
and his father. The street leads to the harbor on the left and to
the city center on the right. The house of Pistoclerus and his father
is not on stage but presumably lies on the way to the forum.</p>
