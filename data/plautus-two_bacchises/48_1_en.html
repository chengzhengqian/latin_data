<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">chry</span><p class="lineGroup">What now? Does Chrysalus seem to be the criminal to
you? Go on now, bind me, listen to your son. Didn’t I tell<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">855</span><span class="br"></span>
you you’d find out about his character?</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">nic</span><p class="lineGroup">What am I to do now?</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">chry</span><p class="lineGroup">Have me unbound quickly, if you will; unless I’m unbound,
he’ll surprise him in flagrante in a moment.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">cleo</span><p class="lineGroup">(<span class="italic">still not noticing anyone</span>) There isn’t any profit I’d prefer
making today to surprising him lying with her, so that I
can kill both.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">chry</span><p class="lineGroup">Can you hear what he’s saying? Why don’t you have me<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">861</span><span class="br"></span>
unbound?</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">nic</span><p class="lineGroup">(<span class="italic">to slaves</span>) Unbind him. (<span class="italic">to Chrysalus</span>) I’m done for, I got
such a shock, poor me.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">cleo</span><p class="lineGroup">(<span class="italic">gradually coming closer</span>) Then I’ll make sure that that
woman who prostitutes her body to all and sundry won’t
say that she’s found someone to laugh at.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">chry</span><p class="lineGroup">(<span class="italic">to Nicobulus</span>) You can settle the issue with him for a<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">865</span><span class="br"></span>
small sum.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">nic</span><p class="lineGroup">Settle the issue, then, please, on any terms you like, so
long as he doesn’t surprise the chap in flagrante and kill
him.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">cleo</span><p class="lineGroup">(<span class="italic">still to himself</span>) Now unless I’m given back two hundred
Philippics, I’ll swallow up their lives this instant.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">nic</span><p class="lineGroup">(<span class="italic">to Chrysalus</span>) Well, settle it for that sum if possible. Go<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">870</span><span class="br"></span>
on, please, settle it for any price you wish.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">chry</span><p class="lineGroup">(<span class="italic">to Nicobulus</span>) I’ll go and do my best. (<span class="italic">going up to Cleomachus,
who is still at a distance</span>) What are you shouting
for?</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">cleo</span><p class="lineGroup">Where’s your master?</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">chry</span><p class="lineGroup">Nowhere. I don’t know. Do you want to be promised
two hundred Philippics now on condition that you won’t
shout around or pick an argument?</p></div>
