our old man, find me until I have seen Pistoclerus,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">175</span><span class="br"></span>
Mnesilochus’ friend, to whom Mnesilochus sent a letter
about his girlfriend Bacchis.</p></div>
<span class="stage">
<span class="italic">Enter PISTOCLERUS from Bacchis’ house.</span>
</span>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">pis</span><p class="lineGroup">(<span class="italic">calling back into the house</span>) It’s strange that you ask me
so earnestly to come back; I couldn’t go away from here<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">180</span><span class="br"></span>
in any way even if I wanted to. You hold me fast, bonded
and bound by love.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">chry</span><p class="lineGroup">(<span class="italic">aside</span>) Immortal gods, I can see Pistoclerus. (<span class="italic">loudly</span>)
Hello, Pistoclerus.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">pis</span><p class="lineGroup">Hello, Chrysalus.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">chry</span><p class="lineGroup">I’ll save you a lot of words now. You’re happy I’ve returned.<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">185</span><span class="br"></span>
I believe you. You’re promising me hospitality
and a dinner, as is appropriate for someone arriving from
abroad. And I nod in approval that I’ll come. As a message
I give you hearty greetings from your friend. You’ll
ask me where he is. He’s alive.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">pis</span><p class="lineGroup">And kicking, too?</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">chry</span><p class="lineGroup">I wanted to ask <span class="italic">you</span> about that.<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">190</span><span class="br"></span>
</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">pis</span><p class="lineGroup">How can <span class="italic">I</span> know?</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">chry</span><p class="lineGroup">No one can know better.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">pis</span><p class="lineGroup">How so?</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">chry</span><p class="lineGroup">Because if the girl he loves has been found, he’s alive and
kicking; if she hasn’t been found, he’s unwell and close to
death. To a lover his girlfriend is his life. If she’s away, he’s
lost. If she’s around, his money’s lost and he himself is . . . <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">195</span><span class="br"></span>
useless and miserable. But what have you done about his
instructions?</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">pis</span><p class="lineGroup">Would I not have sorted out for him on his arrival what
his message mentioned? I’d rather inhabit the nether regions.</p></div>
