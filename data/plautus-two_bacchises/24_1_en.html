<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">phil</span><p class="lineGroup">Easy, easy, Lydus! Those who restrain their anger are
wiser. It’s less of a surprise if a man of that age does some
of those things than if he doesn’t. I too did this in my
youth.</p></div>

him: if it weren’t for you, I would have turned
him into a decent man. Now because of you and your
