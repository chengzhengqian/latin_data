<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">lyd</span><p class="lineGroup">Now you’ve wasted yourself and me and my efforts; I often
showed you the right way, but in vain.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">pis</span><p class="lineGroup">I’ve wasted my own efforts in the same place where
you’ve wasted yours. Your instruction helps neither me
nor you.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">lyd</span><p class="lineGroup">O what an obstinate breast!</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">pis</span><p class="lineGroup">You’re getting on my nerves. Shut up and follow me,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">135</span><span class="br"></span>
Lydus.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">lyd</span><p class="lineGroup">Just look at that! He isn’t calling me “tutor” any longer,
but “Lydus.”</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">pis</span><p class="lineGroup">When the one who bought this is inside and lying with his<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">139</span><span class="br"></span>
girlfriend, and when he’s kissing her and other guests are
lying beside them, it wouldn’t be appropriate or acceptable
for a “tutor” to be there in their presence.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">lyd</span><p class="lineGroup">Please, was this food bought for these purposes?</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">pis</span><p class="lineGroup">I do hope so; but the outcome is in the gods’ hands.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">lyd</span><p class="lineGroup">You will have a girlfriend?<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">145</span><span class="br"></span>
</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">pis</span><p class="lineGroup">When you see her then you’ll know.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">lyd</span><p class="lineGroup">(<span class="italic">grabs him</span>) No, you won’t have one and I won’t allow it.
Go straight home!</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">pis</span><p class="lineGroup">Drop it, Lydus, and watch out for trouble.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">lyd</span><p class="lineGroup">(<span class="italic">obeying reluctantly</span>) What? “Watch out for trouble?”</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">pis</span><p class="lineGroup">I’m too old now for having you as my tutor.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">lyd</span><p class="lineGroup">O pit, where art thou now? How willingly would I use
thee! I’m already seeing far more than I ever wanted to.<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">150</span><span class="br"></span>
Now it would be far better to have lived than to go on living.
Is it possible that any pupil is threatening his tutor? I
don’t care for having such full-blooded pupils: a strong
one is bullying me, a man devoid of strength.</p></div>
