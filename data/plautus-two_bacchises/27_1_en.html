<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">lyd</span><p class="lineGroup">Here. (<span class="italic">points to Bacchis’ house</span>)</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">mne</span><p class="lineGroup">Where do people say she’s from?</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">lyd</span><p class="lineGroup">From Samos.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">mne</span><p class="lineGroup">What’s she called?</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">lyd</span><p class="lineGroup">Bacchis.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">mne</span><p class="lineGroup">You’re mistaken, Lydus: I know how the whole story
goes. You’re accusing Pistoclerus wrongly—he’s innocent.
Yes, he’s eagerly carrying out a charge for a close<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">475</span><span class="br"></span>
friend of his, his chum. He himself is not in love and you
shouldn’t believe that he is.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">lyd</span><p class="lineGroup">Should he eagerly fulfill his friend’s charge in such a way
that he himself is sitting there and holding the woman in
his lap while she is kissing him? Can’t a charge be fulfilled
in any other way than by moving his hands to her breasts
again and again and on no occasion removing his lips
from hers? Indeed, I’m ashamed of telling you the other<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">481</span><span class="br"></span>
things I saw him doing: when he put his hand under
Bacchis’ clothes onto her body, in my presence, and without
feeling any shame. What need is there for words? My
pupil, your friend, and this man’s son has died. Yes, I say<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">485</span><span class="br"></span>
that he has died whose sense of shame has died. What
need is there for words? If I’d wanted to wait for just a bit
more, I think I’d have had a greater opportunity to watch
him, and I’d have seen more than would have been right,
more than would have been appropriate for me and him.</p></div>
