<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">chry</span><p class="lineGroup">I said exactly all the same words to him a while ago.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">nic</span><p class="lineGroup">“I beg you to consider it enough, father, that Chrysalus
has scolded me with a great deal of harsh words and<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1021</span><span class="br"></span>
made me a better man through his admonitions, so that
you ought to be grateful to him.”</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">chry</span><p class="lineGroup">Is that written there?</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">nic</span><p class="lineGroup">(<span class="italic">showing him the letter</span>) There, look, then you’ll know.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">chry</span><p class="lineGroup">How the delinquent is willing to fawn on everyone!</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">nic</span><p class="lineGroup">“Now if it’s right for me to ask you for a favor, father, give<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1025</span><span class="br"></span>
me two hundred Philippics, I beg you.”</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">chry</span><p class="lineGroup">No, not even a single one if you’re in your right mind.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">nic</span><p class="lineGroup">Let me read through it. “I’ve given a solemn oath that I
would give this to the woman today before the evening,
before she leaves me. Now, father, take care that I’m not<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1030</span><span class="br"></span>
perjuring myself and drag me away as quickly as possible
from here from this woman because of whom I’ve incurred
such great loss and disgrace. Don’t agonize over
the two hundred Philippics; I’ll give it back to you a thousand
times over if I live. Farewell and do take care of<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1035</span><span class="br"></span>
this.” What do you think now, Chrysalus?</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">chry</span><p class="lineGroup">I won’t give you any advice at all today and I won’t take
the risk that if anything goes wrong you might say you
acted according to my verdict. But, the way I see it, if I
were in your place I’d give him the gold rather than let<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1040</span><span class="br"></span>
him be ruined. There are two options; see which one you
choose: either you lose the gold or the lover becomes a
perjurer. I don’t command, forbid, or advise you at all.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">nic</span><p class="lineGroup">I’m feeling sorry for him.</p></div>
