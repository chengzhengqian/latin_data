with this matter better at our place. And until he comes

<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">bac</span><p class="lineGroup">How so?</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">pis</span><p class="lineGroup">Because I understand you two are trying to catch one
pigeon.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL060_373_3" id="target_note_LCL060_373_3">

</a> is hitting my
wings. (<span class="italic">to Bacchis</span>) Madam, I don’t think that that kind of
behavior is good for me.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">bac</span><p class="lineGroup">How so, please?</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">pis</span><p class="lineGroup">Because, Bacchis, I’m afraid of Bacchants and your
shrine of Bacchus.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">bac</span><p class="lineGroup">What’s that? What are you afraid of? That my bed could
persuade you to do something naughty at my place?</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">pis</span><p class="lineGroup">I’m more afraid of your bidding than your bed. You’re a<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">55</span><span class="br"></span>
bad beast: woman, a shady place is no good for someone
of my age.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">bac</span><p class="lineGroup">If you wanted to do anything stupid at my place, I myself
would prevent you from doing it. But when the soldier
comes, I’d like you to be with me for the simple reason
that when you’re there, no one will wrong her (<span class="italic">points to
her sister</span>) or me. Your presence will prevent it, and at the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">60</span><span class="br"></span>
same time you’ll support your friend. And when the soldier
comes here he’ll suspect I’m your girlfriend. Please,
why have you fallen silent?</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">pis</span><p class="lineGroup">Because these things are pleasant to talk about; the very
same things are thorny in practice, when you try them
out: they hurt your heart, torture your possessions, and
wound character and reputation.</p></div>
