I am not yet arguing about my client’s case, I am not yet speaking of our right to possession; what I am objecting to now is your defence, Gaius Piso.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL198_131_a" id="target_note_LCL198_131_a"><sup>a</sup></a> For your speech and your<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">35</span><span class="br"></span> conclusion amount to this: that, if Caecina had been ejected from the farm when actually on it, in that case he would have had the right to restitution by means of this injunction; but, as it is, he was in no sense “ejected” from a place in which he was not; and that we have gained nothing by this injunction: I ask you, then, what would you proceed to do if, on your return home to-day, you were prevented by men collected together and armed from entering not merely the doorway and the actual interior of your house but even the forecourt by which it is approached? My friend Lucius Calpurnius advises you to give the same answer as he once gave: “an action for assault.” But what has that to do with possession or with restitution of the man who ought to be restored or, indeed, with either the civil code or the praetor’s notice and cognizance?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL198_131_b" id="target_note_LCL198_131_b"><sup>b</sup></a> Suppose you bring your action for assault: nay, I will grant you more than that, suppose you not only bring your action but win it, you will not be any nearer, will you, to possession? For an action for assault does not seek to establish a right to possession: it merely consoles a man for interference with his liberty by trying and punishing his assailant.</p>
