of them have been kept safely in the house, and that you alone have been debarred and frightened away from your house by force of arms, will you be entitled to employ either the same procedure which we are now employing, or a different one or none at all? To say that no procedure is available in so signal and scandalous a case is consistent neither with your common sense nor with your position: if there be some other which I may have failed to notice, pray inform me what it is: I am anxious to learn. But if<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">38</span><span class="br"></span> it be this same procedure which we have employed, your own judgement gives us the verdict. For I have no fear of your saying that in identical cases the same injunction should restore you but not Caecina. Who indeed can fail to see that all men’s goods, fortunes and tenures are reduced to insecurity if this injunction be in any respect lessened in scope or weakened in power; if the violence of armed men appear, on the authority of men like yourselves, to be sanctioned by a court of law, a court in which, as will be said, the question of arms was not disputed, discussion being confined to a question of words? Shall your verdict be given to the man who defends himself by saying, “I drove you back by armed men, I did not drive you out,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL198_135_a" id="target_note_LCL198_135_a"><sup>a</sup></a> giving the impression that so infamous a deed owed its immunity not to the equity of the defence but to a single letter<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL198_135_b" id="target_note_LCL198_135_b"><sup>b</sup></a> in the law? Shall your decision be<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">39</span><span class="br"></span> that there is no legal process to meet this case, no right prescribed for raising the issue at law, when a man has been debarred by means of armed men, by the collecting together of a multitude, from effecting not merely an entry but even an approach?</p>
