Now examine this point further. If anyone drives<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">87</span><span class="br"></span> my household from my estate, he drives me out of it; if anyone meets me with armed men outside my estate and prevents my entering it, he does not drive me out of it but away from it.

For this is plain: “whence you have driven out” means either “out of any place” or “away from any place.” “Thither thou shalt restore”: this too is clear—you must restore to the
