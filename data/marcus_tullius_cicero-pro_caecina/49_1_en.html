Does it make any difference whether or not our injunction contains the additional clause “Aulus Caecina being in possession”? Do the principles of law, the point of difference between the injunctions, the intention of our forefathers, make any impression on you? Had the clause been added, your point would have been a relevant one. It was not added: shall the point be relevant still?</p>
<p>In this particular, I am not defending Caecina:<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">94</span><span class="br"></span> for Caecina, gentlemen, has possession; but although it is outside my case I will briefly deal with the question in order to make you no less anxious to protect the person of my client than you are to protect the rights of the public. You, Aebutius, do not deny that Caesennia had possession by virtue of her life interest.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL198_193_a" id="target_note_LCL198_193_a"><sup>a</sup></a> Now since the tenant who had the farm on lease from Caesennia maintained his tenure by virtue of that same lease, is there any doubt that, if Caesennia had possession during the tenure of the lessee, her heir after her death had the same title to possession?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL198_193_a" id="target_note_LCL198_193_a"><sup>a</sup></a> Further, when Caecina came to this estate as he was going the round of his property, he received a statement of account from this tenant; and there is evidence to prove it. Why, subsequently,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">95</span><span class="br"></span> did you, Aebutius, serve Caecinawith notice toquitthis particular farm rather than any other you may have, if Caecina had no possession? Why, moreover, did Caecina himself consent to being formally ejected, as he had informed you in the answer which he gave on the advice of his friends and of Aquillius himself?</p>
