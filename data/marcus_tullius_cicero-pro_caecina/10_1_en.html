Caecina</h1></hgroup></header><section class="div2"><p class="noindent">had not full rights like other citizens by reason of the disability and the civil degradation to which the Volaterrans were subject. And so I suppose, like a timid and inexperienced man, lacking both in courage and resource, my client did not think it worth while, for the sake of the inheritance, to have any doubts cast on his rights as a citizen, and gave way to Aebutius, letting him keep whatever of Caesennia’s estate he wanted! No indeed! He acted like a brave and wise man, and crushed this foolish and dishonest claim. Now as he was in possession of the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">19</span><span class="br"></span> property, and Aebutius was making out his seventy-second share to be greater than it was, he asked, in his capacity as an heir, for an arbiter to divide the inheritance. In the course of the next few days, realizing that nothing could be squeezed out of Caecina by the threat of a lawsuit, Aebutius formally notified him in the Forum at Rome that the estate of which I have already spoken and which I showed that the defendant purchased on the instructions of Caesennia, was his own, bought by him for himself. What? Is Aebutius the owner of the estate of which Caesennia was indisputably in possession for four years, that is, from the day it was sold until she died? His answer is: “Yes; for she had been left a life interest in it under her husband’s will.”</p>
<p>While Aebutius with such evil intent was planning<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">20</span><span class="br"></span> this singular kind of lawsuit, Caecina decided on the advice of his friends to fix a day on which he should repair to the actual place and be formally ejected from the estate. A conference was held and a day chosen to suit both parties. Caecina came with his friends on the appointed day to the castle of Axia, from which the disputed estate was not far distant.
