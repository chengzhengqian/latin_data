As for<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">29</span><span class="br"></span> him, what am I to say against him save what he cannot deny—that he attended the session of a public tribunal although not one of the jurors at that session;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL198_125_b" id="target_note_LCL198_125_b"><sup>b</sup></a> and that, in the course of it, although he had not heard the case, and an adjournment was possible, he voted “guilty”; that, since he decided to pronounce judgement on the case without having heard it, he preferred voting “guilty” to voting “not guilty”; and that, since the accused could not have been convicted had there been one vote less given against him, his purpose there was not to investigate the case but to ensure a conviction?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL198_125_b" id="target_note_LCL198_125_b"><sup>b</sup></a> Can anything worse be said against anyone than that he took a bribe to condemn a man whom he had never seen or heard?
