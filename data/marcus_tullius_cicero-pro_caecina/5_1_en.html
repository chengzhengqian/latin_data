<p>And if any judge or assessor<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL198_105_a" id="target_note_LCL198_105_a"><sup>a</sup></a> were to say to me: “But you might have brought your action by a less stringent process: you might have secured your rights by an easier and more convenient form of trial; so either adopt a different process or do not press me to pronounce judgement,” he would none the less seem either more nervous than a resolute judge ought to be or more presumptuous than a wise one; for either he is lacking in the courage to try the case himself or he is seeking to prescribe the method which I am to employ in pursuing my rights.
