When, as I had begun to say, it<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">15</span><span class="br"></span> was settled to hold the auction at Rome, Caesennia’s friends and relations began to persuade her (and the same idea was occurring to her independently) that as she had the chance to buy the estate which had belonged to M. Fulcinius and which adjoined her own original farm, there was no reason to let such an opportunity slip, especially as money was owing to her from the division of the property, which could not be better invested. This therefore she decided to do: she gave a commission to buy the farm to—whom indeed? Whom do you think? Does it not occur to every one of you that this was essentially the business of the man who was ready to undertake all the lady’s business, without whom no adequate foresight or shrewdness was possible? You are right. The business was entrusted to Aebutius.</p>
