Why, the familiar speech of every<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">52</span><span class="br"></span> day will not have a consistent meaning if we set verbal traps for one another. Even our authority at home will cease to exist if we allow our slave-boys to obey our orders to the letter only, without paying any attention to the meaning implied in our words. And now I suppose I must produce examples of all these points; as though indeed every one of you cannot think of some example, whether in one connexion or another, to support my plea that Right does not depend on words, but that words are subservient to the purpose and the intentions of men. This opinion was supported by the great orator,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">53</span><span class="br"></span> Lucius Crassus, in an elegant and ample speech before the centumviral court<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL198_149_a" id="target_note_LCL198_149_a"><sup>a</sup></a> shortly before I was called to the bar;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL198_149_b" id="target_note_LCL198_149_b"><sup>b</sup></a> and although the learned Quintus Mucius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL198_149_c" id="target_note_LCL198_149_c"><sup>c</sup></a> was against him he proved to everyone, and with ease, that Manius Curius, who was to succeed to an estate “in the event of the death of a posthumous son,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL198_149_d" id="target_note_LCL198_149_d"><sup>d</sup></a> was entitled to succeed although the son was not dead—never, in fact, having been born! Well, did the wording of the will provide adequately for this situation? Far from it. Then what was the deciding consideration? Intention; for if our intention could be made clear without our speaking, we should not use words at all; but because it cannot, words have been invented, not to conceal but to reveal intention.</p>
