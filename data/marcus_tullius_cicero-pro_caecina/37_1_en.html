In a question of law, gentlemen, there is nothing like that—no forged document, no dishonest witness; and even undue influence, which is all-powerful in public life, is here, and only here, inoperative; for it has no chance of getting to work, no opportunity to tamper with a juror, no means even of raising a finger. For a man of more presumption<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">72</span><span class="br"></span> than decency may say to a juror, “Give judgement that this took place or never took place: credit this witness, admit these documents “; but he cannot say, “Decide that a will is not invalidated by the subsequent birth of a son to the testator: give judgement that a promise is binding when made by a woman without the sanction of her trustee.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL198_169_a" id="target_note_LCL198_169_a"><sup>a</sup></a> No man’s power, or influence either, can affect the decision in such a matter; and further—to show how exalted and inviolable the law is—not even money can corrupt a juror in such a connexion. That very<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">73</span><span class="br"></span> witness of yours<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL198_169_b" id="target_note_LCL198_169_b"><sup>b</sup></a> who dared to pronounce a man guilty when he could not possibly have known even the charge against him, even he would never dare to give judgement that, if a woman settles her dowry on her husband without proper sanction,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL198_169_a" id="target_note_LCL198_169_a"><sup>a</sup></a> the settlement is binding.</p>
