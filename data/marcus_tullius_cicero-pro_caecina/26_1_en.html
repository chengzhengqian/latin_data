Well, can anyone be “thrust out” without being touched? Surely if we mean to go by the words, we must understand that, for a man to be thrust out, hands must be laid on him. I repeat, it is impossible, if we wish to give the word its fair value, to hold that anyone has been thrust out, unless it be clear that he had been dislodged and driven headlong by personal application of force. And how can anyone be literally “ejected<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL198_147_a" id="target_note_LCL198_147_a"><sup>a</sup></a>” unless<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">50</span><span class="br"></span> he has been removed from higher to lower ground? He may be expelled, put to flight or evicted; but “ejected” he cannot be if he is not touched, or even if the ground is flat and level. What then? Do we imagine that this injunction was framed for the benefit of those who claimed to have been thrown headlong down from a height (for they it is who can rightly be styled “ejected”) or shall we rather, since the intention, design and meaning of the injunction is clear to us, reckon it a piece of consummate impudence and of unparalleled stupidity to be concerned over a verbal error while abandoning, nay betraying, the facts of the case and the interests of the public?</p>
