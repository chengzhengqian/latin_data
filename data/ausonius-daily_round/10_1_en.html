Why steal you in at my doors and haunt the darkling couch in my confined dwelling? Leave me to pass night unexcited in calm repose till golden Lucifer comes back for me in the rosy east. But if soft sleep shall soothe me with his gentle breath, nor any shapes trouble my rest by night, this grove—the elm which spreads its green leaves on my estate—I dedicate for you to dwell in on your night watches.</p>
