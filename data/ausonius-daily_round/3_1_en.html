<p><span class="sc">Almighty</span> One, whom through the worship of my heart alone I know, to the wicked unknown, yet known to every devout soul, thou art without beginning and without end, more ancient than time past and time to come: thy fashion and extent no mind can ever grasp, nor tongue express. He only may behold thee and, face to face, hear thy bidding and sit at thy fatherly right-hand who is himself the Maker of all things, himself the Cause of all created things, himself the Word of God, the Word which is God, who was before the world which he was to make, begotten at that time when Time was not yet, who came into being before the Sun’s beams and the bright Morning-Star enlightened the sky. Without him was nothing made, and through him were all things made: his throne is in Heaven; and beneath his seat lie Earth and the Sea and the invincible Chaos of darkling Night: unresting, he is the very mover of all things, the quickener of the lifeless. He is God, the begotten of the unbegotten, who being provoked by the guile of his scornful people, called the nations into his kingdom—the worthier offshoots of an ingrafted stock to worship him. To our forefathers it was granted to behold him; and whoso discerned his Godhead, to him it was given to have seen the Father also. He bare our sinful stains and suffered a death with mockery, thus teaching us that there is a road to lead back to eternal life, and that the soul returns not alone, but with the body complete enters the realms of Heaven and leaves the secret chamber of the grave empty, covered with earth which cannot hold it.</p>
