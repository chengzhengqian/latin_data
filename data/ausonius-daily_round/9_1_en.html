Then, too, in dreams we undergo amours unspeakable, and night’s foul shames, and unions which are the themes of tragedy. Yet there is escape from these whenever shame bursts through the bonds of sleep, scattering the horrors of our dreams, and the mind freed from filthy fancying keeps watch. Then the hands untainted feel about the bed nor find cause for remorse: the sinful guilt of luxury departs, and as the dream fades from us, so its stain. Now, I see myself applauding, one of a triumphant throng: again I am dragged through the streets a disarmed Alan prisoner of war. And now I gaze upon the temples of the gods, their sacred portals and golden palaces; or seem to recline at a feast upon a couch of Sarran (Tyrian) purple, and presently sit feasting at the table of some steamy eating-house.</p>

But if dreams of doubtful import leave us the choice, better that cheerful sights deceive us than we should fear with a cause. Look you, I would even rather be deceived; for, if only gloomy dreams always prove void, it is better to have missed what might have been enjoyed than to tremble at ill-fortune. ’Tis well enough if only fear be far from us. Some there are also who argue their woe and weal by contraries, and who forecast results by opposite interpretation.</p>
