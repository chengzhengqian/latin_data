<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">servant</span></span> (<span class="italic">calling to Diniarchus</span>) I can see you, you who are
shielding the wall because of your misdeeds.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">din</span></span> (<span class="italic">aside</span>) I’m neither alive nor dead, and I don’t
know what
I should do now; I don’t
know how to get away from here
or how to approach him. I’m paralyzed with fear.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">cal</span></span> (<span class="italic">to his servant girl</span>) Are you telling me or not?<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">825</span><span class="br"></span></p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">servant</span></span> Diniarchus, to whom you’d once betrothed her.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">cal</span></span> Where is the man you name?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">din</span></span> (<span class="italic">coming forward</span>) Here I am, Callicles. I implore you by
your knees to accept my unwise deed wisely and to forgive
me for what I did bereft of reason, through the fault
of wine.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">cal</span></span> I don’t
like that; you’re laying the blame on someone
dumb who can’t speak: if the wine could speak, it would<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">830</span><span class="br"></span>
defend itself. Wine is not in the habit of controlling men,
but men are in the habit of controlling wine, at least
those who are decent. But an indecent man, whether he
drinks a little or whether he abstains from alcohol, is
nonetheless indecent in his nature.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">din</span></span> I know that because of my offense I’ll have to listen to a
lot of things I don’t
want to hear. I admit that I’m guilty<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">835</span><span class="br"></span>
and at your mercy.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">servant</span></span> Callicles, please watch out that you don’t
commit a
great injustice: the defendant is pleading his cause unbound,
but the witnesses you keep bound.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">cal</span></span> (<span class="italic">to his slaves</span>) Release them. (<span class="italic">to the women</span>)
Come on,
go away, you to your home and you to yours. (<span class="italic">to Syra</span>)
You, tell your mistress: she is to return the boy if anyone
demands him.</p></div>
<span class="stage"><span class="italic">Exeunt the servant girl of <span class="sc">callicles</span> and <span class="sc">syra</span> to the
right.</span></span>
