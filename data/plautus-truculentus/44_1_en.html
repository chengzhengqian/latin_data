<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">din</span></span> Let them learn it, so long as I may practice it so as not
to forget.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">ast</span></span> What will become of your teacher in the meantime,
while you practice? She wants to practice in the same
way.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">din</span></span> Practice what?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">ast</span></span> Receiving tuition fees again and again.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">din</span></span> I for one have given her mine today: I had five silver
minas brought to her, and in addition one for provisions.<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">740</span><span class="br"></span></p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">ast</span></span> I know that this was brought there. They’re now having
a good time from it thanks to you.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">din</span></span> Ah! Should my enemies slaughter my goods in there? I’d
rather be dead than bear this.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">ast</span></span> You’re being stupid.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">din</span></span> How so? Explain. Well then, Astaphium?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">ast</span></span> Because I’d prefer my enemies envying me to me envying
my enemies: it’s wretchedness to envy another having<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">745</span><span class="br"></span>
a good time, having a bad time yourself. Those who
envy are in need; those who are envied have money.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">din</span></span> May I not have my share of the provisions I gave as a
gift?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">ast</span></span> If you wanted to have your share, you should have taken
half home: just as in the Underworld, here at our place
an account is kept of goods received. One receives deposits<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">750</span><span class="br"></span>
inside; once received, there are no withdrawals.
Goodbye.</p></div>
