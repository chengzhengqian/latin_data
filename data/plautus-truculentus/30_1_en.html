<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">ast</span></span> Do you ask? As soon as he was born, he demanded sword

army? Has he brought back any spoils?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">ast</span></span> Nonsense! He was born only four days ago.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">strat</span></span> So what? Within so many days he ought to have performed<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">510</span><span class="br"></span>
some deed already. Why did he leave the womb
before he could go into battle?</p></div>
