through well and being blessed with a child, and on having
given birth to a great distinction for myself and
you.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">phro</span></span> And my greetings to you, who have almost deprived me
of life and light, and who, for the sake of your own pleasure,
have put an enormous amount of great pain into<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">520</span><span class="br"></span>
my body, an illness because of which I’m wretched even
now.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">strat</span></span> Goodness! That labor hasn’t
fallen onto you to your
disadvantage, my darling: you’ve given birth to a son
who’ll fill your house with spoils.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">phro</span></span> I have a much greater need for wheat-filled
granaries so
that starvation won’t wipe us out here before he can get
any spoils.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">strat</span></span> Have no fear.<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">525</span><span class="br"></span></p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">phro</span></span> Take a kiss from me, please. Ah! I can’t lift up my head,
that’s how much pain I’m in and how difficult
it is to
move, and I still can’t walk on my feet alone.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">strat</span></span> (<span class="italic">bowing down to her couch and kissing her</span>) If you told
me to come and get a kiss from you from the middle of
the sea, I’d gladly get it, my honey. You know by experience
that this is the case; now, my dear Phronesium,
you’ll learn by experience that I love you. Look, I’ve<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">530</span><span class="br"></span>
brought you two slave girls from Syria; I present you with
them. (<span class="italic">to his servant</span>) You, bring them here. (to <span class="italic">Phronesium</span>)
Mind you, they were both queens in their home,
but I destroyed their country with my hand. I present
you with them.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">phro</span></span> Aren’t you satisfied
with the amount of slave girls I have
to feed, without bringing me girls in addition to eat up
my food?</p></div>
