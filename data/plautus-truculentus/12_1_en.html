outsider: she doesn’t

<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">din</span></span> Your tongues and talks are soaked in honey, but your

That’s why you give us sweet words with your tongues,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">180</span><span class="br"></span>
but do bitter things with your hearts.</p></div>

<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">ast</span></span> It wasn’t
appropriate for you to say that, my generous
friend, but for those niggards who wage war against their
own well-being.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">din</span></span> You’re sly and the same temptress as usual.</p></div>

she is at home.</p></div>

<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">ast</span></span> Yes, and I hope she’ll be even better now when she sees

when we’re in<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">190</span><span class="br"></span>

when they’re lying openly, we dimwits believe them to
be true, let alone that we should have righteous
anger.</p></div>
