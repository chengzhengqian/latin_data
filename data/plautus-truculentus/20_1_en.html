think that<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">315</span><span class="br"></span>
he could be so fierce. Yet he seemed well-disposed
toward
his master. But even though he’s savage, I hope
he can be changed with flattering, enticements, and the
other arts of prostitutes. I’ve seen a horse and other
animals turning from untamed to tame. Now I’ll check<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">320</span><span class="br"></span>
on my mistress again. (<span class="italic">turns toward Phronesium’s house</span>)
But look, my nuisance is appearing. He’s coming out,
looking glum. He still hasn’t
met Phronesium.</p></div>

<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">din</span></span> I believe that fish, which bathe as long as they live,
don’t
bathe for as long as Phronesium here is bathing. If
women

because of my exhaustion I too need to bathe. But please,
Astaphium, go in and announce that I’m here; advise her<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">330</span><span class="br"></span>
that she should hurry up and that she’s bathed enough
now.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">ast</span></span> All right. (<span class="italic">turns to go</span>)</p></div>

I just
say “go” to you?</p></div>
