speak about myself first, taught by my own experience.
What great worry is on my mind, what great pain do I<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">455</span><span class="br"></span>
feel in my heart, for fear that . . . my trick might come to
nothing through the boy’s death. I’m all the keener on
his survival because I’ve been called his mother; I, who
have dared to do this trick, am now taking on an equally
great one. Greedy as I am, I’ve carried out an offense for
the sake of profit,
I’ve taken on another’s pangs as my<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">460</span><span class="br"></span>
own. But you shouldn’t
approach any business guilefully
unless you also execute it cleverly
and meticulously. You
can see yourselves now in what outfit I’m walking: I’m
pretending to be unwell from giving birth now. Unless a<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">465</span><span class="br"></span>
woman completes carrying out the bad deed that she’s
begun, it’s an illness for her, it’s an affliction
for her, it’s
wretchedness for the wretched woman. If she’s begun to
do a good deed, aversion to it seizes her all too quickly.
Very few women
who have begun to do a bad deed have
grown tired of it, and very few women
succeed if they’ve
begun to do a good deed. For a woman doing a bad deed<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">470</span><span class="br"></span>
is a far lighter burden than doing a good one. As for the
fact that I’m bad, I’m bad through my mother’s training
and my own badness, since I pretended to the soldier
from Babylon that I was pregnant. Now I want the soldier
to find this wickedness performed painstakingly.</p></div>
