<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">phro</span></span> (<span class="italic">to Stratophanes</span>) If you were behaving appropriately,
you wouldn’t
criticize those of my visitors whose gifts I
regard as accepted and welcome; the gifts I received
from you I regard as unwelcome.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">strat</span></span> Then I’ve been deprived of gifts and I’m utterly ruined.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">phro</span></span> That’s obvious.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">cya</span></span> (<span class="italic">to Stratophanes</span>) Then why are you sitting around here
now, you tedious creature, when your position has been
ruined?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">strat</span></span> (<span class="italic">to Phronesium</span>) I really am ruined today unless I drive<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">620</span><span class="br"></span>
this man away from you!</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">cya</span></span> Just step over here, just come here.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">strat</span></span> Are you even threatening me, you rascal? I’ll chop you
up this instant! Why are you coming here? Why are you
approaching her? Why, I insist, do you know this girlfriend
of mine? You’ll die quickly unless you win fighting!</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">cya</span></span> What? I should win fighting?

<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">strat</span></span> Do what I’ve told you, stay! Now I’ll chop you up into
morsels here; it’s best if you’re cut up into morsels.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">cya</span></span> It’s a trap: that sword you have is longer
than this here
(<span class="italic">pulls out his kitchen knife</span>) is. But do let me get a spit;
if I have to wage war with you, I’ll be off till I’ve got hold
of an appropriate referee for my fight with you, warrior.
(<span class="italic">aside</span>) But why am I wasting time here while I can still<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">630</span><span class="br"></span>
get away with my belly intact?</p></div>
