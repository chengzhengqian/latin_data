the wise man, have nothing from us, we, the bad women,

before, but flatteringly, when I had the property at my

<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">ast</span></span> While he’s alive, you should know a man; when he’s dead,

<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">din</span></span> Do you actually
consider me dead?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">ast</span></span> Please, how could one be so more plainly? You, who
