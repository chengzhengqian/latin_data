give me that purple cloak. (<span class="italic">hands it over</span>) My darling,
look, I brought you a mantle from Phrygia. Take it.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">phro</span></span> Is only such a little thing given to me in return for such
great labors?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">strat</span></span> (<span class="italic">aside</span>) Poor me, I’m dead! My son already costs me his
weight in gold. She doesn’t
even consider the addition of
a purple cloak worth anything. (<span class="italic">to Phronesium</span>) From
Arabia I’ve brought you incense, from the Black Sea<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">540</span><span class="br"></span>
balsam. Take it, my darling. (<span class="italic">the servant steps forward
again</span>)</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">phro</span></span> Take this stuff, Astaphium, and take these Syrians out of
my sight. (<span class="italic">Astaphium takes the girls and gifts into the
house and returns</span>)</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">strat</span></span> Don’t
you love me at all?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">phro</span></span> No, not at all, and you don’t
deserve my love. (<span class="italic">turns
away</span>)</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">strat</span></span> (<span class="italic">aside</span>) Isn’t
anything enough for this woman? She
didn’t
even say one single kind word to me. I believe
those gifts I presented her with could be sold for twenty
minas. Now she’s terribly angry with me, I feel and realize<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">545</span><span class="br"></span>
it; but I’ll leave. (<span class="italic">to Phronesium</span>) What do you say?
My darling, you wouldn’t
mind now if I went for dinner
where I’ve been invited? I’ll come back soon to lie with
you. Why are you silent? (<span class="italic">aside</span>) I’m dead, it’s absolutely
obvious. But what novelty is that? Who is this man who’s
bringing such a procession?
I’m resolved to watch where<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">550</span><span class="br"></span>	
they’re carrying it all. It’s being carried to this woman
here, I believe. But I’ll know more in a moment.</p></div>
