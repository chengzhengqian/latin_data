announced to me today: my gifts are considered loved
and accepted by Phronesium. While this is already pleasurable,
the other news is absolutely sweet for me: the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">705</span><span class="br"></span>
soldier’s gifts were considered hateful and unwelcome.
I’m completely joyful. The ball is mine:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL328_347_40" id="target_note_LCL328_347_40"><sup>40</sup></a> if the soldier is
rejected, the woman will be with me. I’m safe because
I’m perishing. If I weren’t
perishing, I’d have plainly
perished. Now I’ll spy on what’s going on there, who is
going in, and who is coming out. From here from a distance
I’ll observe what’s happening to my fate. As I don’t <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">710</span><span class="br"></span>
have anything—well, I’ve removed all my property here
—I’ll be at her mercy.</p></div>

<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">ast</span></span> (<span class="italic">into the house</span>) I’ll carry out my job nicely; just see to it
inside that you carry out yours in the same way. Love, as
you ought to, your money; empty him. Now while he’s
eager, while he has something,
it’s an opportune time for
this activity; produce your charm for your lover, so that
he enjoys being ruined. Meanwhile I’ll stay behind and<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">715</span><span class="br"></span>
protect you, while he’s exporting his property to your
place like this. In the meantime I won’t let anyone in to
you who’d be tedious. You must continue to trick him as
you like.</p></div>
