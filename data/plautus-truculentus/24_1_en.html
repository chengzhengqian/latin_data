<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">din</span></span> I’d guessed as much. But what’s that? Why was it important
for you to pretend?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">phro</span></span> In order that there’d be some tie and band,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL328_311_19" id="target_note_LCL328_311_19"><sup>19</sup></a> to make<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">395</span><span class="br"></span>
him return to me again. Now recently he sent a letter to
me here saying that he was going to test how much I
value him; if I didn’t
kill the child I’d given birth to and
if I took it up, I’d have all his possessions.<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">400</span><span class="br"></span></p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">din</span></span> I hear it with pleasure.
What did you do in the end?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">phro</span></span> Since the tenth month<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL328_311_20" id="target_note_LCL328_311_20"><sup>20</sup></a> was getting close already, my
mother told each of her slave girls to go to a different
place, to procure and look beforehand for a boy or a
girl that could be smuggled into my household. Why<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">405</span><span class="br"></span>
should I use a lot of words? Do you know our hairdresser
Syra?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">din</span></span> The one who lives opposite this house? I do.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">phro</span></span> She went round the households, as her job demands, and
found a boy. She brought him to me in secret and said
that he was given to her.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">din</span></span> What a bad piece of work! Now not the woman who gave<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">410</span><span class="br"></span>
birth to him gave birth to him, that earlier one, but you,
the later one.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">phro</span></span> You understand the whole business to a tee. Now according
to the message the soldier sent me, he’ll be here
shortly.</p></div>
