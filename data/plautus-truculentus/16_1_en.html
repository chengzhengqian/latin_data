every
time he sees one of us coming close to this house,
he frightens us and drives us away with his shouting,
like geese from the corn; he’s such a country bumpkin.
But I’ll knock at the door, whatever’s going to happen.

<span class="italic">ei</span> in its first syllable; in Plautus’ day the diphthong was still
written and possibly still pronounced, though it is more likely that in
pronunciation it had already developed into a closed <span class="italic">ē</span>. Truculentus (probably deliberately) misunderstands the word as <span class="italic">ĕra</span>, “mistress,”
which leads to a different interpretation of <span class="italic">comprimere</span>: Astaphium had
intended the meaning “keep in check, control,” whereas Truculentus
interprets it as “keep in check, rape.” In the Latin, Astaphium goes on
to say that Truculentus removed one letter (<span class="italic">eira → era</span>); in the translation
this is rendered as “changing one letter” (<span class="italic">distress → mistress</span>).</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL328_295_10a').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
