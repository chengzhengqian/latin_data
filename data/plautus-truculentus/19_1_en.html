place and how you lure him into wicked deceit and disgrace.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">ast</span></span> If you seemed sane, I’d say: “you’re insulting us.” Nobody<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">300</span><span class="br"></span>
is ever destroyed here at our place. People waste
their money; when they’ve wasted it, they’re free to leave
safe and sound if they so wish. I don’t
know that young

<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">truc</span></span> Really and truly? What does that wall say which is in our
garden and which night by night becomes
one brick
lower where he’s traveled on the road to ruin over to your
place?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">ast</span></span> It’s not surprising—the wall is old—if old bricks tumble<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">305</span><span class="br"></span>
down.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">truc</span></span> Do you really say that it’s old bricks tumbling down? May
no mortal ever believe me hereafter in the two things,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL328_301_15" id="target_note_LCL328_301_15"><sup>15</sup></a>

<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">truc</span></span> Yes, he didn’t
acquire his wealth by making gifts to prostitutes,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">310</span><span class="br"></span>
but through frugality and austerity; that wealth
is now being secretly carried over to your place, you
crooks. You eat it up, anoint it up, drink it up. Should
I keep quiet about this? This instant I’ll go to the forum
and tell the old man about these deeds; and that
will prevent my back from getting a mass of unsown
trouble.</p></div>
