<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">ast</span></span> (<span class="italic">overhearing</span>) Goodness! It’s not like that.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">din</span></span> Do you say that she’s in love with me?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">ast</span></span> Yes, with you alone.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">din</span></span> I’ve heard that she’s given birth.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">ast</span></span> Ah, please, be quiet, Diniarchus!</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">din</span></span> Why?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">ast</span></span> Poor me, I shudder every
time there’s a mention of birth,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">195</span><span class="br"></span>
that’s how close your Phronesium came to dying. Please
go in and see her. Or rather, wait: she’ll come out in a
moment; she was having a bath.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">din</span></span> What do you say? How could a woman who was never
pregnant give birth? Well, as far as I know, I never noticed
her womb swell up.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">ast</span></span> She hid it and was afraid that you’d urge her to have an<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">200</span><span class="br"></span>
abortion and kill the child.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">din</span></span> Then that boy’s father is the soldier from Babylon, whose
arrival she’s awaiting eagerly now.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">ast</span></span> Yes. According to a message from him, they say he’ll be
here soon. I’m surprised he hasn’t
arrived yet.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">din</span></span> Shall I go in then?<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">205</span><span class="br"></span></p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">ast</span></span> Why not? As boldly as into your own house; you’re still
one of us, even now, Diniarchus.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">din</span></span> How soon are you returning here?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">ast</span></span> I’ll be back soon; the place I’m bound for is close by.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">din</span></span> Do return at once. In the meantime I’ll wait here at your
place.</p></div>
