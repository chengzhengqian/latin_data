long? She was waiting for someone; the soldier, I believe.
Now it’s him they’re keen on; like vultures they have
foreknowledge three days in advance as to what day
they’ll be eating on. They’re all gaping at him, that’s
where all their minds are. When he comes
here, nobody<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">340</span><span class="br"></span>
will pay any more attention to me than if I’d been dead
for two hundred years. How pleasant it is to hold on to
one’s money! Poor, wretched me! I’m changing course
after the event, now that I’ve lost the property acquired
in the past. But if I now got hold of a big and splendid inheritance,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">345</span><span class="br"></span>
now that I know what sweet and bitter things
money brings you, I’d silence those who are criticizing
me now: I’d hold on to it so tightly and I’d live so frugally
that . . . I’d bet it would be gone within a few days. But<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">350</span><span class="br"></span>
