<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">cal</span></span> Gods, I implore your protection! How much easier it
was for one woman than for the other to give birth to
one and the same boy! This one gave birth to a boy
through another’s labor and without pains. The boy at
least got lucky: he has two mothers and two maternal
grandmothers. Now I’m concerned about how many
fathers
there have been. Do look at a woman’s crime!</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">servant</span></span> This wickedness has more to do with men than with<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">810</span><span class="br"></span>
women:
a man got her pregnant, not a woman.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">cal</span></span> I know that too. You’ve been a good guardian for her.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">servant</span></span> The one who is stronger

he was stronger.
He overpowered her and took away

I’ve experienced it in reality.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">cal</span></span> I’ve never managed today to make you say who it was.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">servant</span></span> I’ve been silent till now; now I won’t be silent because
he’s present and doesn’t
show himself.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">din</span></span> (<span class="italic">aside</span>) I’m petrified! Poor me, I don’t
dare to move. The
whole business is out and there the assembly deciding
over my life is taking place now. That’s my misdeed,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">820</span><span class="br"></span>
my stupidity. I’m scared to think how soon I’ll be mentioned.</p></div>
