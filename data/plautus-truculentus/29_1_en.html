mentioned who have been convicted and condemned
for false battles. [A man who is believed more by the
one who hears him than by the one who sees him does
not deserve praise.] I don’t
like a man who is praised
more by those who hear him than by those who see him.
One witness furnished with eyes is worth more than ten
witnesses furnished with ears. People who hear recount<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">490</span><span class="br"></span>
what they’ve heard, but those who see know it plainly. I
don’t
like a fellow whom the men about town praise, but
whom his comrades in arms keep silent about, nor do I
like those whose tongues outdazzle the edge of swords
while they’re at home. Energetic men benefit
the people
far more than eloquent, clever
ones. Bravery easily finds
eloquent fluency
for itself, but I’d consider an eloquent<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">495</span><span class="br"></span>
citizen without bravery to be like a woman hired to
mourn, who praises others, but cannot truthfully praise
herself. Now I’m visiting my girlfriend in Attic Athens
after ten months, to see how she’s doing; I left her behind
pregnant as a result of our relationship.</p></div>
