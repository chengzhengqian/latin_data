<p>IV. It is agreed, moreover, that often in a single day he drank a Capitoline amphora<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL140_321_1" id="target_note_LCL140_321_1"><sup>1</sup></a> of wine, and ate forty pounds of meat, or, according to Cordus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL140_321_2" id="target_note_LCL140_321_2"><sup>2</sup></a> no less than sixty. It seems sufficiently agreed, too, that he abstained wholly from vegetables, and almost always from anything cold, save when he had to drink. Often, he would catch his sweat and put it in cups or a small jar, and he could exhibit by this means two or three pints of it.</p>
<p>For a long time under Antoninus Caracalla he commanded in the ranks of the centuries<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL140_321_3" id="target_note_LCL140_321_3"><sup>3</sup></a> and often held other military honours as well. But under Macrinus, whom he hated bitterly because he had slain his Emperor’s son,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL140_321_4" id="target_note_LCL140_321_4"><sup>4</sup></a> he left the service and acquired an estate in Thrace, in the village where he was born, and here he trafficked continually with the Goths. He was singularly beloved by the Getae, moreover, as if he were one of themselves. And the Alani, or at least those of them who came to the river-bank,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL140_321_5" id="target_note_LCL140_321_5"><sup>5</sup></a> continually exchanged gifts with him and hailed him as friend.</p>
<p>When Macrinus and his son were slain, however, and he learned that Elagabalus was reigning as Antoninus’ son,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL140_321_6" id="target_note_LCL140_321_6"><sup>6</sup></a> he went to him, being now of mature age, and besought him to hold the same opinion of him that his grandfather Severus had done. But he could have no influence with that filthy man. For Elagabalus is said to have made sport of him
