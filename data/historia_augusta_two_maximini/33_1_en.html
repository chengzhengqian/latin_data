the senate, in honour of the matrons, dedicated the temple of Venus Calva.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL140_379_1" id="target_note_LCL140_379_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>We can by no means be silent about the following point. For although Dexippus, Arrianus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL140_379_2" id="target_note_LCL140_379_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and many other Greek writers have said that Maximum and Balbinus were set up as emperors against Maximinus, and that Maximum, being sent out with the army, prepared for war at Ravenna, and did not see Aquileia until after he was victorious,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL140_379_3" id="target_note_LCL140_379_3"><sup>3</sup></a> Latin writers have said that it was not Maximum but Pupienus who fought Maximinus at Aquileia and beat him. Whence this error arose I cannot say, unless it be that Maximum and Pupienus were one and the same.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL140_379_4" id="target_note_LCL140_379_4"><sup>4</sup></a> At any rate, I have set this statement down with its authorities, in order that no one may believe that I did not know it—which indeed would cause great wonder and amazement!</p>
