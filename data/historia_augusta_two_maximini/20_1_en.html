When news of these events was brought to Rome, the senate, fearing Maximinus’ barbarity—natural at all times and inevitable now that the two Gordians were dead,—elected two other emperors,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL140_353_1" id="target_note_LCL140_353_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Maximum,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL140_353_2" id="target_note_LCL140_353_2"><sup>2</sup></a> who had been prefect of the city and had held many other offices with distinction before that, humble by birth but eminent by his virtues, and Balbinus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL140_353_3" id="target_note_LCL140_353_3"><sup>3</sup></a> who was somewhat fonder of pleasure.

With three emperors, therefore, was the state propped against Maximinus. Maximum, however, was the most rigorous of life, the most sagacious, and the most uniformly courageous of the three, so finally both the senate and Balbinus entrusted the war against Maximinus to him. But after Maximum had set out to war against Maximinus, Balbinus was beset with civil war and domestic disturbances at Rome,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL140_353_5a" id="target_note_LCL140_353_5a"><sup>5</sup></a> especially after two soldiers of the praetorian guard were slain by the populace at the
