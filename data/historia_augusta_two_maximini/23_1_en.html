Their heads were sent to Rome.</p>

<p>XXIV. This was the end of the Maximini, worthy the cruelty of the father, unworthy the goodness of the son. Among the provincials there was tremendous rejoicing at their death, but among the barbarians<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL140_359_4" id="target_note_LCL140_359_4"><sup>4</sup></a> the most grievous sorrow.</p>
