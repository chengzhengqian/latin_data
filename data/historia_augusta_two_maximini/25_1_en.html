As it happened, games were being held that day, when suddenly, while Balbinus and Gordian were seated, the messenger entered the theatre; and at once, before he uttered a word, the people cried out with one voice, “Maximinus is dead!” Thus the messenger was anticipated and the Emperors, who were present, by nodding in assent expressed the public rejoicing. The performance, then, being brought to a close, everyone immediately rushed to his religious duties, and thereafter the nobles sped to the Senate-house, the people to the assembly.</p>

<p>XXVI. The decree of the senate was as follows:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL140_363_1" id="target_note_LCL140_363_1"><sup>1</sup></a> After the Emperor Balbinus Augustus had read the letter, the senate cried: “The gods take vengeance on the foes of the Roman people. Most great Jupiter, we give you thanks. Revered Apollo, we give you thanks. Maximum Augustus, we give you thanks. Balbinus Augustus, we give you thanks. We decree temples for the Deified Gordians. The name of Maximinus, previously expunged,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL140_363_2a" id="target_note_LCL140_363_2a"><sup>2</sup></a> is now to be stricken from our hearts. Let the head of the public foe be cast into running water. Let no man bury his body.
