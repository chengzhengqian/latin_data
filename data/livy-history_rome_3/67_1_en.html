the many months in which the state had been at <span class="marginNote right"><span class="sc">b.c.</span> 449</span>peace nobody had raised the question whether regular magistrates were at the head of affairs, and only now, when the enemy were almost at their gates, were men sowing political dissension; unless it was because they thought that in troubled waters it would be harder to discern what was going on. For the rest, was it not right that when men’s attention was taken up with the larger concern, all prejudgment of so important a matter should be eliminated? He therefore proposed, concerning the charge brought by Valerius and Horatius that the official term of the decemvirs had expired on the day before the Ides of May, that they should first conclude the impending wars and restore the state’s tranquillity, and then refer the question to the senate for settlement; and that Appius Claudius should at once make up his mind to recognize that he must explain, regarding the comitia which he had held for the election of decemvirs—being one himself—whether
they were chosen for one year or until the missing laws should be enacted.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL133_135_1" id="target_note_LCL133_135_1"><sup>1</sup></a> For the present he thought they should pay no attention to anything but the war.

But if they trusted both couriers and envoys, a levy should be held at the earliest possible moment; and the decemvirs should lead the armies whither it seemed good to each of them, giving precedence to no other business.</p>
