charge; and the other lieutenant, Publius Sulpicius, they put in command of the horse. The infantry on the right fought brilliantly, and were vigorously resisted by the Volsci. Publius Sulpicius broke through the enemy’s centre with his cavalry. He might have returned to the Roman side the way he went, before the enemy could re-form their broken ranks; but it seemed better to assail them in the rear. It would have been but the work of a moment to charge them from behind and throw them into confusion between the two attacks; but the Volscian and Aequian cavalry met him with his own kind of troops and held him in check for some little while. Thereupon Sulpicius cried out that there was no time for hesitation; they were surrounded and cut off from their fellows, unless they put forth all their might and disposed of the enemy’s cavalry. Nor was it enough to rout them and let them get safely off; they must destroy them, horse and man, that none might ride back into the battle or renew the fight. It would be impossible, he said, for their cavalry to resist his men, when the close ranks of their infantry had given way before them. His words did not fall upon deaf ears. With a single rush the Romans routed the entire body of cavalry. Hurling great numbers of them from their horses, they transfixed men and steeds with their javelins. This ended the cavalry-battle. Then they fell upon the hostile infantry, and sent off gallopers to announce their success to the consuls, where the enemy’s line was already beginning to give way.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL133_239_1" id="target_note_LCL133_239_1"><sup>1</sup></a> The tidings at once aroused fresh ardour in the conquering Romans and
