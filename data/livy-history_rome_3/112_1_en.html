Rome any longer a united nation; all the hostility <span class="marginNote right"><span class="sc">b.c.</span> 446</span>
and quarrelsomeness they had formerly entertained towards other nations was now being turned against themselves; the wolves<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL133_225_1" id="target_note_LCL133_225_1"><sup>1</sup></a> were blinded with mad rage at one another, and there was now an opportunity to destroy them. Combining their armies, they first desolated the country of the Latins, and then, when it appeared that there was no one in that region to punish them, they carried their marauding, amidst the triumphant rejoicings of the advocates of war, to the very walls of Rome, in the direction of the Esquiline Gate, where they insolently exhibited to the inhabitants of the City the devastation of their lands. After they had withdrawn unmolested, and driving their booty before them had marched to Corbio, the consul Quinctius summoned the people to an assembly.</p>

We have now for a long time been living under such conditions that my mind could foresee nothing good; yet had I known that such a disgrace was in store for this year, of all others, I should have shunned it even at the cost of exile or of death, in default of other means of escaping office. So! Had they been men whose swords were there at our gates, Rome might have been captured in my consulship!
