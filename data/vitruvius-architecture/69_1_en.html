alder stakes, being fixed in marshy ground below the foundations of buildings, admit fluid because they have a less quantity in their substance. Hence they remain imperishable to eternity, uphold immense weights of walling, and preserve them without decaying. Thus a timber which cannot endure even a short time above ground, when it is buried in moisture abides for long periods. 11. Now we can best consider this at Ravenna; because there all works both public and private have piles<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL251_139_1" id="target_note_LCL251_139_1"><sup>1</sup></a> of this kind under their foundations. But the elm and the ash have an excess of moisture, very little air and fire, and are provided moderately with a mixture of the earthy. When they are wrought for buildings they are pliant, and, owing to the weight of moisture, they are without stiffness and quickly bend. In time, however, they become dried up, or the moisture which is in them being cast forth, they are allowed to die off, standing in the open. At the same time they become harder, and owing to their pliability they make good joints, both upright and horizontal. 12. The hornbeam<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL251_139_2" id="target_note_LCL251_139_2"><sup>2</sup></a> has a slight mixture of fire and earth, and is compounded with a full supply of air and moisture; it is not fragile, but is most convenient to handle. And so the Greeks, because they prepare yokes for cattle from this wood, and because among them yokes are called <span class="italic">zyga,</span> also call it <span class="italic">zygia.</span> There is not less cause for wonder in the cypress and the pine. They have abundance of moisture, equal to the whole mixture of the rest. Because of their saturation with moisture, they usually warp in use, but they last for a long time without decay. For the moisture which is within the timber has a bitter
