from which it is engendered. And so when the offspring is brought forth, what previously was withdrawn to another kind of growth, the body will receive into itself through the empty and open pores. By taking up juices it becomes solid, and returns to the strength of its former nature.</p>
<p>2. Likewise in autumn the leaves wither when the fruits are ripe. The roots of the trees receive into themselves the sap from the earth, and are recovered and restored to their old solidity. But the power of the winter air compresses and consolidates them through that time as is written above. Therefore if the wood is cut in the manner and at the time described above, it will be in season,
3. Now it ought to be cut so that the thickness of the tree is cut to the middle of the pith, and left, that the sap may dry out by dripping. Thus the useless fluid which is in the veins flows out through the sapwood, and does not let the watery part die away in it, nor the quality of the wood to be corrupted. But when the tree is dry and does not drip, let it be cut down, and so it will be best in use.
4. This, moreover, we can perceive about shrubs also. When they are bored through at the base in their proper season and pruned, they pour forth from the pith, through the openings, the excessive and diseased fluid which they contain; and thus by drying they gain durability. But those trees which have no outlets of moisture, swell inside and rot, and are rendered hollow and diseased. Therefore, if by draining when they are standing and alive trees are saved from decay, doubtless when they are felled for timber, if they are treated in the same way, they will have great advantages in buildings for durability.</p>
