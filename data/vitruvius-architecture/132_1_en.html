On these the breath of the wind falls, and if it comes from marshy districts or other infected quarters, it will pour harmful spirits into the system. If therefore special care is taken in choosing a site, infection will be avoided. 2. Care also is to be taken, lest it be open to attacks from the south. For when the sun fills the circuit of the theatre, the air being enclosed within the curved space and not having the opportunity of circulating, revolves and becomes heated; hence it blazes, burns up, draws out and reduces the moisture of the body. Thus sites which are faulty in these respects are especially to be avoided, and healthy sites chosen.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL251_265_1" id="target_note_LCL251_265_1"><sup>1</sup></a> 3. If the theatre is<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL251_265_2a" id="target_note_LCL251_265_2a"><sup>2</sup></a> on a hillside, the construction of the foundations will be easier. But if they have to be laid on level or marshy ground, piles and substructures must be used as we have written in the third book concerning the foundations of temples. Above the foundations, the stepped seats ought to be built up from the substructure in stone or marble. 4. The curved level gangways, it seems, should be made proportionately to the height of the theatre; and each of them not higher at the back, than is the breadth of the passage of the gangway. For if they are taller, they will check and throw out the voice into the upper part of the theatre. Neither will they allow the endings of words to come with a clear significance to the ears of the people in their seats above the gangways. In brief the section of the theatre is to be so managed that if a line is drawn touching the lowest and the top rows, it shall also touch the front angles of all the rows. Thus the
