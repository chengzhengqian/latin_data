<p>7. The analemma in this way has been set forth and explained, whether the figures of the hours are to be marked by the analemma according to the winter lines or the summer lines or the equinoctial or indeed the monthly lines in accordance with the annexed figure. From the analemma there may be deduced many varieties and kinds of dials and they
