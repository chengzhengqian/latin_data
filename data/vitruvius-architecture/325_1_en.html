Greeks call <span class="italic">antibasis</span>,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_331_1" id="target_note_LCL280_331_1"><sup>1</sup></a> is of 8 holes; the width, 1 1/2 holes; the thickness, 2/3. The prop has a length of 12 holes; and the breadth and thickness of the smaller column. Above the smaller column is a socket-piece or cushion as it is called, 2 1/2 holes long, the same thickness and 3/4 of a hole broad. The handles of the windlass are 27/12 holes long; the thickness, 2/3; the breadth, 1 1/2. The length of the cross-pieces and tenons is . . . holes; the width and thickness, 1 1/2. The length of the arm<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_331_2" id="target_note_LCL280_331_2"><sup>2</sup></a> is 7 holes; its thickness at the bottom, 2/3; and at the top, 1/2 a hole: its curve amounts to 2/3 of a hole. 6. These proportions are attained in the work by additions or subtractions. For if the frames are too high for the breadth and these are called <span class="italic">anatona</span> [or ‘tightened up’], something must be taken from the arms; so that the tension being relaxed, because of the height of the frame, the shortness of the arm may make the stroke more powerful. Let the frame be not so high and this is called <span class="italic">catatonum</span>,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_331_3" id="target_note_LCL280_331_3"><sup>3</sup></a> the arms will be made somewhat longer more effective so as to be easily pulled down. For just as when a lever five feet long raises a load with four labourers, that same load is raised by two labourers when the lever is 10 feet long; so the longer arms are pulled down more easily, the shorter arms with more difficulty.</p>
