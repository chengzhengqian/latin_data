In these machines the blocks<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_285_1" id="target_note_LCL280_285_1"><sup>1</sup></a> are made in a different way. For they have below and above two pulleys arranged vertically. The guide rope passes into a hole in the lower block in such a way that the rope when it is taut has its two ends equally long. The rope being passed round and secured to the lower block, both ends of the rope are secured so that they cannot swerve to the right or left. Then the ends of the rope are carried back on the outside of the upper block and are taken over its lower pulleys, and return below. They are passed from the inside to the pulleys of the lower block and are carried up right and left and return to the top round the highest pulleys.</p>
<p>7. Passing from the outside they are carried right and left of the drum on the axle, and are tied so as to hold there. Then another rope is wound round the drum and carried back to the capstan. This rope is turned round the drum and axle, winds itself up and the ends are stretched equally and so gently raise the loads in safety. But if a greater drum is fixed either in the middle or on one of the ends, the capstan is dispensed with, and the drum, being trodden by men, can produce results more quickly.</p>
<p>8. There is another<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_285_2" id="target_note_LCL280_285_2"><sup>2</sup></a> kind of machine ingenious enough and suitable for speedy use; but only skilled workmen can deal with it. A pole is set up and is kept upright by cables in four different directions.
