There were two main streets, one the famous Canopic Street running east and west. These were 46 feet wide, bordered with columns. The others mostly 23 feet. The chief temple—the Serapeum—corresponding to the Roman Capitol, was on rising ground. The splendid banqueting hall of Ptolemy Philadelphus is described in Athenaeus, p. 196.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL251_75_1a').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
