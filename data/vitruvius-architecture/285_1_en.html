indicated by a point <span class="sc">c.</span> This will be the equinoctial shadow of the gnomon. From the point marked c let a line be drawn through the centre <span class="sc">a</span>; and this will represent a ray of the sun at the equinox. Then extending the compasses from <span class="sc">a</span> let a line be drawn parallel to the level surface, with the letter <span class="sc">e</span> on the left side and the letter I on the right side of the circumference, let them be joined through the centre, so that they divide the circle into two equal semicircles. This line is called the horizon by the mathematicians.</p>
<p>4. Then the circumference is to be divided into fifteen parts, and the centre of the compasses is to be put at that point <span class="sc">f</span> in the circumference where it is cut by the equinoctial ray <span class="sc">c</span>, and the points <span class="sc">g h</span> are to be marked right and left. Then from these, through the centre, lines are to be carried through to the line of the plane where the letters <span class="sc">t r</span> are to be put. One line will mark the ray of the sun in winter, the other the ray of the sun in the summer. Over against <span class="sc">e</span> will be the letter I on the horizon which cuts the circumference and passes through the centre. In this quarter are the points <span class="sc">yklg.</span> Over against <span class="sc">k</span> will be the points <span class="sc">khxl.</span> And over against <span class="sc">c f a</span> will be the letter <span class="sc">n.</span> 5. Then diameters are to be drawn from <span class="sc">g</span> to <span class="sc">l</span> and from <span class="sc">h</span> to <span class="sc">k.</span> The upper will determine the summer portion, and the lower the winter portion. These diameters are to be equally divided in the middle at the letters <span class="sc">o</span> and <span class="sc">m</span>, and the centres marked. Through those letters and the centre <span class="sc">a</span>, a line is to be produced to the circumference at the points
