alternate courses,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL251_115_1a" id="target_note_LCL251_115_1a"><sup>1</sup></a> and so they produce strength firm enough to last. Well, these are built in two kinds. Of these one is called <span class="italic">isodomum,</span> the other is called <span class="italic">pseudisodomum.</span> 6. It is called isodomum when all the courses are built of an equal thickness; pseudisodomum when the courses are unequal and unlike. Both are firm, for the reason especially that the rubble itself is of a thick and solid property, and cannot suck out the moisture from the mortar; the rubble preserves the mortar with its moisture for a long time; and the bed-joints of the stone, being laid flat and levelled, do not allow the mortar to sink down; but the stones being bonded in the unbroken thickness of the walls, keep the mortar together for a long time. 7. The second is that which they call <span class="italic">enplecton</span>, which our country people still use. In this the faces are dressed<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL251_115_2" id="target_note_LCL251_115_2"><sup>2</sup></a>; the rest of the stones are laid with mortar in their natural state, and they bond them with alternating joints. But people nowadays, being eager for speedy building, attend only to the facing, setting the stones on end, and fill it up in the middle with broken rubble and mortar.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL251_115_3" id="target_note_LCL251_115_3"><sup>3</sup></a> Thus three slices are raised in this walling, two of the facings, and a middle one of the filling in. Not so the Greeks who lay the stones level and put the headers and stretchers alternately. Thus they have not to fill in the middle, but with their through facing stones they render solid the unbroken and single thickness of the walls. In addition to the rest, they insert special stones

Hence the joints in the course above do not come over the joints in the course below.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL251_115_1a').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL251_115_2"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL251_115_2" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">2</sup><span class="italic">columnae politae sunt.</span> Cic. <span class="italic">Q.
