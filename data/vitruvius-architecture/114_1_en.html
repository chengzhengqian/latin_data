be a fence of marble or of fine joinery<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL251_229_1" id="target_note_LCL251_229_1"><sup>1</sup></a> with gates<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL251_229_2" id="target_note_LCL251_229_2"><sup>2</sup></a> by which the portico may be entered. 2. Also if the breadth be more than 40 feet, columns are to be placed towards the inner part, in a direct line with those which are between the pilasters. These other columns are to have the same height as those in front, but their diameters are to be lessened in the following manner: if the diameter of the front columns is one eighth of their height, the side diameters are to be one tenth; if the front diameter is one ninth or one tenth, then proportionately. For being diminished in an enclosed space, they will not be remarked. But if they should seem too slender they may have 28 or 32 flutes against the outside 20 or 24. Thus what is taken from the diameter of the shaft will be added by the extra number of the flutes, so as not be observed. In this way the varying diameter of the columns will be balanced. 3. This effect is produced for the following reason. The eye thus touches a greater number of points,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL251_229_3" id="target_note_LCL251_229_3"><sup>3</sup></a> and ranges over a larger circumference of vision. For if two columns of equal diameter, of which one is fluted and the other is not, have a line measured round them and one line touches the shafts of the columns round the flutes and their fillets, although the columns are of equal diameter, the bounding lines will not be equal because the circuit of the fillets and the flutes produces a greater length of line. Now if this shall seem to be the case, it is not inappropriate, in narrow places and a confined space, to use in building more slender proportions for the columns, since we have the adjustment of the fluting to help us. 4. The thickness of the walls
