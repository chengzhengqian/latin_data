porter’s rooms on the other; and these immediately adjoin the inner entrance. The space between the two entrances is called in Greek <span class="italic">thyroron.</span> You then enter the peristyle. This has colonnades on three sides. On the side which looks southward, there are two piers at a fair distance apart, on which beams are laid. The space behind is recessed two-thirds
of the distance between the piers. The recess by some is called <span class="italic">prostas, pastas</span> by others.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_47_1" id="target_note_LCL280_47_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>2. As we pass in, there is the Great Hall in which the ladies sit with the spinning women. Right and left of the recess are the bedchambers, of which one is called the <span class="italic">thalamus,</span> the other the <span class="italic">amphithalamus.</span> Round the colonnades are the ordinary dining-rooms, the bedrooms and servants’ rooms. This part of the building is called the women’s quarter, <span class="italic">gynaeconitis.</span></p>

The peristyle which has one colonnade higher is called Rhodian. These buildings have splendid approaches and doorways of suitable dignity. The colonnades of the peristyles are finished with ceilings of stucco, plaster, and fine wood panelling. In the colonnades which face the north are Cyzicene triclinia and picture galleries; on the east the libraries, the exedrae on the west; halls and square entrances<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_47_2" id="target_note_LCL280_47_2"><sup>2</sup></a> face the south that there may be ample room for four triclinia, and for the servants who attend them and assist in the amusements.</p>
