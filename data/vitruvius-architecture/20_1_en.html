Birds have less of the earthy, less of moisture, moderate heat, much air. Therefore being compounded of the lighter principles, they rise more easily against the onrush of the air. But fishes with their watery nature (because they are tempered by heat and are compounded of much air and earth, but have remarkably little moisture), the less they have of the principles of moisture in their frame, the more easily they persist in moisture; and so when they are brought to land they lose their life along with the water. Terrestrial animals, also, because they have a moderate degree of the elements of air and heat, and have less of the earthy and more moisture, inasmuch as they abound in moisture, cannot keep alive long in water. 8. Therefore if these matters are accepted as we have set forth, and if we apprehend by perception that the bodies of animals are compounded of elements, and if we judge that they suffer and are dissolved by excess or defect of them, we do not doubt that we must diligently seek to choose the most temperate regions of climate, since we have to seek healthiness in laying out the walls of cities.</p>
