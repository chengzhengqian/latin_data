<p>2. When these points are accurately marked in this way, there is taken a thin strip of willow or osier and this being smeared with liquid pitch is fixed upon the first intersection. Thence it is drawn across obliquely to the next intersections of the longitudinal and circular line. In like manner proceeding in due course it passes the successive points and winds round them, being fixed at the several intersections. Thus moving back from the first to the eighth point it reaches and is fixed on the line in which the first part of it was fixed. In this way, as far as it advances obliquely through eight points of the circumference, so far it proceeds longitudinally to the eighth point. In the same manner, throughout the whole distance of the length and of the circumference, strips of wood are fixed obliquely at the several intersections and make channels which wind round through the eight divisions of the thickness: thus forming an accurate and natural imitation of a spiral shell.</p>
<p>3. Then along this track, strips are fixed one above another and smeared with liquid pitch, and are piled up until the entire thickness is one-eighth the length. Above the strips, planks are placed all round and fixed to cover the winding strips. Then the planks are soaked in pitch and bound together with iron hoops to protect them against the effect of the water. The ends of the wood are covered with iron. On the right and left of the screw, beams are placed at the ends, with cross-pieces placed on either side. In these are iron sockets into which the pivots of the screws are inserted, and so the screws are made to turn by a treadmill. 4. The fixing of the screw is to be done at such a slope that it corresponds to the manner in which the Pythagorean right-angled
