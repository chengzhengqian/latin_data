<p>6. The length of the cheek (on either side of the table) is 8 holes; the breadth and thickness 1/2 a hole. The tenons are to be 2/3 long and 1/4 in thickness. The curvature of the cheek is 3/4. The breadth and thickness of the outside cheek is as much. The length is given by the angle of the design, and the breadth of the side-piece which is in curvature. Now the upper cheeks shall be equal to the lower cheeks: the cross-pieces of the table &lt;in thickness&gt; 3/4.</p>
<p>7. The length of the shaft of the <span class="italic">ladder</span> is 13 holes, its thickness one hole. The breadth of the middle spaces is a hole and a quarter: the depth 1 1/8. The part of the upper ladder which is nearest to the arms and conjoined to the table is to have its total length divided into five parts.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_337_3" id="target_note_LCL280_337_3"><sup>3</sup></a> Two parts are to be given to that detail which the Greeks call <span class="italic">chēlē</span>; its breadth 1 1/16; its thickness 1/4; its length 3 1/2 holes.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_337_4" id="target_note_LCL280_337_4"><sup>4</sup></a> The projection of the claw is 1/2 a hole, of the wings 3/16.
