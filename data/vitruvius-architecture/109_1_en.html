<p>1. <span class="sc">Some</span> ancient architects have said that temples should not be constructed in the Doric style, because faulty and unsuitable correspondence arose in them; for example Arcesius,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL251_219_1" id="target_note_LCL251_219_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Pythius,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL251_219_2" id="target_note_LCL251_219_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and especially Hermogenes.
