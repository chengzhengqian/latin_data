walls are along the coast and shall look to the south or west they will not be wholesome, because through the summer the southern sky is warmed by the rising sun and burns at midday. Also that which looks to the western sun is warm at sunrise, hot at noon, burns in the evening. 2. Therefore by the changes of heat and cold, bodies which are in these places will be infected. We may even perceive this from those bodies which are not animal. For in wine stores no one takes light from the south or west but from the north, because that quarter at no time admits changes, but is continuously fixed and unchangeable. So also those granaries which look towards the sun’s course quickly change their goodness; and fish and fruit which are not placed in that quarter which is turned away from the sun’s course do not keep long. 3. For always, when heat cooks the strength out of the atmosphere and with warm vapours removes by suction the natural virtues, it dissolves and renders them weak, as they become softened by warmth. Moreover, we see the same thing in iron, which is hard by nature, and yet when it is heated through in furnaces, by the vapour of fire becomes so soft that it is easily fashioned into every kind of shape; and when, being soft and red-hot, it is chilled and steeped in cold water, it hardens again and is restored to its previous character. 4. We may also consider that this is so from the fact that in summer, not only in pestilential, but in salubrious districts, all bodies become weak by the heat; and also, through the winter, even the regions which are most pestilential, are rendered salubrious because they are rendered solid by freezing. Not less also the bodies which are transferred from cold
