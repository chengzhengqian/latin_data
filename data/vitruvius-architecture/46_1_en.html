<span class="italic">Lydion,</span> that is the one which we use, a foot and a half long, a foot wide. Greek buildings are constructed with the other two. Of these, one is called <span class="italic">pentadoron,</span> the other <span class="italic">tetradoron.</span> Now the Greeks call the palm <span class="italic">doron,</span> because the giving of gifts is called <span class="italic">doron,</span> and this is always done by means of the palm of the hand. Thus the brick that is of five palms every way is called pentadoron; of four palms, tetradoron. Public buildings are erected with the former; private buildings with the latter. 4. Along with these bricks, half-bricks also are made. When these are built to the line of the face, on one side courses<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL251_93_1" id="target_note_LCL251_93_1"><sup>1</sup></a> are laid with bricks, on the other side half-bricks are laid. The walls are bound together by the alternate facings<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL251_93_2" id="target_note_LCL251_93_2"><sup>2</sup></a>; and the middle of the bricks, being placed above the joints, produces firmness, and a not unpleasing appearance on either side.</p>
<p>Now in Further Spain there is a town Maxilua, and also Callet, in Asia there is Pitane,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL251_93_3" id="target_note_LCL251_93_3"><sup>3</sup></a> where bricks, when they have been made and dried, swim in water if they are thrown in. Now it seems that they are able to swim because the soil from which they are drawn is like pumice. Thus, since it is light, when made solid by the air it does not admit nor drink up moisture into itself. Therefore since these bricks are of a light and open property, and do not allow the humid potency to penetrate into the body, of whatever weight the body shall be, it is compelled by Nature to be upheld by water like pumice-stone.
