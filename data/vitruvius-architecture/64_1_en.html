walling of burnt brick be put beneath the tiles, and let it have a projecting cornice. So the faults which usually happen here can be avoided. For when tiles in the roof are broken or thrown down by the wind (where rain-water could pass through from showers), the burnt brick shield will not allow the brickwork to be damaged; but the projection of the cornices will throw the drippings outside the facing line, and in that way will keep intact the structure of brick walls. 19. But whether the baked brick itself is very good or faulty for building, no one can judge its strength off hand, because only when it is laid as a coping is it tested by weathering and lapse of time. For brickwork that is not made of good clay or is too little baked shows its faults on the work when weathered by ice and hoar-frost. Therefore the brickwork which cannot stand the strain in the coping courses cannot be strong enough in the walling to carry loads. Wherefore the coping courses are specially built from old tiles, and the walls will be strong enough.</p>

For when the plaster is applied, they take up the moisture and swell, then when they dry they contract, and so they are rendered thin, and break the
