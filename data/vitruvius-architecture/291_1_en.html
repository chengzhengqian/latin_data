cork or drum raised by the water; on the other, a counterpoise<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_263_1" id="target_note_LCL280_263_1"><sup>1</sup></a> of sand equal in weight to the cork.</p>
<p>9. Thus, in so far as the cork is raised by the water, to that extent the weight of sand drags down and turns the axle, and the axle turns the drum. The revolution of this drum sometimes makes a greater part of the circle of the zodiac to indicate the proper length of the hour; sometimes a lesser part so to do. For in the several signs, holes are made to the number of the days of the several months; and the pin, which in dials seems to represent the sun, marks the spaces of the hours, and moving from one hole to another completes the course of the passing month. 10. Therefore just as the sun traversing the spaces of the constellations lengthens and contracts the days and hours,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_263_2" id="target_note_LCL280_263_2"><sup>2</sup></a> so the index moving along the holes in the dial in the opposite direction to the revolving drum, passes daily sometimes over longer, sometimes over shorter spaces; thus it produces over the monthly periods the representation of the hours and days.</p>
<p>The supply of water and its adjustment to the machine is to be as follows. 11. Inside, behind the dial of the clock, a cistern<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_263_3" id="target_note_LCL280_263_3"><sup>3</sup></a> is to be placed. The water is to enter by a pipe, and the cistern is to have a hole at the bottom. Against this at the side there is to be fixed a bronze drum with an opening, through which the water flows into it from the cistern. Within this is enclosed a lesser drum joined to it with tenon and socket, so that the lesser drum turning round within the greater, like a stopcock, fits closely and smoothly in its revolution.</p>
