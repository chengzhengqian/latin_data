Moreover, towns are not to be planned square<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL251_49_1" id="target_note_LCL251_49_1"><sup>1</sup></a> nor with projecting angles, but on the round, so that the enemy be seen from several sides. For when angles run out, defence is difficult, because the angle defends the enemy rather than the townsmen. 3. But I think the width of the wall should be so made that armed men meeting one another above can pass without hindrance. Then, in the width, through-timbers of charred olive wood should be put very frequently, in order that both fronts of the wall, being tied together by these timbers, as though by pins, may have everlasting strength. For such timber cannot be injured by decay or weather or age; even when it is covered with soil or placed in water, it remains unimpaired and useful for ever. And so not only the city wall, but the substructures, and those dividing walls which are made to be of the thickness of fortifications, when united in this manner, will not quickly be decayed. 4. The distances between the towers are so to be made that one is not further from another than a bowshot; so that if a tower is besieged anywhere, then, by “scorpions” and other missile engines from the towers right and left, the enemy may be thrown back. And also opposite the lower part of the towers, the wall is to be divided by intervals as wide as a tower; and these intervals opposite the interior parts of the towers shall be joined with planks. These, however, are not to be fixed with iron nails. For if the enemy occupies any part of the wall, the defenders shall cut them down, and if they manage it quickly, they will
