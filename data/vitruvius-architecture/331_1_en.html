<p>1. <span class="sc">In</span> the first place, the invention<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_343_1" id="target_note_LCL280_343_1"><sup>1</sup></a> of the battering-ram for sieges is related in the following manner. The Carthaginians had pitched their camp for the siege of Cadiz. Having already captured a fort, they set about demolishing it. Since they lacked iron tools for this purpose, they took a beam, and raising it by manual labour, they swung the end repeatedly against the top of the wall and brought down the top courses of the masonry. Thus they broke up the whole fortification little by little and in order.</p>
<p>2. Subsequently a Tyrian engineer<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_343_2" id="target_note_LCL280_343_2"><sup>2</sup></a> named Pephrasmenos, following the method of this invention, set up a pole and from it suspended a crossbeam, like the beam of a balance. This he drew backward and thrust forward, and by its violent blows overthrew the walls of Cadiz. Ceras<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_343_3" id="target_note_LCL280_343_3"><sup>3</sup></a> the Carthaginian first made a wooden platform<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_343_4" id="target_note_LCL280_343_4"><sup>4</sup></a> with wheels underneath, upon which he constructed penthouses with uprights and cross-pieces. In these he suspended a ram which he protected with oxhides, for the greater safety of the mechanics who were posted there to attack the wall. The contrivance, because it moved slowly, he was the first to call the “ram tortoise.” 3. After these first steps had been
