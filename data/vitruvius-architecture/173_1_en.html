the span is not great, and they furnish roomy apartments in the story above.</p>
<p>3. The length and breadth of the <span class="italic">atrium</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_27_1" id="target_note_LCL280_27_1"><sup>1</sup></a> is planned in three ways. The first arrangement is to divide the length into five parts, and to give three of these to the width; the second divides the length into three parts and assigns two to the width; in the third arrangement a square is described upon the width, and the diagonal of the square is drawn: whatever is the size of the diagonal supplies the length of the atrium. 4. The height of the atrium to the underside of the beams is to be three-quarters of the length. The remaining quarter is to be assigned as the dimension of the ceiling and of the roof, above the beams.</p>
<p>The width of the <span class="italic">alae</span> or wings, on the right and the left, is to be one-third of the length of the atrium when it is from 30 to 40 feet; from 40 to 50 feet the length is to be divided into three parts and a half, and one is to be given to the alae. When the length is from 50 to 60 feet, a fourth part is to be assigned to the alae. From 60 to 80 feet let the length be divided into four parts and a half: of these one is to be the width of the alae. From 80 to 100 feet the length divided into five parts will determine the breadth of the alae. The lintel beams are to be placed so high, that, in height, the alae are equal to their breadth.</p>
<p>5. The <span class="italic">tablinum</span> or alcove, if the breadth of the atrium is 20 feet, must be two-thirds in width. If the breadth of the atrium is 30 to 40 feet, half is to
