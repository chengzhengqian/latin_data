When they had made trial of many, and had tested the entire and solid nature of the livers in accordance with the water and pasture they established there the fortifications; if, however, they found them faulty, by analogy<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL251_43_1" id="target_note_LCL251_43_1"><sup>1</sup></a> they judged: that the supply of food and water which was to be found in these places would be pestilential in the case of human bodies. And so they removed elsewhere and changed their quarters, seeking salubrity in every respect. 10.
