balls and they are put together to dry. When dry they are collected in an earthenware jar, and the jars are put in a furnace. In this way the copper and the sand burning together owing to the vehemence of the fire dry together, and, interchanging their vapours, lose their properties; and their own character being overcome by the vehemence of the fire, they acquire a blue colour. 2.

The vessel is covered with a lid lest the vapour which is enclosed should escape.
