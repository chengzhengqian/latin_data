as they had seen in Achaia. Then they called it Doric because they had first seen it built in that style. 6. When they wished to place columns in that temple, not having their proportions, and seeking by what method they could make them fit to bear weight, and in their appearance to have an approved grace, they measured a man’s footstep and applied it to his height. Finding that the foot was the sixth part of the height in a man, they applied this proportion to the column. Of whatever thickness they made the base of the shaft they raised it along with the capital to six times as much in height. So the Doric column began to furnish the proportion of a man’s body, its strength and grace.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL251_207_1" id="target_note_LCL251_207_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>7. Afterwards also seeking to plan a temple of Diana in a new kind of style, they changed it to a feminine slenderness with the same measurement by feet. And first they made the diameter of the column the eighth part of it, so that it might appear taller. Under the base they placed a convex moulding as if a shoe; at the capital they put volutes, like graceful curling hair, hanging over right and left. And arranging cymatia and festoons in place of hair, they ornamented the front, and, over all the trunk (<span class="italic">i.e.</span> the shaft), they let fluting fall, like the folds of matronly robes; thus they proceeded to the invention of columns in two manners; one, manlike in appearance, bare, unadorned; the other feminine. 8. Advancing in the subtlety of their judgments and preferring slighter modules, they fixed seven measures of the diameter for the height of the Doric column, nine for the Ionic. This order because the Ionians made it first, was named Ionic.</p>
