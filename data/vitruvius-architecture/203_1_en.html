through the joints. When this has so been laid, the first finishing coat is to be spread, beaten with staves and so kneaded. Upon this, are to be put the pavements of thick tesserae or of tiles laid herringbone, with the fall already described, and when this is done, damage will not quickly arise.</p>

<p>1. <span class="sc">We</span> now pass from the preparation of pavements to plasterersâ€™<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_87_1" id="target_note_LCL280_87_1"><sup>1</sup></a> work. It will be necessary to obtain lumps of the best lime and crush it long before it is required; so that if any lump be imperfectly burnt in the kiln, owing to the long crushing, it is forced by the moisture to lose its heat and is tempered to an even quality. For when it is applied fresh and not thoroughly slaked; if, without due care it is spread containing rough lumps, it causes blisters. And these lumps of lime, when they get a thorough slaking after the work is begun, break up and destroy the surface of the stucco. 2. Now when attention is given to the slaking and care is taken in preparing the work, a trowel<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_87_2" id="target_note_LCL280_87_2"><sup>2</sup></a> is to be taken and the lime which is being slaked in the pit is to be chopped as one chops wood. If lumps are met in the chopping, the lime is not slaked. When the trowel is drawn out dry and clean, it shows that the lime is poor and absorbent; when, however, the lime is rich and duly slaked, it clings round the tool like glue, and shows that it is properly mixed.
