for so great and remarkable a thing as to surpass craftsmen who have assiduously and with the greatest industry applied themselves to single employments? 15. Therefore in this matter Pythius seems to have erred because he failed to perceive that the several arts are composed of two things—craftsmanship and the theory of it. Of these the one, craftsmanship, is proper to those who are trained in the several arts, namely, the execution of the work; the other, namely, theory, is shared with educated persons. Physician and musician alike deal with the rhythm of the pulse and the movement of the feet. For example, if a man has to heal a wound or to rescue a sick man out of danger, it is not the musician who will come, but it will be the special work of a physician.

But the taking up of work which is finely executed by hand,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL251_21_3" id="target_note_LCL251_21_3"><sup>3</sup></a> or technical methods, belongs to those who have been specially trained to work in a single trade. Therefore, he seems to have done quite enough who in the several arts is moderately familiar with the branches and methods which are necessary to architecture, so that he is not at a loss when it is necessary to judge and test any work done in these other departments and trades. 17.
