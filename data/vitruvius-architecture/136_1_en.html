tetrachord. Thus in the three scales the tetrachords are equivalent to two tones and a half, but when they are considered separately within the limits of each scale, they vary in the arrangement of the intervals. 4. Therefore by the intervals of tones, semitones, and tetrachords, nature has divided and defined their limits for the voice, measuring them by the <span class="italic">quantity</span> of the intervals; and has fixed their <span class="italic">quality</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL251_273_1" id="target_note_LCL251_273_1"><sup>1</sup></a> in certain distinct modes. Craftsmen who make instruments use these proportions which nature has fixed, and make perfect their instruments with a view to suitable concords.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL251_273_2" id="target_note_LCL251_273_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>5. Sounds (which in Greek are called <span class="italic">phthongi</span>) are eighteen in number for each kind.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL251_273_3" id="target_note_LCL251_273_3"><sup>3</sup></a> Of these, eight are perpetually fixed in the three kinds; the remaining ten, when they are modulated in common, are found to vary. Now those are fixed which are interposed between the variable sounds; they determine the combination of the tetrachord, and in accordance with the differences of the kinds remain in their own limits. Their names are these: proslambanomenos;
hypatè hypatōn; hypate mesōn; mesè; nēte synhēmmenōn; paramesè; nētè diezeugmenōn;
nēte hyperbolaeōn. Those sounds are shifting which are arranged in the tetrachord between the fixed sounds, and change from place to place in the three kinds. Their names are these: parhypatè hypatōn; lichanos hypatōn; parhypatè mesōn; lichanos mesōn; trite synhēmmenōn; paranētè synhēmmenōn; trite diezeugmenōn; paranētè die-
