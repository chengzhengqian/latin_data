<p>4. Ctesibius, therefore, when he observed that the air being drawn along and forced out gave rise to wind-pressure and vocal sounds, was the first to use these principles and make hydraulic machines. He also described the use of water-power in making automata and many other curiosities, and among them the construction of water-clocks. First he made a hollow tube of gold, or pierced a gem; for these materials are neither worn by the passage of water nor so begrimed that they become clogged. 5. The water flows smoothly through the passage, and raises an inverted bowl which the craftsmen call the cork or drum.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_259_1" id="target_note_LCL280_259_1"><sup>1</sup></a> The bowl is connected with a bar on which a drum revolves. The drums are wrought with equal teeth, and the teeth fitting into one another cause measured revolutions and movements. Further, other bars, and other drums toothed after the same fashion, and driven together in one motion cause, as they revolve, various kinds of movement; therein figures are moved, pillars are turned, stones or eggs are let fall, trumpets sound, and other side-shows.</p>
<p>6. Among these contrivances also, the hours are marked on a column or pilaster; and these are indicated by a figure<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_259_2" id="target_note_LCL280_259_2"><sup>2</sup></a> rising from the lowest part and using a pointer throughout the day. The shortening and lengthening of the pointers was brought about through the addition or removal of wedges for each day and each month.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_259_3" id="target_note_LCL280_259_3"><sup>3</sup></a> To regulate the supply of water, stopcocks are thus formed. Two cones are made, one solid, one hollow, and so finished
