In loose gravel the supply is scanty but it is found lower down; this water will be muddy and unpleasant. In black earth, moisture and small drops are found; when these gather after the winter rains and settle in hard solid receptacles, they have an excellent flavour. But in gravel small and uncertain currents are found; these also are of unusual sweetness. In coarse gravel, common sand and red sand,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_139_2" id="target_note_LCL280_139_2"><sup>2</sup></a> the supply is more certain, and this is of good flavour. The waters from red rock are copious and good, if they do not disperse through the interstices and melt away.

Springs on level ground are salt, coarse, lukewarm and unpleasant, unless they flow from the mountains underground, and break out in the middle of the fields, and there under the shadows of the trees they furnish the sweetness of mountain springs.</p>

The following growths will be found to show where the kinds of soil already described are found; the slender bulrush, the wild willow, the alder, the agnus castus, reeds, ivy and the like which cannot grow without moisture. These plants usually grow in marshy places; for these, settling below the level of the rest of the ground, receive water from the rains and from the rest of the land in winter, and because of their capacity retain the moisture.
