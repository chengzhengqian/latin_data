force. For, of the seven planets, the moon traverses that circle which is nearest the earth and least in its range. Every month, therefore, it is darkened under the disk and rays of the sun, and lies hid for one day before it passes. When it adjoins the sun, it is called the new moon. On the next day, which is counted the second, it passes away from the sun, and gives a slight visibility to the edge of its disk. When it is three days’ distance from the sun, it waxes and receives more light. When in its daily departure it comes to the seventh day, being distant from the western sun about half the region of the sky, it has half its light and that part which looks towards the sun is illuminated.</p>
<p>4. On the fourteenth day, when it is distant from the sun by the diameter of the universe, it becomes full, and rises when the sun is in the west, because being distant the whole space of the universe it stands face to face, and by the force of the sun receives into itself the splendour of the sun’s whole orb. When the sun rises on the seventeenth day the moon is near<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_231_1" id="target_note_LCL280_231_1"><sup>1</sup></a> to the west. When the sun is risen on the twenty-second day the moon holds nearly the middle region of the sky; it keeps bright the part which looks towards the sun; in the other parts the moon is darkened. Further, making its journey from day to day, it is absorbed in the rays of the sun about the twenty-eighth day, and thus completes the order of the month.</p>
<p>In the next place I will describe<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_231_2" id="target_note_LCL280_231_2"><sup>2</sup></a> how the sun going through the signs, augments and diminishes each month the length of the day and of the hour.</p>
