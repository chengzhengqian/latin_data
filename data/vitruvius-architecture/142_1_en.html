triangles which run round the curve of the circle indicate the ascents and the steps between the blocks to the first circular passage. Above, the upper blocks of seats are arranged with alternate staircases facing the middle of the lower blocks. 3. The angles which are on the ground floor of the theatre and determine the staircases will be 7 in number. The remaining 5 will indicate the arrangement of the stage. One in the middle should have the palace doors opposite to it. Those which are to the right and left, will indicate the apartments provided for strangers. The furthest two will regard the direction of the revolving scenes. As to the rows of the auditorium where the seats are placed, the seats are not to be lower than 16 inches nor more than 18. The width is not to be more than 2½ feet nor less than 2 feet. 4. The roof of the colonnade, which is to be built on the top row of steps, is to be so planned<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL251_285_1" id="target_note_LCL251_285_1"><sup>1</sup></a> as to be level with the top of the back wall of the stage, because thereby the voice will rise evenly until it reaches the top seats and the roof. For if the roof is not level, the lower it is, to that extent the voice will be interrupted, at the height which it reaches first. 5. As to the orchestra, a sixth part is to be taken of its diameter between the lowest steps. On the wings at either side of the entrance, the inmost seats are to be cut back to a perpendicular height equal to that sixth. Whatever the amount of this cutting off is, fixes the spring of the arch over the passages. In this way their vaulting will have sufficient height. 6. The length of the stage must be twice the width of the orchestra. The height of the pedestal of the back wall above the level of the stage, along with the cornice and moulding, is to be one twelfth of the diameter of the orchestra.
