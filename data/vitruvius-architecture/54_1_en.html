there is less moisture and earth in these, then also the fire, when the air has been expelled by the contact and violence of the heat, following far within and seizing upon the empty spaces of the fissures, seethes and produces, from its own substance, similar burning bodies. 3. But there are also several quarries in the neighbourhood of Tarquinii,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL251_109_1" id="target_note_LCL251_109_1"><sup>1</sup></a> known as the Anician,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL251_109_2a" id="target_note_LCL251_109_2a"><sup>2</sup></a> in colour like those of Alba, of which the workings are mostly round the lake of Bolsena,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL251_109_3" id="target_note_LCL251_109_3"><sup>3</sup></a> and also in the prefecture of Statonia.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL251_109_4" id="target_note_LCL251_109_4"><sup>4</sup></a> These also have infinite virtues; for they can neither be injured by weathering under frost nor by the approach of fire. But the stone is firm and wears well over a long time, because it has little air and fire in its natural mixture, a medium amount of moisture, and much of the earthy. Thus solidified by its close composition, it is injured<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL251_109_5" id="target_note_LCL251_109_5"><sup>5</sup></a> neither by weathering nor by the violence of fire. 4. Now this we may especially judge from the monuments, which are about the municipality of Ferentum,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL251_109_6" id="target_note_LCL251_109_6"><sup>6</sup></a> made from these quarries. For they have large statues strikingly made, and lesser figures and flowers and acanthus finely carved. These, old as they are, appear as fresh as if they were just made. None the less also, coppersmiths in their bronze castings get moulds from these quarries, and find great advantages from them for casting bronze.
