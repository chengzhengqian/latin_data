it remains that much better sources are found to the north and north-east, unless they come upon sulphur, alum or bitumen. For then they are changed; and either hot or cold, they send forth springs of a bad flavour or odour. 9. For there is no special character attaching to hot water, but when cold water, as it runs, comes upon hot ground, it seethes and comes out warm through the cracks above ground. Therefore it cannot retain its heat, but soon becomes cold. For if it were naturally warm, its warmth would not be subject to chill. But taste and smell and colour are not surrendered, because it is steeped and blended with these qualities owing to its rarefied texture.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_151_1" id="target_note_LCL280_151_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p>1. <span class="sc">There</span> are some hot springs from which water flows of excellent flavour and so pleasant to drink that we miss neither the Fountain of the Camenae<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_151_2" id="target_note_LCL280_151_2"><sup>2</sup></a> nor the conduit of the Marcian Aqueduct.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_151_3" id="target_note_LCL280_151_3"><sup>3</sup></a> Hot springs arise naturally in the following way. Fire arises underground owing to alum or bitumen or sulphur, and by its heat makes the soil above it to glow. It further sends a warm vapour to the surface of the ground, and whatever springs of sweet water rise in such places, meeting this vapour they surge forth between the cracks and flow without damage to their flavour.</p>
