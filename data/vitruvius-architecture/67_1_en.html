<p>5. Now trees have virtues varying and unlike one with another; for example, oak, elm, poplar, cypress, fir, and the rest which are most suitable in buildings. For the oak has not the same power as the fir, nor the cypress as the elm, nor have the rest by nature the same resemblances one with another. But the several kinds furnished with the properties of their first principles provide in the work various<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL251_135_1" id="target_note_LCL251_135_1"><sup>1</sup></a> effects. 6. And first, the fir has most air and fire and least moisture and earth. Being thus furnished with the lighter powers of Nature, it is not weighed down. It is held together by a natural stiffness, and is not quickly bent by a load, but remains straight in the flooring. But timber which has more heat generates and feeds decay and is diseased by it. Fir is also soon kindled because the rarefaction of the air which is present in this body, and is porous, receives the fire, and so sends forth a vehement flame. 7. Of the tree before it is cut down, the part which is nearest the earth receives the moisture from the neighbourhood through the roots and is rendered free from knots and moist. The upper part (since by the vehemence of the heat the branches are carried into the air through the knots) is cut off about twenty feet up.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL251_135_2" id="target_note_LCL251_135_2"><sup>2</sup></a> It is rough-axed and because of the hardness of the knotted portion is called “knotwood.” The lowest portion, however, when it is cut and divided in four directions,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL251_135_3a" id="target_note_LCL251_135_3a"><sup>3</sup></a> and the sapwood<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL251_135_4" id="target_note_LCL251_135_4"><sup>4</sup></a> is rejected from the same tree, is used for inside work, and is called “deal.” 8.
