triangles. In the Greek the line of the proscenium (or stage) is drawn along the side of the square which is nearest to the scenery, where it cuts the circumference. On the same side, parallel to this a line is drawn to touch the outside of the circle, and on this the front of the scenery is marked out. Through the centre of the orchestra a line is described parallel to the proscenium; where it cuts the circumference right and left, centres are marked at the ends of the semi-circle. Fixing the centre of the compasses on the right, with a radius equal to the distance of the left point, a circle is drawn to the left side of the proscenium. In the same way, the centre is fixed on the left and with a radius equal to the distance of the right, a circle is drawn to intersect the right side of the proscenium. 2. Thus the Greeks have a wider orchestra, drawn from these three centres. The scenery is more recessed. The stage is narrower: this they call <span class="italic">logeion</span> (speaking-place), for the reason that the tragic and comic actors deliver their speeches on the stage. The other artists carry on their action in the orchestra. Hence the Greek gives them separate names: stage players and chorus (<span class="italic">scaenici</span> et <span class="italic">thymelici</span>). The height of the stage is not to be less than ten feet, nor more than twelve. The staircases between the lowest blocks of seats are to be arranged opposite the several angles of the squares up to the first horizontal gangway; between the tops of the first staircases, higher flights are to be put at halfway intervals along the gangway. And generally speaking, they are to be doubled in number when a gangway is reached.</p>
