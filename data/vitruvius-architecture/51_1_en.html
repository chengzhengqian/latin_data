Not less also let it be recorded, that heats in antiquity grew and abounded under Mount Vesuvius, and thence belched forth flame round the country. And therefore now that which is called “spongestone”
or Pompeian pumice seems to be brought to this general quality from another kind of stone when it is subjected to heat. 3. But that kind of sponge stone which is taken thence is not found in all places, only round Etna and on the hills of Mysia (which is called <span class="italic">Catacecaumene</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL251_103_1" id="target_note_LCL251_103_1"><sup>1</sup></a> by the Greeks), and if there are in any other places properties of that kind.

Therefore, when unlike and unequal substances are caught together and brought into one nature, the hot desiccation, suddenly saturated with water, seethes together with the latent heat in the bodies affected, and causes them to combine vehemently and to gain rapidly one strong solidity.</p>
