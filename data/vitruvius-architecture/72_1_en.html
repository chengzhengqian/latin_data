This is a cure for phthisical persons.</p>
<p>Concerning the several kinds of trees, I have set forth the properties of which they seem to be naturally composed, and the manner in which they come to grow. The inquiry follows why the pine called Highland in Rome is inferior, whereas the so-called Lowland pine furnishes striking advantages for durability in buildings.
