(For neither talent without instruction nor instruction without talent can produce the perfect craftsman.) He should be a man of letters, a skilful draughtsman, a mathematician, familiar with scientific inquiries, a diligent student of philosophy, acquainted with music; not ignorant of medicine, learned in the responses of jurisconsults, familiar with astronomy and astronomical calculations.</p>
<p>4. The reasons why this should be so are these. An architect must be a man of letters that he may keep a record of useful precedents. By his skill in draughtsmanship he will find it easy by coloured<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL251_9_1" id="target_note_LCL251_9_1"><sup>1</sup></a> drawings to represent the effect desired. Mathematics again furnishes many resources to architecture. It teaches the use of rule and compass and thus facilitates the laying out of buildings on their sites by the use of set-squares, levels and alignments. By optics,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL251_9_2" id="target_note_LCL251_9_2"><sup>2</sup></a> in buildings, lighting is duly drawn from certain aspects of the sky. By arithmetic, the cost of building is summed up; the methods of mensuration are indicated; while the difficult problems of symmetry are solved by geometrical rules and methods. 5. Architects ought to be familiar with history because in their works they often design many ornaments about which they ought to render an account to inquirers. For example, if anyone in his work sets up, instead of columns, marble statues of long-robed women which are called caryatids,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL251_9_3" id="target_note_LCL251_9_3"><sup>3</sup></a> and places mutules and cornices above them, he will thus
