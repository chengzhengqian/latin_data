architraves and ornaments in due proportion. The width of the colonnades should be arranged as follows. Taking the height of the outer columns, this will give the width from the lower part of the outer columns to the middle columns and from the middle columns to the walls which surround the walks of the colonnades. The middle columns are to be designed one fifth higher than the outer ones, and either in the Ionic or Corinthian style. 3. The proportions and symmetries of the columns will not be calculated in the same way as I have described for sacred edifices. In the temples of the gods dignity should be aimed at; in colonnades and other similar works, elegance. And so if the columns are in the Doric style, their height including the capitals is to be divided into 15 parts of which one is to be the module. The planning of the whole work is to be calculated to this module. The thickness of the column at the foot is to be of two modules. The intercolumniation is to be 5½ modules. The height of the column excluding the capital is to be 14 modules. The height of the capital is to be one module; the width 2 1/6 modules. The proportions of the rest of the work are to be completed as laid down in the fourth book for sacred edifices. 4. But if the columns are Ionic, the shaft apart from the base and capital is to be divided into 8½ parts and of these one is to be given to the diameter of the column. The base, with the plinth, is to be of half the diameter. The capital is to be designed as set forth in the third book. If the column is Corinthian, the shaft and base are to be as in the Ionic, but the capital is to be proportioned as
