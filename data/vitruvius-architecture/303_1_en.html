Where the cables meet at the top, two sockets are fixed; the block is fixed to the sockets with ropes. Under the block is put a piece of timber about two feet long, six inches wide, and four inches thick. The blocks, with three sets of pulleys in their width, are fixed so that three guide ropes are inserted in the machine. These are brought down to the lower block and pass from the side next the pole over the upper pulleys; thence they are carried to the upper block and pass over the lower pulley, from the outside to within.</p>
<p>9. When they come below they pass over the second pulleys from within outwards, and are brought back to the second pulleys above. Passing on they return below, and from below they return to the top. And passing over the top of the pulleys, they return to the lower part of the machine. Further, at the foot of the machine a third block is fixed; this is called <span class="italic">epagon</span> by the Greeks, <span class="italic">artemon</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_287_1" id="target_note_LCL280_287_1"><sup>1</sup></a> by us. The block is secured to its foot with three pulleys, over which the ropes pass, which are given to men to work. Thus three sets of men working without a capstan quickly draw a load to the top. 10.

The use of a single pole has this advantage, that by inclining it beforehand it can deposit the load sideways right or left as much as is desired.</p>
<p>The use of all the contrivances described above is available not only for these purposes, but also for
