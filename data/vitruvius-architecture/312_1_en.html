<p>3. When, however, the water is to be raised to a greater height, a similar method will be employed. A wheel is so constructed round the axle of such a size as shall suit the height required. Round the circumference of the wheel square buckets are to be fixed, made taut with pitch and wax. Thus, when the wheel is turned by men treading it, the buckets are raised full to the top, and on their return down, pour into a conduit what they have raised. 4. But if a supply is required at a still greater height, a double iron chain is made to revolve on the axle of the same wheel and let down to the lower level, with bronze buckets suspended to the chain, each holding 3 quarts. Thus the turning of the wheel makes the chain revolve round the axle, and carries the buckets to the top. These are carried over the axle; they are made to turn over and pour into the conduit the water they have raised.</p>

<p>1. <span class="sc">Wheels</span> are used in rivers in the same way as described above. Round the outside, paddles are fixed, and these, when they are acted on by the current of the river, move on and cause the wheel to turn. In this fashion they draw up the water in buckets and carry it to the top without workmen to tread the wheel. Hence, being turned by the force of the river only, they supply what is required.</p>
<p>2. Mill wheels are turned on the same principle, except that at one end of the axle a toothed drum is
