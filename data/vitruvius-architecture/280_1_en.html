Dragon is twisted and folded back from the head of the Little Bear to the Great Bear about his snout and the right temple of his head. Further, the feet of Cepheus are on the tail of the Little Bear. And there at the highest point are stars which form a triangle with its equal sides above the Ram. But many stars belonging to the Little Bear and to the constellation of Cassiopeia are confused.</p>
<p>The constellations which are to the right of the east between the Zodiac and the Waggon I have described as figured.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_241_1" id="target_note_LCL280_241_1"><sup>1</sup></a> I will now explain those which are distributed by nature to the left of the east and in the parts south.</p>

<h3><span class="sc">on the southern constellations</span></h3>
<p>1. <span class="sc">First</span>, under Capricorn lies the southern Fish looking towards the tail of the Whale. From that to the Archer is a void. The Altar is under the Scorpionâ€™s sting. The front part of the Centaur is nearest to the Balance and Scorpion. He holds in his hands a figure which the astronomers have named the Beast.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_241_2" id="target_note_LCL280_241_2"><sup>2</sup></a> The Virgin, the Lion and the Crab are girt about with the Serpent,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_241_3" id="target_note_LCL280_241_3"><sup>3</sup></a> which in its twistings stretches through a procession of stars. It raises its snout to the Crab; against the Lion it supports the Cup with its middle; to the hand of the Virgin it raises its tail, on which rests the Crow. The stars above its shoulders are equally luminous.</p>
