Thus the Egyptian halls resemble basilicas<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_33_1" id="target_note_LCL280_33_1"><sup>1</sup></a> rather than Corinthian apartments.</p>

These are situated with a north aspect, and especially with an outlook upon gardens; they have folding windows in the middle. The halls themselves are broad and long enough to have two triclinia facing each other, with room to pass round; and these, on both hands, have garden windows with folding lights, so that the guests, under cover,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_33_2" id="target_note_LCL280_33_2"><sup>2</sup></a> may have a view of the garden.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_33_3" id="target_note_LCL280_33_3"><sup>3</sup></a> The height of the hall must be one and a half times its width.</p>
