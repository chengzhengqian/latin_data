<p>3. In the several channels are single stopcocks fitted with an iron handle. When the iron handle is turned, it opens an aperture from the chest into the channels. The canon has openings from the channels; and the openings are placed along the canon corresponding to the openings in the top board which, in Greek, is called the <span class="italic">pinax.</span> Between the pinax above and the canon below, bars are fixed with openings corresponding to those of the canon and the pinax. The bars are well oiled so that they easily pass backwards and forwards, closing and opening the holes in the channels. The bars are called <span class="italic">plinthides.</span> 4. To these plinthides, iron springs are attached which connect with the keys of the organ, so that to touch the keys forthwith moves the plinthides. On the pinax, rings are fixed round the holes which allow the passage of the air from the channels. And these rings receive the feet of the organ pipes. Now from the cylinders, there run lengths of piping to the neck of the air-vessel and communicate with the openings in the chest. Over these openings there are placed valves wrought on the lathe. These valves, when the chest is supplied with air, close the openings and do not allow the air to escape.</p>
<p>5. Thus when the levers are raised, the piston rods draw down the pistons towards the bottom of the cylinder, and the dolphins working on pivots, releasing the valves in the cylinders, fill the cavity of the cylinders with air. Thereupon the piston rods raise the pistons within the cylinders with rapid and violent strokes and close the openings above, with the valves; the air in the cylinders is forced by the pumping into
