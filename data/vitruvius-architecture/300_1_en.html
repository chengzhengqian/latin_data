pieces of timber are carefully prepared, which answer to the size of the load. They are set up, connected<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_281_1" id="target_note_LCL280_281_1"><sup>1</sup></a> at the top with a brace, and spreading at the base. They are kept upright by ropes fastened at the top and adjusted round them. At the top a block is made fast: these some call <span class="italic">rechamus.</span> On this block two pulleys are fixed, which revolve upon axles. Over the top pulley the leading rope is passed. It is then let down and drawn round a pulley of the block below. It is returned to the lower pulley of the top block, and so comes again to the lower block and is secured to the eye of it. The other end of the rope belongs to the lower part of the machine.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_281_2" id="target_note_LCL280_281_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>2. On the back faces of the timbers where they separate, socket-pieces are fixed, into which the ends of the windlasses are put, so that the axles may turn easily. The windlasses near their ends have two perforations so adjusted that handspikes can fit into them. To the bottom of the block, iron pincers are fixed, the teeth of which are adjusted to holes in the blocks of stone. Now when the rope has its end tied to the windlass, and the handspikes draw and turn the windlass, the rope in winding round the axle is made taut and so lifts up weights to their place in the work.</p>
<p>3. Now this kind of contrivance, because it is turned by three pulleys, is called <span class="italic">trispastos.</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_281_3" id="target_note_LCL280_281_3"><sup>3</sup></a> When,
