On the cover a pipe, which is called a trumpet, is jointed to it, and made vertical. The cylinders have, below the lower mouths of the pipes, valves inserted above the openings in their bases. 3. Pistons are now inserted from above rounded on the lathe, and well oiled. Being thus enclosed in the cylinders, they are worked with piston rods and levers. The air and water in the cylinders, since the valves close the lower openings, the pistons drive onwards. By such inflation and the consequent pressure they force the water through the orifices of the pipes into the vessel. The funnel receives the water and forces it out by pneumatic pressure through a pipe. A reservoir is provided, and in this way water is supplied from below for fountains.</p>
<p>4. Nor is this the only remarkable device of Ctesibius
which is current. There are many others of various kinds which are driven by the pressure of water. The pneumatic pressure will be shown to produce effects borrowed from nature, both notes of blackbirds<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_313_1" id="target_note_LCL280_313_1"><sup>1</sup></a> by the motion of water, and walking automata<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_313_2" id="target_note_LCL280_313_2"><sup>2</sup></a>; little figures which drink and move; and other things which flatter the pleasure of the eyes and the use of the ears. 5. Of these I have chosen those which I have judged most useful and serviceable. In the last book I spoke about clocks; in this we have had to deal with water-pumps. The other things which are not for service, but for the purpose of our delight, can be found in the commentaries of Ctesibius by those who have a special wish for such ingenuity.</p>
