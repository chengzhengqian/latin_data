When, after the Bull, he enters the Twins at the rising of the Pleiades, he rises higher above the earth and lengthens the day. Thereupon, after the Twins he enters the Crab, a sign which occupies the shortest space of the heavens; coming to the eighth degree, he completes the solstice, and in his progress reaches the head and breast of the Lion, these parts being assigned to the sign of the Crab.</p>

Passing then from the Lion to the Virgin and reaching the lap of her robe, he contracts his circuit and makes the amount of his course equal to that which the Bull holds.
