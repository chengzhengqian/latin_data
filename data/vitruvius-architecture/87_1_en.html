bases; if the building is hexastyle, into 18 parts; if it shall be octastyle, into 24½ parts. Further, of these parts, whether for tetrastyle, hexastyle, or octastyle, let one be taken, and that will be the module or unit. And of this module, one will be the thickness of the column. The several intercolumniations
except those in the middle will be of two modules and a quarter; the middle intercolumniations
at the front and at the back will be severally of three modules. The height of the columns will have a just proportion of modules.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL251_175_1" id="target_note_LCL251_175_1"><sup>1</sup></a> 8.
