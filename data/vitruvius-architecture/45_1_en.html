because of their roughness. But bricks are to be made of white clayey earth or of red earth, or even of rough gravel. For these kinds, because of their smoothness, are durable. They are not heavy in working, and are easily built up together. 2. Now bricks are to be made either in the spring or autumn, that they may dry at one and the same time. For those which are prepared at the summer solstice become faulty for this reason: when the sun<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL251_91_1" id="target_note_LCL251_91_1"><sup>1</sup></a> is keen and overbakes the top skin, it makes it seem dry, while the interior of the brick is not dried. And when afterwards it is contracted by drying, it breaks up what was previously dried. Thus bricks crack and are rendered weak. But, most especially, they will be more fit for use if they are made two years before. For they cannot dry throughout before. Therefore when they are built in fresh and not dry, and the plaster is put on and becomes rigid, they remain solid only on the surface. Hence they settle and cannot keep the same height as the plaster. For by contraction and the consequent movement they cease to stick to the plaster, and are separated from their union with it. Therefore the wall-surfaces are separated from the wall itself, and because of their thinness cannot stand of themselves and are broken, and the walls settling haphazard, become faulty. That is why the citizens of Utica<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL251_91_2a" id="target_note_LCL251_91_2a"><sup>2</sup></a> use no bricks for building walls, unless the magistrate has approved them as being dry and made five years before. 3.
