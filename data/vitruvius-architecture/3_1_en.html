<h3><span class="sc">on the training of architects</span></h3>
<p>1. <span class="sc">The</span> science of the architect depends upon many disciplines and various apprenticeships which are carried out in other arts. His personal service<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL251_7_1a" id="target_note_LCL251_7_1a"><sup>1</sup></a> consists in craftsmanship and technology. Craftsmanship is continued and familiar practice, which is carried out by the hands<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL251_7_2" id="target_note_LCL251_7_2"><sup>2</sup></a> in such material as is necessary for the purpose of a design. Technology sets forth and explains things wrought in accordance with technical skill and method.</p>
<p>2. So architects who without culture aim at manual skill cannot gain a prestige corresponding to their labours, while those who trust to theory and literature obviously follow a shadow and not reality. But those who have mastered both, like men equipped in full armour, soon acquire influence and attain their purpose.</p>
<p>3. Both in general and especially in architecture are these two things found; that which signifies and that which is signified. That which is signified is the thing proposed about which we speak; that which signifies is the demonstration unfolded in systems of precepts. Wherefore a man who is to follow the architectural profession manifestly needs to have experience of both kinds. He must have both a natural gift<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL251_7_3" id="target_note_LCL251_7_3"><sup>3</sup></a> and also readiness to learn.
