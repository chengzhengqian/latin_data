determined as perfect the number which is called ten.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL251_163_1a" id="target_note_LCL251_163_1a"><sup>1</sup></a> For from the hands they took the number of the inches; from the palm, the foot was discovered. Now while in the two palms with their fingers, ten inches are naturally complete, Plato considered that number perfect, for the reason that from the individual things which are called <span class="italic">monades</span> among the Greeks, the decad<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL251_163_2" id="target_note_LCL251_163_2"><sup>2</sup></a> is perfected. But as soon as they are made eleven or twelve, because they are in excess, they cannot be perfect until they reach the second decad. For individual things are minor parts of that number. 6. But mathematicians, disputing on the other side, have said that the number called six<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL251_163_3" id="target_note_LCL251_163_3"><sup>3</sup></a> is perfect for the reason that this number has divisions which agree by their proportions with the number six. Thus a sixth is one; a third is two; a half is three; two-thirds, which they call <span class="italic">dimoeros,</span> four; five-sixths, which they call <span class="italic">pentemoeros,</span> five; the perfect number, six. When it grows to the double, a twelfth added above six makes <span class="italic">ephectos</span>; when eight is reached, because a third is added, there is a second third, which is called <span class="italic">epitritos</span>; when half is added and there are nine, there is half as much again, and it is called <span class="italic">hemiolios</span>; when two parts are added and a decad is made, we have the second two-thirds, which they call <span class="italic">epidimoeros</span>: in the number eleven, because five are added, we have five-sixths, which they call <span class="italic">epipemptos</span>; twelve, because it is produced from two simple numbers, they call <span class="italic">diplasios.</span> 7.
