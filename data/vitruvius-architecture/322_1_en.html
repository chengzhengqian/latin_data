When, therefore, the ship receives an impulse from the force of the oars or the sails, the paddles fixed to the wheels touch the water which meets them, and being urged by a strong backward impulse, turn the wheels. These in turn move the axle by their revolutions; and the axle moves the drum, the tooth of which being driven round, strikes at each revolution a single tooth of the second drum, and produces the corresponding rotations. Thus when the wheels have been made to revolve 400 times by the paddles, the drum being once driven round will strike by the tooth placed on its side, a tooth in the horizontal drum. Therefore as often as the revolution of the horizontal drum brings the stones to the opening, it will let them drop through the small channel. And in this way, by the sound and number of the stones, it will indicate the miles traversed by the ship.</p>
