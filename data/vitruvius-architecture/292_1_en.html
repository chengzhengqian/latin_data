<p>12. The edge of the greater drum is to have 365 points marked at equal intervals. The lesser drum is to have on its outside circumference a tongue fixed, and is to direct the tip towards the places of the points. In the same drum a proportionate perforation is to be adjusted, because the water flows through it into the drum and guides the working. Now since the representations of the signs of the zodiac are on the margin of the greater drum, this is to remain unmoved. The sign of Cancer is to be figured at the top; perpendicularly below it, the sign of Capricorn is at the bottom. On the right of the spectator, the sign of Libra; on his left, that of Aries. The other signs are to be marked within their spaces as they appear in the sky.</p>
<p>13. Therefore, when the sun is in Capricorn,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_265_1" id="target_note_LCL280_265_1"><sup>1</sup></a> the tongue in the lesser drum touches every day the several points in Capricorn on that part of the larger drum. The great weight of the running water being vertical, is quickly delivered through the perforation of the lesser drum into the vessel. The vessel which receives the water is soon filled, and arrests and contracts the spaces of the days and hours. When, however, by the continuous revolution of the lesser drum, the tongue enters all the points in Aquarius, the perforations leave the perpendicular, and after the downpour the water is compelled to send forth its current more slowly. Thus the slower is the flow by which the vessel receives the water, the more it extends the length of the hours.</p>
