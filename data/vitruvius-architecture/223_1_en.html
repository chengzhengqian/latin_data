<p>1. <span class="sc">We</span> now turn to purple, which of all is most prized and has a most delightful colour excellent above all these. It is obtained from sea shells which yield the purple dye, and inspires in students of nature as much wonder as any other material. For it does not yield the same colour everywhere, but is modified naturally by the course of the sun. 2. What is collected in Pontus and Gaul is black because these regions are nearest to the north. As we proceed between the north and west it becomes a leaden blue. What is gathered in the equinoctial regions, east and west, is of a violet colour.
