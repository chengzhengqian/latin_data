For such places are turned away from the sun’s course, and in these especially are many forest trees; and the mountains themselves have intervening shadows, nor do the sun’s rays reach the earth directly and cause the moisture to evaporate.</p>
<p>7. Valleys between mountains are subject to much rain, and because of the dense forests, snow stands there longer under the shadow of the trees and the hills. Then it melts and percolates through the interstices of the earth and so reaches to the lowest spurs of the mountains, from which the product of the springs flows and bursts forth. But on the plains one cannot get supplies of water. And what there is, cannot be wholesome, because, in the absence of shadow, the violent power of the sun catches and drains, by its heat, the moisture from the level fields. And if any water is visible, the air calls out the lightest, thinnest and most subtly wholesome part and dissipates it towards the sky; but the heaviest, the harsh and unpleasant parts, are left in the field springs.</p>
