to warm regions cannot endure but are dissolved; while those which are transferred from warm places under the northern regions not only do not suffer in health by the change of place but even are strengthened. 5. Wherefore in laying out walls we must beware of those regions which by their heat can diffuse vapours<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL251_39_1" id="target_note_LCL251_39_1"><sup>1</sup></a> over human bodies. For according as from the elements (which the Greeks call stoecheia)<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL251_39_2a" id="target_note_LCL251_39_2a"><sup>2</sup></a> all bodies are composed, that is from heat and moisture and earth<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL251_39_3" id="target_note_LCL251_39_3"><sup>3</sup></a> and air, just so by these mixtures, owing to natural temperament, the qualities of all animals are figured in the world according to their kind. 6. Therefore in whatsoever bodies, one of their principles, heat, is predominant, it then kills them and by its fervency dissolves the rest. Now a hot sky from certain quarters produces these defects; since it settles into the open veins more than the body permits by its natural temperament or admixture. Again, if moisture had filled the veins of bodies and altered their dimensions, the other elements, as though decomposed by liquid, are diluted and the virtues dependent on their proportion are dissolved. So also from the chilling of moisture of winds and breezes, vices are infused into bodies. Not less the natural proportion of air and also of the earthy element by increase or diminution weakens the other elements; the earthy by repletion of food, the aerial, by the heavy climate.</p>
