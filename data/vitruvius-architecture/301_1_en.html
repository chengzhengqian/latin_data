however, there are two pulleys in the lower block and three in the upper block, it is called <span class="italic">pentaspaston.</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_283_1" id="target_note_LCL280_283_1"><sup>1</sup></a> But if machines are to be prepared for greater loads, we must use longer and thicker timbers. In the same way we must use larger bolts at the top, and larger windlasses below. When all is made ready, the tackle,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_283_2" id="target_note_LCL280_283_2"><sup>2</sup></a> which is previously loose, is to be attached; the cables are to be carried over the shoulders of the machine. If there is no place to which they may be fixed, sloping piles are to be driven into the ground and secured by ramming the ground round them; to them the ropes are to be attached. 4. The block at the top of the machine is to be attached by a cable. And a rope is to be taken from the top to the inclined pile and fastened to the block which is on the pile. Passing over its pulley the rope is to be carried back to the block which shall be bound to the top of the machine. After passing round the pulley the rope is to come down from the top and is to return to the windlass which is below, and bound there. The windlass being worked by handspikes will revolve: and of itself will raise the machine without danger. Thus the ropes are passed round, the cables are fixed to the piles and the machine is in position for use. The pulleys and the tackle are applied as it is described above.</p>
<p>5. If, however, the works involve loads of immense dimensions and weight, we must not trust to the windlass. But an axle held in sockets like the windlass is to be inserted having in the middle a large drum,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_283_3" id="target_note_LCL280_283_3"><sup>3</sup></a> which some call a wheel: the Greeks,
