not suffer the enemy to penetrate the rest of the towers and wall, unless he is willing to throw himself headlong. 5. The towers therefore are to be made round or polygonal. For engines more quickly demolish square towers, because the battering-rams beat and break the angles; whereas in the case of rounded surfaces, even when they drive the battering-rams wedge-fashion towards the centre, they cannot hurt them. Further, the fortifications of the wall and towers especially when joined by embankments are safer, because neither battering-rams nor undermining nor other contrivances avail to injure them. 6. But not in all places is the method of embankment to be employed; only where there is an approach outside the wall from high ground by a level footway for troops besieging the ramparts. Therefore in places of this kind, ditches are to be made of the amplest possible breadth and depth; then the foundation of the wall is to be carried down within the hollow of the ditch, and is to be constructed of such a thickness that the weight of earth is easily held up. 7. Also on the inner side of the substructure another foundation is to be laid, so far distant from the outer foundation that cohorts can stand upon the broad rampart for its defence, as when drawn up in line of battle. Now when the foundations are fixed at such a distance from each other, then between these let there be placed other transverse walls joined to the outer and inner foundation, arranged comb-fashion, as the teeth of a saw are wont to be. For when it shall so be done, then the greatness of the load of earth being thus distributed into small parts, will not press with the whole weight, so as to thrust out the substructures of the wall.
