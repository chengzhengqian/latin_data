Then the foundations are to be filled with very solid structures. The foundations being built to a level, the stylobates<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL251_183_1" id="target_note_LCL251_183_1"><sup>1</sup></a> are to be laid. 3. Above the stylobates the columns are to be erected as described above; whether in pycnostyle (as are the pycnostyle temples), or in systyle, or diastyle or eustyle, as it has been described and determined above. For in araeostyle there is freedom to determine as everybody pleases. But let the columns be so disposed in peripteral temples that the intercolumniations on the sides are twice as many as on the front. For then the length of the work will be twice the breadth. For those who made double the number of the columns seem to be at fault because in the length one more intercolumniation than is necessary seems to occur. 4. The steps are to be so placed in front that they are always of an uneven number. For since the first step is ascended on the right foot, the right foot must also be set on the top of the temple steps. And the risers of the steps must be of such dimensions that they are neither deeper than ten inches nor shallower than nine. For thus the ascent will not be hard. But the treads of the steps, it seems, should be made not less than eighteen inches or more than two feet. Also, if steps are to be round the temple, they ought to be made after the same measure. 5. But if a platform is to be made round the temple on three sides, it is to be planned in such a way<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL251_183_2" id="target_note_LCL251_183_2"><sup>2</sup></a> that the plinths, bases, dados, cornices and cymatium conform to the pedestal which is under
