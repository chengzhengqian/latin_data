protect the water from the sun. When they come to the city walls, a reservoir is to be made. To this a triple receptacle is to be joined, to receive the water; and three pipes of equal size are to be put in the reservoir, leading to the adjoining receptacles, so that when there is an overflow from the two outer receptacles, it may deliver into the middle receptacle.</p>
<p>2. From the middle receptacle pipes will be taken to all pools and fountains; from the second receptacle to the baths, in order to furnish a public revenue; to avoid a deficiency in the public supply, private houses are to be supplied from the third: for private persons will not be able to draw off the water, since they have their own limited supply from their receptacle. The reason why I have made this division, is in order that those who take private supplies into their houses may contribute by the water rate to the maintenance of the aqueducts. 3. If there are hills between the city and the fountain head, we must proceed as follows. Tunnels are to be dug underground and levelled to the fall already described. If the formation of the earth is of tufa or stone, the channel may be cut in its own bed; but if it is of soil or sand the bed and the walls with the vaulting are to be constructed in the tunnel through which the water is to be brought. Air shafts are to be at the distance of one actus (120 feet) apart.</p>
<p>4. But if the supply is to be by lead pipes, first of all a reservoir is to be built at the fountain head. Then the section of the pipe is to be determined for the supply of water, and the pipes are to be laid from the reservoir to a reservoir in the city. The pipes are to be cast in lengths of not less than 10 feet. If the lead is 100 inches wide, they are to weigh 1200 lbs.
