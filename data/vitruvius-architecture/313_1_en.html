fixed. This is placed vertically on its edge and turns with the wheel. Adjoining this larger wheel there is a second toothed wheel placed horizontally by which it is gripped. Thus the teeth of the drum which is on the axle, by driving the teeth of the horizontal drum, cause the grindstones to revolve. In the machine a hopper is suspended and supplies the grain, and by the same revolution the flour is produced.</p>

<p>1. <span class="sc">There</span> is further an application of the screw which draws a large amount of water, but does not raise it as high as the wheel. The contrivance<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_307_1" id="target_note_LCL280_307_1"><sup>1</sup></a> is as follows. A beam is taken as many inches thick as it is feet long. This is rounded to an exact circle. At the ends the circumference is to be divided by a compass into quadrants and eighths and so to eight parts; and the diagonals are to be so drawn that when the beam is horizontal the lines at either end correspond exactly. The whole length is to be marked off into spaces equal to one-eighth of the circumference. Again, the beam is to be laid level and lines are to be drawn from one end to the other guided by a level. Thus there will be equal divisions both round the beam and along it. Where the longitudinal lines are drawn, they will intersect the cross-lines, and these intersections are to be marked by points.</p>
