names and the quarters whence the fixed currents of winds blow. Since these may be regarded as ascertained, we must calculate as follows to find the quarters and risings of the winds. 6. Let there be placed to a level a marble dial, somewhere in the middle of the city; or let a space be so polished to rule and level that the marble dial is not wanted. Above the middle point of that place, let there be put a bronze indicator to track the shadow<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL251_59_1" id="target_note_LCL251_59_1"><sup>1</sup></a> (which in Greek is called <span class="italic">sciotheres</span>). Before midday, at about the fifth hour, the end of the shadow of the indicator is to be taken and marked with a point. Then a radius being taken from the indicator to the point which marks the length of the shadow, with that, from the indicator as centre, a circumference is to be drawn. After midday the growing shadow of the indicator, when it touches the line of the circle and marks a post-meridian shadow equal to the antemeridian, is to be marked with a point. 7. From these two points, two intersecting circles are to be described. Through the intersection and the centre of the circle first described, a line is to be carried through to the end so that the southern and northern quarters may be indicated. Next we take as radius the sixteenth part<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL251_59_2" id="target_note_LCL251_59_2"><sup>2</sup></a> of the circumference of the circle. From centres given by the meridian line at the two points where it touches the circle, and with that radius, points are to be marked right and left in the circle, both on the southern and on the northern part. Then from these four points, intersecting lines are to be drawn through the middle centre from one side of the circumference to the other. Thus both for the south wind and for the north wind we shall have marked out the eighth part of the circumference.
