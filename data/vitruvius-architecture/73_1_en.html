For it has an unbroken direction towards the sun’s course. But the further slope, which inclines to the Adriatic, lies towards the northern quarter, and is bounded by unbroken tracts of land overshadowed and gloomy. And so the trees which grow in that part absorb a humid element. Not only do they grow to an immense size, but their pores, being filled with a supply of moisture, are saturated with an abundance of pressing fluid. But when they are cut down and axed they lose their vital force: remaining with the pores stiff and open, they dry, become hollow and perishable, and so cannot last in buildings. 2. But those which grow in places facing the sun’s course, lacking the open spaces of the pores, are drained by dryness and solidified. For the sun licks up and draws moisture not only from the ground but also from trees. And so the trees in sunny regions are solidified by the closeness of their pores, and are free from the attenuation which is caused by moisture. When they are hewn into timber they furnish great advantages for durability. Therefore the lowland pine because it is brought from sunny districts is better than that which is brought from sunless districts in the highlands.</p>
