<h3><span class="sc">on the treasury, prison, and curia</span></h3>
<p>1. <span class="sc">The</span> treasury, prison, senate-house are to adjoin the forum but in such a way that their scale and proportion answers to that of the forum. In the first place especially the senate-house is to be built with a view to the dignity of the municipality or city. If it be square its height must be one and a half times its width; but if it be oblong, let the length and breadth be added together and let half of the total amount be given to the height under the ceiling. 2. Moreover the interior walls are to be surrounded half way up with cornices of fine joinersâ€™ work or plaster<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL251_263_1" id="target_note_LCL251_263_1"><sup>1</sup></a> at half their height. If this is not done, the voice of the disputants rising upwards cannot be understood by the audience. When, however, the walls are girt with cornices, the voice, being delayed by the lowest parts before it rises into the air and is scattered, will be perceived by the ear.</p>

<h3><span class="sc">on the site of the theatre</span></h3>
<p>1. <span class="sc">When</span> the forum has been settled, a site as healthy as possible is to be chosen for the exhibition of plays on the festivals of the immortal gods, according to the instructions given in the first book for the healthy disposition of the city walls. For at the play citizens with their wives and children remain seated in their enjoyment; their bodies motionless with pleasure have the pores opened.
