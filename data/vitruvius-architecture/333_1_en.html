<p>6. The construction of the Ram Tortoise was carried through with the same method. It had a breadth of 32 cubits, a height (not including the gable) of 16 cubits, and the height of the gable from the platform to the summit, of 16 cubits. Now the gable rose up above the middle of the roof not less than 2 cubits. Above this there was raised a small tower 4 cubits wide, of 3 stories;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_347_1" id="target_note_LCL280_347_1"><sup>1</sup></a> in the top story of this there were placed scorpions and catapults,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_347_2" id="target_note_LCL280_347_2"><sup>2</sup></a> in the lower stories a large quantity of water was stored to extinguish whatever flames should be kindled. Now there was constructed in the tortoise a machine for the ram, which in Greek is called <span class="italic">criodocis.</span> In this was fixed a roller finished on the lathe, on which the ram was placed, and being drawn forwards and backwards by ropes, produced great effects. This was covered with raw hides in the same way as the tower.</p>
<p>7. The method of constructing the Borer he described as follows: the machine itself was like the Tortoise, having, in the middle, a channel resting upon uprights (as is customary in catapults or balistas) 50 cubits long and a cubit high, on which there was placed a windlass crosswise. At the front were two pulleys, right and left, by which the beam with its iron front<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_347_3" id="target_note_LCL280_347_3"><sup>3</sup></a> was moved along the channel. Under the beam in the channel itself rollers were fixed at frequent intervals and rendered its movements quicker and more violent. Above the beam
