<h3><span class="sc">on the foundations of temples</span></h3>
<p>1. <span class="sc">Let</span> the foundations of those works be dug from a solid site and to a solid base if it can be found, as much as shall seem proportionate to the size of the work; and let the whole site be worked into a structure as solid as possible. And let walls be built, upon the ground under the columns, one-half thicker than the columns are to be, so that the lower portions are stronger than the higher; and these are called the <span class="italic">stereobate,</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL251_181_3" id="target_note_LCL251_181_3"><sup>3</sup></a> for they receive the loads. And let not the projections of the base mouldings proceed beyond the bed. Further, the thickness of the wall is to be kept above in the same manner. The spaces between the columns are to be arched over, or made solid by being rammed down, so that the columns may be held apart. 2. But if a solid foundation is not found, and the site is loose earth right down, or marshy, then it is to be excavated and cleared and re-made with piles<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL251_181_4" id="target_note_LCL251_181_4"><sup>4</sup></a> of alder or of olive or charred oak, and the piles are to be driven close together by machinery, and the intervals between are to be filled with charcoal.
