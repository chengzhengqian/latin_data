they are let down under the water, owing to the transparent thinness of the element, they send back images<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_23_1" id="target_note_LCL280_23_1"><sup>1</sup></a> flowing from their substance, which float at the topmost level of the water, and being there disturbed, they seem to the eyes to produce a broken appearance of the oars. 3. Now whether we see by the impression of images upon the eye, or by the effusion of rays from the eyes, as the natural philosophers teach us, both explanations suggest that the vision of the eyes gives false judgments. 4. Since, therefore, what is real seems false, and some things are approved by the eyes as other than they really are, I do not think it should be doubtful that we ought to add or subtract, as needed by the nature or requirements of our sites: but this is done by native skill and not by rule alone.</p>
<p>5. We must therefore first determine the method of the symmetries, from which these modifications are to be correctly deduced. Then the unit<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_23_2" id="target_note_LCL280_23_2"><sup>2</sup></a> of length for the site of the future work is to be set forth. When the magnitude of this is once determined, there will follow upon it the adjustment of the proportions to the decor so that the appearance of eurythmy<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_23_3" id="target_note_LCL280_23_3"><sup>3</sup></a> may be convincing to the observer. How this result is to be attained, it is now my duty to show, and I will first speak on the right arrangement of the courtyards of houses.</p>
