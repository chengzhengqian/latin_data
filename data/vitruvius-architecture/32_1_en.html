Now there shall be on a levelled surface a centre with the letter <span class="sc">a</span>; the shadow before midday of the indicator, with <span class="sc">b</span>; and from the centre marked a the compass is opened to the point of shadow marked <span class="sc">b</span>, and a circle is to be drawn. The indicator being replaced where it was before, we must wait until the shadow diminishes, and again by increasing makes the shadow after midday equal to that before midday and touches the circle at the letter <span class="sc">c.</span> Then from <span class="sc">b</span> and from c let the intersection <span class="sc">d</span> be described with the compasses; then through the intersection <span class="sc">d</span> and the centre, let a line be carried through to the furthest limit, and on this line will be the index of the southern and northern regions. 13. Then the sixteenth part of the whole circle is to be taken with the compass, and the point of the compass is to be put on the meridian line where it touches the circumference at <span class="sc">e</span>, and a mark is to be made right and left at <span class="sc">gh.</span> Also in the northern part, the point of the compass is to be placed on the circumference and the northern line where is the letter <span class="sc">f</span>, and a mark is to be made right and left at I and <span class="sc">k.</span> And from <span class="sc">G</span> and <span class="sc">k</span> and from <span class="sc">h</span> to I, lines are to be drawn through the centre. So the space from <span class="sc">g</span> to <span class="sc">h</span> will be the space of the Auster and of the southern region; likewise the space from <span class="sc">i</span> to <span class="sc">k</span> will be of the Septentrio.
