<p>The doors are to be so put together that the hinge stiles<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL251_237_1" id="target_note_LCL251_237_1"><sup>1</sup></a> are 1/12 of the breadth of the whole opening. The panels between the two stiles are to have 3 parts out of 12 in width. 5. For the rails, the distribution shall be such that, taking the height to be of 5 parts, two are assigned to the upper portion, 3 to the lower portion. Let the middle rails be placed above the centre; of the others one set are at the top of the doors, the others at the bottom. The width of the rail is to be one third of the panel; the cymatium 1/6 of the rail. The breadth of the inner stiles is to be half the rail, and the cover-moulding
2/3 of the rail. The stiles against the architrave are made one half the rail. If the doors are folding, the heights remain the same; but let the breadth of the opening be increased. If the doors are fourfold, let the height be increased.</p>
<p>6. Attic doors are made of the same proportions as the Doric, the fasciae, however, are carried round under the cymatia in the architraves, and ought to be so arranged that of the architrave, exclusive of the cymatium, they have 2 parts out of 7. They are to be without lattice-work and are not to have hinges folding inwards, but to fold outwards on sockets.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL251_237_2" id="target_note_LCL251_237_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
