For when a pipe is made of a sheet of lead 50 inches wide, it is called a fifty-inch pipe, and similarly the rest.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_185_2" id="target_note_LCL280_185_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>5. When, however, an aqueduct is made with lead pipes it is to have the following arrangement. If from the fountain head there is a fall to the city, and the intervening hills are not so high as to interrupt the supply, and if there are valleys, we must build up the pipes to a level as in the case of open channels. If the way round the hills is not long, a circuit is to be used; if the valleys are wide-spreading, the course will be down the hill, and when it reaches the bottom, it is carried on a low substructure so that it may be levelled as far as possible. This will form a U-shaped bend which the Greeks call <span class="italic">koilia.</span> When the bend comes uphill after a gentle swelling spread over the long space of the bend, the water is to be forced to the height of the top of the hill.</p>
<p>6. But if the bend is not made use of in the valleys, or if the pipe is not brought up to a level, and there is an elbow,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_185_3" id="target_note_LCL280_185_3"><sup>3</sup></a> the water will burst through and break the joints of the pipes. Further, stand-pipes are to be made in the bend, by which the force of the air may be relaxed. In this way the supply of water by lead pipes may be carried out in the best manner, because
