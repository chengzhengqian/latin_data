Gypsum should not be employed, but selected marble of uniform texture, lest the gypsum by setting too soon prevent the work from drying uniformly. Further, we must avoid in these arched ceilings the old arrangements, because, in them, the projecting surfaces of the cornices overhang dangerously with their heavy weight. 4. Now there are other and more elaborate forms of cornice. In apartments, however, where there is a fire and lamps, the cornices should be plain so that they may be the more easily dusted.
