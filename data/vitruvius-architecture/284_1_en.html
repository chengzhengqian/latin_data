<h3><span class="sc">on the principles of dialling</span></h3>
<p>1. <span class="sc">We</span> must separate from other astronomical studies the description of the shortening and marking of the days, month by month, on the dial. For the sun, in his revolution, at the time of the spring and autumn equinoxes, casts a shadow, in the latitude of Rome, which is equal to eight-ninths of the height of the gnomon. Further, at Athens the shadows are three-quarters of the gnomon, at Rhodes five-sevenths,
at Tarentum nine-elevenths, at Alexandria three-fifths; and in other places the shadows of the gnomon at the equinox are found to differ by different amounts, in accordance with the Nature of Things.</p>
<p>2. Therefore in whatever places dials are to be set out, the length of the shadow at the equinox is to be taken. If, as at Rome, there are nine parts of the gnomon, and eight parts of the shadow, let a line<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_249_1" id="target_note_LCL280_249_1"><sup>1</sup></a> be drawn on the level, and from the middle let there be set upright and with a set-square, a perpendicular which is called the gnomon; and on the line where the level surface is, let nine parts be measured starting from the foot of the gnomon; where the end of the ninth part is marked, let a centre be taken and indicated by the letter <span class="sc">a</span>; and extending the compasses from that centre to a point in the line, to be indicated by the letter <span class="sc">b</span>, let the circumference of the circle be described which we call the meridian.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_249_2" id="target_note_LCL280_249_2"><sup>2</sup></a> 3. Then of the nine parts which are between the centre of the gnomon and the point on the level line, let eight be taken and
