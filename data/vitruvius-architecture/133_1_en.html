voice will not be checked. 5. Many and spacious stepped passages must be arranged between the seats; but the upper ones ought to be discontinuous with the lower. Everywhere, each passage (upper or lower) must be continuous and straight without bends; so that when the audience is dismissed from the spectacle, it may not be cramped, but may find everywhere separate and uninterrupted exits.</p>
<p>Great care is also to be taken that the place chosen does not deaden the sound, but that the voice can range in it with the utmost clearness. And this can be brought about if a site is chosen where the passage of sound is not hindered. 6. Now the voice is like a flowing breath of air, and is actual<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL251_267_1" id="target_note_LCL251_267_1"><sup>1</sup></a> when perceived by the sense of hearing. It is moved along innumerable undulations of circles; as when<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL251_267_2" id="target_note_LCL251_267_2"><sup>2</sup></a> we throw a stone into standing water. Innumerable circular undulations arise spreading from the centre as wide as possible. And they extend unless the limited space hinders, or some obstruction which does not allow the directions of the waves to reach the outlets. And so when they are interrupted by obstacles, the first waves flowing back disturb the directions of those which follow. 7. In the same way the voice in like manner moves circle fashion. But while in water the circles move horizontally only, the voice both moves horizontally and rises vertically by stages.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL251_267_3" id="target_note_LCL251_267_3"><sup>3</sup></a> Therefore as is the case with the direction of the waves in water, so with the voice when no obstacle interrupts the first wave, this in turn does not disturb the second and later
