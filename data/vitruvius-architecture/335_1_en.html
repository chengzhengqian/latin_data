in which the axles of the wheels turn, and are sheathed in iron plates. And these timbers are to be constructed with pivots and holes whereby levers are passed through and cause them to turn, so that the machines can move front or back, right or left, or sideways as may be necessary, by the turning of the wheels by help of the timbers.</p>
<p>2. Let two beams be laid on the base projecting 6 feet on either side, and on the projecting parts let there be fixed two other beams projecting in front 12 feet and with the thickness and breadth as desscribed
for the base. On this frame let there be put up frame-posts 9 feet high not including the tenons, 15 inches square and 18 inches apart. Let these be joined above by beams mortised together. Above the beams let there be fixed rafters locked in one another by tenons and rising to a height of 9 feet. Above the rafters is a squared ridge-piece by which they are to be joined together. 3. Further, they are to be held together by purlins and covered by planks, best if of holm-oak, otherwise of wood which is very strong, but not of pine or alder; for these are brittle and inflammable. Around the framework are to be placed wattles, closely interwoven, of thin twigs which are to be as green as possible. The whole machine is to be covered<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_351_1" id="target_note_LCL280_351_1"><sup>1</sup></a> with double oxhide very raw sewn together and filled in with sea-weed or straw which is soaked in vinegar. For by these expedients the shots of the balistae and the danger of fire will be repelled.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_351_2" id="target_note_LCL280_351_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
