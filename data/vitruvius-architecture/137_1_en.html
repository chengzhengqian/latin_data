6. But those sounds which shift, gain various qualities; for they have increasing intervals and distances. Thus the parhypatè which in the enharmonic is half a semitone from the hypatè, has a semitone when it is changed to the chromatic. What is called lichanos in the enharmonic kind, is distant a semitone from the hypatè; transferred to the chromatic, it advances two semitones; in the diatonic, it is distant three semitones. Thus the 10 sounds, because of their transpositions in the three scales, produce a triple variety of modulation. 7. Now the tetrachords are five: the first is the lowest which in Greek is called <span class="italic">hypaton</span>; the second is the middle which is called <span class="italic">meson</span>; the third which is joined to these is called <span class="italic">synhēmmenon</span>; the fourth being separated is called <span class="italic">diezeugmenon</span>; the fifth which is the highest is called in Greek <span class="italic">hyperbolaeon.</span> The concords (in Greek <span class="italic">symphoniae</span>) which the human voice can modulate are six: diatessaron (fourth); diapente (fifth); diapason (octave); disdiatessaron (octave and fourth); disdiapente (octave and fifth); disdiapason (two octaves). 8. These have taken their names from numbers. For when the voice has rested in one fixed sound, and then modulates and changes from itself, and comes to the fourth sound it is called diatessaron; when it comes to the fifth, it is called diapente; [to the eighth, diapason; to the eleventh, diapason with diatessaron; to the twelfth, diapason with diapente to the fifteenth disdiapason], 9. For concords cannot arise between two intervals, when the sound of strings or the song of the voice is uttered, nor between three or six or seven; but, as we wrote above, the diatessaron and diapente up to
