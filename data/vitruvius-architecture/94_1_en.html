volutes, following a perpendicular from the edge of the abacus. Then of nine parts and a half, one part and a half are to be left as the thickness of the abacus, and the remaining eight parts are to be allotted to the volutes. 6. Then within a vertical line which is let fall at the extreme corner of the abacus, let fall another line at the distance of one part and a half. Next let these lines be so divided that four parts and a half are left under the abacus. Then that point which divides the four and a half and the three and a half is the centre of the eye of the volute: and let there be drawn from that centre a complete circle with a diameter of one part out of the eight parts. That will be the magnitude of the eye. Through the centre let there be drawn a vertical diameter. Then, beginning from the top under the abacus, let the radius be successively diminished by half the diameter of the eye in describing the quadrants, until it comes into the quadrant which is under the abacus.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL251_189_1" id="target_note_LCL251_189_1"><sup>1</sup></a> 7. Now the height of the capital is to be so arranged that of the nine and a half parts, three parts are below the astragal at the top of the shaft. The remaining part is for the cymatium, when the abacus and channel are taken away. The projection of the cymatium beyond the abacus is to be the size of the eye. Let the bands of the pillows<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL251_189_2" id="target_note_LCL251_189_2"><sup>2</sup></a> have the following projection: one point of the compasses is placed in the centre of the eye, and the other point is taken to the top of the cymatium; the circle thus described will mark the furthest part of the pillow band. The axes of the volutes should not be further apart than the diameter of the eye, and the volutes
