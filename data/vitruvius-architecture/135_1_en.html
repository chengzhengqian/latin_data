sound and the next; as when we say: <span class="italic">sol lux flos vox.</span> For now it is not perceived whence it begins nor where it ceases. But that it passes from high to low, and from low to high, is heard by the ears. The case is opposite with intervals. For when the voice is modulated, the voice in changing is directed first to one determinate sound and then to another. Doing this often backwards and forwards it appears consistent<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL251_271_1" id="target_note_LCL251_271_1"><sup>1</sup></a> to the sense of hearing, as when in singing we modulate the voice in various ways. When therefore the voice is modulated by intervals, the manifest limits of the notes make clear where it begins and where it breaks off; but the notes within the intervals, although clear in themselves, are not heard.</p>
<p>3. The kinds of modulation are three: first that which the Greeks call <span class="italic">harmonia</span>; second <span class="italic">chroma</span>; third <span class="italic">diatonon.</span> Now harmonic modulation<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL251_271_2" id="target_note_LCL251_271_2"><sup>2</sup></a> is artificially constructed; singing in this style has a very solemn and impressive influence. Chromatic<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL251_271_3" id="target_note_LCL251_271_3"><sup>3</sup></a> modulation, by the refinement and “closeness” of its transitions, produces an impression of more sweetness. The diatonic modulation is closer to nature and has a more easy distance of its intervals. In these three scales, the arrangements of the tetrachords
differ. The harmonic scale has two tones in the tetrachord and two quarter-tones. (Now two quarter-tones make a semitone.) The chromatic tetrachord<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL251_271_4" id="target_note_LCL251_271_4"><sup>4</sup></a> has two consecutive semitones and the third interval is of three semitones. The diatonic tetrachord<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL251_271_4" id="target_note_LCL251_271_4"><sup>4</sup></a> has two consecutive tones, and the third interval—a semitone—completes the amount of the
