not only to their fellow-citizens but also to all mankind. Those who from tender years are satisfied thence with abundance of knowledge, acquire the best habits of thought, institute civilised manners, equal rights, laws without which no state can be secure. 3. Since, therefore, such boons have been conferred on individuals and communities by wise writers, not only do I think that palms and crowns should be awarded to them, but that triumphs also should be decreed and that they should be canonised in the mansions of the gods.</p>
<p>I will propose, as examples taken from a great number, several conceptions of a few thinkers which have helped the furnishing of human life, in order that the consideration of these may lead mankind to confess that honours should be conferred upon their inventors. 4. And first, out of the many and most useful theorems of Plato,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_199_1" id="target_note_LCL280_199_1"><sup>1</sup></a> I will set out one with its demonstration. If there is a square area, or field with equal sides, and it is necessary to double it, there will be required some number which cannot be found by multiplication; this is determined by a perfect geometrical figure. Here is the demonstration. A square space which is ten feet long and wide makes 100 feet. If then it is necessary that it should be made double—of 200 feet—and also to make it of equal sides, we must inquire how long the side of that square is to be made, so that it may produce 200 feet, corresponding to the doubling of the area. No one can discover this by arithmetic. For if the side be 14 feet, then the multiplication gives 196 feet; if 15, then 225 feet.</p>
