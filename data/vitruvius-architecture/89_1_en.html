angle columns also must be made thicker by the fiftieth part of their diameter, because they are cut into by the air and appear more slender to the spectators. Therefore what the eye cheats us of, must be made up by calculation. 12. The contractions, however, in the topmost necking of the columns, it seems, should be so made that from the smallest dimension up to fifteen feet, the lowest diameter should be divided into six parts and the top should be of five of those parts. Also in those which shall be from fifteen feet to twenty feet, the lowest part of the shaft is to be divided into six and a half parts; and of those parts five and a half are to be the upper diameter of the column. Also in those which shall be from twenty feet to thirty feet, let the lowest part of the shaft be divided into seven parts, and let the top contraction be made six of them. In the column which shall be from thirty to forty feet, let the lowest diameter be divided into seven and a half parts; of these let the column have six and a half at the top as the amount of contraction. Those which shall be from forty to fifty feet are also to be divided into eight parts, and these are to be contracted to seven at the top of the shaft under the capital. Further, if any are higher, let the contractions be determined proportionately in the same way. 13. It is on account of the variation in height that these adjustments are added to the diameters to meet the glance of the eye as it rises. For the sight follows gracious contours; and unless we flatter its pleasure, by proportionate alterations of the modules (so that by adjustment there is added the amount to which it suffers illusion), an uncouth and ungracious aspect will be
