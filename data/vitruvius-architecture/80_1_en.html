these, ancient painters and famous sculptors have attained great and unbounded distinction. 3. In like fashion the members of temples ought to have dimensions of their several parts answering suitably to the general sum of their whole magnitude. Now the navel is naturally the exact centre of the body. For if a man lies on his back with hands and feet outspread, and the centre of a circle is placed on his navel, his fingers and toes will be touched by the circumference. Also a square will be found described within the figure, in the same way as a round figure is produced. For if we measure from the sole of the foot to the top of the head, and apply the measure to the outstretched hands, the breadth will be found equal to the height, just like sites which are squared by rule. 4. Therefore if Nature has planned the human body so that the members correspond in their proportions to its complete configuration, the ancients seem to have had reason in determining that in the execution of their works they should observe an exact adjustment of the several members to the general pattern of the plan. Therefore, since in all their works they handed down orders,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL251_161_1" id="target_note_LCL251_161_1"><sup>1</sup></a> they did so especially in building temples, the excellences and the faults of which usually endure for ages.</p>

And these they grouped into the perfect number<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL251_161_2" id="target_note_LCL251_161_2"><sup>2</sup></a> which the Greeks call <span class="italic">teleon.</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL251_161_3" id="target_note_LCL251_161_3"><sup>3</sup></a> Now the ancients
