menōn at an interval of one fourth from the last; third from the end at the paramesè (another fourth); the fourth set of vases at the nētè synhemmenōn; the fifth at the mesè (interval of a fourth); the sixth set at the hypatè mesōn (interval of a fourth); in the middle one vase at the hypatè hypatōn. 3. Thus by this calculation the voice, spreading from the stage as from a centre and striking by its contact the hollows of the several vases, will arouse an increased clearness of sound, and, by the concord, a consonance harmonising with itself. But if the theatre is larger, then the height is to be divided into 4 parts, so that three lines of cavities are drawn crosswise, one enharmonic, a second chromatic, the third diatonic. The first from the bottom is to be arranged for the enharmonic kind as described above for the smaller theatre. 4. In the middle series on the extreme wings, the first vases are to be put with a note of the chromatic hyperbolaeon;
in the second cavities at the interval of a fourth, the chromatic diezeugmenon; in the third the chromatic synhēmmenon; in the fourth cavities, at the interval of a fourth, the chromatic meson; in the fifth at the interval of a fourth the chromatic hypaton; in the sixth the paramesè, which has a fifth interval to the chromatic hyperbolaeon, and an interval of a fourth to the chromatic synhēmmenon. 5. In the centre nothing is to be put, because no other quality of sound has a share in the concords of the chromatic kind.
