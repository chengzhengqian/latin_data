arches are constructed with voussoirs and with joints directed to a centre, the end piers in the buildings are to be set out of greater width, so that they may be stronger and resist when the voussoirs, being pressed down by the weight of the walling owing to the jointing, thrust towards the centre and push out the imposts. Therefore if the angle piers are of wide dimensions, they will restrain the thrust and give stability to the buildings.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_55_1a" id="target_note_LCL280_55_1a"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>5. When proper attention has been given herein that such care be taken, we must not less be on our guard that every part of a building maintains its perpendicular and that no part leans over. But the greatest care must be taken in the substructures, because, in these, immense damage is caused by the earth piled against them. For it cannot remain of the same weight as it usually has in the summer: it swells in the winter by absorbing water from the rains. Consequently by its weight and expansion it bursts and thrusts out the retaining walls.</p>
<p>6. To avoid this damage, therefore, we must proceed as follows. The thickness of the walling must answer to the amount of earth. Next, supporting walls or buttresses are to be carried up at the same time. The interval between them is to be the same as the height of the substructure, and the thickness that of the substructure. They are to project at the base in accordance with the thickness determined for the substructure. Then they are to be gradually diminished, so that at the top they may project as much as the thickness of the walling.</p>
