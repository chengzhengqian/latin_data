Therefore if we take the region in the south which is nearest to the lowest point, the nations which are under that quarter, have vocal sounds which are thin and very shrill, because of the small height towards the limit of the universe, like the string of the instrument which is next to the angle. Next to this, the other strings so far as Greece which is in the middle, produce by their relaxation, the pitch of the voice for each nation. Further, rising regularly from the middle to the height in the furthest north, the national pitch is naturally produced with deeper tones. Thus the whole system of the world because of the slope from south to north seems to be most agreeably adjusted to harmony by the temperature of the sun.</p>

We can observe by experiment that heavier and deeper effects arise in damp places, and lighter and shriller
