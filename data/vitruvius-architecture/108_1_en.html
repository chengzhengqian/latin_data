Greeks give the name of <span class="italic">opae</span> to the beds of beams and rafters; as our people call them hollow mortices. So the space between the two opae is called <span class="italic">metopa</span> among the Greeks.</p>

And just as in the Doric order the mutules have been the representation of the projecting principal rafters, so, in the case of Ionic dentils, they also imitate the projection of the ordinary rafters. Therefore in Greek works no one puts dentils under a mutule.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL251_217_1" id="target_note_LCL251_217_1"><sup>1</sup></a> For ordinary rafters cannot be put beneath principals.
