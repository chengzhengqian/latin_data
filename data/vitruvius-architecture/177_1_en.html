<h3><span class="sc">on the aspect of the several apartments</span></h3>
<p>1. <span class="sc">Now</span> we will explain the adjustments by which the various apartments may look out suitably to their proper aspects.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_35_1" id="target_note_LCL280_35_1"><sup>1</sup></a> The baths and winter dining-rooms should look towards the winter setting sun, because there is need of the evening light. Besides, when the setting sun faces us with its splendour, it reflects the heat and renders this aspect warmer in the evening. Private rooms<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_35_2" id="target_note_LCL280_35_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and libraries should look to the east, for their purpose demands the morning light. Further, the books in libraries will not decay. For in apartments which look to the south and west, books are damaged by the bookworm and by damp, which are caused by the moist winds on their approach, and they make the papyrus rolls mouldy by diffusing moist air.</p>
<p>2. The spring and autumn dining-rooms should look to the east. For exposed as they are to the light, the full power of the sun moving to the west renders them temperate at the time when the need to use them is customary. The summer dining-rooms
should have a northern aspect. For while the other aspects, at the solstice, are rendered oppressive by the heat, the northern aspect, because it is turned away from the sun’s course, is always cool, and is healthy<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_35_3" id="target_note_LCL280_35_3"><sup>3</sup></a> and pleasant in use. Not less should the picture galleries, the weaving-rooms of the embroiderers, the studios of painters, have a north aspect, so that, in the steady light, the colours in their work may remain of unimpaired quality.</p>
