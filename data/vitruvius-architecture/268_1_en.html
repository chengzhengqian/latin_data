through its orbit from the sign in which it began, on the twenty-eighth day and about an hour more, and returning to that sign completes the lunar month.</p>
<p>6. The sun, journeying for a month, passes over the space of a sign which is the twelfth part of the heavens. Thus in twelve months he traverses the distance of twelve signs, and when he returns to the sign from which he started, he completes the space of the revolving year. Hence the sun measures once in twelve months the circle which the moon in the same number of months runs through thirteen times. The planets Mercury and Venus, with their orbits, encircling the sun’s rays as on a centre, retreat backwards and delay their course;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_217_1" id="target_note_LCL280_217_1"><sup>1</sup></a> thus because of their orbit they delay at the nodes<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_217_2" id="target_note_LCL280_217_2"><sup>2</sup></a> in their course through the signs.</p>
<p>7. This is best seen from the planet Venus, because when it follows the sun it appears in the sky after sunset, and brightly shining is called the Evening Star.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_217_3" id="target_note_LCL280_217_3"><sup>3</sup></a> At other times it precedes the sun, and rising before the dawn is called Lucifer. Hence sometimes they delay several days in a sign, sometimes they enter more quickly into another sign. Therefore because they do not spend uniformly a fixed number of days in the several signs, they make up by quicker movements the amount they previously delayed; so that while they delay in some signs, none the less, when they escape the compulsion of delay, they quickly make up their proper course.</p>
<p>8. The planet Mercury so completes its path in the firmament that, traversing the spaces of the
