three layers of wood jointed together with alternating tenons and secured with plates of chilled iron.</p>
<p>3. They revolved in blocks (or as they are called <span class="italic">amaxopodes</span>). Above the cross-pieces of the floor which was above the base, posts were erected 18 feet high, 9 inches broad and 8 inches thick, and one foot 9 inches apart. Above the posts, beams one foot 9 inches wide and 9 inches thick were carried round and held the framing together. Above the framing struts<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_355_1" id="target_note_LCL280_355_1"><sup>1</sup></a> were raised with a height of 12 feet; above the struts a beam was fixed which received the joints of the struts. They had side-pieces placed obliquely on which boarding was carried to protect the lower parts.</p>
<p>4. The machine had in the middle aisle a floor upon joists, where the scorpions and catapults were placed. There were also set up two upright pieces jointed together, 45 feet high, 18 inches wide and 9 inches thick, joined at the top with a dovetailed cross-piece, and a second half-way up, mortised between the two uprights and secured with iron plates. Above this, between the uprights and the cross-piece, a wooden frame was placed consisting of blocks and firmly held by clamps. In this frame two axles turned on the lathe were placed, and the ram was controlled by ropes attached to the axles.</p>
<p>5. Above the heads of those who worked the ram, a shelter was placed built after the fashion of a turret, so that the two soldiers standing in safety could look out and report the movements of the enemy.
