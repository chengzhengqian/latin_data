<p>5. Just as also the steersman of a great merchant vessel holds the handle of the tiller (which is called <span class="italic">oiax</span> by the Greeks) with only one hand, and moves it skilfully round the centre where the fulcrum is tightly set, and guides the ship laden with an abundant or indeed enormous<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_299_1" id="target_note_LCL280_299_1"><sup>1</sup></a> cargo of merchandise and timber.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_299_2" id="target_note_LCL280_299_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Further, when the sails are only half-mast high, the ship cannot run swiftly; but when the yard-arms are drawn up to the tops of the masts, the ship sails with a more vehement course, because the sails take the wind, not near the foot of the mast (which is like a fulcrum), but at the mast-head from which the distance is greater.</p>
<p>6. Therefore just as when a lever is put under a load and pressed down about the middle, it is moved with difficulty, but when the longer arm is pressed down from the top, it easily raises the load; so when the sails are set half-mast high, they are less effective, but when they are set at the mast-head at a greater distance from the centre, without any further rising of the wind, with the summit as fulcrum, they cause the ship to sail a stronger course. When also the oars of a ship are tied to the tholes with loops, and pushed backwards and forwards, the ends of the blades,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_299_3" id="target_note_LCL280_299_3"><sup>3</sup></a> moving at a distance from the centre in the waves of the sea, drive the ship with a mighty impulse straight through the foam, as the bows cleave the yielding waters.</p>
