<h3><span class="sc">on the use of marble</span></h3>
<p>1. <span class="sc">Marble</span> is not found of the same kind in all regions. In some places, blocks occur with shining flakes, as of salt. And these being crushed and ground are of use. But where there are no such supplies, marble-rubble, or splinters as they are called, which the marble workers throw down from their benches, are crushed and ground.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_111_1a" id="target_note_LCL280_111_1a"><sup>1</sup></a> This material when sifted the plasterers use in their work. Elsewhere, for example between the boundaries of Magnesia and Ephesus, there are places where it is dug up ready for use, and need not be ground nor sifted.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_111_2" id="target_note_LCL280_111_2"><sup>2</sup></a> It is as fine as if it had been crushed by hand and sifted.</p>
<p>There are other coloured materials which occur in a natural state in certain places, and are dug up from mines. Yet others are composed of different substances and are treated and blended so as to serve the same<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_111_3" id="target_note_LCL280_111_3"><sup>3</sup></a> purposes in buildings.</p>
