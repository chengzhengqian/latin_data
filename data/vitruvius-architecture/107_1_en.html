forward, to the line and perpendicular of the walls. But since this appearance was ungraceful, they fixed tablets shaped as triglyphs now are, against the cutoff beams, and painted them with blue wax, in order that the cutoff beams might be concealed so as not to offend the eyes. Thus in Doric structures, the divisions of the beams being hidden began to have the arrangement of the triglyphs, and, between the beams, of metopes. 3. Subsequently other architects in other works carried forward over the triglyphs the projecting rafters, and trimmed the projections. Hence just as triglyphs came by the treatment of the beams, so from the projections of the rafters the detail of the mutules under the cornices was invented. Thus generally in buildings of stone and marble the mutules are modelled with sloping carving; and this imitates the rafters. For they are necessarily put sloping because of the rainfall. Therefore in the Doric style the detail both of the triglyphs and of the mutules arose from this imitation of timber work.</p>
<p>4. For it cannot be that triglyphs are representations of windows (as some have mistakenly said). For triglyphs are placed at the angles of the front, and over the centre of columns; where generally it is impossible for windows to be made. For the bond at the angles of buildings is destroyed, if window lights are left there. And also if window lights are considered to have been where now triglyphs are placed, in the same way dentils in Ionic buildings will seem to have taken the place of windows. For the intervals, which are both between dentils and between triglyphs, are called <span class="italic">metopae.</span> For the
