most finely tenuous of all sources; then filtering through moving air, it liquefies in storms and so reaches the earth. Further, it is not often that rain showers gather in the plains, but rather on the mountains or near them. For moisture rising from the earth being moved by the rising sun at dawn, thrusts the air into whatever part of the sky it tends. Thereupon the moisture thus moved, because of the vacuum, receives behind it the waves of rushing air. 2. Now the air which rushes on, thrusting the moisture in whatever direction, by the violence of the blast causes the rising force and undulations of the winds. Whithersoever the wind carries the massed moisture from springs, from rivers and marshes and the sea, the moisture under the sunâ€™s influence<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_145_1" id="target_note_LCL280_145_1"><sup>1</sup></a> is collected and drawn forth, and the clouds are raised on high. Then the clouds, supported on the wave of air, meet the resistance of the mountains and, becoming liquid in rain-storms, by their fullness and weight, break and their water is poured over the fields.</p>
<p>3. Now vapour and clouds and moisture seem to rise from the earth, for this reason that the earth contains both fervid heat and huge blasts of air, coldness and a large amount of water. Hence when the world is cooled by night, and the rising sun touches it by its force, and gusts of wind rise up through the darkness, the clouds rise on high from the damp places. In that the air warmed by the sun through its effect raises moisture from the earth, we can find a parallel in the baths. 4. For the vaulted chambers<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_145_2" id="target_note_LCL280_145_2"><sup>2</sup></a> which enclose a hot bath cannot
