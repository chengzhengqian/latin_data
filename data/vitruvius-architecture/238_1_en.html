because they have the pores of the vessels saturated with hard, thick and cold particles.</p>
<p>6. There is a kind of water which has pores insufficiently clear; a foam floats on the top, in colour like blue glass. This is especially seen at Athens where conduits<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_157_1" id="target_note_LCL280_157_1"><sup>1</sup></a> from such places and fountains are taken to the city and the Piraeus. No one drinks from it because of the reason given, but they use it for baths and so forth. They drink from wells and thus avoid its ill effect. This cannot be avoided at Troezene, because no other water is found there at all, except what is furnished by polluted springs; therefore in that city either all or the greatest part suffer from their feet. In the Cilician city Tarsus there is a river, Cydnus by name, in which gouty persons bathe their legs to relieve the pain.</p>
