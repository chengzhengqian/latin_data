<p>1. <span class="sc">There</span> is also a kind of powder which, by nature, produces wonderful results. It is found in the neighbourhood of Baiae<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL251_101_1" id="target_note_LCL251_101_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and in the lands of the municipalities round Mount Vesuvius. This being mixed with lime and rubble, not only furnishes strength to other buildings, but also, when piers<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL251_101_2" id="target_note_LCL251_101_2"><sup>2</sup></a> are built in the sea, they set under water. Now this seems to happen for this reason: that under these mountainous regions there are both hot earth and many springs. And these would not be unless deep down they had huge blazing fires of sulphur, alum or pitch. Therefore the fire and vapour of flame within, flowing through the cracks, makes that earth light. And the tufa which is found to come up there is free from moisture. Therefore, when three substances formed in like manner by the violence of fire come into one mixture, they suddenly take up water and cohere together. They are quickly hardened by the moisture and made solid, and can be dissolved neither by the waves nor the power of water. 2. But that there are fervent heats in these districts may be proved by this circumstance. In the hills of Baiae which belong to Cumae<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL251_101_3" id="target_note_LCL251_101_3"><sup>3</sup></a> sites are excavated for sweating-rooms.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL251_101_4" id="target_note_LCL251_101_4"><sup>4</sup></a> In these hot vapour rising deep down perforates the soil by the violence of its heat, and passing through it rises in these places, and so produces striking advantages in sweating-rooms.
