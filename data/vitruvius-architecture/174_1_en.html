be given to the alcove. When the breadth is from 40 to 60, two-fifths are to be assigned to the alcove. For the smaller atria cannot have the same kind of symmetry as the larger. For if we use the symmetry of the larger atria in the smaller, it cannot be useful for the alcove or the wing. But if we use the symmetry of the smaller in the larger, the details will be huge and monstrous. Therefore I thought that according to their kinds the exact dimensions should be registered with a view both to use and to effect. 6. The height of the alcove to the cornice is to be one-eighth more than its breadth. The panelled ceiling is to be raised higher than the cornices by one-third of the breadth.</p>
<p>The main entrance for smaller atria is to be two-thirds
of the width of the alcove; for larger atria, one-half. The portraits with their ornaments are to be fixed above at a height equal to the breadth of the alae.</p>
<p>The relation of the breadth to the height of the doors is to be in the Doric manner for Doric buildings, in the Ionic, for Ionic buildings, as in the case of Greek doorways of which the symmetrical relations have been set out in the fourth book.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_29_1" id="target_note_LCL280_29_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>The width of the opening of the compluvium is to be not less than a fourth, nor more than a third, of the width of the atrium; the length, in proportion to the atrium.</p>
<p>7. The peristyles<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_29_2" id="target_note_LCL280_29_2"><sup>2</sup></a> lie crosswise, and should be one-third wider than they are deep. The height of the columns is to be the same as the breadth of the colonnade of the peristyle. The inter-columniations
