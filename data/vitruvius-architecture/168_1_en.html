Southern nations also, owing to the rarity of the atmosphere, with minds rendered acute by the heat, are more readily and swiftly moved to the imagination of expedients; but northern peoples steeped in a thick climate amid reluctant air, are chilled by the damp, and have sluggish minds. We can observe this in the case of snakes: they move quickest when the heat has drawn away the damp with its chilling effect; but in the rainy and wintry seasons they are chilled by the change of climate, and are sluggish and motionless. Hence we need not wonder if warm air renders the human mind more acute, and a cool air impedes.</p>
