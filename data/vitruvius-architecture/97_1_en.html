sima,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL251_195_1" id="target_note_LCL251_195_1"><sup>1</sup></a> is to be equal to the middle fascia of the architrave. The projection of the cornice with the dentil is to be made equal to the height from the frieze to the top of the cymatium of the cornice; and generally all projections have a more graceful appearance when they are equal to the height of the feature. 12. The height of the tympanum which is in the pediment is to be such, that the whole front of the cornice from the outside of the cymatia is to be measured into nine parts; and of these one is to be set up in the middle for the summit of the tympanum. The architraves and hypotrachelia<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL251_195_2" id="target_note_LCL251_195_2"><sup>2</sup></a> of the columns are vertically under it. The cornices above the tympana are to be made equal to those below, omitting the simae. Above the cornices the simae, which the Greeks call <span class="italic">epaietides,</span> are to be made higher by one-eighth than the coronae. The angle acroteria<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL251_195_3" id="target_note_LCL251_195_3"><sup>3</sup></a> are to be as high as the middle of the tympanum; the middle ones are to be one-eighth higher than those at the angles.</p>
<p>13. All the features which are to be above the capitals of the columns, that is to say, architraves, friezes, cornices, tympana, pediments, acroteria, are to be inclined towards their fronts by a twelfth part of their height; because when we stand against the fronts, if two lines are drawn from the eye,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL251_195_4" id="target_note_LCL251_195_4"><sup>4</sup></a> and one touches the lowest part of the work, and the other the highest, that which touches the highest, will be the longer. Thus because the longer line of vision goes to the upper part, it gives the appearance of leaning backwards. When however, as written above, the line is inclined to the front, then the
