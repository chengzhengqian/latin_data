The remaining parts in the whole round, three on the right and three on the left, are to be distributed equally, so that equal divisions of the eight winds are marked out in the figure. Then the angles between two quarters of the winds will determine the laying out both of the streets and of the alleys. 8. For by these methods and this division, troublesome winds will be excluded from the dwellings and the streets. For when the quarters of the city are planned to meet the winds full, the rush of air and the frequent breezes from the open space of the sky will move with mightier power, confined as they are in the jaws of the alleys. Wherefore the directions of the streets are to avoid the quarters of the winds, so that when the winds come up against the corners of the blocks of buildings they may be broken, driven back and dissipated.</p>
<p>9. Perhaps those who know many names of the winds will wonder because only eight winds have been described by us to exist. But if they perceive that the circumference of the world, ascertained by the sunâ€™s course, and the equinoctial shadows of the gnomon and the inclinations of the sky, have been found by Eratosthenes<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL251_61_1" id="target_note_LCL251_61_1"><sup>1</sup></a> of Cyrene with mathematical calculations and geometric methods to be 252,000 stades, which give 31,500,000 paces, while of this the eighth part which the wind seems to occupy is 3,937,500 paces, they ought not to wonder, if in so great a space one wind, as it moves with its inclinations and retreats, causes varieties through the change of its current. 10. Therefore on the right
