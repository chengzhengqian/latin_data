<p>2. There are also cold springs not of pleasant smell or taste, which, rising far below, pass through hot soil, and thereupon running a long distance are chilled and reach the surface with damage to their flavour, their smell and colour; such as the river Albula<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_153_1" id="target_note_LCL280_153_1"><sup>1</sup></a> on the Via Tiburtina,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_153_2" id="target_note_LCL280_153_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and the cold springs near Ardea, with the same smell, and called sulphur springs, and in other like places. Now these springs, being cold, have the appearance of bubbling, because when, deep down, they come upon a hot place, the fire and water meet; and because of the collision, the springs take up with a loud noise the violent currents of air. They are thus forced by the power of the wind driven into them, to issue with much bubbling through the fountains. But those which have no outlet and are contained by rocks, are driven forth through narrow passages by the vehemence of the air-currents to the tops of hillocks.</p>
<p>3. Hence those who think that they can have fountain-heads of the same height as the hills find their mistake when they open out their trenches. For instance, let a bronze vessel be filled not to the brim but holding two-thirds, by measure, of its capacity of water; and let a lid be placed upon it. When it is subjected to the vehement heat of the fire, it makes the water boil. Yet, owing to its natural penetrability, it takes up a strong inflation of the heat, and not only fills the vessel but, raising the lid with the currents of air, it expands and boils over. When, however, the lid is removed, the steam passes into the open and the water settles down into its own place again. In the same way when fountain-heads are forced along narrow channels, the
