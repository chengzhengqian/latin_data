In the same way the air of the sky, receiving heat from the sun, draws moisture from all directions, lifts it and assembles it into clouds. For the earth when it is touched by heat casts forth moisture,â€”the human body also sweats from warmth.</p>

For those which originate and blow from the coldest quarters, the north and north-east, bring currents of air which are rarefied by their dryness; but the south wind and the rest, which attack us from the south, are very moist and always bring rains, because they come warmed from the hot regions; and as they fall, they take up the moisture everywhere and so pour it forth towards the north.</p>
