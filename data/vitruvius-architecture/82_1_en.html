man’s height, and also because six times, that is the number six, in that it is completed by the number of feet, determined the height of the body, they fixed that number as perfect, observing that the cubit consists of six palms and twenty-four fingers. Hence also the cities of the Greeks seem to have made in a like fashion (just as the cubit is of six palms) six parts of the <span class="italic">drachma</span>, the coin which they use, stamped bronze coins like <span class="italic">asses,</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL251_165_1a" id="target_note_LCL251_165_1a"><sup>1</sup></a> which they call <span class="italic">obols</span>; and to have fixed twenty-four

Now of this they found the origin in the foot. For when two palms are taken from the cubit, there is left a foot of four palms, and the palm has four fingers. So it comes that the foot has sixteen fingers, and the bronze denarius as many asses.</p>
