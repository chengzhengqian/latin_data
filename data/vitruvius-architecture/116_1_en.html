<p>1. <span class="sc">The</span> following are the rules for doorways to temples and their architraves. First we must determine of what style they are to be. For the styles of doorways are these: Doric, Ionic, Attic.</p>
<p>Of these (as concerns the Doric) the proportions are found to be of the following character. The top of the cornice which is put above the upper architrave, is made level with the tops of the capitals of the columns which are in the pronaos. The opening of the doorway is to be so determined that the height of the temple from the pavement to the panels of the ceiling is to be divided into parts, and of these 2½ in height are to be fixed for the opening of the folding doors.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL251_233_1" id="target_note_LCL251_233_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Let this in turn be divided into 12 parts and of these let 5½ be the breadth of the opening at the bottom. Let it be diminished at the top a third of the width of the architrave, if the opening be not more than 16 feet high; if from 16 to 25 feet, let the upper part of the opening be contracted 1/4 of the architrave; from 25 to 30 feet, 1/8 of the architraves. Higher openings should have perpendicular sides. 2. The architraves<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL251_233_2" id="target_note_LCL251_233_2"><sup>2</sup></a> themselves
