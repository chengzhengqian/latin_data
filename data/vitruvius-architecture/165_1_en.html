<h3><span class="sc">the influence of climate upon architecture</span></h3>
<p>1. <span class="sc">Now</span> we shall proceed aright herein if first we observe in what regions or latitudes of the world, our work is placed. For the style of building ought manifestly to be different in Egypt and Spain, in Pontus and Rome, and in countries and regions of various characters. For in one part the earth is oppressed by the sun in its course; in another part, the earth is far removed from it; in another, it is affected by it at a moderate distance. Therefore since, in the sunâ€™s course through the inclination of the zodiac,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_11_1" id="target_note_LCL280_11_1"><sup>1</sup></a> the relation of the heavens to the earth is arranged by nature with varying effects, it appears that in like manner the arrangement of buildings should be guided by the kind of locality and the changes of climate. 2. Towards the north, buildings, I think, should be vaulted, thoroughly shut in rather than exposed, and with an aspect to the warmer quarter. On the other hand, where the sun is violent in the southern regions because they are oppressed by the heat, buildings should be open to the air with a northern, or north-eastern,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_11_2" id="target_note_LCL280_11_2"><sup>2</sup></a> aspect. Thus we may remedy by art the harm that comes by chance.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_11_3" id="target_note_LCL280_11_3"><sup>3</sup></a> In other regions also, buildings are to be similarly adjusted to suit the relation of climate to latitude.</p>
<p>3. Now these things are to be observed and weighed in the light of Nature, and further to be tested by the figure and physique of different peoples. For in those regions where the sun pours forth a moderate heat, he keeps the body duly tempered;
