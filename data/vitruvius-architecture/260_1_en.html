<p>5. Since arithmetic does not furnish a solution, let a diagonal line be drawn from angle to angle in the square which was 10 feet long and wide, so that two triangles of equal magnitude, each of the area of 50 feet, are described. On the length of the diagonal let a square be described with equal sides. Therefore two triangles of 50 feet in area will be drawn upon the diagonal line in the lesser square; four triangles of the same magnitude and the same number of feet will be described in the larger square. In this manner the duplication is demonstrated geometrically by Plato in accordance with the figure subjoined at the bottom of the page.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_201_1" id="target_note_LCL280_201_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>6. Again, Pythagoras<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_201_2" id="target_note_LCL280_201_2"><sup>2</sup></a> demonstrated how to make a set-square without the help of a craftsman. And whereas the craftsman with great labour making a set-square can scarcely carry it out accurately, the exact process is explained in accordance with Pythagorasâ€™ instructions. For if three straight rods be taken, of which one is 3 feet long, the second 4 feet, the third 5 feet, and let these rods, being jointed together, touch one another at their extremities in the form of a triangle, they will make a perfect set-square.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_201_3" id="target_note_LCL280_201_3"><sup>3</sup></a> Moreover, if single squares with equal sides be described along the several rods, when the side is 3 feet, it will have 9 feet in area; the 4 feet side, 16; the 5 feet side, 25.</p>
<p>7. Thus the square which is described on 5 feet contains an area measured in feet equal to the area produced by the two squares, one with a side of 3 feet, and one with a side of 4. When Pythagoras
