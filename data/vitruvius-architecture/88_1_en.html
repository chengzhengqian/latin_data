in the pseudodipteral plans of temples. Hence there must have been great and subtle skill to produce the works of Hermogenes, and it has left sources from which posterity could draw their methods of study.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL251_177_1" id="target_note_LCL251_177_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>10. For araeostyle temples, the columns are to be so made that their diameters are one-eighth the height. Also in the diastyle, the height of the column is to be measured out into eight and a half parts, and let the diameter of the column be of one part. In the systyle let the height be divided into nine and a half parts, let one of those be given for the diameter of the column. Also in the pycnostyle, the height is to be divided into ten, and of that one part is to be made the diameter of the column. Now of the eustyle temple, as of the systyle, let the height be divided into nine and a half parts, and of that let one part be set up for the diameter of the bottom of the shaft. In this way the relation of the intercolumniations will be observed proportionately. 11. For in the measure by which the spaces between the columns grow, the diameters of the shafts are to be increased. For if in the araeostyle there shall be the ninth or tenth part of a diameter, it will appear thin and scanty; because through the width of the intercolumniations the air consumes and lessens in appearance the diameter of the shafts.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL251_177_2" id="target_note_LCL251_177_2"><sup>2</sup></a> On the other hand, in pycnostyle temples if there shall be the eighth part of a diameter, because of the frequency and narrowness of the intercolumniations, it will produce a swollen and displeasing appearance. Therefore we must follow the symmetries required by the style of the work. The
