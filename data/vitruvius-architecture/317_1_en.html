<h3><span class="sc">on water organs</span></h3>
<p>1. <span class="sc">On</span> the principles of water organs,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_315_1" id="target_note_LCL280_315_1"><sup>1</sup></a> I cannot omit to touch as briefly and precisely as possible, and commit them to writing.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_315_2" id="target_note_LCL280_315_2"><sup>2</sup></a> A base is made of framed wood and a bronze vessel is placed upon it. On the base, uprights are set up right and left, with rungs like a ladder. Between these, bronze cylinders are enclosed. Pistons which move up and down are accurately wrought on a lathe, and with iron piston rods fixed in the middle. These rods are joined by pins to the levers, and the pistons are covered with leather and wool. Further, on the top surface of the cylinders are openings about three fingers (2 1/2 in.) broad. Adjoining the openings and placed on pins are bronze dolphins with valves hanging by chains from their mouths and secured below the openings of the cylinders.</p>
<p>2. Within the chest where the water is stored there is an air-vessel, like a funnel inverted; beneath this, small blocks about three inches high are placed, and they keep even the lowest space between the lips of the air-vessel and the bottom of the chest. On the neck of the air-vessel a small box is constructed which carries the top of the instrument, which is called in Greek the <span class="italic">canon musicus.</span> Along this there are four channels, if the instrument is tetrachord; six if it is hexachord; eight if it is octochord.</p>
