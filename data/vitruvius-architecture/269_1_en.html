signs, it arrives on the three-hundred-and-sixtieth day at that sign, from which in its previous revolution it entered on its course. Its path is so averaged that it spends about thirty days in each sign.</p>

The planet Venus, when it is freed from the hindrance of the sunâ€™s rays, traverses the space of some signs in thirty days; so far as it suffers an abatement from forty days in the several signs, after traversing a node, it regains that amount lost by delaying in the several signs. Therefore it completes the whole circuit in the firmament on the four-hundred-and-eighty-fifth day, in that sign from which previously it started on its journey.</p>
<p>10. Mars traverses the spaces of the constellations on about the six-hundred-and-eighty-third day, and reaches the place from which it previously made a beginning in making its journey; where it runs more quickly in the signs, it fulfils the proportionate number of days after passing a node. Jupiter, rising by more easy steps against the revolution of the firmament, measures about three hundred and sixty days against each sign, and after eleven years and three hundred and thirteen days it halts and returns to the sign where it had been twelve years before. Saturn, traversing a sign in twenty-nine months and a few days, takes twenty-nine years and about a hundred and sixty days to regain the sign in which it was thirty years before. From the fact that it is less distant from the furthest verge of the firmament, it seems to be more slow in traversing the greater circumference of its orbit.</p>
