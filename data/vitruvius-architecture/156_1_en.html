either docks are to be made, or approaches from the colonnades to the warehouses. On either side towers are to be built from which chains<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL251_313_1" id="target_note_LCL251_313_1"><sup>1</sup></a> (across the harbour) can be drawn by machinery.</p>
<p>2. But if we have no natural harbour suitable for protecting ships from a stormy sea, we must proceed as follows. If there is an anchorage on one side without any river mouth to interfere, piers are to be constructed on the other side by masonry or embankments in order to form an enclosed harbour. The masonry which is to be in the sea must be constructed in this way. Earth<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL251_313_2" id="target_note_LCL251_313_2"><sup>2</sup></a> is to be brought from the district which runs from Cumae to the promontory of Minerva,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL251_313_3" id="target_note_LCL251_313_3"><sup>3</sup></a> and mixed, in the mortar, two parts to one of lime. 3. Then in the place marked out, cofferdams,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL251_313_4" id="target_note_LCL251_313_4"><sup>4</sup></a> formed of oak piles and tied together with chains, are to be let down into the water and firmly fixed. Next, the lower part between them under the water is to be levelled and cleared with a platform of small beams laid across and the work is to be carried up with stones and mortar as above described, until the space for the structure between the dams is filled. Such is the natural advantage of the places described above.</p>
<p>But if on account of the breakers or the violence of the open sea, the supports cannot uphold the dams, then a platform is to be laid, as firmly as possible, starting from the edge of the shore or from a breakwater.
This platform is to be laid with a level top
