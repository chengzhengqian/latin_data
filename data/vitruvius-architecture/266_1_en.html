magnitude at Athens, another at Alexandria, another at Rome, is different at Piacenza and in other parts of the world. Therefore the designs of dials vary widely with change of place. For the length of the shadows at the equinox determines the design of the <span class="italic">analemma</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_213_1" id="target_note_LCL280_213_1"><sup>1</sup></a> by which the hours are marked in accordance with the locality and the shadow of the gnomon. The analemma is an exact contrivance invented by observing the course of the sun and the lengthening of the shadow towards the winter, by means of which through architectural<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_213_2" id="target_note_LCL280_213_2"><sup>2</sup></a> calculations and the use of the compass, the action of the sun in the universe is discovered.</p>
<p>2. The universe is the total conception of the whole system, and the firmament with its ordered constellations. It rolls continually round the earth and sea, on the furthest poles<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_213_3" id="target_note_LCL280_213_3"><sup>3</sup></a> of its axis. For there the power of nature like an architect, has contrived and placed the poles like centres, one at a vast distance from the earth at the top of the universe and behind the very stars of the Great Bear, and the other opposite, under the earth in the regions of the south; and there has constructed rims of wheels (which the Greeks call <span class="italic">apsides</span>) round centres as in a lathe, about which the firmament for ever rolls. Thus the middle of the earth and sea is set by nature in the central place.</p>
<p>3. The arrangement of nature is such that on the north the higher centre is exalted above the earth, while in the southern part the centre lying under the lower
