<p>I have explained the belt of the twelve signs, and the contrary operation and course of the seven planets; the causes and numerical relations by which they pass from sign to sign, and their revolutions as I have learned from my masters. I will now speak of the rising light and waning of the moon, as our predecessors have told us.</p>

<h3><span class="sc">on the rising and waning of the moon</span></h3>
<p>1. <span class="sc">Berosus,</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_227_1" id="target_note_LCL280_227_1"><sup>1</sup></a> who sprang from the Chaldaean city, or rather nation,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_227_2" id="target_note_LCL280_227_2"><sup>2</sup></a> expounded the Chaldaean discipline as far as Asia. He taught as follows:</p>
<p>The moon is a globe with one hemisphere luminous<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_227_3" id="target_note_LCL280_227_3"><sup>3</sup></a> and the other of a dark blue colour. Now when it traverses the course of its orbit, and comes under the sun’s disk, it is attracted by the sun’s rays and violent heat, and, because of the property of the sun’s light, the shining hemisphere of the moon turns to that light. But while those upper parts which are attracted look towards the sun’s sphere, the lower hemisphere of the moon, which does not shine, seems dark because of its resemblance to the air. When the moon is perpendicular to the sun’s rays, all its light is held back on its upper face, and it is then called the first moon.</p>
