faces the middle of the forum and the Temple of Jupiter. 8. The tribunal which is in the former temple, is in the shape of the segment of a circle. The width of the segment in front is 46 feet; its depth is 15 feet; so that those who come before the magistrates may not interfere with persons on business in the basilica. Above the columns are beams made of three 2 foot joists bolted together. These return from the third column on either side of the opening to the antae of the pronaos, and adjoin the curve of the tribunal right and left. 9. Above the beams vertically over the capitals, piers are placed on supports, 3 feet high and 4 feet square. Above them, beams formed of two 2 foot joists, carefully wrought, are carried round the basilica. Thereon over against the shafts of the columns, and the antae and walls of the pronaos, cross-beams and struts support the whole ridge of the basilica, and a second ridge running out from the middle of the main ridge, over the pronaos of the temple. 10. Thus there arises from the roof a double arrangement of gables. This gives a pleasing effect both to the exterior of the roof and to the high vaulting within. Further, we dispense with the ornaments of the entablatures and the provision of the upper columns and parapets. We are relieved from laborious details and escape a large expenditure, while the carrying up of the columns without a break to the beams of the vault<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL251_261_1" id="target_note_LCL251_261_1"><sup>1</sup></a> seems to give a sumptuous magnificence and impressiveness to the work.</p>
