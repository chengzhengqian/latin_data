wheel a point is to be marked. When the wheel begins to move forward from this point and to revolve on the road surface, it will have completed a distance of 12 1/2 feet<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_321_1" id="target_note_LCL280_321_1"><sup>1</sup></a> on arriving at the point from which it began its revolution.</p>
<p>2. As the next step, let a drum be secured to the inner side of the hub of the wheel with one tooth projecting from its exterior circumference. Above this, in the body of the carriage, let a box be securely fixed with a drum revolving perpendicularly, and fastened to an axle. On the outside edge of the drum 400 teeth are to be set at equal intervals so as to meet the teeth on the lower drum. Further, at the side of the upper drum there is to be fixed a second tooth projecting beyond the other teeth.</p>
<p>3. Now above there is to be placed a horizontal wheel toothed in the same manner, and enclosed in a similar case, with teeth which fit upon the single tooth which projects on the side of the second drum. In this drum openings are to be made equal in number to the miles which can be covered with the carriage in a day: whether the miles are more or less makes no difficulty. In all these openings, round stones are to be placed, and in the lining of the drum there is to be one opening attached to a small channel, where the stones placed in the drum when they come to the corresponding place can fall one by one into the carriage body and a bronze vessel which is placed below. 4. Thus when the wheel moves forwards and carries with it the lowest drum, in a single revolution, the wheel causes its one tooth to strike in passing the teeth in the upper drum. The effect
