In Pontus among the nation of the Colchi,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL251_81_1" id="target_note_LCL251_81_1"><sup>1</sup></a> because of their rich forests, two whole trees are laid flat, right and left, on the ground, a space being left between them as wide as the lengths of the trees allow. On the furthest parts of them, two others are placed transversely, and these four trees enclose in the middle the space for the dwelling. Then, laying upon them alternate beams from the four sides, they join up the angles.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL251_81_2a" id="target_note_LCL251_81_2a"><sup>2</sup></a> And so constructing the walls with trees, they raise up towers<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL251_81_3" id="target_note_LCL251_81_3"><sup>3</sup></a> rising perpendicular from the lowest parts. The gaps which are left by the thickness of the timber they block up with splinters and clay. Further, they raise the roofs by cutting off the cross-beams at the end and gradually narrowing them.
