The same calculation, as it is useful in many things and measurements, so it applies to buildings in the construction of staircases, for the adjustment of the steps.</p>
<p>8. For if the height of a story from the flooring above to the level below is divided into three parts, five such parts will give the inclined string of the staircase in its exact length. Taking the height between the floor above and the level below as three parts, let four parts be set off from the perpendicular and let the foot of the string be placed there. This will be so adjusted; so also will be the plotting out of the several steps of the staircase itself. The drawing of this, also, is subjoined.</p>
<p>9. Archimedes made many and various wonderful discoveries. Of all these the one which I will explain<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_203_2" id="target_note_LCL280_203_2"><sup>2</sup></a> seems to be worked out with infinite skill. Hiero<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_203_3" id="target_note_LCL280_203_3"><sup>3</sup></a> was greatly exalted in the regal power at Syracuse, and after his victories he determined to set up in a certain temple a crown vowed to the immortal gods. He let out the execution as far as the craftsman’s wages<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_203_4" id="target_note_LCL280_203_4"><sup>4</sup></a> were concerned, and weighed the gold out to the contractor to an exact amount.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_203_5" id="target_note_LCL280_203_5"><sup>5</sup></a> At the appointed time the man presented the work finely wrought for the king’s acceptance, and appeared to have furnished the weight of the crown to scale. 10. However, information was laid that gold had been withdrawn, and that the same amount of silver had been added in the making of the crown. Hiero was indignant that he had been made light of, and
