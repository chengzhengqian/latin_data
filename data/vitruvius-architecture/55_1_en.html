compels the use of supplies from the quarries of Grotta Rossa and Palla, and others which are nearest to the city, we must take precautions if we wish to complete our work without faults. When we have to build, let the stone be got out two years before, not in winter but in summer, and let it lie and stay in exposed places. Those stones, however, which in the two years suffer damage by weathering, are to be thrown into the foundations. Those which are not faulty are tested by Nature, and can endure when used in building above ground. And these precautions are to be taken not only in the case of squared stones, but also for rough stone or rubble walling.</p>

The “uncertain” rough work, <span class="italic">opus incertum,</span> lying course above course and breaking joints, furnishes walling which is not pleasing but is stronger than the reticulatum. 2. Both kinds of walling are to be built with very minute stones; so that the walls, thoroughly saturated with mortar of lime and sand, may hold longer together. For since the stones are of a soft and open nature, they dry up the moisture by sucking it out of the mortar. But when the supply of lime and sand is abundant, the wall having more moisture will not quickly become
