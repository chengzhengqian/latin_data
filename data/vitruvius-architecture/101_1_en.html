<h3><span class="sc">on the corinthian capital</span></h3>
<p>1. <span class="sc">Corinthian</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL251_203_1" id="target_note_LCL251_203_1"><sup>1</sup></a> columns have all their proportions like the Ionic, with the exception of their capitals. The height of the capitals renders them proportionately higher and more slender, because the height of the Ionic capital is one third of the thickness of the column, that of the Corinthian is the whole diameter of the shaft. Therefore because two-thirds of the diameter of the Corinthian columns are added to the capitals they give an appearance of greater slenderness owing to the increase in height. 2. The remaining features which are fixed above the columns are placed upon them in accordance either with Doric proportions or in the Ionic manner; because the Corinthian order has not separate rules for the cornices and the other ornaments, but, on the one hand, the mutules<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL251_203_2" id="target_note_LCL251_203_2"><sup>2</sup></a> in the cornices and the guttae in the architraves, are disposed in the Doric fashion; or, on the other hand following the Ionic arrangement, the friezes are adorned with carving and are combined with dentils and cornices. 3. Thus from the two orders, a third is produced by the introduction of a new capital. From the formation of the columns, come the names of the three styles, Doric, Ionic, Corinthian; of which the Doric came first and from early ages.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL251_203_3" id="target_note_LCL251_203_3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
