Thus‚Äînot
so easily indeed as by pressing against the actual fulcrum‚Äînone the less by pressing against the weight of the load, the work will be done. Therefore if the shorter end of the lever, being applied above the fulcrum, goes too far under the load, and the longer arm has the fulcrum too near the centre, it will not be able to raise the load, unless (as it has been written above) the long arm of the lever is balanced from the end, and not by pressing down the centre.</p>
<p>4. We can consider this in the case of steel-yards which are called <span class="italic">staterae.</span> For when the handle of suspension is placed like a centre, nearer the end of the beam from which the scale hangs, and the weight moves along the points marked on the other side of the centre, the further it is taken (or even to the end), with a small and unequal weight, it is made equal to a very large weight by bringing the beam to a level. The further the balancing weight retreats from the centre, to that extent may it be of slighter amount. The small counter-weight brings down, as it moves, the more powerful weight, and causes it to rise gently and without violence up and down.</p>
