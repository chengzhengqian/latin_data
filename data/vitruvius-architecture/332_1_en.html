taken towards this kind of machine, when Philip the son of Amyntas was besieging Byzantium, Polyidus a Thessalian made a variety of designs with easier construction; his method was continued by his pupils, Diades and Charias, who accompanied Alexander on his campaigns.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_345_1" id="target_note_LCL280_345_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Diades, then, in his books<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_345_2" id="target_note_LCL280_345_2"><sup>2</sup></a> shows that he invented Movable Towers, the parts of which he used to assemble and carry round with the army; in addition to this, the Borer and the Climbing Machine by which a passage from the level up the wall was possible; further, the Grappling-hook for demolition which some call the Crane. 4. Moreover, he used to employ a ram on wheels for which he left detailed descriptions. He says that the smallest tower should be 60 cubits high and 17 broad, and that it should be contracted at the top, by 1/5 of the width at the foot. The uprights for the towers should be 9 inches at the bottom and 6 inches at the top. He says further that the tower should be ten stories high, with openings like windows on each side. 5. The largest tower is to be 120 cubits high, 23 1/2 wide, the contraction at the top 1/5; the uprights one foot at the bottom, six inches at the top. He used to construct this size of tower with 20 stories, and the several stories had a balcony three cubits wide. These he further covered with raw hides to preserve them from attack.</p>
