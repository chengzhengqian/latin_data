things, although they are co-operating principles in producing their results. There is the principle of the <span class="italic">straight</span> line (which the Greeks call <span class="italic">eutheia</span>); and that of the <span class="italic">circle</span> (which the Greeks call <span class="italic">cyclotes</span>). But neither rectilinear motion without circular, nor rotating movements without rectilinear, can produce the raising of loads.</p>
<p>2. I will illustrate this so as to make it understood. Axles are fixed as centres for the pulleys and fitted into blocks. The rope is taken round over the pulleys and drawn straight down; and being coiled round a windlass, when the levers are turned, causes the load to rise upwards. The pivots of the windlass being inserted, like centres, into the sockets, the levers are inserted into holes in the windlass, and their ends being pushed round in a circle and turning like a lathe, cause the movement upwards of the loads. After the same fashion, when an iron lever<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_295_1" id="target_note_LCL280_295_1"><sup>1</sup></a> is applied to a weight which a multitude of hands could not move, a fulcrum<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_295_2" id="target_note_LCL280_295_2"><sup>2</sup></a> is placed under it on the nearer side as a centre (which the Greeks call <span class="italic">hypomochlion</span>). The short end of the lever is placed under the load, and the long end of the lever, when it is pressed down by one man’s strength, raises the load.</p>
<p>3. Now this lifting is accomplished because the short end of the lever is under the weight, and is nearer to the fulcrum where is the centre of motion; and in so far as the head of the lever which is pressed down is further distant from the fulcrum. When the lever is in action, the circular motion (<span class="italic">i.e.</span> of the
