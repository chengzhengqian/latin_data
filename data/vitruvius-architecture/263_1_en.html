and found that more water flowed into the space left by the crown than into the space left by a mass of gold of the same weight. And so from the fact that there was more water in the case of the crown than in the mass of gold, he calculated and detected the mixture of the silver with the gold, and the fraud of the contractor.</p>
<p>13. Let us turn our attention to the theorems of Archytas of Tarentum, and of Eratosthenes of Cyrene. For they made for mankind many welcome discoveries by means of mathematics. While, therefore, they were made welcome by their other inventions, they were most admired for their mathematical inspirations. For they satisfied, each by his own method, the demand which Apollo had imposed upon Delos:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_207_1a" id="target_note_LCL280_207_1a"><sup>1</sup></a> namely, that the number of cubic feet in his altar should be doubled, and that thereby the residents in the island should be freed from a religious scruple.</p>

Archytas<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_207_2" id="target_note_LCL280_207_2"><sup>2</sup></a> solved the problem by a diagram with cylinders; Eratosthenes by means of an instrument the <span class="italic">mesolabium.</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_207_3" id="target_note_LCL280_207_3"><sup>3</sup></a> These theorems are apprehended with the great pleasure which such methods can give. For we are compelled, when we consider the effects of individual causes, to feel a natural emotion in the presence of inventions. After a wide survey, I admire especially Democritus’ treatises on the Nature of Things, and in them the commentary in which there is figured the cutting of
