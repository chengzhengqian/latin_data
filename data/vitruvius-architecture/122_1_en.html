with columns added right and left on the sides of the pronaos. The first temples built in the manner of that of Castor in the Circus, were those of Pallas (Minerva) in the Acropolis<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL251_245_1" id="target_note_LCL251_245_1"><sup>1</sup></a> at Athens, and at Sunium in Attica, of the same and not different proportions. For like the others, the cells are double in length compared to the breadth. In these temples also, all the features which are customary on the front are transferred to the flanks. 5. For some taking the arrangements of the columns from the Tuscan style, transfer them to the design of Corinthian and Ionic buildings. And where the pilasters run forward in the forecourt, they place <span class="italic">two</span> columns in line with the walls of the cella and produce a system common to Tuscan and Greek forms of building. 6. Others again, removing the walls of the shrine and putting them in the intercolumniations of the colonnade,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL251_245_2" id="target_note_LCL251_245_2"><sup>2</sup></a> produce a large extension of the cella by the space thus gained; keeping the other parts, however, of the same proportions and symmetries, they seem to have created another kind of plan and of name, the pseudoperipteral. The styles of building vary to suit the needs of sacrifice. For temples are not to be built to all the gods in the same styles. For the several gods by the variety of their worship give rise to different religious effects.</p>
<p>7. I have set forth all the plans of temples as they have been taught me, and have distinguished in detail their orders and symmetries, the difference of their forms and the details by which they are distinguished
