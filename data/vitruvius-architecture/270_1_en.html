the path of the sun, especially when they are in the trigon<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_221_1" id="target_note_LCL280_221_1"><sup>1</sup></a> which he has entered, do not go forward but retrograde and delay until the same sun has passed from that trigon into another sign. To some, this seems to happen because the sun, they say, being further away at a certain distance, hinders by the delay of darkness the planets wandering in their unillumined paths. To us it seems otherwise. For the splendour of the sun is perceptible and patent through all the universe without any obscuration, so that these stars appear<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_221_2" id="target_note_LCL280_221_2"><sup>2</sup></a> to us even when they retrograde or are stationary. Therefore if our vision can perceive it at such great distances, why do we judge that obscurity may be set against the prophetic splendours of the stars?</p>
<p>12. Therefore the consideration rather commends itself to us that, just as heat evokes all things and draws them to itself, as also we see the crops rising on high from the earth because of the heat, and the watery exhalations raised from the springs to the clouds along the rainbow, so in the same way the mighty force of the sun extending its rays in the form of a triangle draws to itself the planets as they follow, and, as it were curbing and restraining those which precede, prevents their onward movement and compels them to return to it and to be in the sign of another trigon.</p>
<p>13. Perhaps it will be asked, why does the sun cause delay by these heats, in the fifth sign away from itself rather than in the second and third? I will therefore explain how this seems to happen.
