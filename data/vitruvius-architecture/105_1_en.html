the height of the capital. Thus the front elevations in every direction, will have the right breadth. Let the faces be curved inward from the extreme angles of the abacus the ninth part of the breadth of the face. At the lowest part, let the capital have the diameter of the top of the column, excluding the curving away of the column into the capital, and the astragal.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL251_211_1" id="target_note_LCL251_211_1"><sup>1</sup></a> The thickness of the abacus is one seventh of the height of the capital. 12. Taking away the thickness of the abacus, let the remainder be divided into three parts, of which let one be given to the lowest leaf. Let the second leaf have two thirds. Let the stalks have the same height, and let leaves arise from these, projecting to receive the volutes which rise from the stalks and run out to the extreme angles. Let smaller spirals be carved running up to the flower which is in the middle of the abacus. On the four sides let flowers be carved, their width being equal to the height of the abacus. With these proportions, Corinthian capitals will have their appropriate execution.</p>
<p>There are other<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL251_211_2" id="target_note_LCL251_211_2"><sup>2</sup></a> kinds of capitals variously named which are placed upon these same columns. We cannot name their special proportions nor the style of the columns in any other manner. We observe that even their names are transferred and changed from the Corinthian, Pulvinate and Doric styles, the proportions of which are transferred to the refinements of these novel sculptures.</p>
