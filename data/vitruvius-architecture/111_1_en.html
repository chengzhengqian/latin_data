and a half high and one module wide in front, and so distributed that in the columns both at the corners and in the middle, they are placed over the centres. In the middle intercolumniations of the front and back there are to be three, in the other intercolumniations there are to be two triglyphs. The middle intercolumniations are to be thus widened so that for those who are approaching the statues of the gods there may be an uninterrupted approach. 5. The width of the triglyphs is to be divided into six parts, of which five parts are to be in the middle, and two halves right and left are to be marked by the length of the fillet. The part in the middle is to be shaped flat as the <span class="italic">thigh</span> (which in Greek is called <span class="italic">mÄ“ros</span>). Parallel channels are to be sunk with sides meeting in a right angle. To the right and left of them, in order, other flat surfaces or thighs are to be put. At the furthest edges, half channels are to be put. After placing the triglyphs, the metopes which separate them, are to be made as high as they are long. Further, at the extreme corners, half metopes are to be made half a module wide. Hence the divisions will be made uniform and all the faults, both of metopes and intercolumniations and soffits, will be removed. 6, The capitals of the triglyphs are to be made of the sixth part of a module. Above the capitals of the triglyphs, the cornice is to be placed projecting two thirds of a module, with a Doric cymatium below and another at the top. Further, with the cymatia, the cornice will be half a module high. Now in the lowest part of the cornice, above the triglyphs and the middle of the metopes, the lines of the <span class="italic">viae</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL251_223_1" id="target_note_LCL251_223_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and the rows of the guttae are to
