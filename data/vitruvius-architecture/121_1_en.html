the pedestal (stylobate) the columns are put of such a height as is the diameter of the pedestals from side to side; the diameter is to be 1/10 of the height including the capitals and bases. The architrave is to be half a diameter high. The frieze and the other members which are placed above are to follow the proportions given in the third book.</p>
<p>2. But if the temple is peripteral, two steps and the stylobate are to be built from the foundation; then the wall of the cella is to be built set back from the edge of the stylobate about 1/5 of the width. In the middle is to be left an opening with folding-doors for the approach. The cella within the walls and colonnade, is to have a diameter equal to the height of the column. On the stylobate, let columns be disposed round the cella and of the same proportions. 3. In the middle let the proportions of the roof be such that the height of the dome, apart from the terminal, is half the diameter of the whole work. Let the terminal have the magnitude of the capital of the column in addition to the pyramid (on which the flower<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL251_243_1" id="target_note_LCL251_243_1"><sup>1</sup></a> rests). The other parts are to be constructed of the proportions and symmetries as is above described.</p>
<p>4. Further, temples of other orders are laid out and built with the same symmetries, yet having the arrangements of another order than the Tuscan: such as the temple of Castor<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL251_243_2" id="target_note_LCL251_243_2"><sup>2</sup></a> in the Circus Flaminius, of Veiovis<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL251_243_3" id="target_note_LCL251_243_3"><sup>3</sup></a> between the Two Groves, and with more subtle proportions the temple of Diana Nemorensis<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL251_243_4" id="target_note_LCL251_243_4"><sup>4</sup></a>
