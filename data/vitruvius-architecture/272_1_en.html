less orbit, more often moves under and passes the planet above it.</p>
<p>15. To illustrate<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_225_1" id="target_note_LCL280_225_1"><sup>1</sup></a> this: let us suppose that on a wheel such as potters use, seven ants are placed, and as many channels are made in the wheel round the centre as the lowest point, increasing in length to the most distant; let the ants be compelled to make a circuit in these channels and let the wheel be turned the other way; in spite of the revolution of the wheel, they will necessarily complete their journeys in the opposite direction. That which has the channel nearest the centre completes its wanderings more quickly; that which traverses the farthest circuit of the wheel, even if it walks as quickly, finishes its course much more slowly on account of the magnitude of the orbit. In like fashion, the planets advancing in a direction opposite to the movement of the firmament complete a circuit along their own paths. Yet in the revolution of the sky they are carried backwards, by the excess of it over their own motion, in the daily circuit of time.</p>
<p>16. The reason why some stars are temperate, others fiery and others cold, seems to be this, that all fire has a flame which rises to higher regions. Therefore the sun scorches with its rays the aether above it and causes it to burn, and the planet Mars has its course in these regions; hence it is made to burn by the heat of the sun. The planet Saturn, however, which is nearest to the verge of the firmament, touches the frozen regions of the sky; it is exceedingly cold.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_225_2" id="target_note_LCL280_225_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Hence Jupiter, having its course between the circuits of either, seems to enjoy the most temperate effects of cold and heat, which suit its middle position.</p>
