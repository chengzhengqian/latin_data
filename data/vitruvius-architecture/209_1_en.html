as far as the case admits. Between the two walls, a gutter must be laid lower than the level of the room, with outlets into the open. Further, when the wall is built to the top, ventilation holes are to be left. For unless the moisture has outlets, it will none the less diffuse itself over the new wall. When these precautions have been taken, let the wall be rough-cast with powdered pottery, brought to an even surface and finished with plaster.</p>
<p>2. But if the space is not enough for another wall, let gutters be made with outlets to the open. Then let two-foot tiles<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_99_1" id="target_note_LCL280_99_1"><sup>1</sup></a> be placed above the edge of the gutter on the one side; on the other side, piers<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_99_2" id="target_note_LCL280_99_2"><sup>2</sup></a> of eight-inch bricks are to be built up, to take the edges of two tiles, and let the piers be distant not more than one palm’s length from the wall. Then let flanged<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_99_3" id="target_note_LCL280_99_3"><sup>3</sup></a> tiles be fixed to the wall vertically from the bottom to the top. Their inner side is to be carefully covered with pitch so as to reject the moisture. Also let there be air-holes at the bottom, and at the top above the spring of the ceiling.</p>
<p>3. They are then to be whitened over with lime and water so that they do not reject the rough-cast of powdered brick; for from the dryness that comes in the kiln they can neither take nor keep this coating unless the lime that is applied, glues both together and causes their union. When the rough-cast is put on, broken pottery is to be used instead of sand and the remainder is to be finished as described above about plastering.</p>
