<p>But the third order, which is called Corinthian,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL251_209_1" id="target_note_LCL251_209_1"><sup>1</sup></a> imitates the slight figure of a maiden; because girls are represented with slighter dimensions because of their tender age, and admit of more graceful effects in ornament. 9. Now the first invention of that capital is related to have happened thus. A girl, a native of Corinth, already of age to be married, was attacked by disease and died. After her funeral, the goblets which delighted her when living, were put together in a basket by her nurse, carried to the monument, and placed on the top. That they might remain longer, exposed as they were to the weather, she covered the basket with a tile. As it happened the basket was placed upon the root of an acanthus. Meanwhile about spring time, the root of the acanthus, being pressed down in the middle by the weight, put forth leaves and shoots. The shoots grew up the sides of the basket, and, being pressed down at the angles by the force of the weight of the tile, were compelled to form the curves of volutes at the extreme parts. 10. Then Callimachus, who for the elegance and refinement of his marble carving was nick-named <span class="italic">catatechnos</span> by the Athenians, was passing the monument, perceived the basket and the young leaves growing up Pleased with the style and novelty of the grouping, he made columns for the Corinthians on this model and fixed the proportions. Thence he distributed the details of the Corinthian order throughout the work. 11. The proportions of the capital are to be arranged thus. The height of the capital with the abacus is to equal the diameter of the bottom of the column. The width of the abacus is to be so proportioned: the diagonal lines from angle to angle are to equal twice
