be divided so that there are six guttae in the length and three in the breadth. The remaining spaces, because the metopes are broader than triglyphs, are to be left plain, or divine images are to be carved; and at the very edge of the cornice a line is to be cut in which is called the scotia. All the rest—namely the field of the pediment, the cymas, the cornices—are to be finished as prescribed above for Ionic buildings.</p>
<p>7. Such is the method that will be appointed for diastyle works. But if the work is to be systyle and with single triglyphs, the front of a tetrastyle temple is to be divided into nineteen and a half parts; of a hexastyle temple into twenty nine and a half parts. Of these one part will be the module according to which they are to be divided, as written above.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL251_225_1" id="target_note_LCL251_225_1"><sup>1</sup></a> 8. Thus above the single architraves, two metopes and two triglyphs are to be placed. At the angles<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL251_225_2" id="target_note_LCL251_225_2"><sup>2</sup></a> in addition, as much as is half a triglyph is put. Against the middle of the pediment, a space will intervene of three triglyphs and three metopes, in order that the middle intercolumniation, being broader, may give room to persons approaching the temple, and furnish a dignified appearance as one goes to meet the Image of the God.</p>
<p>9. The columns ought to be fluted with 20 flutes.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL251_225_3" id="target_note_LCL251_225_3"><sup>3</sup></a> If the flutes are flat, the columns must have 20 vertical edges marked. But if the flutes are hollow, we must fix their form in this way: draw a square with equal sides as great as is the width of the fluting.
