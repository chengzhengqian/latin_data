<h3><span class="sc">on balistae</span></h3>
<p>1. I <span class="sc">have</span> described the design of a catapult and the details which are combined in accordance with proportion. The design of the balista varies and its differences are adjusted for the purpose of a single effect. For some are worked by levers and windlasses, some by many pulleys, some by capstans, some by wheels. Yet all balistae are constructed with a view to the proposed amount of the weight of the stone which such a machine is to let fly.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_333_1" id="target_note_LCL280_333_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Therefore only those craftsmen can deal with the design who are familiar with the geometrical<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_333_2a" id="target_note_LCL280_333_2a"><sup>2</sup></a> treatment of numbers and their multiples.</p>
<p>2. For the holes which are made in the frames (through the openings of which ropes are stretched, made especially of woman’s hair or of the sinews of animals) are taken proportionately to the amount of the weight of the stone which the balista is to shoot, in accordance with gravity,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_333_3" id="target_note_LCL280_333_3"><sup>3</sup></a> just as in the case of catapults the <span class="italic">length of the arrows</span> furnishes the module. Therefore in order that persons who are ignorant of geometry may be equipped and may not be delayed by calculation amid the perils of war, I will specify in accordance with my own knowledge gained in practice and also in accordance with the instructions of my teachers. Further, I will set forth in detail the manner in which the Greek
