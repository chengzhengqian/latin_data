of one to three, he will produce a blending of material which is better for use. 2. And so when lime receives water and sand and then strengthens the structure, the following seems to be the cause: just as other bodies, so also stones are blended of the elements. And those which have more air are soft; more water, are pliant from the moisture; more earth, are hard; more fire, are more fragile. Therefore if stones of this last quality are crushed before they are burnt, and mixed with sand, and thrown into the work, they do not become solid, nor can they hold the building together. But when they are thrown into the kiln,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL251_99_1" id="target_note_LCL251_99_1"><sup>1</sup></a> they are seized by the violent heat of the fire and lose the virtue of their former solidity. Their strength is burnt out and exhausted and they are left with open and empty pores. 3. Therefore when the moisture which is in the body of that stone, and the air, are burnt out and removed, and the stone retains the remaining latent heat, on being plunged into water (before it recovers power from fire), the moisture penetrates into the open pores, and it seethes and thus, being cooled again, it rejects the heat from the substance of the lime. Thus, moreover, whatever weight the stone possesses when it is thrown into the kiln, it cannot answer to that<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL251_99_2" id="target_note_LCL251_99_2"><sup>2</sup></a> when it is taken out; but when it is weighed, the bulk remaining the same, it is found to lose about one-third of its weight when the moisture is burnt out. Therefore, when the pores and attenuations of the lime are open, it catches up into itself the mixture of the sand; thus it coheres and, as it dries, joins with the rubble and produces solid walling</p>
