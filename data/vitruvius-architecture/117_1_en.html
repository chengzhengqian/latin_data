are to be contracted 1/14 part of their width at the top. The height of the lintel is to be the same as that of the architraves at the top. The cymatium (ogee) should be made one sixth of the architrave, projecting the amount of its thickness. It is to be carved in the Lesbian form with an astragal. Above the cymatium of the lintel, the frieze is to be placed as deep as the lintel; and on it is to be carved a Doric cymatium and a Lesbian astragal in low relief. Over this the cornice is to be carved without ornament and with a cymatium; its projection is to be as much as its height. To the right and left of the lintel, which is placed above the jambs, projections are to be made so that the bases run out, and are exactly joined to the cymatium with a mitre.</p>
<p>3. If the doorways are to be of the Ionic style, the opening must be of a height determined as in the Doric style. Let the breadth be determined, so that the height is divided into 2½ parts, and let the breadth of the opening at the bottom be one part. The contractions are to be as in the Doric. The width of the architrave is to be 1/14 of the height of the opening in front; the cymatium is to be 1/6 of the width of the architrave. The remainder, excluding the cymatium, is divided into 12 parts. The first fascia with the astragal is to be three parts of these; the second, of four parts; the third, of five parts. The fasciae with the astragal are to run evenly round the architrave. 4. The tops of the doorways are as in the Doric style, with the proportionate dimensions.
