in this way such contrivances take movements at a centre, both rectilinear and circular, so also waggons, carts, drum-wheels and other wheels, screws, scorpions, balistae, presses and other machines produce the desired effect with parts moving about a centre along a straight line<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_303_1" id="target_note_LCL280_303_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and by a rotation round it.</p>

<h3><span class="sc">on machines for raising water, and first the tympanum</span></h3>
<p>1. I <span class="sc">will</span> now explain the machines which have been invented for raising water and how they are contrived in their different kinds. And first I will speak of the <span class="italic">tympanum.</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_303_2" id="target_note_LCL280_303_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Now this does not raise the water to a great height, but draws a large amount in a short time. The axle is wrought in a lathe or made circular by hand and its ends are hooped with iron bands. Round the middle it has a drum of planks fitted together; and it is placed upon posts cased with iron, under the ends of the axle. Within the drum are inserted eight cross-pieces going from the axle to the circumference of the drum, and these are arranged round the drum at equal intervals. 2. Around the rim of the drum, boards are fixed with six-inch openings to receive the water. Further, along the axle, holes are cut, one for each bay. When it has been tarred ship-fashion, it is turned by men on a treadmill. The water which is drawn through the openings in the outside of the drum is delivered also through the holes next to the axle into a wooden basin having a trough connected with it. Thus an abundant supply of water is furnished for irrigating gardens, or for diluting salt in salt pits.</p>
