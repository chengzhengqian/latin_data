proceeds by lengthening the metopes or contracting the intercolumniations, it is faulty. Hence the ancients, as it seems, avoided the Doric order in temples.</p>
<p>3. Now we, following the arrangement demanded in accordance with the instruction of our masters, proceed in such a way that, if the reader will conform to our methods, he may find those proportions set forth by which he can carry out temples in the Doric style faultless and without blemish. The front of a Doric temple is to be divided along the line where columns are set, into 27 parts if it is tetrastyle, into 42 parts if it is hexastyle. Of these one part will be the module (which in Greek is called <span class="italic">embater</span>) and when this is determined, the distribution of all the work is produced by multiples of it. 4. The diameter of the columns will be two modules,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL251_221_1" id="target_note_LCL251_221_1"><sup>1</sup></a> the height including the capital 14, the height of the capital is one module, the width two modules and a sixth. The height of the capital is to be divided into three parts, of which one is to be the abacus with the cymatium; the second the echinus with fillets; the third the necking. The column is to be diminished as directed for the Ionic order in the third book. The height of the architrave is to be one module including the taenia and guttae; the taenia is to be the seventh part of a module; the length of the guttae under the taenia corresponds to the triglyphs, and is to hang down, including the fillet, the sixth part of a module. The breadth also of the architrave at the soffit is to correspond to the necking of the column at the top. Above the architrave are to be placed the triglyphs with the metopes; the triglyphs being a module
