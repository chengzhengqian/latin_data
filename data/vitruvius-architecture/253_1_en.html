the descent, the circuit, the bend, the compression of the air, can be thus managed when there is a regular fall from the fountain head to the city.</p>
<p>7. Again, it is not without advantage to put reservoirs at intervals of 200 actus (24,000 feet), so that if a fault arises anywhere, neither the whole load of water nor the whole structure may be disturbed, but it may be more easily found where the fault is. But these reservoirs are to be neither in the descent nor on the level portion of the bend, nor on the rise, nor generally in valleys, but on unbroken level ground.</p>
<p>8. But if we wish to employ a less expensive method, we must proceed as follows. Earthenware pipes are to be made not less than two inches thick, and so tongued that they may enter into and fit one another. The joints are to be coated with quicklime worked up with oil. At the descents to the bend, a block of red stone is to be placed at the actual elbow, and pierced so that the last pipe<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_187_1" id="target_note_LCL280_187_1"><sup>1</sup></a> on the incline, and the first from the level of the bend, may be jointed in the stone. In the same way uphill: the last from the level of the bend, and the first of the ascent, are to be jointed in the same way in the hollow of the red stone.</p>
<p>9. Thus, by adjusting the level of the tubes, the work will not be forced out of its place at the downward inclines and the ascents. For a strong current of air usually arises in the passage of water, so that it even breaks through rocks, unless, to begin with, the water is evenly and sparingly admitted from the fountain head, and controlled at the elbows and turns by bonding joints or a weight of ballast.
