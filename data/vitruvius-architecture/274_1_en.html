<p>2. When the moon in its passage moves towards the eastern parts of the sky, it begins to be released from the sun’s force, and the extreme edge of its shining hemisphere in a very thin line lets fall its splendour on the earth; and so therefrom it is called the second moon. Owing to the daily retardation of its revolution, the third and fourth moons and so on are numbered. On the seventh day let the sun be towards the west; the moon occupies the middle region of the sky and has half of the shining hemisphere turned upon the earth because it is distant from the sun by a space equal to the half part of the sky. But when the whole space of heaven separates the sun and moon, and the sun is opposed on the west to the rising moon, the moon, burning at a greater distance, is released from the sun’s rays,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_229_1a" id="target_note_LCL280_229_1a"><sup>1</sup></a> and on the fourteenth day sends forth its splendour with the full disk of its whole orb. During the remaining days there is a daily decrease until the lunar month is complete; the moon as it revolves along its course is recalled under the sun’s disk and rays, and now<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_229_2" id="target_note_LCL280_229_2"><sup>2</sup></a> completes the order of the days of the month.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_229_3" id="target_note_LCL280_229_3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>3. I will now explain how Aristarchus the mathematician of Samos, by his powerful intelligence, left in his systematic works an explanation of the moon’s phases. For it does not escape him that the moon has not its own proper light, and that it is like a mirror and receives its splendour from the sun’s
