The persons already enumerated and many others left behind them other discoveries, such as the Conical Spider, the Conical Ceiling and the Antiborean.
Many also have left instructions for making Hanging Dials for travellers. From such works anyone who wishes can find instructions, provided he understands the method of describing the analemma.</p>
<p>2. The same writers have also sought the methods of making water-clocks;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_257_1" id="target_note_LCL280_257_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and first, Ctesibius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_257_2" id="target_note_LCL280_257_2"><sup>2</sup></a> of Alexandria, who also discovered the nature of wind-pressure and the principles of pneumatics. It is worth a student’s while to learn how these discoveries were made. Now Ctesibius was the son of a barber and was born at Alexandria. He was marked out by his talent and great industry, and had the name of being especially fond of mechanical contrivances. On one occasion he wanted to hang the mirror in his father’s shop, in such a way that when it was pulled down and pulled up again, a hidden cord drew down the weight; and he made use of the following expedient.</p>
<p>3. He fixed a wooden channel under a beam of the ceiling, and inserted pulleys there. Along the channel he took the cord into a corner where he fixed upright tubes. In these he had a lead weight let down by the cord. Thus when the weight ran down into the narrow tubes, and compressed the air, the large amount of air was condensed as it ran violently down through the mouth of the tube and was forced into the open; meeting with an obstacle, the air was produced as a clear sound.</p>
