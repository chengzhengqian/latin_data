will be that when the lower drum has revolved 400 times, the upper drum will revolve once; and the tooth fixed on the side of the upper drum moves one tooth of the horizontal drum. Since, therefore, in 400 revolutions of the lower drum, the upper drum will revolve once, as it moves it will record thereby a distance of 5000 feet, that is, of 1000 paces. Hence when a stone falls, it will announce by its sound the traversing of a single mile, and the number of the stones collected from below will indicate, by their total, the number of miles for the dayâ€™s journey.</p>
<p>5. With a few changes, a similar procedure is adopted for sea voyages. For an axle is passed through the sides of the hull, with ends projecting beyond the ship. On these axles are projecting wheels with diameters of 4 1/2<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_323_1" id="target_note_LCL280_323_1"><sup>1</sup></a> feet, having paddles round the edge which touch the water. Also the middle of the axle in the middle of the ship has a drum with one tooth projecting beyond its circumference. At this place a case is fixed with a drum enclosed within, having 400 teeth at equal intervals corresponding to the teeth of the drum which is fixed on the axle. In addition, another single tooth is fixed to the side of the drum and projects beyond it. 6. Above, and adjoining it, another case is fixed, which contains a horizontal wheel toothed in the same way. Answering to these teeth, there is the tooth which is fixed on the side of the vertical drum. This tooth at each revolution drives one of the teeth which belong to the
