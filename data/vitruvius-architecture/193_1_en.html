they knew anyone prepared for such a duty. They gave the name of Aristophanes,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_67_1" id="target_note_LCL280_67_1"><sup>1</sup></a> who read each book in the library systematically day by day with comprehensive ardour and diligence. Therefore at the assemblage for the games special seats were allotted to the judges, and Aristophanes, being summoned with the rest, took his seat in the place allotted to him. 6. The competition for poets was first on the list; and when their poems were recited, the whole multitude by its utterances warned the judges what to approve. When, therefore, the judges were asked one by one, the six agreed and gave the first prize to the poet who, they observed, most pleased the audience; the second prize to the person who came next in their approval. Aristophanes,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_67_2" id="target_note_LCL280_67_2"><sup>2</sup></a> however, when his opinion was asked, voted that the first place should be given to the candidate who was least liked by the audience. 7. When the king<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_67_3" id="target_note_LCL280_67_3"><sup>3</sup></a> and all the company showed great indignation, he rose and obtained permission to speak. Amid a general silence he informed them that only one of the competitors was a true poet; the others recited borrowed work, whereas the judges had to deal with original compositions, not with plagiaries. The assembly were surprised and the king was doubtful. Aristophanes relying upon his memory produced a large number of papyrus rolls from certain bookcases,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_67_4" id="target_note_LCL280_67_4"><sup>4</sup></a> and comparing these with what had been recited he compelled the authors to confess they were thieves. The king then ordered them to be brought to trial for theft. They were condemned and dismissed in disgrace, while Aristophanes was raised to high office and became librarian.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_67_5" id="target_note_LCL280_67_5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
