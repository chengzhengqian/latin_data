is accompanied by gales, the drops may not reach the inside. 2. On the other three sides, spacious <span class="italic">exhedrae</span> (apsidal recesses) are to be planned with seats where philosophers, teachers of rhetoric and other studious persons can sit and discuss. In the double colonnade, however, these provisions are to be made. In the centre there is to be the <span class="italic">ephebeum</span> (a large apsidal recess with seats for young men) a third longer than it is wide; on the right the <span class="italic">coryceum</span> (for exercise with the quintain); next to this the <span class="italic">conisterium</span> (for athletes to powder themselves); adjoining the conisterium at the angle of the colonnade the cold bath which the Greeks call <span class="italic">loutron</span>; at the left of the ephebeum, the <span class="italic">elaeothesium</span> (for athletes to oil themselves); next to this is the cold room from which the furnace-room is entered at the angle of the colonnade. Adjoining this on the inside in line with the cold room, a vaulted sweating-room is to be placed, twice as long as it is broad, having in the angle of the colonnade the <span class="italic">Laconicum</span> (domed sweating room) constructed as before described (c. x 5), and opposite this a warm bath. In the palaestra, the cloisters ought to be thus completed and arranged.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL251_309_1" id="target_note_LCL251_309_1"><sup>1</sup></a> 3. Outside the palaestra three colonnades are to be arranged; the first, as you go out of the peristyle; right and left of this, two colonnades with running tracks. Of these three the one which has a north aspect, is to be built double and very wide; the others are to be single. On the sides which adjoin the walls and those which adjoin the columns, they are to have borders ten feet wide to serve as paths. The middle part is to be excavated with steps down from the paths to the level track a foot and a half below, and the track is to be not less than 12 feet
