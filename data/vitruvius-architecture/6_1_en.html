Let him not be greedy nor have his mind busied with acquiring gifts; but let him with seriousness guard his dignity by keeping a good name. And such are the injunctions of philosophy. Philosophy, moreover, explains the “nature of things”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL251_13_1" id="target_note_LCL251_13_1"><sup>1</sup></a> (and this in Greek is <span class="italic">physiologia</span>), a subject which it is necessary to have studied carefully because it presents many different natural problems, as, for example, in the case of water-supply. For in the case of watercourses, where there are channels or bends or where water is forced along on a levelled plane, natural air-pockets are produced in different ways, and the difficulties which they cause cannot be remedied by anyone unless he has learnt from philosophy the principles of nature.
