<p>1. Now that all these matters are set forth with careful skill, diligent consideration must be given. For we must choose a site in which the voice may fall smoothly, and may reach the ear with a definite utterance and without the interference of echoes. For there are some places which naturally hinder the passage of the voice: the dissonant which the Greek call <span class="italic">katechountes</span>; the circumsonant which are named by them <span class="italic">periechountes</span>; the resonant also which are called <span class="italic">antechountes</span>; the consonant which they name <span class="italic">synechountes.</span> The dissonant places are those in which the voice, when first it rises upwards, meets solid bodies above. It is driven back, and settling down, overwhelms the following utterance as it rises. 2. The circumsonant are those in which the voice moves round, is collected and dissipated in the centre. The terminations of the words are lost and the voice is swallowed up in a confused utterance. The resonant are those in which the words, striking against a solid body, give rise to echoes and make the termination of the words double to the ear. The consonant also are those in which the voice reinforced from the ground rises with greater fulness, and reaches the ear with clear and eloquent accents. Thus if careful observation is exercised in the choice of sites, such skill will be rewarded by the improved effect of the actorsâ€™ voices. To sum up, the outlines of the plans will be marked by these differences among themselves, namely, those plans follow Greek usage which are designed from squares; the Roman
