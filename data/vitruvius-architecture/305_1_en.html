fixed the ends of the architraves in the middle of the wheels. In the same way he fixed pivots and sockets at the ends of the architraves. Thus when the frames of four-inch timber were drawn by the oxen, the pivots moving in the sockets turned the wheels, while the architraves being enclosed like axles in the wheels (in the same way as the shafts) reached the building without delay. (A similar machine<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_291_1" id="target_note_LCL280_291_1"><sup>1</sup></a> is used when rollers level the walks in the palaestrae.) This expedient would not have been possible unless, to begin with, the distance had been short. It is not more than eight miles from the quarries to the temple, and there are no hills but an unbroken plain.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_291_2" id="target_note_LCL280_291_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>13. Within living memory, when the base of the colossal statue of Apollo in the temple had been cracked across by age, it was feared lest the statue should give way and be broken, and a contract was let out for cutting a base from the same quarries. A certain Paconius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_291_3" id="target_note_LCL280_291_3"><sup>3</sup></a> undertook the contract. The base was 12 feet long, 8 feet wide, 6 feet high. Paconius was so proud of his reputation that he did not convey it after the manner of Metagenes, but decided to construct a similar machine in another way. 14. He made two wheels about 15 feet in diameter and in them he enclosed the ends of the stone. Next, he fixed two-inch pieces less than a foot apart round the stone lengthwise from wheel to wheel. Then he wound a rope outside the wood pieces and drew the rope with a yoke of oxen. When the rope was pulled it caused the wheels to turn. However, he could not keep the machine straight along the road, but it kept
