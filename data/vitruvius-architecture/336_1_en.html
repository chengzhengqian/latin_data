<h3><span class="sc">on the tortoise of hagetor</span></h3>
<p>1. <span class="sc">There</span> is also another kind of tortoise which has everything in the manner above described except the rafters. Instead it has a parapet and battlements made of boards with sloping eaves above; these are held together by boards and skins securely fixed. Over these clay kneaded with hair is applied to such a thickness that fire cannot damage the machine. If it is required, these machines can be on eight wheels; but it will be necessary to adjust them to the lie of the ground.

The uprights which were set up on the frame, four in number, were each made of two timbers, of a height for each of 36 feet, and 15 inches broad with a thickness of 18 inches.
