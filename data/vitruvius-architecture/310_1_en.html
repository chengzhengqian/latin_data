the undivided solid weight is shared in a definite proportion, and each labourer carries an equal part of the load on his neck. For the middle parts of the carrying-poles, on which the straps of the porters are fixed, are provided with pegs so that the straps do not slip out of their place. For when the load slips away from the middle, it presses upon that side to which it is nearer, just as in the case of the weight on a balance when it is adjusted nearer one end of the beam.</p>
<p>8. In the same way, yokes of oxen draw their loads evenly, when the yokes are arranged about the middle, by the thongs of the yoke-straps. But when the strength of the oxen is not equal, and one by its greater pull burdens the other, the thong is moved on so that one part of the yoke is longer so as to help the weaker beast. Thus in the case of carrying-poles<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_301_1" id="target_note_LCL280_301_1"><sup>1</sup></a>
and yokes, when the suspending thong is not placed in the middle but on one side, where the thong departs from the middle, it renders one side shorter and the other longer. By this means when the two arms of the yoke turn about the centre at which the thong is placed, the longer part describes a greater circle, the shorter arm a less.</p>
<p>9. Now just as smaller wheels are harder and more awkward to turn, so when carrying-poles and yokes have a less interval from the centre to the end of the arm, they press upon the neck, but those which have longer spaces from the same centre, ease off the load both in hauling and carrying.
