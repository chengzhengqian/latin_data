not rely upon these places, but water is to be sought in those regions and soils other than marshes in which such trees are found naturally, and not artificially planted.</p>
<p>4. When such a discovery is indicated, we must make trials in the following way. A hole is to be dug not less than three feet square and five feet deep, and about sunset a bronze or lead vessel, or a basin, is to be placed there. Whichever it is, must be smeared inside with oil and put upside down, and the top of the hole covered with rushes or leaves; and earth must be thrown above. On the next day it is to be opened, and if there are drops of water and moisture in the vessel, water will be found.</p>
<p>5. Further, if a vessel made of clay, but not burnt, be covered in the same way and put in the pit, if there is water in the place, the vessel will be moist when opened and soon be destroyed by the moisture. Or if a fleece of wool is placed in the hole, and next day water can be squeezed from it, it will show that water is abundant there. Similarly let a lamp be trimmed and filled with oil and lit. If it is covered and put in that place and on the following day it is not burnt out, but has traces of the oil and wick and is itself found moist, it will show that water is found there, because all heat draws moisture to itself. Again, if a fire is made there and the soil which is heated and burnt raises a misty vapour from itself, the place will supply water. 6. When these experiments have been made and the above mentioned signs of water found, a well is to be sunk. If a head of
