themselves are to be channelled to the twelfth part of their height. These will be the proportions of capitals when the columns shall be up to twenty-five feet. Those which are more will have their other proportions after the same fashion. The length and breadth of the abacus will be the thickness of the column at its base with the addition of one-ninth:
inasmuch as its diminution is less as the height is greater, the capital must not have less addition in projection and height. 8. At the end of the book a diagram and formula will be furnished for the drawing of the volutes so that they may be correctly turned by the compass.</p>
<p>When the capitals are completed they are to be set, not level through the range of columns, but with a corresponding adjustment; so that the architraves in the upper members may correspond to the addition in the stylobates. The proportion of the architraves should be as follows: if the columns are from twelve to fifteen feet, the height of the architrave should be half the thickness of the column at the bottom; from fifteen to twenty feet let the height of the column be divided into thirteen parts, and the height of the architrave be one part; from twenty to twenty-five feet, let the height be divided into twelve parts and a half, and let the architrave be one part of that in height; also from twenty-five to thirty let it be divided into twelve parts, and let the height be made of one part. Thus the heights of the architraves are to be determined in accordance with the height of the columns. 9. For the higher the glance of the eye rises, it pierces with the more difficulty the denseness of the air; therefore it fails owing to the
