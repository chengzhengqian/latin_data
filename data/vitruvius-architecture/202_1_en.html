<p>5. Such pavements are most suitable to be used in the open. For wood floors swell with damp, or shrink in dry weather, or sag and settle, and make faulty pavements by giving way. Besides, ice and hoar-frost hinder their durability. But if need compels, we must limit their failure as far as possible in the following manner. After laying the floor, a second floor is to be laid above cross-wise; being fixed with nails, it will furnish a double coating to the joists. Then a third part of broken pottery is to be mixed in the fresh rubble, and two parts of lime are to answer to five<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_85_1" id="target_note_LCL280_85_1"><sup>1</sup></a> when mixed in the mortar.</p>
<p>6. Let the ground be spread with this, and the rubble be laid over it and pounded thoroughly to a thickness of not less than a foot. Then the finishing coat is to be put on as already described, and the pavement is to be laid with tesserae about two inches thick, with a fall of two inches in ten feet. If this is well mixed and properly rubbed over, it will be safe against all damage. That the mortar between the joints may not be affected by the frost, let it be soaked every year with oil lees before the winter. In this way it will not take up the frost into itself.</p>
<p>7. But if special care seems to be needed, tiles two feet square jointed together are to be laid upon the pavement of mortar, with small channels an inch deep on each side. When these are joined, lime tempered with oil is to be filled in, and the joints are to be pressed together and rubbed down. Thus the lime which will remain in the channels will harden and prevent water or anything else from passing
