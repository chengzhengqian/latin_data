the levelling is successful. Further, when we have levelled with the chorobates, we shall know the amount of the fall.</p>
<p>3. Perhaps the student of the works of Archimedes may say that true levelling cannot be made by means of water, because his theory is that the surface of water is not level, but is that of a sphere of which the centre is that of the earth. But whether the surface of the water is plane or spherical, it is necessary that the extreme ends of the plank should uphold the water evenly. But if there be a fall at one end, the end which is higher will not have water up to the lips of the channel. For while it is necessary that where water is poured along, there should be an inflation and curvature in the middle, it is also necessary that the ends, right and left, should be level one with another. A drawing of the chorobates is furnished at the end of the book. If the fall is considerable, the flow of the water will be made easier. If there are marshy intervals, the assistance of substructures must be sought.</p>

And they are arranged as follows. In the case of channels, the structure must be on a very solid foundation; the bed of the current must be levelled with a fall of not less than 6 inches in 100 feet. The channels are to be arched over to
