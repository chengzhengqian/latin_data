Above the pedestal, the columns with capitals and bases are to be of a height equal to one quarter of the diameter; the architrave and ornaments, one fifth part of their height. The parapet above, with its base and cornice, is to be one half of the lower parapet (or pedestal). Above the parapet are to be columns one fourth less in height than the lower ones; the architrave and ornaments a fifth of those columns. If there is to be a third order, the top parapet is to be half of the middle one. The top columns are to be one quarter less in height than the middle; the architraves with the cornices are also to have one fifth of the height of those columns.</p>
<p>7. Nevertheless it is not in all theatres that the dimensions can answer to all the effects proposed. The architect must observe in what proportions symmetry must be followed, and how it must be adjusted to the nature of the site or the magnitude of the work. For there are details which must be of the same dimensions both in a small, and in a large theatre, since their use is the same. Such are the steps, the semi-circular passages, the parapets, the ordinary passages, the steps up, the height of the stage, the boxes<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL251_287_1" id="target_note_LCL251_287_1"><sup>1</sup></a>; and whatever else occurs to compel us to depart from proportion in the interest of convenience. Similarly if scantness<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL251_287_2" id="target_note_LCL251_287_2"><sup>2</sup></a> of materials, such as marble, timber and other supplies, meet us in the work, it will not be inappropriate to make slight additions or deductions, provided this is done with taste and so as to avoid a clumsy effect. Such will be the result, if the architect in addition to being experienced, is not devoid of a versatile mind and technical skill.</p>
