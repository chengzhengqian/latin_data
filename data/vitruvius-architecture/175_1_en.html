But if the columns in the peristyle are to be in the Doric style, the modules are to be taken as I described in the fourth book<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL280_31_1" id="target_note_LCL280_31_1"><sup>1</sup></a> about Doric detail, and the columns and triglyphs arranged accordingly.</p>
<p>8. The length of <span class="italic">triclinia,</span> or dining-rooms, must be twice their width.
