<p>Nonius: ‘Auspicavi’ for ‘auspicatus sum.’ . . . Caecilius in <span class="italic">The Little Necklace</span>—</p>
<p>It’s an unhealthy augury; quite different is the actors’ augury from what happens when magistrates take the auspices for the state.</p>
<p>
<span class="italic">The father of the guilty youth, after a soliloquy, converses with a neighbour about troublesome wives</span>:</p>
<p>Gellius: We had a fancy to read also <span class="italic">The Little Necklace</span> of Menander, which Caecilius had adapted for <span class="italic">his</span> comedy. . . . How dull and stiff was Caecilius revealed right from the beginning! What great alterations he made in Menander’s material! . . . Our reading in due course had reached the passage in which an old husband was making a great to-do about his wife, who was rich and ugly, complaining that he had been forced to put up for sale a handmaid who rendered skilled service and was very good-looking; his wife suspected her of being his mistress. . . . Menander writes thus:</p>

</a> can go to sleep on both cheeks. She has done a doughty deed which will make a big noise everywhere; she has cast out of the house the girl she wanted to, one who provoked her, so that the whole neighbourhood may gaze on the face of, why—Crobyle, and that she, my illustrious wife, may be a tyrant over me. As for the looks which she got herself, well, she’s an ass amongst apes, as the saying is. I’d rather say nothing about the night which was the prime cause of many troubles. Oh! Damn it! That I should have chosen to marry Crobyle with a dowry of sixteen talents and a nose a yard long! And besides, is her snortiness by any means to be put up with? No! By Zeus in heaven and by Athena, not at all! And the little serving girl must be led away before you can say a word.</p>
