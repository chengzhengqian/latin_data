<h2>The Little Necklace</h2>
<p>knowing that his betrothed was the girl he had himself ruined and that the baby was his, decided to repudiate her, and the wedding was stopped, but the girl’s father decided to bring the matter into court. Then came the dénouement—through a necklace the girl and the youth recognised each other as the parents of the baby; the betrothal was renewed, and Parmeno was made free. See R. Argenio, in <span class="italic">Il Mondo Classico</span>, 1937, 359 ff.</p>
<p>In the fragments of Caecilius we can distinguish the follow ing characters:</p>
<p>(A) the guilty youth’s father, husband of Crobyle. (B) an elderly neighbour of (A). (C) a friend of the slave Parmeno? (see below). (D) a poor peasant, father of the betrayed girl. Parmeno, slave of (D). Crobyle, wife of (A). (Cf. Allinson, <span class="italic">Menander,</span> p. 432, 407 K.)</p>
