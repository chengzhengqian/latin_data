<p>Gellius goes on: Quite apart from charm of ideas and diction, which is by no means the same in the two works, I am generally impressed by the fact that where Menander wrote brilliantly and wittily and to the point, Caecilius has not tried to reproduce even where he might have, but has passed them over as not in the least worthy of approbation, and has crammed in some farcical tricks, and in some way or other has altogether missed that simple and delightful effect of Menander’s, which is so true to nature and is taken from the very heart of human life. For that same old husband, in conversation with a second person, another old man, calls down curses on the haughtiness of his wealthy wife in these words:</p>
<p>(A) I’ve got an heiress-witch. Haven’t I told you this? Haven’t I really then? Well, as the mistress of the house and fields and absolutely everything, we have, by Apollo, a thing most tiresome of the tiresome. She’s a nuisance to everyone, not only to me, but her son too and much more to her daughter.</p>
<p>(B) There’s no fighting with that kind of thing.</p>
<p>(A) Don’t I know it well!</p>

(A) uses the phrase in the sense of ‘breath that makes you want to vomit,’ ‘nauseous breath,’ and means his wife’s. But (B) thinks of the phrase in the meaning of
‘with a starved soul.’ The wife wants to smell (A’s) breath. Nonius gives most of this passage to illustrate <span class="italic">anima</span> in the sense of <span class="italic">alitus oris et odor.</span>
