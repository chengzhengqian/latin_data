<span class="line">There’s often wisdom even underneath</span><span class="linebreak"></span>

<p>If you bring Confidence with you, confide everything to her.</p>
<span class="label">257</span>
<p>Symmachus: Rightly does Caecilius, a writer of comedies, say—</p>
<p>Man to man is a god if he knows his duty.</p>
