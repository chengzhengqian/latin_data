<p>Gellius: It is quite clear what opinion we ought to hold on that scene also—it occurs in both comedies—of which the following is more or less the purport. The daughter of a poor man was outraged during a sacred vigil. The occurrence was kept secret from her father, and she was still taken for a virgin. Made big with child by that outrage she gave birth when the sum of months was past. A slave of good character, while he was standing before the doors of the house, not knowing that his master’s daughter was approaching delivery, and being quite unaware that she had suffered outrage, heard the cries and entreaties of the girl in the throes of childbirth. He is frightened, angry, suspicious, full of pity, and sad. All these emotions and feelings of his mind are, at any rate in the Greek comedy, wonderfully vivid and clear. But in Caecilius’ play all this is dull and void of all the dignity and grace of expression which the occasion demands.</p>

<p>Does a woman usually give birth in the tenth month?</p>
