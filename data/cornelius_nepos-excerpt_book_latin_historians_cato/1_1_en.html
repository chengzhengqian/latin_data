<p><span class="bold">1.</span> Marcus Cato, born in the town of Tusculum, in his early youth, before entering on an official career, lived in the land of the Sabines, since he had there an hereditary property, left him by his father. Then, with the encouragement of Lucius Valerius Flaccus, later his colleague in the consulship and the censorship—as Marcus Perpenna, the ex-censor, was fond of mentioning—he moved to Rome and entered public

with Gaius Helvius. As praetor he was allotted the province of Sardinia, from which at an earlier time,<span class="marginNote right">198 <span class="sc">b.c.</span></span>
when leaving Africa after his quaestorship, he had brought the poet Ennius to Rome—an act which, in my opinion, was no less glorious than the greatest possible victory in Sardinia.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL467_283_4" id="target_note_LCL467_283_4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
