This request he obtained by a unanimous vote; indeed, the senate voluntarily voted Trajan many more honours than Hadrian had requested. In this letter to the senate he apologized because he had not left it the right to decide regarding his accession,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_19_4" id="target_note_LCL139_19_4"><sup>4</sup></a> explaining that the unseemly haste of the troops in acclaiming him emperor was due to the belief that the state could not be without an emperor. Later, when the senate offered him the triumph which was to have been Trajan’s, he refused it for himself, and caused the effigy of the dead Emperor to be carried in a triumphal chariot, in order that the best of emperors might not lose even after death the honour of a triumph.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_19_5a" id="target_note_LCL139_19_5a"><sup>5</sup></a> Also he refused for the present the title of Father of his Country, offered to him at the time of his accession and again later on, giving as his reason the fact that Augustus had not won it until late in life.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_19_6" id="target_note_LCL139_19_6"><sup>6</sup></a> Of the crown-money<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_21_1" id="target_note_LCL139_21_1"><sup>1</sup></a>
