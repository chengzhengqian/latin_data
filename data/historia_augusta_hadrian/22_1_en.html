This was done in connection with the “founding” of the new colony in 130; accordingly, this sentence is not in chronological order. The war was actually begun after Hadrian’s departure from Egypt, and finally necessitated his return. The outbreak was quelled, after much bloodshed, in 134.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL139_45_1').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL139_45_2"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL139_45_2" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">2</sup>Probably the mountain of this name at the mouth of the river Orontes.

Mus., <span class="italic">Alex</span>., p. 101, No. 871), to Syria and Asia Minor. During a stay at Athens he dedicated the Olympieion (cf. note to c. xiii. 6) in 131-132; see Dio, lxix. 16, 1. He was then called to Judaea on account of the long duration of the Jewish revolt (see note to c. xiv. 2).
