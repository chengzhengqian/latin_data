Legacies from persons unknown to him he refused, and even those left to him by acquaintances he would not accept if they had any children. In regard to treasure-trove, he ruled that if anyone made a find on his own property he might keep it, if on another’s land, he should turn over half to the proprietor thereof, if on the state’s, he should share the find equally with the privy-purse.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_57_2a" id="target_note_LCL139_57_2a"><sup>2</sup></a> He forbade masters to kill their slaves, and ordered that any who deserved it should be sentenced by the courts. He forbade anyone to sell a slave or a maidservant to a procurer or trainer of gladiators without giving a reason therefor. He ordered that those who had wasted their property, if legally responsible, should be flogged in the amphitheatre and then let go. Houses of hard labour for slaves and free he abolished. He provided separate baths for the sexes.
