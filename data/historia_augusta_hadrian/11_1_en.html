He then hastened to Rome in order to win over public opinion, which was hostile to him because of the belief that on one single occasion he had suffered four men of consular rank to be put to death. In order to check the rumours about himself, he gave in person a double largess to the people,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_23_1" id="target_note_LCL139_23_1"><sup>1</sup></a> although in his absence three aurei<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_23_2" id="target_note_LCL139_23_2"><sup>2</sup></a> had already been given to each of the citizens. In the senate, too, he cleared himself of blame for what had happened, and pledged himself never to inflict punishment on a senator until after a vote of the senate.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_23_3" id="target_note_LCL139_23_3"><sup>3</sup></a> He established a regular imperial post,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_23_4" id="target_note_LCL139_23_4"><sup>4</sup></a> in order to relieve the local officials of such a burden. Moreover, he used every means of gaining popularity.

Neither the later Julio-Claudian nor the Flavian emperors had recognized the right of a senator to trial by his fellow-senators only. Nerva, on the other hand, took an oath that he would not put a senator to death (Dio, lxviii. 2), and Trajan seems to have followed his example (Dio, lxviii. 5).
