At this same time he incurred grave danger and won great glory; for while he was walking about in a garden at Tarragona one of the slaves of the household rushed at him madly with a sword. But he merely laid hold on the man, and when the servants ran to the rescue handed him over to them. Afterwards, when it was found that the man was mad, he turned him over to the physicians for treatment, and all this time showed not the slightest sign of alarm.</p>
<p>During this period and on many other occasions also, in many regions where the barbarians are held back not by rivers but by artificial barriers, Hadrian shut them off by means of high stakes planted deep in the ground and fastened together in the manner of a palisade.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_39_2" id="target_note_LCL139_39_2"><sup>2</sup></a> He appointed a king for the Germans, suppressed revolts among the Moors,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_39_3" id="target_note_LCL139_39_3"><sup>3</sup></a> and won from the senate the usual ceremonies of thanksgiving.
