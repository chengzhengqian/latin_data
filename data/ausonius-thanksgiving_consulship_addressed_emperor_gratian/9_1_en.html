had nothing more to long for.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL115_235_1" id="target_note_LCL115_235_1"><sup>1</sup></a> I for my part, though I am a consul and an old man to boot, will confess to a ravenous appetite. I long to see you, Gratian, holding this office so many more times that your total may equal the sum of the six consulships of Valerius Corvinus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL115_235_2" id="target_note_LCL115_235_2"><sup>2</sup></a> the seven of Caius Marius, and the thirteen of Augustus, whose name you bear. Your youth and your exalted station can secure for you a still greater number; but I am sparing in my estimate, because you are so generous in bestowing this honour.

Such a conviction have all men felt, in such wise have you yourself created this
