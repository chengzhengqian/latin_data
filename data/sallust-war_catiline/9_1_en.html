But at first men’s minds were stirred less by avarice than a desire for advancement—a fault, yet one not so far removed from virtue; for the noble and the ignoble man alike crave for themselves glory, public office, and power; but the former strives by the true path, whereas the latter, being without noble qualities, contends with craft and deception. Avarice entails the pursuit of money, which no wise man covets; avarice, as though steeped with noxious poisons, renders a manly body and mind effeminate; it is always boundless and insatiable; it is lessened neither by plenty nor want. But after Lucius Sulla had regained control of the state by arms<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL116_37_11" id="target_note_LCL116_37_11"><sup>11</sup></a> and brought about bad results despite good beginnings, all men began to rob and pillage; one coveted a house, another lands; the victors showed neither moderation nor restraint, but did shameful and cruel deeds against their fellow citizens. To this was added the fact that Lucius Sulla, so as to secure the loyalty of the army which he had led in Asia, had allowed it luxury and excessive license contrary to our ancestral custom; charming and pleasure-filled places had easily sapped the warlike spirit of his soldiers in their idle moments. There it was that an army of the Roman people first became accustomed to indulge in women and wine; to admire statues, paintings, and chased vessels; to steal them from private houses and public places; to pillage shrines, and to desecrate everything, both sacred and profane. These soldiers, therefore, after they had achieved victory, left nothing to the vanquished. In truth, prosperity tries wise men’s souls; still less could men of depraved character like those temper victory.</p>
