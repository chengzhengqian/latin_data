nor by dangers; the fear in his heart obstructs his ears. I have, however, called you together to offer a few words of advice, and at the same time to reveal the motive for my decision.</p>
<p>“Indeed you know, soldiers, how much disaster the folly and inaction of Lentulus brought upon himself and us, and how, while I was waiting for reinforcements from the City, I could not set out for Gaul. Now, moreover, you all understand as well as I do in what a position our affairs stand. Two hostile armies, one in the direction of the City, the other in the direction of Gaul, block the way. Lack of grain and of other necessities prevents us from remaining any longer in this locale, even if we were most inclined to do so. Wherever we decide to go, we must hew a path with steel. Therefore I advise you to be brave and ready in spirit, and, when you enter the battle, to remember that you carry in your own right hands riches, honor, glory, and on top of that, freedom and your native land. If we win, complete security will be ours; supplies will abound, towns and colonies will open their gates. If we yield out of fear, those same circumstances will be against us: no place and no friend will protect the man whom arms have not protected.</p>
<p>“Moreover, soldiers, we and our opponents are not subject to the same constraint; we are contending for our native land, for freedom, for our very lives; theirs is a pointless exercise, to fight on behalf of the power of a few men. Attack, therefore, more boldly, mindful of your former valor. You had the option of spending your life in exile, under a cloud of utter infamy; some of you could have looked to others for aid in Rome after losing your possessions. Because those options seemed base and intolerable to true men, you resolved to pursue this course.
