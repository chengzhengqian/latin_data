<p>51. “Members of the Senate, all men who deliberate upon difficult questions had best be devoid of hatred, friendship, anger and pity. When those feelings stand in the way, the mind cannot at all easily discern the truth, and no one has ever served at the same time his passions and his best interests. When you apply your intellect, it prevails; if passion takes control, it is master, whereas the mind is entirely impotent. I can mention, Members of the Senate, plenty of examples of kings and nations who made bad decisions under the influence of wrath or pity. But I prefer to speak of those deeds which our forefathers did properly and in due order contrary to the impulse of passion. In the Macedonian war, which we waged with King Perses, the great and glorious community of the Rhodians, which had flourished thanks to the support of the Roman people, was unfaithful and opposed to us.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL116_109_116" id="target_note_LCL116_109_116"><sup>116</sup></a> But after the war was over and the question of the Rhodians was discussed, our ancestors let them go unpunished so that no one might say that war had been undertaken more because of the wealth of the Rhodians than their misconduct.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL116_109_117a" id="target_note_LCL116_109_117a"><sup>117</sup></a> So, too, in all the Punic wars,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL116_109_118" id="target_note_LCL116_109_118"><sup>118</sup></a> although the Carthaginians both in peacetime and during truces had often done many abominable deeds, our ancestors never did likewise when they had the opportunity, but they took into consideration what conduct would be consistent with their dignity rather than what action could be justified against the Carthaginians.
