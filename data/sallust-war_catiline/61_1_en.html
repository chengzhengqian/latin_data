If you want to forsake it, there is need for boldness; no one, except the victor, exchanges war for peace. For to hope for safety in flight when you have turned away from the enemy the arms which protect your body, such conduct is surely madness. In battle the greatest danger always threatens those who show the greatest fear; boldness serves as a rampart.</p>

Your spirit, youth, and valor encourage me, not to mention necessity, which makes even the timid brave. For the narrowness of this place prevents the throng of our enemies from being able to surround us. But if Fortune frowns upon your bravery, take care not to lose your lives unavenged, nor to be captured and slaughtered like cattle rather than leaving the enemy a bloody and mournful victory by fighting like heroes.”</p>
