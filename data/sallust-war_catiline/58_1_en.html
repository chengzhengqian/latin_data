<p>56. While this was taking place in Rome, Catiline formed two legions out of the whole force which he had brought with him and Manlius already had; he filled up the cohorts in proportion to the number of soldiers on hand; then whenever a volunteer or any of his confederates came to the camp, he distributed them equally, and within a brief span he had filled up the legions with a full complement of men, although in the beginning he had had no more than two thousand soldiers.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL116_135_141" id="target_note_LCL116_135_141"><sup>141</sup></a> But only about a fourth part of the entire force was equipped with regular arms;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL116_135_142" id="target_note_LCL116_135_142"><sup>142</sup></a> the others, just as chance had armed them, carried hunting spears or lances, or in some cases sharpened stakes.</p>
<p>Now after Antonius began to draw near with his army, Catiline marched through the mountains, moved his camp now toward the City and now in the direction of Gaul; he did not give the enemy an opportunity for battle; he was hoping shortly to have a large force, if his confederates in Rome accomplished their undertakings. Meanwhile he turned away slaves (a great abundance of whom was flocking to him at first) because he had confidence in the strength of the conspiracy, and at the same time because he thought it harmful to his interests to appear to have linked a citizens’ cause with runaway slaves.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL116_135_143" id="target_note_LCL116_135_143"><sup>143</sup></a></p>
