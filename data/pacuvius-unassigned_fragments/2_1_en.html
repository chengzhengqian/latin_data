</p>
<span class="label">4–5</span>
<p>Paulus: ‘Trabica navis’ is a ship so called because it is made of ‘trabes’ nailed together. Pacuvius—
</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">the plank-built boat glides on the channel.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p></blockquote>
<span class="label">6</span>
<p>An augmenter of Servius, on ‘with a rumble from the mountain’ in Virgil: Pacuvius wrote thus—

</p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">because a rumble attends the winds.</p>
