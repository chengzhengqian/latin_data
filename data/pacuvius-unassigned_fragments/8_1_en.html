<span class="line indent1">Untrustworthy, unstaid; and, they repeat,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent1">Sightless she is because she nothing sees</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent1">Whereto she’ll steer herself: and brutish too</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent1">Because she cannot tell between the man</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent1">That’s worthy and the unworthy. But there are</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
