<p>smaller. In composing them, if it is a question of utility, I have been at play: if of trouble, I have been hard at work. I have called this little book <span class="italic">Technopaegnion,</span> that you might not think it has been all work without play for me, or all play without skill.</p>

<h2><span class="ac"><span class="sc">II.—Ausonius to his Friend Paulinus</span></span></h2>
<p>I <span class="sc">am</span> sending you my <span class="italic">Technopaegnion,</span> the poor unprofitable outcome of inactive leisure. It consists in verses begun with monosyllables and ended with monosyllables. But the rock-strewn<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL096_289_1" id="target_note_LCL096_289_1"><sup>1</sup></a> difficulty of the task did not stop there, but went on further to the heart-breaking business of linking up, so that the monosyllable which was the ending of one verse might also become the beginning of the line following. You may well exclaim, then: “Heavens, what time and toil!” Of a surety I have spent my pains upon a useless task: it is small, yet it brings a sense of surfeit; it is disjointed, yet a hopeless tangle; though it is something, it is proved to be worth just nothing. Nevertheless, I have taken pains to give it something of learning and lore; for the rule I was bound to keep debarred the lighter graces of poetry and rhetoric. To sum up, you will find here nothing pretty, but (with the change of a few letters) something to pity and to resolve never to imitate. And if you should come down into these depths also, you will find the cramping of your ideas and powers of expression causes you greater discomfort than your effort at imitation affords you delight.</p>
