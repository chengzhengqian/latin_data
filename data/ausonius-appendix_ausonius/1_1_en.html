<h2>I.—Sayings of the Seven Sages</h2>
<h2>(<span class="sc">i</span>) <span class="italic">Bias of Priene</span></h2>
<p><span class="sc">What</span> is the sum of all good? A heart ever conscious of right. What is man’s greatest bane? His brother man alone. Who is the rich man? He who will long for nothing. Who is the poor man? The miser. What is the fairest dowry wedded wives can bring? A modest life. Who is the chaste woman? She about whom scandal fears to lie. What deed marks a wise man? To refuse to hurt another when he might. What is the fool’s badge? To wish to hurt another though he cannot.</p>

<h2>(<span class="sc">ii</span>) <span class="italic">Pittacus of Mitylene</span></h2>
<p>He who cannot hold his tongue will not know how to speak. I would rather please one good man than many bad. A fool envies the proud man in prosperity, a fool laughs at the grief of the unhappy. Obey the law whoever you be who made the law. If Fortune smile, you gather many friends: if Fortune frowns, you find few true friends.</p>
