<p>VIII. Marcus Pompilius Andronicus, a native of Syria, because of his devotion to the Epicurean sect was considered somewhat indolent in his work as a grammarian and not qualified to conduct a school. Therefore, realizing that he was held in less esteem at Rome, not only than Antonius Gnipho, but than others of even less ability, he moved to Cumae, where he led a quiet life and wrote many books. But he was so poor and needy that he was forced to sell that admirable little work of his “Criticisms of the Annals of Ennius”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL038_392_15" id="target_note_LCL038_392_15"><sup>15</sup></a> to someone or other for sixteen thousand sesterces. Orbilius tells us that he bought up these books after they had been suppressed, and caused them to be circulated under their author’s name.</p>

<p>IX. Lucius Orbilius Pupillus of Beneventum, left alone in the world by the death of his parents, both of whom were slain on the selfsame day by treacherous enemies, at first earned a living as an attendant on the magistrates. He then served as a subaltern in Macedonia, and later in the cavalry. After completing his military service, he resumed his studies, to which he had given no little attention from boyhood; and after teaching for a long time in his native place, he at last went to Rome in his fiftieth year, when Cicero was consul,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL038_393_16" id="target_note_LCL038_393_16"><sup>16</sup></a> where he gave instruction with greater renown than profit. For in one of his books, written when he was well on in years, he admits that he was poor and lived under the tiles.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL038_393_17" id="target_note_LCL038_393_17"><sup>17</sup></a> He also wrote a book called “On Folly,” full of complaints of the wrongs which teachers suffered</p>
