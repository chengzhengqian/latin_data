<p>XXXII. Or was it to secure the collusion<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL198_315_a" id="target_note_LCL198_315_a"><sup>a</sup></a> of<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">87</span><span class="br"></span> Cluentius? That too is an act of judicial corruption. But what need, for such a purpose, of a juror as go-between? Why, indeed, should the whole alleged transaction have been conducted through the agency of Staienus, a dirty scoundrel who had nothing to do with either party, and not through some honest man, a friend and connexion of both? But why do I labour my point as if there were any doubt about it, when the actual sum employed shows us by its figures and its total not only the amount but its purpose? I depose that, to secure the acquittal of Oppianicus sixteen jurors would have had to be bribed: 640,000 sesterces were paid to Staienus.

Far from it: before to-day your contention has never come before a court as a direct issue. Much as the case has been discussed, long as it has been canvassed, this is the first day on which it has been defended, the first on which truth, emboldened by this honourable court, has raised her voice to answer prejudice. But as for those many previous trials, what do they amount to? I have fortified myself
