For he may have been annoyed at being brought to book over speeches of public import in which consistency, perhaps, is more to be expected. But for my part, I feel no<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">142</span><span class="br"></span> annoyance at your having read out the passages you did, for they were inappropriate neither to their own times nor to the case in question; and in making the remarks you quote, I incurred no such responsibility as to affect my honour or my freedom in defending this case. But if I should choose to admit that, though I have now examined the case of Aulus Cluentius, I previously shared the popular prejudice of the time, who, pray, could find fault with me for that? Especially as it is only fair that from you also, gentlemen, I should gain the request that I made to you at the beginning and now make to you again—the request that, should you have come into this court with an unfavourable impression of that trial, you lay it aside now that you have come to understand the case, and to know the whole truth about it.</p>

Accius, that you were greatly mistaken in supposing that I should base my defence of my client’s case not upon its merits but upon its legal aspect. For you claimed again and again to have information that I meant to defend it by the protection afforded by the statute.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL198_375_b" id="target_note_LCL198_375_b"><sup>b</sup></a> Is that so?
