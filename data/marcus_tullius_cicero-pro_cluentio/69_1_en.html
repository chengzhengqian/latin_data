And do you propose to do<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">129</span><span class="br"></span> the same when making up the list of the senate in your capacity as censor? Should there be several who have taken a bribe to condemn the innocent, will you, instead of visiting the crime on all, choose at your pleasure and elect for degradation a few out of many? Shall the senate then, to your knowledge and before your eyes, retain one single member, the Roman people a single juror, the state a single citizen who has compassed the ruin of the innocent by selling his honour and his oath, and who has not suffered ignominy for it? And shall the man who, for money’s sake, robbed an innocent citizen of his country, his fortunes, and his children, shall he, I say, not be branded with the stigma of the censor’s stem displeasure? Or shall the measure of punishment designed by our forefathers as a warning to the cowardice of a soldier in time of war, be equally applied by you to the dishonesty of a senator in time of peace? Had this precedent, drawn from military usage, been applicable to the infliction of the censorial stigma, here too it should have been carried out by the drawing of lots. But if it is consistent with a censor’s duty to ballot for punishment and to submit the conduct of criminals to the arbitrament of chance, surely it is wrong, where many have sinned, to pick and choose only a few for the infliction of ignominy.</p>
