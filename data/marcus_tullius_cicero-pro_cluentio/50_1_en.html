I hold that of the actual facts of the case no single item can have changed. Whence<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">93</span><span class="br"></span> comes it, then, that my case is being heard in such deep silence now, whereas Junius then was deprived even of the chance of defending himself? The reason is that then the case was wholly at the mercy of prejudice, misunderstanding, suspicion, and the spirit of lawlessness and tumult which daily animated the mass meetings. The accuser was a tribune of the people: whether on the platform or before the court, a tribune still; and he came into court straight from his mass meeting—nay, he brought it with him.
