Finally, let us stand by that prime characteristic of a fair trial, which we hold as an heritage from our forefathers—that, in courts of law, though there be no prejudice, guilt is punished; and if there be no guilt, prejudice is put aside.</p>
<p>For this reason, then, before I begin to deal with<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">6</span><span class="br"></span> the case proper, I have a request to make to you, gentlemen. First, that, as is only just, you bring to this court no preconceived judgements (for indeed men will cease, not only to respect us as judges, but even to call us judges, unless in this place we base our judgements on the facts of the case, instead of applying to the facts the ready-made judgements we have brought from home). Next—supposing you already to have formed some opinion—that, if it be dislodged by reason, shaken by argument, or finally uprooted by truth itself, you dismiss it without resistance from your minds, if not gladly, at least without reluctance. And lastly, as I proceed to a detailed refutation of the charge, do not on your part make a mental note of any point against me, but wait till the end and allow me to develop the defence in my own way: the conclusion of my speech will be time enough for you to ask yourselves the reason for any omissions I may have made.</p>
