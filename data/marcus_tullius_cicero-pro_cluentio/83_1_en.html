Now L. Sulla was anything but a friend to the popular cause; but still, when subsequently appointing a court to deal with this matter under the very statute which you are now administering, he did not dare to inflict this new kind of court upon the Roman people whom he had found free from any such liability. Had he thought it possible to do otherwise, nothing would have pleased him so much, considering his well-known hatred of the order of knights, as to concentrate in this one court all the venom of his proscription as he visited it on the former jurors.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL198_387_ba" id="target_note_LCL198_387_ba"><sup>b</sup></a> The single aim and object of<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">152</span><span class="br"></span> this (believe me, gentlemen, and look the danger in the face) is the extension of liability under this statute to include the order of knights.

For those who have a ready protection in their own uprightness and innocence (as may truthfully be said of you and of all whose lives are innocent of party spirit) are anxious that the order of knights should occupy a position second only to that of their own order and most firmly allied to it by the bond of unanimity.
