<p>Junius presided over the court administering that statute. Quinctius should have waited a few days; but he was anxious to conduct his prosecution before either he resigned office or the popular prejudice subsided. And so you see that the prosecutor relied entirely, not on the merits of his case, but on its circumstances, and on his own prerogative.
