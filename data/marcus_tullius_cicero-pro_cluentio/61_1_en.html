You, then, who rested the case<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">114</span><span class="br"></span> for the prosecution on judicial decisions, are bound either to find fault with their decision in this case or, if you will allow that it was a right one, to admit that the conviction of Oppianicus was not due to bribery.</p>
<p>However, this should need no better proof than the fact that after the acquittal of Falcula, not one of his fellow-jurors was put on trial. What, I ask you, is the use of quoting their convictions for giving bribes under a different statute on a definite charge and on the evidence of many witnesses? In the first place, those jurors should have been charged with taking, not with giving bribes.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL198_343_a" id="target_note_LCL198_343_a"><sup>a</sup></a> For if the taking of bribes told against them when on trial for giving bribes, which comes under a different statute, it would manifestly have told against them still more if they had been put on trial under the statute proper to the offence in question.

It is not for me to deal at length with the nature of this proceeding, as I am addressing gentlemen of such experience: but the care which is customary in trials generally is never displayed when once the verdict of guilty has been given.
