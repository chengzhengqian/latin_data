In this civil suit, believe me, even though he too may chance to employ you<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL198_401_a" id="target_note_LCL198_401_a"><sup>a</sup></a> to defend him, he will not escape conviction as a false accuser. Again, it is reported to me that you<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL198_401_a" id="target_note_LCL198_401_a"><sup>a</sup></a> are suborning that man of much hospitality, Ambivius, innkeeper of the Latin Way, to say that he was assaulted in his own inn by Cluentius and his slaves. About this fellow it is at present unnecessary for me to speak: if he gives us his customary invitation, we will give him so warm a reception as to make him sorry he ever went out of his way.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL198_401_b" id="target_note_LCL198_401_b"><sup>b</sup></a> Here, gentlemen, you have<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">164</span><span class="br"></span> every reflexion on Aulus Cluentius’s character, which, after eight years of preparation, the prosecution has raked together for the whole case, anxious as they are to embarrass his trial with prejudice. How essentially trivial they are; how substantially false; how easily refutable!</p>

<p>LX. Pass now to what concerns your oath, what belongs to your jurisdiction, what is laid on you as a responsibility by the statute through whose operation you are here met together — that is, to the charges of poisoning—and you will all realize in how few words my case might have been concluded, and how much I have said which, though entirely relevant to my client’s instructions, was entirely irrelevant to your court.</p>
<p>My client Aulus Cluentius is charged with having<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">165</span><span class="br"></span> removed by poison Vibius Cappadox. Fortunately
