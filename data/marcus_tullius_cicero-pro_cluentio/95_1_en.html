But actually the whole story is a bare-faced lie. To bring this home to you, let me tell you about his death and the way in which, after his death, Cluentiusâ€™s mother tried to find a charge against her son.</p>
<p>Wandering about, a vagabond and an exile, and<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">175</span><span class="br"></span> finding all doors shut against him, Oppianicus betook himself to L. Quinctius in the Falernian district. It was there that he first fell sick; and he had a long and serious illness. Sassia was with him, and was on terms of greater intimacy with one Sextus Albius, a lusty yeoman who was usually in her company, than the most dissolute of husbands could tolerate had his fortunes been unimpaired; for she was of the opinion that the bonds of that chaste, that lawful wedlock had been removed by the condemnation of her husband. And it is said that a favourite slave of Oppianicus called Nicostratus, a faithful fellow, very inquisitive and no liar, used to bring many tales of this to his master. Meanwhile Oppianicus was beginning to get better, and could endure no longer the misconduct of the Falernian yeoman; so he started to come here to the neighbourhood of Rome, where it was his custom to take some hired lodging outside the gates. But, so they say, he was thrown from his horse, and, ailing as he was, sustained a serious injury to his side; he reached the city in a fever, and died a few days afterwards. The circumstances of his death, gentlemen, are such as to admit of no suspicion; or, if any be admissible, to confine it to the four walls of his house, and to incriminate his own people.</p>
