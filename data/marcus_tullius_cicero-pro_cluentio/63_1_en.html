For I am on friendly terms with both those excellent men who were our last censors, and with one of them, as most of you know, I enjoy a friendship and an intimacy based on our mutual good offices. And so, whatever I may have to say about their endorsements,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">118</span><span class="br"></span> I shall say it with the desire to make you feel that my every word bears not upon their actions, but upon the censorial system.

Here I will first lay down the general proposition that our state has never assigned the same weight to a censorial stigma as to a judicial decision; and without wasting time over a matter of common knowledge, I will merely illustrate it with a single example. G. Geta was himself made censor after having been degraded from the senate by the censors L. Metellus
