<p>About that very time, this Strato, the doctor, committed theft and murder at her house in the following circumstances. There was a safe in the house which he knew to contain a quantity of cash and of gold; so one night he killed two of his fellow-slaves as they slept, threw them into the fish-pond, and himself cut out the bottom of the safe, abstracting . . .<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL198_417_a" id="target_note_LCL198_417_a"><sup>a</sup></a> sesterces and five pounds weight of gold, with the connivance of one of the slaves, quite a young lad.
