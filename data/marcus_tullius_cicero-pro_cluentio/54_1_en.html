The court laughed at his talking thus of reconciliation,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">101</span><span class="br"></span>and posing as an honest man, as he had done in the matter of the gilt statues which he erected in the Temple of Juturna,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL198_329_a" id="target_note_LCL198_329_a"><sup>a</sup></a> with an inscription at the foot recording the kings whom he had restored to friendship with Rome. Then were all his sharp practices and impostures driven from cover, disclosing a whole lifetime devoted to such pursuits; his private lack of means was brought to light, and his source of income from the courts; but his pose as the paid agent of peace and goodwill carried no conviction, with the result that Staienus, when answering the same charge as Accius is now, was found guilty. The Cominii, taking the same line as I have<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">102</span><span class="br"></span> been taking all through the case, made good their charge. Wherefore, if the condemnation of Staienus amounted to a judicial decision that Oppianicus intended to bribe the court, and that he gave a bribe to a juror for the purchase of votes; and if (since it is agreed that either Cluentius or Oppianicus was guilty of so doing) no trace can be found of Cluentius having given any money to a juror, while the money given by Oppianicus was recovered from a juror after the trial was over; then what possible doubt is there that Staienus’s condemnation, so far from telling against Cluentius, provides abundant confirmation of my case and of my defence?</p>
