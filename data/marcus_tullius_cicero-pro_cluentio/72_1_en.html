I feel, indeed, that I cannot fail to mention the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">134</span><span class="br"></span> example of the great and famous P. Africanus.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL198_365_a" id="target_note_LCL198_365_a"><sup>a</sup></a> During his term as censor he was holding the census of knights, when G. Licinius Sacerdos came forward; whereupon, in a loud voice so as to be heard by the whole assembly, he said that he knew that Licinius had committed deliberate perjury; and that if anyone wished to bring an accusation against him, he would give his evidence to support it. Then, as no one brought an accusation, he bade Licinius “lead past his horse.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL198_365_b" id="target_note_LCL198_365_b"><sup>b</sup></a> And so the man with whose judgement the Roman people and foreign nations had always been satisfied, was not satisfied with his personal knowledge when it came to degrading another.

<p>There is a further point which troubles me greatly,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">135</span><span class="br"></span> an argument to which I find myself scarcely able to reply; I mean the passage which you quote from the will of the elder Egnatius—the most honourable and intelligent of men, I need hardly say—stating that he disinherited his son for taking a bribe to secure Oppianicus’s conviction. On this man’s worthless and unreliable character I will not dilate: the very will which you quote has the effect of disinheriting the son whom the testator hated, and at the same time instituting absolute strangers as heirs conjointly with the son whom he loved.
