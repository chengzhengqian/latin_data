Your story of a reconciliation was invented by Staienus in the midst of the crisis, when he was gripped by the throat, or perhaps as rumour had it at the time, it was suggested to him by P. Cethegus. For<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">85</span><span class="br"></span> you remember that there was such a rumour at the time—to the effect that as Cethegus hated the fellow, was reluctant to see such knavery engaged in public life, and moreover realized that there was no hope of acquittal for a man who had admitted to having secretly and irregularly accepted a bribe from the accused when serving as a juror, he gave him somewhat insincere advice. If, in thus acting, Cethegus was unprincipled, I think it was that he wished to be rid of an opponent.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL198_313_b" id="target_note_LCL198_313_b"><sup>b</sup></a> But if it was the case that Staienus could not deny his acceptance of the money, whereas nothing was so damning or disgraceful as to confess the ends for which he had accepted it, no fault can be found with Cethegus’s advice. But your<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">86</span><span class="br"></span> present case, Accius, has no connexion with Staienus’s case in the past; he in his desperate plight might have said anything, and brought less shame on himself by saying it than by confessing the truth: but as for you, I am surprised that you have now revived that old farce which was then hissed and hooted off the stage. How was it at that time possible for Cluentius to be reconciled to Oppianicus? Or how with his mother? Their names were down in black and white on the public records as defendant and prosecutor: Fabricius and his accomplice had been convicted: Albius could not have escaped though
