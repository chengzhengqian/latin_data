Later, he appointed him consul for a second term at <span class="marginNote right">145</span>the same time that he began his fourth. And all this time, when busied with so many public duties of his own, and while sharing his father’s activities that he might be fitted for ruling the state, Marcus worked at his studies<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_147_4" id="target_note_LCL139_147_4"><sup>4</sup></a> eagerly.</p>

Moreover, he showed great deference to his father, though there were not lacking those who whispered things against him, especially Valerius Homullus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_147_9" id="target_note_LCL139_147_9"><sup>9</sup></a>

Marcus had also the title of <span class="italic">princeps iuventutis</span> or honorary chief of the equestrian order (Dio, lxxi. 35, 5), a title bestowed by the acclamation of the order, with the consent or at the command of the emperor, upon the heir apparent.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL139_147_1').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL139_147_2"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL139_147_2" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">2</sup>See note to <span class="italic">Pius</span>, x. 4.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL139_147_2').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL139_147_3a"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL139_147_3a" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">3</sup>Especially the four great colleges of which the emperor was always a member, <span class="italic">i.e</span>., the <span class="italic">pontifices</span>, the <span class="italic">augures</span>, the <span class="italic">quindecimviri sacris faciendis</span> or keepers of the Sibylline Books, and the <span class="italic">septemviri epulonum</span>, and probably also the <span class="italic">fratres arvales</span> and the <span class="italic">sodales</span> of the various deified emperors (see note to <span class="italic">Hadr</span>., xxvii. 3).
