private citizen and a philosopher at all the stadia, temples, and in fact everywhere. And although the citizens of Alexandria had been outspoken in wishing Cassius success, he forgave everything and left his daughter among them. And now, in the village of Halala, in the foothills of Mount Taurus, he lost his wife Faustina, who succumbed to a sudden illness.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_197_1" id="target_note_LCL139_197_1"><sup>1</sup></a> <span class="marginNote right">176</span>He asked the senate to decree her divine honours and a temple, and likewise delivered a eulogy of her, although she had suffered grievously from the reputation of lewdness.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_197_2" id="target_note_LCL139_197_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Of this, however, Antoninus was either ignorant or affected ignorance. He established a new order of Faustinian girls<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_197_3" id="target_note_LCL139_197_3"><sup>3</sup></a> in honour of his dead wife, expressed his pleasure at her deification by the senate,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_197_4" id="target_note_LCL139_197_4"><sup>4</sup></a> and because she had accompanied him on his summer campaign, called her “Mother of the Camp”.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_197_5" id="target_note_LCL139_197_5"><sup>5</sup></a> And besides this, he made the village where Faustina died a colony, and there built a temple in her honour.
