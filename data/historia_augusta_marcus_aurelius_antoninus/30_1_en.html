while absent from Rome he left forceful instructions that the amusements of the Roman people should be provided for by the richest givers of public spectacles, because, when he took the gladiators away to the war, there was talk among the people that he intended to deprive them of their amusements and thereby drive them to the study of philosophy. Indeed, he had ordered that the actors of pantomimes should begin their performances nine days later than usual in order that business might not be interfered with. There was talk, as we mentioned above,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_191_1" id="target_note_LCL139_191_1"><sup>1</sup></a> about his wifeâ€™s intrigues with pantomimists; however, he cleared her of all these charges in his letters.

<p>XXIV. It was customary with Antoninus to punish all crimes with lighter penalties than were usually inflicted by the laws; although at times, toward those who were clearly guilty of serious crimes he remained implacable. He himself held those trials of distinguished men which involved the death-penalty, and always with the greatest justice.

The sentence seems rather to mean that the rites of Serapis were isolated from the mass of Egyptian cults celebrated at the Pelusia; so also Wilcken, <span class="italic">Klio</span>, ix. p. 131 f.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL139_191_3a').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
