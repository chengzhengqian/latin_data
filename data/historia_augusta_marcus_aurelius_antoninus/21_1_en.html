<p>XVI. Such was Marcus’ kindness toward his own family that he bestowed the insignia of every office on all his kin, while on his son,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_173_1" id="target_note_LCL139_173_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and an accursed and foul one he was, he hastened to bestow the name of Caesar,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_173_2" id="target_note_LCL139_173_2"><sup>2</sup></a> then afterward the priesthood,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_173_3" id="target_note_LCL139_173_3"><sup>3</sup></a> and, a little later, the title of imperator<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_173_4" id="target_note_LCL139_173_4"><sup>4</sup></a> and a share in a triumph<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_173_5" id="target_note_LCL139_173_5"><sup>5</sup></a> and the consulship. It was at this time <span class="marginNote right">177</span>that Marcus, though acclaimed imperator, ran on foot in the Circus by the side of the triumphal car in which his son was seated.</p>
<p>After the death of Verus, Marcus Antoninus held the empire alone, a nobler man by far and more abounding in virtues, especially as he was no longer hampered by Verus’ faults, neither by those of excessive candour and hot-headed plain speaking, from which Verus suffered through natural folly, nor by those others which had particularly irked Marcus Antoninus even from his earliest years, the principles and habits of a depraved mind. Such was Marcus’ own repose of spirit that neither in grief nor in joy did he ever change countenance, being wholly given over to the Stoic philosophy, which he had not only learned from all the best masters,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_173_6" id="target_note_LCL139_173_6"><sup>6</sup></a> but also acquired for himself from every source. For this reason Hadrian would have taken him for his own successor to the throne had not his youth prevented. This intention, indeed, seems obvious from the fact that he chose Marcus to be the son-in-law of Pius,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_173_7" id="target_note_LCL139_173_7"><sup>7</sup></a> in order that the direction of the Roman state might some time at least come into his hands, as to those of one well worthy.</p>
