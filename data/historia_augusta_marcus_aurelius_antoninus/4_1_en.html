the lectures of Claudius Severus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_139_1" id="target_note_LCL139_139_1"><sup>1</sup></a> an adherent of the Peripatetic school, but he received most instruction from Junius Rusticus, whom he ever revered and whose disciple he became, a man esteemed in both private and public life, and exceedingly well acquainted with the Stoic system, with whom Marcus shared all his counsels both public and private, whom he greeted with a kiss prior to the prefects of the guard,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_139_2" id="target_note_LCL139_139_2"><sup>2</sup></a> whom he even appointed consul for a second term,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_139_3" id="target_note_LCL139_139_3"><sup>3</sup></a> and whom after his death he asked the senate to honour with statues. On his teachers in general, moreover, he conferred great honours, for he even kept golden statues of them in his chapel,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_139_4" id="target_note_LCL139_139_4"><sup>4</sup></a> and made it a custom to show respect for their tombs by personal visits and by offerings of sacrifices and flowers. He studied jurisprudence as well, in which he heard Lucius Volusius Maecianus, and so much work and labour did he devote to his studies that he impaired his health—the only fault to be found with his entire childhood. He attended also the public schools of rhetoricians. Of his fellow-pupils he was particularly fond of Seius Fuscianus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_139_5" id="target_note_LCL139_139_5"><sup>5</sup></a> and Aufidius Victorinus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_139_6" id="target_note_LCL139_139_6"><sup>6</sup></a> of the senatorial order, and Baebius Longus and Calenus, of the equestrian. He was very generous to these men, so generous, in fact, that on those whom he could not advance to public office on account of their station in life, he bestowed riches.</p>
