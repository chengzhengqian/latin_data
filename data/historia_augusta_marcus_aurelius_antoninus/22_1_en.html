<p>XVII. Toward the provinces from then on he acted with extreme restraint and consideration. He carried on a successful campaign against the Germans. He himself singled out the Marcomannic war—a war which surpassed any in the memory of man—and waged it with both valour and success, and that at a time when a grievous pestilence had carried away thousands of civilians and soldiers.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_175_1" id="target_note_LCL139_175_1"><sup>1</sup></a> And so, by crushing the Marcomanni, the Sarmatians, the Vandals, and even the Quadi, he freed the Pannonias from bondage,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_175_2" id="target_note_LCL139_175_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and with Commodus his son, whom he had previously named Caesar, triumphed at Rome, as we told above.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_175_3a" id="target_note_LCL139_175_3a"><sup>3</sup></a> When he had drained the treasury for this war, moreover, and could not bring himself to impose any extraordinary tax on the provincials, he held a public sale in the Forum of the <span class="marginNote right">169</span>Deified Trajan<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_175_4" id="target_note_LCL139_175_4"><sup>4</sup></a> of the imperial furnishings, and sold goblets of gold and crystal and murra,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_175_5" id="target_note_LCL139_175_5"><sup>5</sup></a> even flagons made for kings, his wife’s silken gold-embroidered robes, and, indeed, even certain jewels which he had found in considerable numbers in a particularly holy cabinet of Hadrian’s. This sale lasted for two months, and such a store of gold was realised thereby, that after he had conducted the remainder of the Marcomannic war in full accordance with his plans, he gave the buyers to understand that if any of them wished to return his purchases and recover his money, he could do so. Nor did he make it unpleasant for anyone who did or did not return what he had bought.
