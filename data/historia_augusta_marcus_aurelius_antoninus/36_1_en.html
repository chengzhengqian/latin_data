for me, instead of thinking about the pestilence<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_203_1" id="target_note_LCL139_203_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and about death which is the common lot of us all?” And when they were about to retire he groaned and said: “If you now grant me leave to go, I bid you farewell and pass on before’’. And when he was asked to whom he commended his son he replied: “To you,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_203_2" id="target_note_LCL139_203_2"><sup>2</sup></a> if he prove worthy, and to the immortal gods”. The army, when they learned of his sickness, lamented loudly, for they loved him singularly. On the seventh day he was weary and admitted only his son, and even him he at once sent away in fear that he would catch the disease. And when his son had gone, he covered his head as though he wished to sleep and during the night he breathed his last.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_203_3" id="target_note_LCL139_203_3"><sup>3</sup></a> It is said that he foresaw that after his<span class="marginNote right">17 Mar., 180</span>

It is held to Marcus’ discredit that he advanced his wife’s lovers, Tertullus and Tutilius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_203_4" id="target_note_LCL139_203_4"><sup>4</sup></a> and Orfitus and Moderatus, to various offices of honour, although he had caught Tertullus in the very act of breakfasting with his wife. In regard to this man the following dialogue was spoken on the stage in the presence of Antoninus himself. The Fool asked the Slave the name of his wife’s lover and the Slave answered “Tullus” three times; and when the Fool kept on asking, the Slave replied, “I have already told you thrice Tullus is his name”.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_203_5" id="target_note_LCL139_203_5"><sup>5</sup></a> But the city-populace and others besides talked a great deal about this incident and found fault with Antoninus for his forbearance.</p>
