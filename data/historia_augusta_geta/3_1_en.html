Immediately after Geta was born some one announced that a purple egg had been laid by a hen in the palace. This egg was then brought in, and Bassianus his brother, seizing it, dashed it upon the ground, as a child would do, and broke it; whereupon Julia, it is said, exclaimed in jest, “Accursed fratricide, you have killed your brother”.
