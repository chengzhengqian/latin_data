<p class="noindent"><span class="sc">The</span> Christian Faith is proclaimed by the authority of the New Testament and of the Old; but although the Old scripture<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL074_53_b" id="target_note_LCL074_53_b"><sup>b</sup></a> contains within its pages the name of Christ and constantly gives token that he will come who we believe has already come by his birth of the Virgin, yet the diffusion of that faith throughout the world dates from the actual miraculous coming of our Saviour.</p>
<p>Now this our religion which is called Christian and Catholic is supported chiefly on these foundations which it asserts: From eternity, that is, before the establishment of the world, before all, that is, that can be given the name of time, there has existed the divine substance of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit in such wise that our religion calls the Father God, the Son God, and the Holy Spirit God, and yet not three Gods but one. Thus the Father has the Son, begotten of his substance and coeternal with himself after a manner that he alone knows. Him we confess to be Son in the sense that he is not the same as the Father. Nor has the Father ever been Son, so the human mind must not imagine a divine lineage
