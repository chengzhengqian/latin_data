that after the end of the world our bodies shall rise incorruptible to the kingdom of heaven, to the end that he who has lived well on earth by God’s gift should be altogether blessed in that resurrection, but he who has lived amiss should, with the gift of resurrection, enter upon misery. And this is a firm principle of our religion, to believe not only that men’s souls do not perish, but that their very bodies, which the coming of death had destroyed, are restored to their first state through the blessedness that is to be. This Catholic church, then, spread throughout the world, is known to exist by three marks: whatever is believed in it has the authority of the Scriptures, or of universal tradition, or at least of its own and proper teaching. And the whole church is bound by that authority, as is the whole church no less by the universal tradition of the Fathers, while each separate church exists and is governed by its private constitution and its proper rites according to difference of locality and the approval of each. There is therefore now but one expectation of the faithful by which we believe that the end of the word will come, that all corruptible things shall pass away, that men shall rise for the test of the judgement to come, that each shall receive reward according to his deserts and abide in the lot assigned to him perpetually and eternally; and that the sole reward of blessedness is the contemplation of the Creator, so far, that is, as the creature may look on the Creator, to the end that the number of the angels may be restored from these and that heavenly city filled where the Virgin’s Son is King and where will be everlasting joy, delight, food, labour, and unending praise of the Creator.</p>
