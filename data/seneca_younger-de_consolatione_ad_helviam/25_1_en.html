alone put the Thirty Tyrants in their place,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL254_465_a" id="target_note_LCL254_465_a"><sup>a</sup></a> entered prison, and so was to rob even prison of all disgrace; for no place that held Socrates could possibly seem a prison. Who has become so blind to the perception of truth as to think that the twofold defeat of Marcus Cato in his candidacy for the praetorship and the consulship was to him a disgrace? It was the praetorship and the consulship, on which Cato was conferring honour, that suffered the disgrace. No one is despised by another unless he is first despised by himself. An abject and grovelling mind may be liable to such insult; but a man who rises up to face the most cruel of misfortunes, and overthrows the evils by which others are crushed—this man’s very sorrows crown him, as it were, with a halo, since we are so constituted that nothing stirs our admiration so much as a man who is brave in adversity.</p>
<p>At Athens, when Aristides<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL254_465_b" id="target_note_LCL254_465_b"><sup>b</sup></a> was being led to death, everyone who met him would cast down his eyes and groan, feeling that it was not merely a just man, but Justice herself who was being doomed to die; yet one man was found who spat into his face. He might have resented this for the simple reason that he knew well that no clean-mouthed man would have dared to do it. But he wiped his face and smiled, saying to the officer that attended him: “Remind that fellow not to open his mouth so offensively another time.” This was to put insult<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL254_465_c" id="target_note_LCL254_465_c"><sup>c</sup></a> upon insult itself. I know that there are some who say that nothing is harder to bear than scorn, that death itself seems more desirable to them. To these I will reply that even exile is often free from any mark of scorn. If a great man falls, though prostrate, he is still great— men no more scorn him, I say, than they tread upon
