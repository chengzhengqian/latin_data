the shores of the Pontic Sea; not by the fierceness of eternal winter, not by the temper of the inhabitants, as savage as their climate, were men deterred from seeking there new homes. A host of Athenians dwell in Asia; Miletus has poured forth in divers directions enough people to fill seventy-five cities<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL254_435_a" id="target_note_LCL254_435_a"><sup>a</sup></a>; the whole coast of Italy which is washed by the Lower Sea became a greater Greece; Asia claims the Tuscans<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL254_435_b" id="target_note_LCL254_435_b"><sup>b</sup></a> as her own; Tyrians live in Africa, Carthaginians in Spain; the Greeks<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL254_435_c" id="target_note_LCL254_435_c"><sup>c</sup></a> thrust themselves into Gaul, the Gauls into Greece<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL254_435_d" id="target_note_LCL254_435_d"><sup>d</sup></a>; the Pyrenees did not stay the passage of the Germans<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL254_435_ea" id="target_note_LCL254_435_ea"><sup>e</sup></a>â€”through pathless, through unknown regions restless man has made his way.

Some, having escaped the destruction of their cities by the forces of the enemy, have been thrust into strange lands when stripped of their own; some have been cast out by civil discord; some have gone forth in order to relieve the pressure from over-crowding caused by an excess of population; some have been driven out by pestilence or repeated earthquakes or certain unbearable defects of an unproductive soil; some
