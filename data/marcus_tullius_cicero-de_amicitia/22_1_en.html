We read that Aemilius Papus was an intimate friend of Gaius Luscinus (so we have received it from our forefathers), that they served together twice as consuls and were colleagues in the censorship.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL154_151_1" id="target_note_LCL154_151_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Again the tradition is that Manius Curius and Tiberius Coruncanius were most closely associated with them and with each other.
