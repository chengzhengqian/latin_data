<p>III. If I were to assert that I am unmoved by grief at Scipio’s death, it would be for “wise” men to judge how far I am right, yet, beyond a doubt, my assertion would be false. For I am indeed moved by the loss of a friend such, I believe, as I shall never have again, and—as I can assert on positive knowledge——a friend such as no other man ever was to me.

Why need I speak of his most affable manners, of his devotion to his mother, of his generosity to his sisters,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL154_119_2" id="target_note_LCL154_119_2"><sup>2</sup></a> of his kindness to his relatives,
