what can be as pliant and erratic as the soul of the man who changes not only to suit another’s humour and desire, but even his expression and his nod?</p>
<p>He says “nay,” and “nay” say I; he says “yea,” and “yea” say I; in fine, I bade myself agree with him in everything. <a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL154_201_1" id="target_note_LCL154_201_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p class="noindent">This was said by Terence whom I quoted before, but he says it in the character of Gnatho; and to have such a man for a friend on any terms is a mark of inconstancy. However, there are many like Gnatho, though his superiors in birth, fortune, and reputation, who become dangerous flatterers when their insincerity is supported by their position. But by the exercise of care a fawning friend may be separated and distinguished from a true friend, just as everything pretended and false may be distinguished from what is genuine and true. A public assembly, though composed of very ignorant men, can, nevertheless, usually see the difference between a demagogue—that is, a smooth-tongued, shallow citizen—and one who has stability, sincerity, and weight. With what flattering words Gaius Papirius <a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL154_201_2" id="target_note_LCL154_201_2"><sup>2</sup></a> not long ago insinuated himself into the favour of the assembly, when he was trying to carry a law making the people’s tribunes eligible for reelection! I spoke against it—but I will not talk of myself, it will give me more pleasure to talk about Scipio. Ye gods! What weight and majesty there was in his speech on that occasion! One would have said, without hesitation, that he was the leader of the Roman people, not their comrade.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL154_201_3" id="target_note_LCL154_201_3"><sup>3</sup></a> But you both were present; besides, his speech is published. As a result this “people’s law” was rejected by the people’s votes.</p>
