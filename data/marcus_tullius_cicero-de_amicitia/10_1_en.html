in fact, I was about to make the same request when Fannius forestalled me. Hence your compliance will be very agreeable to us both.</p>

<section class="div2">
<p>V. <span class="sc">Laelius</span>. I certainly should raise no objection if I felt confidence in myself, for the subject is a noble one, and we are, as Fannius said, free from public business. But who am I? or what skill<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL154_127_1" id="target_note_LCL154_127_1"><sup>1</sup></a> have I? What you suggest is a task for philosophers and, what is more, for Greeks—that of discoursing on any subject however suddenly it may be proposed to them. This is a difficult thing to do and requires no little practice. Therefore, for a discussion of everything possible to be said on the subject of friendship, I advise you to apply to those who profess that art; all that I can do is to urge you to put friendship before all things human; for nothing is so conformable to nature and nothing so adaptable to our fortunes whether they be favourable or adverse.</p>
<p>This; however, I do feel first of all—that friendship cannot exist except among good men; nor do I go into that too deeply,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL154_127_2" id="target_note_LCL154_127_2"><sup>2</sup></a> as is done by those <a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL154_127_3" id="target_note_LCL154_127_3"><sup>3</sup></a> who, in discussing this point with more than usual accuracy, and it may be correctly, but with too little view to practical results, say that no one is good unless he is wise. We may grant that; but they understand wisdom to be a thing such as no mortal man has yet attained.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL154_127_4" id="target_note_LCL154_127_4"><sup>4</sup></a> I, however, am bound to look at things as they are in the experience of everyday life and not as they are in fancy or in hope. Never could I say that Gaius Fabricius, Manius Curius, and Tiberius Coruncanius, whom our ancestors adjudged to be wise, were wise by such a standard as that.</p>
