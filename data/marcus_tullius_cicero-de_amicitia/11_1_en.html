<p>Therefore, let the Sophists keep their unpopular<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL154_129_1" id="target_note_LCL154_129_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and unintelligible word to themselves, granting only that the men just named were good men. They will not do it though; they will say that goodness can be predicated only of the “wise” man. Let us then proceed “with our own dull wits,” as the saying is. Those who so act and so live as to give proof of loyalty and uprightness, of fairness and generosity; who are free from all passion, caprice, and insolence, and have great strength of character —men like those just mentioned—such men let us consider good, as they were accounted good in life, and also entitled to be called by that term because, in as far as that is possible for man, they follow Nature, who is the best guide to good living.</p>
<p>For it seems clear to me that we were so created that between us all there exists a certain tie which strengthens with our proximity to each other. Therefore, fellow countrymen are preferred to foreigners and relatives <a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL154_129_2" id="target_note_LCL154_129_2"><sup>2</sup></a> to strangers, for with them Nature herself engenders friendship, but it is one that is lacking in constancy. For friendship excels relationship <a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL154_129_2" id="target_note_LCL154_129_2"><sup>2</sup></a> in this, that goodwill may be eliminated from relationship while from friendship it cannot; since, if you remove goodwill from friendship the very name of friendship is gone; if you remove it from relationship, the name of relationship still remains. Moreover, how great the power of friendship is may most clearly be recognized from the fact that, in comparison with the infinite ties uniting the human race and fashioned by Nature herself, this thing called friendship has been so narrowed that the bonds of affection always unite two persons only, or, at most, a few.</p>
