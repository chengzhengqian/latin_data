Tisiphone, her locks wreathed on every side with serpents, besets the way and brandishes before me fires and cruel whips; behind her is Cerberus, his mouths inflamed with fearful barking, his necks bristling with twisted snakes this way and that, and his eyes flashing the glow of a blood-red light. Alas, why has no gratitude been shown to my kindness, when even from the very door of death I restored you to the world of the living?

I take my way over pathless regions—pathless regions far away amid Cimmerian groves, and about me throng the woeful penalties for all misdeeds.
