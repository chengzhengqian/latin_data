<h2><span class="ac">VI. Lysander</span></h2>
<p><span class="bold">1.</span> Lysander the Lacedaemonian left a great reputation, gained rather by good fortune than by merit. There is no doubt, indeed, that he put an end to the power of the Athenians, who had been warring against the Peloponnesians for twenty-six years,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL467_63_2" id="target_note_LCL467_63_2"><sup>2</sup></a> but how it was that he effected it is no secret. As a matter of fact, it was due, not to the valour of his army, but to the lack of discipline of his opponents, who did not obey their generals, but, leaving their ships and scattering about the country, fell into the power of the enemy.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL467_63_3" id="target_note_LCL467_63_3"><sup>3</sup></a> As a result, the Athenians surrendered to the Lacedaemonians.</p>
