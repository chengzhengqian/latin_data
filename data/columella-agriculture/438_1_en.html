place will bear.‚Äù For we cannot, if we should wish to do so, feed in a fish-pond a crowd of red surmullet, such as we have very often seen in the sea, since it is a very delicate kind of fish and most intolerant of captivity, and so only one or two out of many<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">8</span><span class="br"></span> thousands can on rare occasions endure confinement, while, on the contrary, we frequently notice in closed waters shoals of those deep-sea fish: the sluggish grey mullet and the greedy basse. Therefore, as I have already suggested, let us consider the quality of our sea-shore and, if we find it rocky, let us be content with it. We shall imprison in our ponds several kinds of thrush-wrasse and merle-wrasse and greedy hake and also basse which have no spots (for there is also a mottled kind), also floating morays, which are much esteemed, and any other morays of the rock-dwelling kind which command a high price; for it does not pay to catch, much less to keep, anything which is cheap. These same kinds<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">9</span><span class="br"></span> of fish can also be kept in ponds on a sandy shore; for shores which are covered with slime and mud are, as I have already said, better suited to shell-fish and animals which lie at the bottom. A different position too is required for ponds which harbour those fish which lie down, nor is the same food provided for prostrate as for upright fish. For soles and turbots and similar creatures a shallow pond is sunk two feet in that part of the shore which is never left high and dry by ebbing of deep water. Next close barriers<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">10</span><span class="br"></span> are fixed along the edges of the pond, so that they always stand out of the water even when the tide of the sea is at its highest; then dams are thrown up all round so as to encompass the pond in their embrace and at the same time to rise above its level.
