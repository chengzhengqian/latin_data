by trees. The nurseries which have not been trimmed at the proper time, and small fig-trees growing in nurseries, ought to be pruned and reduced to single stems; these, however, while they are young, are better trimmed when they are budding. While every operation of agriculture ought to be performed with alacrity, this is especially true of sowing. It is an old proverb among husbandmen that early<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">80</span><span class="br"></span> sowing is often apt to deceive us, late sowing neverâ€”it

<p>Tares and beans are said to manure the ground;<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">81</span><span class="br"></span> but unless you turn in lupines when they are in flower, you will not manure the ground at all.

<p>During the same period it is proper to clean out the ditches and channels and make drains and gutters for the water. At the same season we shall do well to<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">83</span><span class="br"></span> provide the oxen with ash leaves, if we have them, but, if not, with mountain-ash leaves, and, if we have not these either, with holm-oak leaves. It is also not amiss to give each yoke of oxen one <span class="italic">modius</span> of
