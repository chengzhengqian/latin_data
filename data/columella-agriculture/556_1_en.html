This mixture, after having been sprinkled with water, is smeared either on old shipsâ€™ hawsers or any other kind of rope, and these are then dried and put away in a loft. Then, when mid-winter is passed, after an interval of forty days, about the time the swallow arrives, when the West wind is already rising after February 13th, if any water has stood in the furrows during the winter, it is drawn away, and the loose soil, which had been thrown out in the autumn, is replaced so as to fill half the depth of the furrows.<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">6</span><span class="br"></span> Then the ropes already mentioned are produced from the loft and uncoiled and stretched lengthways along each furrow and covered up in such a manner that the seeds of the thorns, which adhere to the strands of the ropes, may not have too much earth heaped upon them but may be able to sprout.
