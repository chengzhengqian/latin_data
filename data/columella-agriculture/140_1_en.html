in selecting the progeny of victorious Olympic mares, should base our hope of a bountiful vintage upon the selection of progeny of the most fruitful Amineans. And there is no reason why the tediousness of the time required should discourage anyone; for any delay that occurs is taken up in the testing of the shoot. But when the fruitfulness of the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">6</span><span class="br"></span>
vine has been proved, it is very quickly raised to a very large number by ingrafting.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_281_a" id="target_note_LCL361_281_a"><sup>a</sup></a> You especially, Silvinus, can bear me out in this, since you will readily recall that I completed the planting of two <span class="italic">iugera</span> of vineyard within two years time by making grafts from one early-ripe vine belonging to you on your place at Caere.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_281_b" id="target_note_LCL361_281_b"><sup>b</sup></a> What number<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">7</span><span class="br"></span>

Therefore, as I have said, if we will exercise industry and care we shall easily, by the aforesaid method, establish vineyards of Aminean vines as fruitful as those of the Bituric or Basilic varieties: only it will be of importance, in transplanting the sets, to give heed to like conditions of climate and situation and to the habit of the vine itself; since a cutting is usually impaired in quality if the situation of the ground or climatic conditions are distasteful to it, or even if it is transferred from tree to trellis. Accordingly, we shall<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">8</span><span class="br"></span>
transplant from cold places to cold, from warm to the like, and from open vineyards to open vineyards. Yet Aminean stock can better endure the change from a cold to a warm situation than from a warm to a cold; because every kind of vine, and especially that
