and must be removed, so that the hen may not be kept sitting any longer after the hatching is over, deluded by vain hope. Chickens should not be removed one by one as they are hatched but should be allowed to remain in the nest for one day with their mother and should be kept without water or food until they are all hatched. On the next day, when the brood is<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">16</span><span class="br"></span> complete, it should be brought down from the nest in the following manner. The chickens should be placed in a sieve made of vetch or darnel, which has already been in use, and they should then be fumigated with sprigs of pennyroyal<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL407_351_a" id="target_note_LCL407_351_a"><sup>a</sup></a>; this seems to prevent the pip, which very quickly kills them when they are young. After this they must be<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">17</span><span class="br"></span> shut up in a coop with their mother and given a moderately large feeding of boiled barley-flour with water or flour of two-grained wheat sprinkled with wine. For above all things indigestion must be avoided, and so on the third day they should be kept in the coop with their mother and before they are let out for fresh food, they should each be examined separately to see if they still have any of the previous day’s food in their gorge; for if the crop is not empty, this is a sign of indigestion and they ought to be kept away from food until digestion has taken place. While they are very young, chickens<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">18</span><span class="br"></span> should not be allowed to wander too far but should be kept in the neighbourhood of the coop and fed on barley-meal until they are strong, and care must be taken that they are not breathed upon by snakes, whose odour is so pestilential that it kills them all off. This is prevented by frequently burning hart’s-horn or galbanum<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL407_351_b" id="target_note_LCL407_351_b"><sup>b</sup></a> or women’s hair; by the fumes from all these things the aforesaid pest is generally kept
