tied up in bundles and chickpea and also meadow-hay. We are not looking after our cattle so well if we feed them on chaff, which is a universal, and in some districts the only, resource. The chaff which is most highly esteemed comes from millet, the next best from barley, and the third best from wheat; beasts of burden which are rendering regular terms of labour are given barley as well as chaff.</p>
<p>The diet of oxen is regulated according to the time<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span> of year. In January it is a good plan to give them four <span class="italic">sextarii</span> each of bitter-vetch crushed and soaked in water and mixed with chaff, or a <span class="italic">modius</span> of soaked lupines, or half a <span class="italic">modius</span> of soaked chickling-pea, as well as chaff in abundance. If there is a lack of pulse, it is allowable to mix with chaff grape skins taken from the after-wine which have been washed and dried, but there is no doubt that it is far better to<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span> give them the grapemash, skins and all, before they have been washed, for they contain the strength both of food and of wine and make the cattle sleek and of good cheer and plump. If we abstain from giving them grain, it is enough to supply a fodder-basket
holding twenty <span class="italic">modii</span> of dry leaves or thirty pounds of hay, or green bay-leaves or the foliage of the holm-oak in unlimited quantities. To these mast is added, if the resources of the district permit, but, unless enough is provided to cause satiety, it causes the scab. A half-<span class="italic">modius</span> of crushed beans may also be provided, if a good crop makes it cheap enough to do so. In February the food is usually the same.<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">6</span><span class="br"></span> In March and April an addition should be made to the weight of hay in places where the ground is being broken up for the first time; forty pounds, however, will be enough to give to each animal. From April
