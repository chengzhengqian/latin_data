trellis and the fruit. For the closer a prop is set to the stock, even when lightly fixed in the ground, the steadier it is; since, by standing close to the vine, it both supports and is supported in turn. Then stronger<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span>
cross-bars are to be bound to the standards; and these are made either of willow rods or of several reeds tied in some sort of bundles to give them stiffness, so that they may not be bent by the weight of the fruit. For now two firm wood branches must be allowed to grow on each plant; unless, however, the slenderness of some vine requires a closer pruning, in which case only one branch is to be left and that containing few eyes.</p>
<p>XVII. A frame of rods is stronger and requires less work. Reeds are put together with greater labour, because they are tied in several places. And these must be bound with their tops turned, one opposite to another, so that the whole frame may be of equal thickness; for if the tops come together, the weakness of that part, when burdened with weight, throws the fruit to the ground just as it ripens and exposes it to dogs and wild animals. But when a frame is duly<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span>
constructed of several reeds tied in bundles, with their tops in alternating order, it gives about five years of service.</p>
<p>Nor, indeed, is the method of pruning or other culture different from that of the first two years. For ablaqueation<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_389_a" id="target_note_LCL361_389_a"><sup>a</sup></a> must be carefully done in the autumn, and new layers must be applied to the vacant props none the less; for this work must never be discontinued but should be renewed every year.
