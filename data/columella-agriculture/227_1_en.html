be cut off when it is one year old, at about two and a half feet above ground, so that it may send out branches from the trunk and be arranged in arms like a low vine; but if the ground has been rather dry, it will be cut back preferably at the age of two years.</p>
<p>XXXII. The reed<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_455_a" id="target_note_LCL361_455_a"><sup>a</sup></a> is planted in ground that is not worked so deep, though it is better to plant it with the two-foot spade. Although it is very hardy and does not refuse any situation, it succeeds better when put in loose soil than in compact; better in a damp place than in a dry one; better in valleys than on hillsides; and on river banks and in borders and thickets better than in midfield. Its bulbous root<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span>
is planted, as also truncheons of the cane; and again the whole reed is laid flat in the ground. The bulb, when buried with three-foot spaces between, yields a full-grown stalk in less than a year. The truncheon and the whole reed are longer than the aforementioned time in coming to maturity. But whether truncheons of two and one-half feet are planted, or entire reeds laid flat, their tops should extend above ground; because, if they are entirely buried, they rot completely. But the culture<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span>
of the reed thicket, for the first three years, is not different from that of the other thickets. Later, when it has become old, the ground must be trenched again. And this is its old age, when it has either dried up completely because of many years of decadence and sloth, or has become so crowded that the reeds grow up slender and cane-like. But in<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span>
the former case it should be dug up again from the
