water, with water from a well. But that the well may provide the certainty of a continual supply, it should be dug when the sun occupies the last part of Virgo, that is, in the month of September before the autumn equinox; for that is the best time to test the capacity of springs, since then the ground is short of rain-water after the long summer drought. But you<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">9</span><span class="br"></span> must take care that the garden is not situated below a threshing-floor, and that the winds during the time of threshing cannot carry chaff and dust into it; for both these things are harmful to vegetables. Next there are two seasons for putting the ground in order and trenching it, since there are also two seasons for sowing vegetables, most of them being sown in the autumn and in the spring. The spring, however, is better in well-watered places, since the mildness of the growing year gives a kindly welcome to the seedlings as they come forth and the drought of summer is quenched by the springs of water. But where the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">10</span><span class="br"></span> nature of the place does not allow a supply of water to be brought by hand nor to be supplied spontaneously, there is indeed no other resource than the winter rains. Yet even in the driest localities your labour can be safeguarded if the ground is trenched rather deeper than usual, and it is quite enough to dig up a spit of three feet, so that the earth which is thrown up may rise to four feet. But where there is an<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">11</span><span class="br"></span> ample opportunity for irrigation, it will suffice if the fallow ground is turned over with a not very deep double-mattock, that is, with an iron tool measuring less than two feet. But we shall take care that the field which has to be planted in the spring is trenched in the autumn about November 1st; then let us turn over in the month of May the land which we intend
