place which is not exposed to the winds. Under these conditions it does not become full of holes or salty or dry, the first of these bad conditions being generally due to too little pressure, the second to its being over-salted, and the third to its being scorched by the sun. This kind of cheese can even be<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">6</span><span class="br"></span> exported beyond the sea. Cheese which is to be eaten within a few days while still fresh, is prepared with less trouble; for it is taken out of the wickerbaskets
and dipped into salt and brine and then dried a little in the sun. Some people, before they put the shackles<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL407_289_a" id="target_note_LCL407_289_a"><sup>a</sup></a> on the she-goats, drop green pinecones
into the pail and then milk the she-goats over them and only remove them when they have transferred the curdled milk into the moulds. Some crush the green pine-kernels by themselves and mix them with the milk and curdle it in this way. Others<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">7</span><span class="br"></span> allow thyme which has been crushed and strained through a sieve to coagulate with the milk; similarly, you can give the cheese any flavour you like by adding any seasoning which you choose. The method of making what we call “hand-pressed” cheese is the best-known of all: when the milk is slightly congealed in the pail and still warm, it is broken up and hot water is poured over it, and then it is either shaped by hand or else pressed into box-wood moulds. Cheese also which is hardened in brine and then coloured with the smoke of apple-tree wood or stubble has a not unpleasant flavour. But let us now return to the point from which we digressed.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL407_289_b" id="target_note_LCL407_289_b"><sup>b</sup></a></p>
