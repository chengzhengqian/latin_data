preference the terms employed in our own language, are enclosures for farm-yard fowls and likewise for birds which are fattened in coops, or else for aquatic animals. On the other hand, in the neighbourhood<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span> of the farm μελισσῶνες and χηνοτροφεῖα (bee-hives and goose-pens) find their place, and there are also carefully managed λαγοτροφεῖα (feeding-places for hares). To these we give a set of similar names, speaking of <span class="italic">apiaries,</span> where bees are lodged, <span class="italic">aviaries</span> for swimming birds which take their pleasure in pools and fish-ponds, and <span class="italic">vivaria</span> for wild creatures which are confined in enclosed woodlands.</p>
<p>II. First then I will give instructions about the
<span class="marginNote right">Οf the various kinds of farm-yard poultry.</span> creatures which are fed within the precincts of the farm. With regards to other animals it may perhaps be doubted whether country people should possess them; but the keeping of hens by farmers is quite a general practice. They fall into three classes, the farm-yard fowl, the “rustic”-hen<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL407_323_a" id="target_note_LCL407_323_a"><sup>a</sup></a> and the African fowl. The farm-yard fowl is the bird<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> commonly to be seen on almost every farm. The “rustic”-cock which is not very different from the farm-yard bird and is caught by the wiles of the fowler, is found in the greatest number in the island in the Ligurian sea to which sailors have given the name Gallinaria,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL407_323_b" id="target_note_LCL407_323_b"><sup>b</sup></a> a lengthened form of the Latin word for hen. The African fowl,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL407_323_c" id="target_note_LCL407_323_c"><sup>c</sup></a> which most people call Numidian, resembles the <span class="italic">meleagris,</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL407_323_d" id="target_note_LCL407_323_d"><sup>d</sup></a> except that it has on its head a red helmet and crest, both of which are blue on the <span class="italic">meleagris.</span> Of these three kinds<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> the female farm-yard fowls alone are properly called hens, its males being called cocks and the half-males
