vessels have each received a bunch of grapes, the two halves of the lid, applied from either side, may meet and protect the grapes. Both these vessels and their covers will have to be carefully treated with pitch outside and inside. Then, when the lids have enclosed the grapes, they should be covered with a quantity of clay mixed with chaff. But the bunches hanging from the mother-vine will have to be put in pots, so that they do not touch the vessels at any point.

These are best gathered moderately ripe, when the weather is fine and the sun has already evaporated the dew, at the fourth or fifth hour, always provided that the moon is waning and is beneath the earth.
