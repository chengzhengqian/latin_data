and sown and at what season, and first of all we must speak of the kinds of seed which can be sown at the two seasons, namely autumn and spring. These are the seeds of cabbage, lettuce, cardoon, rocket, cress, coriander, chervil, dill, parsnip, skirwort
and poppy. For these are sown either about September 1st or better in February before March 1st. In dry or warm districts, however, such<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">15</span><span class="br"></span>
as the sea-coasts of Calabria and Apulia, they can be put into the ground about January 13th. On the other hand, the seeds which ought to be sown only in the autumn—provided, however, that we inhabit a district either on the coast or exposed to the sun—are
commonly these: garlic, small heads of onion, African garlic<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL408_139_a" id="target_note_LCL408_139_a"><sup>a</sup></a> and mustard. But let us rather now arrange month by month at what season it is generally fitting that each kind should be put into the ground.</p>
<p>Immediately after January 1st it will be proper to<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">16</span><span class="br"></span> plant dittander. In the month of February rue, either as a plant or as a seed, and asparagus, and again the seed of the onion and the leek; likewise, if you want to have the yield in the spring and summer, you will bury in the ground the seeds of radish, turnip and navew. For ordinary garlic and African garlic are the last seeds which can be sown at this season. About March 1st you can transplant the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">17</span><span class="br"></span> leek in sunny positions, if it has already grown to a good size; and at the end of the month of March you can treat all-heal in the same way, and then about April 1st leeks likewise and elecampane and late plants of rue. Also cucumbers, gourds and capers must be sown that they may come up in good time. The best time to sow beet seed is when the pomegranate blossoms, but heads of leek can still be<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">18</span><span class="br"></span>
