of 16 <span class="italic">fingers.</span> The multiplication of the foot produces successively the <span class="italic">pace</span>, the <span class="italic">actus</span>, the <span class="italic">clima</span>, the <span class="italic">iugerum</span>, the <span class="italic">stadium</span> and the <span class="italic">centuria</span>, and afterward still larger measurements. The <span class="italic">pace</span> contains five feet. The<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span> <span class="italic">smallest actus</span> (as Marcus Varro says) is four feet wide and 120 feet long. The <span class="italic">clima</span> is 60 feet each way. The <span class="italic">square actus</span> is bounded by 120 feet each way; when doubled it forms a <span class="italic">iugerum,</span> and it has derived the name of <span class="italic">iugerum</span> from the fact that it was formed by joining.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL407_7_a" id="target_note_LCL407_7_a"><sup>a</sup></a> This <span class="italic">actus</span> the country folk of the province of Baetica call <span class="italic">acnua</span>; they also call a breadth of 30 feet and a length of 180 feet a <span class="italic">porca.</span> The Gauls give<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">6</span><span class="br"></span> the name <span class="italic">candetum</span> to areas of a hundred feet in urban districts but to areas of 150 feet in rural districts; they also call a half-<span class="italic">iugerum</span> an <span class="italic">arepennis.</span> Two <span class="italic">actus</span>, as I have said, form a <span class="italic">iugerum</span> 240 feet long and 120 feet wide, which two numbers multiplied together make 28,800 square feet. Next a <span class="italic">stadium</span> contains 125 paces (that is to say 625 feet) which multiplied by eight makes 1000 paces, which amount to 5000 feet.

It was proper that we should begin by<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">8</span><span class="br"></span> briefly mentioning these facts first, as being relevant to and closely connected with the system of calculation which we are going to set forth.</p>
