<p>XXXI. If any creature has fallen into the must

in order that it may not give the wine an evil odour, let the body in the condition in which it was found be burnt and its ashes when cool be poured
into the vessel into which it had fallen and stirred in with a wooden ladle; this will cure the trouble.</p>
<p>XXXII. Many people consider horehound-wine
<span class="marginNote right">How to make horehound wine.</span> beneficial for all internal complaints, and particularly
for a cough. When you are carrying out the vintage, collect tender stalks of horehound chiefly
from uncultivated and lean places and dry them in the sun; then make small bundles of them and tie them up with palm- or rush-string and let them down into a wine-jar so that the band sticks out. Put eight pounds of horehound into two hundred <span class="italic">sextarii</span> of sweet must, so that the horehound may ferment with the must; afterwards, take out the horehound and, after cleansing the wine, carefully seal it up.</p>

the following manner. First of all, forty days before you wish to begin the vintage, pick the squills and cut them up as thinly as possible, as you do radishes, and hang up the little sections in the shade to dry; then, when they are dry, put a pound of dry squill into forty-eight <span class="italic">sextarii</span> of Aminean must and let it remain there for thirty days; afterwards take it out and, after getting rid of the dregs. put the wine into sound wine-jars. Another prescription is<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> that a pound and a <span class="italic">quadrans</span> of dry squill should be put into forty-eight <span class="italic">sextarii</span> of must; in this I see nothing of which to approve.</p>
