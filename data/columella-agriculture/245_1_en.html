with the vines at intervals of six feet, there is no doubt that 41 vines must be assigned to the length and 21 to the breadth; these numbers multiplied together make a total of 861. But if the vineyard<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">8</span><span class="br"></span> has to be arranged with intervals of seven feet, a row will accommodate 35 heads lengthways and 18 breadthways; these numbers multiplied together make 630, and this, we shall say, is the number of plants which must be got ready. But if the vineyard is to be planted with intervals of eight feet, a row will accommodate 31 plants lengthways and 16 breadthways; these numbers multiplied together make 496. If the interval is to be nine feet, a row<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">9</span><span class="br"></span> will hold 27 plants lengthways and 14 breadthways; these numbers multiplied together make 378. With intervals of ten feet, a row will hold 25 plants lengthways and 13 breadthways; these numbers multiplied together make 325. So that our discussion may not be infinitely prolonged, we shall carry out our planting by using the same proportion to suit the wider spacing which any one of us prefers. Let what we have said about the measurement of land and the number of plants suffice. I now return to my proposed order of subjects.</p>
