<h3><span class="ac">Preface</span></h3>
<p>I am well aware, Publius Silvinus, that there are some intelligent farmers who have refused to keep cattle and have consistently rejected the pursuit of the master of a flock as harmful to their profession. I do not deny that they have some reason for so doing on the ground that the aim of the farmer is contrary to that of the shepherd, since the former rejoices in land which is tilled and cleared to the greatest possible extent, while the latter takes pleasure in ground which is fallow and grassy; the one hopes for the fruits of the earth, the other for the produce of his cattle, and so the cultivator detests while on the other hand the grazier longs for a rich yield of grass. But, in spite of these irreconcilable<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> desires, there exists a sort of alliance and union between them, because, firstly, it is generally better to use the food provided by one’s own farm in feeding one’s own cattle rather than those of other people, and, secondly, because it is owing to the plentiful use of manure, which is derived from flocks, that the fruits of the earth abound. Nor indeed is there any<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> region in which nothing but cereals is grown and which is not cultivated quite as much by the aid of cattle as of men. Hence also draught-animals (<span class="italic">iumenta</span>) and animals which draw the plough (<span class="italic">armenta</span>)
