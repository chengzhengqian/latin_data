It ought to be made in the following manner: an oil-vessel, as large as possible and either new or at any rate very solid, should be got ready; then at vintage-time sixty <span class="italic">sextarii</span> of must, of the best quality and as fresh as possible, should be poured into it together with eighty pounds weight of oil; then spices, which have not been sifted and not even pounded into small pieces, but slightly broken, should be put into a small net made of rush or linen and let down into part of the must and oil.

After the seventh day empty the oil out and store what remains of the must in a barrel treated
