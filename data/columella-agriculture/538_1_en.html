sets: the wind is West or North-west. On June 10th the Dolphin rises in the evening: the wind is in the West: there is sometimes a dew.</p>
<p>During these days, if we have been overwhelmed<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">46</span><span class="br"></span> with work, the same tasks must be carried out which should have been done at the end of May; also all fruit-bearing trees, after being dug round, ought to be earthed up, in order that this work may have been finished before the solstice. Moreover, according to local and climatic conditions, the earth is either broken up for the first time or the process is repeated. If the soil is difficult to work, it takes three labourers a day to break it up for the first time, two for the second time, and one for the third time, but two <span class="italic">iugera</span> can be harrowed by one labourer in a day; but if the soil is easy to work, a <span class="italic">iugerum</span> can be broken up for the first time by two labourers in a day, for the second time by one, while four <span class="italic">iugera</span> can be harrowed by one labourer, since broader ridges can be furrowed in soil which has been already worked. From this reckoning we can infer that in the autumn<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">47</span><span class="br"></span> a hundred and fifty <span class="italic">modii</span> of wheat can easily be sown with a single yoke of oxen, and a hundred <span class="italic">modii</span> of any kind of pulse.</p>
<p>During the same days the threshing-ground must be made ready so that whatever is cut down may be brought to it. The cultivation too of those vineyards which are on an unusually large scale ought to be repeated before the solstice. Fodder, if it is avail-<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">48</span><span class="br"></span> able, ought to be provided for cattle either now or else during the fifteen days which precede June 1st; but from June 1st if green grass is already lacking, up to the end of the autumn we shall cut and provide the foliage of trees.</p>
