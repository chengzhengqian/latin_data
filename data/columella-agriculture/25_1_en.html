though our victories and the annihilation of the enemy had desolated vast stretches of country, it was still a criminal matter for a senator to have more than fifty<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_51_a" id="target_note_LCL361_51_a"><sup>a</sup></a> <span class="italic">iugera</span> in his possession. And Gaius Licinius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_51_b" id="target_note_LCL361_51_b"><sup>b</sup></a> was condemned under the terms of his own law when, with an unrestrained passion for ownership, he had exceeded the limit of landholdings
which he had set up by legislation proposed when he was a tribune; and this not only because it was a mark of arrogance to occupy holdings of such extent, but quite as much for the reason that it seemed the more scandalous for a Roman citizen, by extending his ownership in unheard-of fashion beyond the sufficiency of his inheritance, to leave un-tilled
those lands which the enemy by their flight had abandoned. Therefore, as in all matters, so too in the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">12</span><span class="br"></span> acquiring of land, moderation shall be exercised. For only so much is to be occupied as is needed, that we may appear to have purchased what we may keep under control, not to saddle ourselves with a burden and to deprive others of its use and enjoyment after the manner of men of enormous wealth who, possessing entire countries of which they cannot even make the rounds, either leave them to be trampled by cattle and wasted and ravaged by wild beasts, or keep them occupied by citizens enslaved for debt<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_51_ca" id="target_note_LCL361_51_ca"><sup>c</sup></a> and by chain-gangs. But every manâ€˜s limit will be determined by his own desire plus his means; for, as I have said before, the desire<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">13</span><span class="br"></span> for possession does not suffice if you lack the wherewithal for cultivation.</p>
