the power of productiveness if it has not itself borne fruit. And this statement is not at variance with the former opinion. For it is evident that some men are incapable of procreation even though they have the full number of members; so that it should not be beyond belief that a cane sprung from a generative place, if devoid of fruit at present, will be devoid of progeny in the future also.</p>
<p>And so, to return to the usage of the farmers, they<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">15</span><span class="br"></span>
give the name <span class="italic">spadones</span> or eunuchs<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_293_a" id="target_note_LCL361_293_a"><sup>a</sup></a> to that sort of shoots which have produced nothing; which they would not do if they did not suppose them to be incapable of bearing. It is this very appellation that suggested to me a reason for not choosing mallet-shoots,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_293_b" id="target_note_LCL361_293_b"><sup>b</sup></a> even though they were sprung from an approved part of the vine, if they had not borne fruit; although I understand that even these are not entirely affected with barrenness. For I admit that stock-shoots<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_293_c" id="target_note_LCL361_293_c"><sup>c</sup></a> too, though they have come out of the hard wood, acquire fruitfulness the following season; and for that reason they are reduced to a single spur,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_293_d" id="target_note_LCL361_293_d"><sup>d</sup></a> so that it may have strength for bearing fruit. But we find that offspring of this sort owes 16 not so much to the spur itself as to the munificence of the mother vine. For because it clings to its own stock, which is naturally fruitful, still mingling with the elements of its parent,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_293_e" id="target_note_LCL361_293_e"><sup>e</sup></a> born of prolific seed and reared, so to speak, at the breasts of a nurse, it learns little by little to produce fruit. But when a slip is torn from the stock prematurely and unseasonably,
