products, such as grain, hay, leaves, chaff, and other fodder, should be stored in lofts. But the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">10</span><span class="br"></span> granaries, as I have said, should be reached by ladders and should receive ventilation through small openings on the north side; for that exposure is the coolest and the least humid, and both these considerations contribute to the preservation of stored grain. The same reason holds true in the placing<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">11</span><span class="br"></span> of the wine-room on the ground floor; and it should be far removed from the baths, oven, dunghill, and other filthy places which give off a foul odour, and no less so from cisterns and running water, from which is derived a moisture that spoils the wine.</p>
<p>And I am not unaware that some consider the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">12</span><span class="br"></span> best place for storing grain to be a granary with a vaulted ceiling, its earthen floor, before it is covered over, dug up and soaked with fresh and unsalted lees of oil and packed down with rammers as is Signian work.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_71_a" id="target_note_LCL361_71_a"><sup>a</sup></a> Then, after this has dried thoroughly, it is<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">13</span><span class="br"></span> overlaid in the same way with a pavement of tiles consisting of lime and sand mixed with oil lees instead of water, and these are beaten down with great force by rammers and are smoothed off; and all joints of walls and floor are bound together with a bolstering<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_71_b" id="target_note_LCL361_71_b"><sup>b</sup></a> of tile, for usually when buildings develop cracks in such places they afford holes and hiding-places
for underground animals. But granaries are also divided into bins to permit the storage of every kind of legume by itself. The walls are coated with<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">14</span><span class="br"></span> a plastering of clay and oil lees, to which are added, in place of chaff, the dried leaves of the wild olive
