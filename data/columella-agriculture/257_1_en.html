<p>But if we have in view the sowing of cereals also, the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">11</span><span class="br"></span> trees should be placed, if the soil is rich, at intervals of forty feet from one another, but if it is thin and nothing is planted in it, at intervals of twenty feet. Then when they begin to grow tall, they must be shaped with the pruning-hook and successive “stages” must be arranged; for the husbandmen call prominent branches and trunks by this name and either cut them closer with the knife or let them grow longer, that the vines may spread more loosely, the latter process being better on rich soil, the former on thin soil. The “stages” should be not less than<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">12</span><span class="br"></span> three feet apart from one another and so shaped that an upper branch may not be in the same line as a lower; for the lower branch will rub against the budding shoot let down from the upper branch and shake off the fruit.</p>
<p>But whatever tree you plant, you should not prune it during the next two years. Then afterwards, if the elm receives only a little growth, in the spring, before it sheds its bark, its top must be lopped off near the small branch which appears to be the most healthy, but in such a way as to leave above it on the trunk a stump nine inches long, towards which the branch can be trained and then applied and fastened, that, when it has been thus caught, it may provide a top for the tree. Then after a year the stump must<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">13</span><span class="br"></span> be cut away and the place smoothed off. If, however, the tree has no suitable small branch, it will be enough if nine feet from the ground it is left standing and the upper part lopped off, in order that the new rods which it will have put forth may be safe
