which we have said has the appearance of the Greek letter, measures the ground at the bottom of the trench and at the same time tests its exact level, because, if there is any slope downward or upward, it is detected by the position of the instrument; for the plumb-line that is placed on the aforementioned rod shows the one or the other and does not allow the overseer of the work to be deceived. The work so measured and levelled off progresses always towards a likeness to tilled fallow; and as the line is moved ahead, as much space is taken up as is occupied by the length and breadth of the trench that has been dug.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_319_b" id="target_note_LCL361_319_b"><sup>b</sup></a> And this method of preparing ground is most approved.</p>
<p>XIV. There follows the task of planting the vine; it is properly set out either in spring or in autumn; preferably in the spring if the weather is rainy or cold, or if the land is either fat or flat and wet plain; in autumn, on the other hand, if the atmosphere is dry or warm, if it is a poor and dry plain or a lean and steep hill. There are about forty days of the spring planting, from the Ides of February<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_319_c" id="target_note_LCL361_319_c"><sup>c</sup></a> up to the equinox; and of the autumn planting, from the Ides of October to the Calends of December.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_319_d" id="target_note_LCL361_319_d"><sup>d</sup></a> Moreover,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span>
there are two kinds of planting, with cuttings or with quicksets, both of which are in use by farmers; and in the provinces more use is made of the cutting, for they do not concern themselves with nurseries
