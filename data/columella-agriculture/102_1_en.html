so that it may rot quickly and be mixed with the thin soil; in the latter case when it has grown stronger, so that it may hold up the more solid clods longer and keep them suspended, to be broken down when heated by the summer sun.</p>

These things the ploughman will be able to accomplish if he makes provision not only for the varieties of forage crops which I have mentioned, but also for a supply of hay for the better maintenance of his cattle, without which it is difficult to work the land to advantage; and on that account the tending of a meadow is also required of him. To the meadow the ancient Romans assigned the leading rôle in agriculture, and to it also they gave its name (<span class="italic">pratum</span>)<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> from the fact that it was immediately “ready” (<span class="italic">paratum</span>)<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_205_a" id="target_note_LCL361_205_a"><sup>a</sup></a> and did not require a great amount of toil. Marcus Porcius,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_205_b" id="target_note_LCL361_205_b"><sup>b</sup></a> indeed, called to mind also the following considerations: that it is not damaged by storms like the other divisions of the farm, and that, though needing very little outlay, it yields a return year after year—and that not a single return, because it pays no less in pasturage than in hay.

For a meadow can be laid down both in stiff and in loose soil, however poor, if the opportunity for irrigation is offered. And it should not be a plain that slopes<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span>
