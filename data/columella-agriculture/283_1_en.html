grafts between the bark and the hard wood (both these methods belong to the season of spring); and the third, when the tree receives actual buds with a little bark into a part of it which has been stripped of the bark. The last kind the husbandmen call emplastration<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL407_103_a" id="target_note_LCL407_103_a"><sup>a</sup></a> or, according to some, inoculation.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL407_103_b" id="target_note_LCL407_103_b"><sup>b</sup></a> This type of grafting is best employed in the summer. When we have imparted the method of these graftings,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> we will also set forth another which we have discovered.</p>
<p>You should engraft all other trees as soon as they begin to put forth buds and when the moon is waxing, but the olive-tree about the spring equinox and until April 13th. See that the tree from which<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> you intend to graft and are going to take scions for insertion is young and fruitful and has frequent knots and, as soon as the buds begin to swell, choose from among the small branches which are a year old those which face the sun’s rising and are sound and have the thickness of the little ringer. The scions should have two or three points. You should cut the tree into which you wish to insert the scion carefully with a saw in the part which is most healthy and free from scars, and you will take care not to damage the bark. Then, when you have cut away<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span> part of the trunk, smooth over the wound with a sharp iron instrument; then put a kind of thin wedge of iron or bone between the bark and the firm-wood to a depth of not less than three inches, but do so carefully so as not to damage or break the bark. Afterwards with a sharp pruning-knife pare down the scions which you wish to insert, at their bottom end
