<p>The time which we advise for covering the she-goats<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">6</span><span class="br"></span> is during the autumn, some time before the month of December, so that the kids may be born when spring is already approaching and the shrubs are coming into bud and the woods just sprouting with new foliage. A site for the goatsâ€™ stable should be chosen which has a natural or artificial stone floor, since no litter is provided for this animal. A careful goatherd sweeps out the stable every day and does not allow any ordure or moisture to remain or any mud to form, all of which things are prejudicial to goats. If a she-goat is of good stock, it frequently bears twins and sometimes triplets. It is<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">7</span><span class="br"></span> a very poor increase when two mothers produce only three kids between them.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL407_281_a" id="target_note_LCL407_281_a"><sup>a</sup></a> When the kids are born, they are reared in the same manner as lambs except that their wantonness must be more repressed and kept within stricter bounds. Besides an abundance of milk, elm-seed or shrub-trefoil or ivy must be provided, or else tops of mastic and other delicate foliage must be put before them. When there are sets of twins, from each pair one, whichever seems to be the more robust, is reserved to fill up the herd, while the rest are handed over to the dealers. A she-goat of only one or two years (for both ages are capable of bearing young) should not be given kids to rear; for it ought not to bring up a kid till it is three years old. And a mother of one year ought to be<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">8</span><span class="br"></span> immediately deprived of its offspring, but a kid of a two-year-old mother ought to be left with it until it is ready to be sold. The mother-goats ought not to be kept beyond eight years, because, worn out by continual bearing, they end by becoming barren. The herd-master ought to be keen, hardy, energetic,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">9</span><span class="br"></span>
