so that there is a cleft of three inches in it. Then insert a wedge by which the cleft may be kept open, and thrust down into it scions which have been pared away on both sides, in such a way as to make the bark of the scion exactly meet the bark of the tree. When<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">8</span><span class="br"></span> you have carefully fitted in the scions, pull out the wedge and bind the tree in the manner described above; then heap the earth round the tree right up to the graft. This will give the best protection from wind and heat.</p>
<p>A third kind of grafting is our own invention; being a very delicate operation, it is not suited to every kind of tree. Generally speaking those trees admit of this kind of grafting which have moist, juicy and strong bark, like the fig-tree; for this both yields<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">9</span><span class="br"></span> a great abundance of milk and has a stout bark, and so a graft can be very successfully inserted by the following method.
