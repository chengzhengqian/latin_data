The shrew-<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span> mouse atones with its own body for the harm which it has inflicted; for the animal itself is killed by being drowned in oil, and, when it has putrefied, it is crushed and the bite inflicted by the shrew-mouse is anointed with it as a remedy. If this is not available and the swelling shows teeth-marks, cumin is crushed up and a little liquid pitch and axle-grease is added to it, so that it may have the soft consistency of a poultice. The application of this gets rid of the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">6</span><span class="br"></span> mischief. If the swelling turns into a suppuration before it is dispersed, it is best to cut away the abscess with a hot iron plate and burn away any harmful matter and then anoint the place with liquid pitch and oil. There is also a practice of encasing the shrew-mouse itself while still alive in potter’s clay and, when the clay is dry, hanging it round the ox’s neck. This renders the animal immune from the bite of a shrew-mouse.</p>
<p>Maladies of the eyes are generally cured with<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">7</span><span class="br"></span> honey. If they have swollen up, wheaten flour is sprinkled with honey water and applied to the eyes; or, if there is a white film on the eye, Spanish or Ammoniac<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL407_173_b" id="target_note_LCL407_173_b"><sup>b</sup></a> or even Cappadocian rock-salt, pounded small and mixed with honey, lessens the malady. The shell of a cuttle-fish ground up and blown into the eye three times a day through a pipe has the same effect, as also has the root which the Greeks call <span class="italic">silphion</span> and of which the common name in our language is <span class="italic">laserpitium.</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL407_173_c" id="target_note_LCL407_173_c"><sup>c</sup></a> To any quantity of this ten parts of<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">8</span><span class="br"></span> Ammoniac salt are added; and both are poured similarly into the eye after being ground up in the same manner, or else the root of the same plant crushed up and
