sow it in manured and well-worked soil; then when it has reached some growth, it should be earthed up from time to time; for if it emerges above ground, it will become hard and full of holes.</p>
<p>The cucumber and gourd require less care when<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">48</span><span class="br"></span> there is plenty of water; for they take a very great delight in moisture. But if they have had to be sown in a dry place, where it is not easy to supply running water, a ditch one foot and a half deep must be made in the month of February; then after March 15th about one-third of the depth of the trench must be covered by placing straw in it; next, well-manured
earth must be heaped up so as to fill half the trench and, after the seeds have been put in, water must be supplied until the seeds come up. And when the plants begin to thrive, earth must be added to keep pace with their growth, until the trench is filled to the level of the ground. Thus cultivated the seeds will thrive quite well during the whole summer without irrigation and provide fruit of a pleasanter flavour than if they were watered by irrigation. But<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">49</span><span class="br"></span>
in watery places the seeds must be planted as early as possible, though not before March 1st, so that they can be transplanted when the equinox is passed. You should take the seed from the middle of a gourd and place it in the ground with its top inverted, so that it may attain a greater growth; for the fruits are quite suitable for use as vessels, like the Alexandrian gourds, when they have been thoroughly dried. But if you are growing them to sell for eating,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">50</span><span class="br"></span> the seed will have to be taken from the neck of the gourd and sown with its top upright, so that the fruit which grows from it may be longer and narrower; this certainly commands a better price than any
