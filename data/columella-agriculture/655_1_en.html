both methods, and the flesh is cut up into pieces weighing a pound each. Then salt, toasted but only slightly broken up, as I have described above, is spread at the bottom of a tub; next the pieces of meat are packed closely together in layers and salt is put in between each layer. When the brim of the barrel is almost reached, the rest is filled with salt and it is pressed down into the vessel by weights put on the top. This meat always keeps good and, like salt fish, remains in its own brine.</p>

Then, as pickle-makers usually did, make an incision in the form of an X with a crescent-shaped iron instrument; but take care not to cut down to the bottom of the turnip. Then sprinkle salt, which should not be very fine, amongst the incisions in the turnips and arrange them in a tray or tub and after sprinkling them with a little more salt leave them alone for three days until they exude their moisture.

Then, when it seems to have absorbed enough, take all the turnips out and wash them each in its own juice, or if there is not much liquid, add some hard brine and then wash them. After that arrange them in a square wickerwork basket, which is not closely woven but still solidly and made of thick withies. Then put on the top a board so fitted that it can, if necessary, be pressed down inside the crate right to the bottom.
