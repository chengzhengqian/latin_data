age requires three firm wood branches, rarely four, which should be separated by the binder into as many different parts. For it is of no use that the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">6</span><span class="br"></span>
frame is given cross-pieces and made in the shape of a star unless fruit-bearing branches are joined to it. This arrangement, however, has not met the approval of all husbandmen; for many have been satisfied with a plain straight line. But that vine is more stable, both for supporting the burden of young branches and for bearing its fruit, which, being bound to the frame on both sides, is spread out in even balance as if with a kind of anchors. Then too a vine that is supported on every side spreads its woody branches over more arms and extends them more easily than one which is crowded with many fruiting canes on a simple “horse.” However, if a vine is<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">7</span><span class="br"></span> not of wide spread or not very fruitful, and if it is in a climate that is not turbulent and stormy, it may be satisfied with a single frame. For where there is great violence and onslaught of rains and storms, where the vine is loosened by frequent downpours, where it hangs, as it were, on steep hillsides and requires a great many reinforcments, there it must be supported
on every side, so to speak, by troops in square formation. But in warm and drier places the frame<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">8</span><span class="br"></span>
must be extended in every direction, so that the shoots, as they creep forth on every side, may be joined and, being matted together in the fashion of an arched roof, may shade the thirsty earth. On the contrary, in rainy and cold and frosty districts plain straight rows are to be put up; for in that way the ground is more readily warmed by the sun, and the fruit is thoroughly ripened and has a more wholesome ventilation; also the diggers ply their hoes with
