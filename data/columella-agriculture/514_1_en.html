<p>I. Claudius, a priest of Augustus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL408_49_aa" id="target_note_LCL408_49_aa"><sup>a</sup></a> and a young
<span class="marginNote right">The duties of a bailiff.</span> man equally distinguished for his ingenuous disposition
and for his erudition, encouraged by the discourses of several men of learning and especially of those interested in agriculture, extorted from me a promise to write a treatise in prose on the cultivation of gardens. Nor did this circumstance escape my memory when I was seeking to confine the said subject within the rules of poetry. But when you,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> Publius Silvinus, persistently demanded a taste of my versification, I could not bring myself to refuse, intending presently, if it should be your pleasure, to undertake the task on which I am now entering, namely, to append the duties of a gardener to the functions of a bailiff. Although I seemed already to some extent to have accomplished this in my first book on Agriculture, yet since my friend the priest of Augustus rather often demanded it of me with an eagerness which matches your own, I have exceeded the number of books which I had already practically completed, and have published this eleventh book of the principles of husbandry.</p>
