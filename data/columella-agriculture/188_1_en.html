To us it seems that plants should not be held back by close pruning unless they are very weak, and that at least they should not be cut in the spring. But, to be sure, in the first year<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span>
that they are set out they should be aided, every month while they are in leaf, by frequent digging and by leaf-pruning, so that they may gain strength and support not more than one branch of firm wood. And when they have reared this they should be trimmed clean, in our opinion, in the autumn, or in the spring if it is more convenient, and freed from secondary shoots which the leaf-pruner had left on the upper part; and so they should be placed upon the frame. For it is the smooth and straight vine, without a scar, that overtops the frame with a rod of the first year. This happens, however, with few farmers, and seldom; and for that reason the aforementioned authors thought it best to cut off the first shoots of the vine.

For experience has condemned that long-standing belief that year-old cuttings should not be touched with the knife because they have a dread of it.
