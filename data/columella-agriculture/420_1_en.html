<p>But the possession of these birds is a rare circumstance<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> and so an unusual amount of care must be exercised in inland districts, and the following procedure must be followed. A flat piece of land covered with grass and trees is enclosed with a high fence to three sides of which galleries are attached, while on the fourth side there are two huts, one for the dwelling-place of the custodian, the other as a peacock-house. Then in the galleries enclosures are made with reeds in a row to form coops such as are placed on the roofs of a pigeon-house. These enclosures are separated from one another by barriers as it were of reeds which run between them, so arranged as to have one entrance on either side. The<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span> peacock-house ought to be entirely free from damp, and in the floor short stakes are fixed in a row, the tops of which have carefully hewn tenons for insertion into holes made in the transverse perches. Moreover, these perches which are placed on the top of the stakes are cut square, so that they may give a foothold to a bird when it leaps onto them, but they are made so as to be removable in order that, when it is necessary, they may be detached from the stakes and give free access to those who are sweeping out the peacock-house.</p>
<p>This kind of fowl, when it has completed its first<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span> three years, breeds excellently, but at a tenderer age it is either sterile or not very prolific. The male bird has the salaciousness of the farmyard cock and so requires five hens; for if it frequently covers one or two of them that have been laying, it spoils eggs which are hardly yet formed in the womb and does not allow them to be brought to birth, since they fall out of the genital parts while they are still immature.
