These props and their like must be gone over again after the pruning, and the decayed parts must be hewn away and sharpened; and some, if they are sound, <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span>
are to be reversed, while others, which are either rotten or shorter than is proper, must be removed and replaced with suitable props; those that are lying flat must be set up, and those that lean are to be straightened. As for the frame, if there is no need of a new one, have fresh bindings worked into the mending of it. If it seems to need rebuilding, let it be tied together with poles or reeds before the vine is attached to its prop, and then, as I have directed in the case of a newly planted vine,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_429_a" id="target_note_LCL361_429_a"><sup>a</sup></a> we should bind the vine to the stake, close to the head and below the arms; and this tying should not be done every year in the same place, lest the band cut into the stock and choke it.

And when two mature branches are extended along one part of the frame, let a bar come between them; and let the separated vine-shoots run out over the quadrangular openings<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_429_c" id="target_note_LCL361_429_c"><sup>c</sup></a> of the frames, and, as if plunging
