days as vetch, near the time of the equinox; the other, however, at the end of January or early in February, when it is sown for seed; though we use six <span class="italic">modii</span> to the <span class="italic">iugerum</span> for the latter sowing, and seven for the former. Both sowings are made not without advantage before the ground is prepared, and care is taken that it be ploughed closely but not deeply, for if the seed is covered more than four fingers deep it does not easily come up; and for this reason some people break the ground with the smallest ploughs before sowing, and then scatter the seed and cover it with light hoes.</p>
<p>Bitter vetch, on the other hand, thrives on soil that<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">34</span><span class="br"></span>
is lean but not moist, because it is usually spoiled by rankness. It may be sown in autumn and equally well after the winter solstice, in the latter part of January or all of February, if only before the first day of March. This whole month, farmers say, is not suited to this legume, because when sown at this time it is harmful to cattle, and especially to oxen, in which it causes brain-madness when they eat it.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_179_a" id="target_note_LCL361_179_a"><sup>a</sup></a> It is sown five <span class="italic">modii</span> to the <span class="italic">iugerum.</span></p>

But twelve pounds of bitter vetch are sufficient for one yoke, and sixteen of chick-pea. This same chick-pea is not unsuited to human use, and is not unpleasant; in taste, at least, it differs not at all from the chickling-vetch, being distinguished merely by its colour, for it is more dirty-looking
