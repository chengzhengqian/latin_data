chickens and others are more suitable for bringing them up when they have been hatched. Some hens, on the other hand, break and consume both their own and other hensâ€™ eggs; any hen which does this will have to be got rid of immediately.</p>
<p>The chickens of two or three hens, when they have<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">7</span><span class="br"></span> been hatched and are still very young, should be transferred to one mother, whichever is the best nurse; but this must always be done the very first day while the mother, owing to their similarity, is unable to distinguish her own young and those of other hens. A limit, however, must be observed, which ought not to be more than thirty head; for it is said that a larger flock than this cannot be cared for by a single hen.<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">8</span><span class="br"></span> The rule is observed of putting an uneven number of eggs under a hen, but it is not always the same number.

This is quite illogical, since obviously more eggs can be given to a hen to sit upon in warm than in cold weather.
