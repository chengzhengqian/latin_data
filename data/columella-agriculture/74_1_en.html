There are, nevertheless, certain seeds that do better than others in enduring the heat of spring, such as white wheat (<span class="italic">siligo</span>), Galatian barley, the three-months emmer,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_149_a" id="target_note_LCL361_149_a"><sup>a</sup></a> and the grain of the Marsian bean; for the other hardy grains should always be sown before winter in temperate localities.</p>

It is best that such bare spots be<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">9</span><span class="br"></span> indicated by the use of markers, so that we may take measures against faults of this kind in due season; for in a place where oozy ground or some other plague kills out the crop it is best that pigeon dung or, failing that, cypress foliage be scattered and ploughed in. But the very first thing to do is to draw off all free water by running a furrow; otherwise the aforesaid remedies will be useless.
