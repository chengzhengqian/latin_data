<p>It is advisable not to keep any but the most salacious<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">9</span><span class="br"></span> cock-birds and the same colour as in hens, and the same number of claws is looked for in them, but a loftier stature. Their crest should be high, blood-red and not crooked, their eyes darkish or tending towards black, their beaks short and hooked, their ears very large and white, their wattles bright-red tending towards white and hanging down like grey beards, their head-feathers of different colours or gold shading into yellow and extending over their throats and necks on to their shoulders. Their chests should<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">10</span><span class="br"></span> be broad and muscular, their wings brawny and like arms, and their tails very prominent and divided into two halves, bending over with a single projecting feather on each side. They should also have huge thighs, thickly covered with bristling feathers; their legs should be robust but not long, and armed for offence with what may be described as stakes ready for the attack. These male birds, though they are<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">11</span><span class="br"></span> not being trained for fighting and the glory of winning prizes, are, nevertheless, esteemed as well-bred if they are proud, lively, watchful and ready to crow frequently and not easily to be frightened; for on occasion they have to act on the defensive and protect their flock of wives, nay, even to slay a snake which rears its threatening head or some other hurtful animal.</p>
<p>For such male birds as these five hens each are<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">12</span><span class="br"></span> provided. Of the Rhodian and Median breeds the father-birds are not very salacious on account of their heavy build, nor are the mother-birds very prolific: however, three hens are mated with each cock-bird. And when they have laid a few eggs, they are lazy about sitting on them and much more so about hatching
