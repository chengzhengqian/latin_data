White lilies sown between the furrows in the garden make a brilliant show and the gilliflowers have no less pure a colour; then there are red and yellow roses and purple violets and sky-blue larkspur; also the Corycian<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL407_437_c" id="target_note_LCL407_437_c"><sup>c</sup></a> and Sicilian saffron-bulbs are planted to give colour and scent to the honey.
