to such a size as will fill the space given by a wedge which has been thrust in, in such a way as not to damage the cambium or the bark on the other side. When you have got the scions ready, pull out the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span> wedge and immediately push down the scions into the holes which you made by driving in the wedge between the bark and the firm-wood. Put in the scions by inserting the end where you have pared them down in such a way that they stand out half-afoot or more from the tree. You will be correct in inserting two grafts in one tree, or more if the trunk is larger, provided that the space between them is not less than four inches. In doing so take into account the size of the tree and the quality of the bark. When you have put in all the scions that the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">6</span><span class="br"></span> tree will stand, bind the tree with elm-bark or reeds or osiers; next with well-worked clay mixed with straw daub the whole of the wound and the space between the grafts to the point at which the scions still project at least four inches. Then put moss over the clay and bind it on so that the rain may not seep through. Some people, however, prefer to make a place for the slips in the trunk of the tree with a saw and then smooth the parts in which cuts have been made with a thin surgical-knife and then fit in the grafts. If the tree which you wish to engraft is<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">7</span><span class="br"></span> small, cut it off low down so that it projects a foot and a half from the ground; then, after cutting it down, carefully smooth the wound and split the stock in the middle a little way with a sharp knife,
