Now, the most fruitful cuttings are not, as ancient authorities supposed, the extreme part of the vine—what they call its head, that is, the outermost and most extended shoot; for in this also husbandmen are mistaken. But the reason for this misapprehension lies in the prime appearance of the shoot and in the number of clusters very often seen on the longest branch. But we should not be deceived in this matter; for it comes about, not through the natural fertility of that branch, but through favourableness of location; because all the moisture and nourishment that is supplied by the soil courses through the other portions of the stem until it arrives at the tip. For by natural respiration all<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span>
