on the other hand the lack of food in winter is relieved by putting food for them under cover in their folds. They can be most conveniently fed on leaves of elm or ash which have been kept in store or on autumn hay, which is called the “after-crop”; for it is softer and therefore pleasanter than the early crop. Shrub-trefoil<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">22</span><span class="br"></span> and cultivated vetch also make excellent fodder; but, when all else has failed, chaff of dried pulse must be used as a last resort, for barley by itself or chickling-vetch crushed with beans is too expensive to be provided at a reasonable price in districts near towns; but, wherever their cheapness allows, they are undoubtedly the best food. As for<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">23</span><span class="br"></span> the times at which sheep ought to be fed and taken to water during the summer, my opinion is the same as that delivered by Maro:</p>

<span class="line">The dew is sweetest to the feeding herd.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Then, when the sky’s fourth hour brings thirst to all,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Let’s lead the flocks to wells and deep-dug</span><span class="linebreak"></span>

<p class="noindent">and in the middle of the day, as the same poet says, let us conduct them to a valley,</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">Where haply Jove’s great oak with hardwood old</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Stretches its giant branches or a grove</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
