<p>Fecundity in pigeons, though it is much less than in hens, yet brings in greater profit; for a pigeon, if it is a good breeder, rears eight broods in the year, and so pigeons fill the coffers of their owners with the prices which their young command, as that excellent writer Marcus Varro<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL407_367_a" id="target_note_LCL407_367_a"><sup>a</sup></a> assures us, who has recorded that, even in those more austere times, a single pair used to be sold for 1,000 sesterces. It<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">10</span><span class="br"></span> makes us blush for the present generation, if we are willing to believe that people can be found to pay 4,000 <span class="italic">nummi</span> for a pair of birds, though I should regard those people who pay great sums in copper and silver for the pleasure which their pets give them merely because they own and possess them, as less insufferable than those who clear of all their birds the river Phasis<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL407_367_b" id="target_note_LCL407_367_b"><sup>b</sup></a> in Pontus and the pools of Lake Maeotis<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL407_367_c" id="target_note_LCL407_367_c"><sup>c</sup></a> in Scythia; nay, they are now in their drunkenness belching forth birds brought from the Ganges and from Egypt.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the fattening process can also be<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">11</span><span class="br"></span> carried out in this pigeon-house, as has already been said; for if any barren or badly-coloured pigeons occur, they are crammed in the same manner as hens. Young pigeons indeed are more easily fattened under their mothersâ€™ care, if when they are already strong but before they begin to fly, you pull out a few of their wing-feathers and crush their legs, that they may remain quiet in one spot, and give plenty of food to the parent-birds with which they may feed themselves and their young more abundantly. Some people bind their legs loosely together,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">12</span><span class="br"></span>
