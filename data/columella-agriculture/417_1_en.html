Half a <span class="italic">modius</span> of food every day easily satisfies a hundred and twenty turtle-doves. The<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span> purest possible water is always provided in vessels such as are used for pigeons and hens. The mats are kept clean so that the dung does not burn their feet, and the dung should itself be carefully set aside for the cultivation of the fields and trees, as also that of all birds except those which swim.

So, to prevent this, some old thrushes ought to be mixed with them which, having been brought up by the fowlers for this purpose, may serve as decoys for the captives and may mitigate their distress by flying in among them. For in this way wild birds will become used to seeking both their water and their food when they have seen the tame birds doing so.
