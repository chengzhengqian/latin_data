Now the method of doing this must be handed down, not only to future husbandmen of the Italian race, but also to those from the provinces; for in countries that are far distant and quite remote this particular way of turning and subduing a field is very little practised, but the vines are set for the most part either in planting-holes or in furrows. Those,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span>
moreover, whose habit it is to set the vine in planting-holes, after excavating the earth for about three feet in length and two in depth—to as great a width as that of the iron spade permits, lay the shoots on both sides along the walls of the ditches and bend them to stand erect at the opposite ends of the holes; and then, allowing two eyes to project above ground, they replace the earth about it and level off the rest. This they do in the same line, leaving undug skips of the same number of feet, until they come to the end of the row. Then leaving a space, according to each<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span>

And if the earth is merely turned by a spade-man, the minimum distance between rows is five feet, and seven is the maximum; but if with oxen and plough, the minimum is seven feet, while ten is large enough.
