21st one of the Hyades sets in the morning: the weather is wintry. On November 22nd the Hare sets in the morning: a storm is portended. On November 25th the Dog-star sets at sunrise: the weather is wintry. On November 30th the Hyades set completely: the wind is from the West or the South; it sometimes rains.</p>
<p>During these days you will have to finish the tasks<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">90</span><span class="br"></span> which have been omitted during the previous days, and if we do not carry out very extensive sowing, it is best to have completed it before December 1st. But also, when the nights are long, some time must be added to the period of daylight; for there are many things which can be properly done by artificial light. For if we possess vineyards, poles and props can be hewn and sharpened; or if the district is productive of fennel or bark, hives should be made for the bees; or if it is rich in palm-trees or broom, frails and baskets can be made; or if it abounds in twigs, hampers can be made from osiers. Not to go now into<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">91</span><span class="br"></span> detail of all the other things that can be made, there is no district which does not provide something which can be made by artificial light; for he is the lazy farmer who waits for the short day to begin, especially in regions when the winter days last for only nine hours while the night goes on for fifteen hours. Willows also cut down the previous day can be<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">92</span><span class="br"></span> cleaned by artificial light and prepared as ties for the vines; if they are not naturally tough enough, they should be cut down fifteen days beforehand and, after being cleaned, buried in dung, in order that they may be toughened; but if they have been cut a long time ago and have become dry, they should be soaked in a pond. Then too you should sharpen iron tools
