<p>XII. It is very important to have as much shrub-trefoil
<span class="marginNote right">Of the Cytisus or Shrub-Trefoil.</span> as possible on your land, because it is most useful
for chickens, bees, sheep, goats, oxen and cattle of every kind, which quickly grow fat upon it and it makes ewes yield a very large quantity of milk; moreover you could also use it for eight months of the year as green fodder and afterwards as dry. Furthermore, on any ground whatsoever, even if it be very lean, it quickly takes root, and it bears any ill-treatment without taking harm.

As soon as a plant begins to put forth young foliage, hoe the ground. Then after three years cut down the plants and give them to the cattle.
