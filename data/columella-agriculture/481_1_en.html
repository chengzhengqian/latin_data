honey-combs are also found; for even if they live in<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">7</span><span class="br"></span> harmony together, each community keeps to its own manner of shaping and constructing its waxen cells. All the combs, however, always hang down from the roofs of the hives, adhering very little to the sides and in such a way as not to touch the bottom, thus leaving a passage for the swarms. But<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">8</span><span class="br"></span> the shape of the wax cells depends on the nature of the bee-house; for square and round and also long dimensions impose their own shapes upon the honeycombs as if they were moulds, and that is why the honey-combs are not always found to be of the same shape. But of whatever kind they are, they should not all be removed; for at the first harvesting of honey, when the country still provides plenty of food, one-fifth of the honey-combs must be left; at the later harvesting, when the winter is already causing apprehension, a third part should be left. This, however, is not a fixed rule for all districts, since<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">9</span><span class="br"></span> plans for the bees must be dependent on the abundance of flowers and the richness of the food available. If the hanging waxen cells run into length, the combs must be cut with the iron tool which resembles a knife and must be received by putting your two arms underneath them, and so removed; but if they run horizontally and keep close to the roofs of the hives, then you must use the scraping instrument, so that they may be cut down by the pressure exerted on the side which faces you. But old and defective<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">10</span><span class="br"></span> honey-combs ought to be removed, and those which are soundest and full of honey should be left, as also those which contain young bees, so that they may be preserved for propagating a swarm.</p>
