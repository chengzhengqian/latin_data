bared, so that it exactly corresponds to the area on the other tree from which the bark has been stripped. Having done this, bind the bud well all round and be<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">11</span><span class="br"></span> careful not to damage the sprout itself. Then daub the joints of the wound and the ties round them with mud, leaving a space, so that the bud may be free and not be constricted by the binding. Cut away the shoot and upper branches of the tree into which you have inserted the graft, so that there may be nothing to which the sap can be drawn off or benefit from the sap to another part rather than the graft. After the twenty-first day unbind the scutcheon. This kind of grafting is very successful with the olive also.</p>
<p>The fourth method of grafting we have already<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">12</span><span class="br"></span> explained when we treated of vines; so it is superfluous to repeat here the method of “terebration” already described.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL407_109_a" id="target_note_LCL407_109_a"><sup>a</sup></a></p>
<p>But since the ancients denied that <span class="italic">any</span> kind of scion could be grafted on <span class="italic">any</span> kind of tree and, according to the limitation which we made use of just now,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL407_109_b" id="target_note_LCL407_109_b"><sup>b</sup></a> established as a hard and fast rule that only those scions can unite which resemble the trees in which they are inserted in bark and rind and fruit, we have thought it advisable to destroy this erroneous opinion and to hand down to posterity a method by which any kind of scion can be grafted upon any kind of tree. That we may not weary the reader with<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">13</span><span class="br"></span> too long a discourse, we will submit a single example by following which any kind of scion can be grafted upon a different kind of tree.</p>
