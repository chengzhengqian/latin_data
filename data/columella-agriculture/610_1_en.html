This, moreover, certainly increases the amount of wine and improves its bouquet, but it is attended by the risk that the wine may be spoilt if the water is not properly boiled. This water, as I have already said, is taken as far as possible from the shore; for the greater the distance in the open sea from which it is drawn, the clearer and the purer it is. If one stores<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span> it, as Columella did, and after three years strains it and transfers it to other vessels and then after another three years boils it down to one-third of its volume, he will have a much better preservative for his wine and there will be no risk of his wines being spoilt. But it is enough to add one <span class="italic">sextarius</span> of salt water to two <span class="italic">urnae</span> of must, although many people indeed mix in two and some even three <span class="italic">sextarii.</span> I should have no objection to doing this if the type of wine had such strength that the taste of the salt water would not be noticed. Therefore a careful landed proprietor,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">6</span><span class="br"></span> when he has secured an estate, will at the first vintage immediately make trial of three or four different kinds of preservative in as many different jars, so that he may discover how much salt water the wine which he has made can stand without spoiling the taste.</p>

When the mixture has settled, strain off the lye; then put in again the same quantity of lye and mix and strain in the same manner; then repeat the process for a third time. The ashes take away the smell of the pitch and wash away impurities.
