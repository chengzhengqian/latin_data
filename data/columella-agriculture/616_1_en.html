Then into each vessel, which should contain seven <span class="italic">amphorae</span>, put an ounce and eight <span class="italic">scripula</span> of the preparation, and, if the must comes from marshy ground, three<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> heminae of gypsum in each jar, or, if it comes from newly-established vineyards, a <span class="italic">sextarius,</span> or, if from old-established and dry places, one <span class="italic">hemina.</span> On the third day after you have trodden the grapes, pour in the preservative, but before you begin the process of preserving, transfer a small quantity of must from one vessel to another, lest in the process of preservation it ferments with the preservative and overflows.
