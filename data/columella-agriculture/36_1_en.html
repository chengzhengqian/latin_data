or, if these are wanting, of the olive. Then, when the aforesaid plastering has dried, it is again sprinkled over with oil lees: and when this has dried the grain is brought in. This seems to be the most advantageous<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">15</span><span class="br"></span> method of protecting stored produce from damage by weevils and like vermin, and if it is not carefully laid away they quickly destroy it. But the type of granary just described, unless it be in a dry section of the steading, causes even the hardest grain to spoil with mustiness; and if it were not for this, it would be possible to keep grain even buried underground, as in certain districts across the sea<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_73_aa" id="target_note_LCL361_73_aa"><sup>a</sup></a> where the earth, dug out in the manner of pits, which they call <span class="italic">siri,</span> takes back to itself the fruits which it has produced.

Many think that when this kind of pest appears it can be checked if the damaged grain is winnowed in the bin and cooled off, as it were. But this is a most<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">17</span><span class="br"></span> mistaken notion; for the insects are not driven off by so doing, but are mixed through the whole mass.
