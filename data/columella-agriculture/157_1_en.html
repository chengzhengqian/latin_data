whatever direction they creep out, not repelling their growth by its hardness, but taking them into its tender nourishing bosom, as it were, admitting the rains of heaven and dispensing them for the sustenance of the plants, and acting with all its members in harmony for the rearing of its new offspring.</p>
<p>A level field should be dug two and one-half feet<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">8</span><span class="br"></span>
deep, a sloping region three feet; but a steeper hill should be turned to a depth of four feet, because when earth is carried down from a higher to a lower place, the amount thrown back is barely sufficient for trenching unless you make the bank much higher than on level ground. On the other hand, in sunken valleys it is not proper to set the vine less than two feet deep. For it is better not to plant it at all than to leave it suspended on the surface of the earth; except, however, when marshy ground stands in the way, as in the district about Ravenna, and prevents digging deeper than a foot and a half.

is, moreover, a first principle of the aforesaid operation not to deepen the furrow little by little, as is the practice of most farmers of our time, and so by a second or third gradation to arrive at the intended depth of trenching; but, running a line evenly forward, to extend a continuous trench with perpendicular sides and to pile the earth together behind you as it is removed, and to sink the trench down until it has reached the prescribed measure of depth. Then the line must be moved evenly over the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">10</span><span class="br"></span>
whole extent of the gradation; and you must see to it that the width is made the same at the bottom as it was started at the top. There is need, too, of an experienced and watchful overseer to give orders that the bank be made plumb and the furrow
