way the vine is forced to drive its roots downwards. I shall not deny that this can be done with advantage in dry places; but where either the district is marshy or the climate rainy, I am of opinion that it should certainly not be done, for excessive moisture standing in the half-filled plant-holes kills the plants before they can gain strength. Therefore I think that it<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span> is more expedient that the plant-holes should be filled up again after the vine-stock has been put into them, but, when the plants have taken root, immediately after the autumn equinox, the soil round them ought to be carefully dug up<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL407_33_a" id="target_note_LCL407_33_a"><sup>a</sup></a> to a good depth and, after the rootlets which they may have put forth on the surface of the ground have been cut away, the earth ought to be filled in again after a few days. In this way two inconveniences will be avoided; firstly, the roots are not drawn to the upper part of the soil, and, secondly, the plants will not be troubled by excessive rains while they are still weak. When,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">6</span><span class="br"></span> however, they have become quite strong, there is no doubt that they are greatly benefited by the rains from heaven; and so, in places where the mildness of the winter allows it, it will be expedient to leave the vines uncovered and to keep the soil round them loose the whole winter.</p>
<p>As regards the sort of vine-plants, the authorities are not agreed amongst themselves. Some think that it is better to plant a vineyard with mallet-shoots from the first, others think that it should be planted with quick-sets; I have already stated my opinion in the earlier part of this work.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL407_33_b" id="target_note_LCL407_33_b"><sup>b</sup></a> However, I now add this further point, that there are<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">7</span><span class="br"></span> some lands where vines which have been transplanted do not answer as well as those which have not been
