The must will then keep sweet for as much as a year.</p>
<p>XXX. From the time when you have first put the covers on the wine-jars until the spring equinox, it is enough to attend to the wine once every thirty-six
days, and after the spring equinox twice in that period, or, if the wine begins to “flower” you will have to attend to it more often, lest the “flower” sink to the bottom and ruin the flavour.
