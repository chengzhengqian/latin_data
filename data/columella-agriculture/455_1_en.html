<p>VII. But since most people regard all this as involving

A bank made of stones built three feet high is stretched across the apiary and carefully smoothed over with plaster, so that no chance of climbing it may be offered to lizards and snakes or other harmful creatures; then on the top of it are placed either<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> bee-houses made with bricks, which Celsus prefers, or, as we prefer, hives walled round except at the back; or else—and this is the practice of almost all those who are careful in these matters—receptacles arranged in a row are fastened together either with small bricks or with unhewn stones in such a way that each is contained within two narrow walls and the two sides, at the back and at the front, are left free; for the sides on which they issue forth have sometimes to be opened and this is especially necessary at the back because the swarms have to be attended to from time to time.
