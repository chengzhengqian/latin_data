<p>XIII. I now come to those birds which the Greeks
<span class="marginNote right">Amphibious birds.</span> call “amphibious,” because they require not only food produced from the earth but also that which comes from the water, and have accustomed themselves quite as much to standing water as to the land. Of this type of bird the goose is particularly acceptable to farmers, because it does not demand very much attention and keeps watch more cleverly than a dog, since by its cackling it betrays the presence of anyone<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span>
who is lying in wait, just as (so history has informed us) when during the siege of the Capitol it was the goose which loudly announced the approach of the Gauls while the dogs kept silence. The goose, however, cannot be kept everywhere, an opinion which Celsus expresses with much truth when he says: “A goose cannot easily be maintained without plenty of water and plenty of grass and is not profitable in closely planted land because it plucks at anything which it can reach; but wherever there<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> is a river or a lake and an abundance of grass and there are not sown crops too near at hand, this kind of bird also should be reared.” We, furthermore, are in favour of keeping geese not because it brings a large profit but because it gives very little trouble. Yet it produces goslings and feathers; the latter you may gather not merely once a year, like wool from sheep, but you can pluck twice, in spring and in autumn. Indeed for these reasons, if local conditions permit, you should rear at any rate a few geese and assign three female birds to one male; for because of their weight they cannot couple with more. Moreover, so that they may have protection, separate goose pens should be made for each inside
