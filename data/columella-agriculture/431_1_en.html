On the other hand, the middle (island) part<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span> of the pond should be of earth, so that it may be sown with the Egyptian bean<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL407_399_a" id="target_note_LCL407_399_a"><sup>a</sup></a> and other green stuff which lives in or near water and provides shade for the haunts of the waterfowl. Some of them take pleasure in lingering in little plantations of tamarisk and thickets of club-rushes. Nevertheless the whole space should not for this reason be occupied by little plantations, but, as I have said, should be left free all round the circumference, so that, as they are cheered by a day of sunshine, the water fowl may vie with one another to see which swims the fastest. For just as<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span> they require to be where there are holes into which they can creep and where they can lie in wait for fresh-water creatures which are in hiding, so they are displeased if there are no open spaces in which they can roam freely.

The foods grown on dry land which they like best are panic-grass and millet and also barley; but, where there is abundance of them, acorns and grape-husks are also provided. If there is food available which originates in water, they are given shrimps or prawns
