sunk into the ground in an inverted position, it will take root with difficulty and, when it has gained more strength, it will be barren for ever. You will have to smear the tops and lower ends of the slips with a mixture of dung and ashes and plunge them completely underground in such a way that there may be four inches of loose earth above them. But the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span> slips should be provided with two marking-pegs, one on each side; these are of any kind of wood and are placed a little distance away from the slips and are tied together with a band, so that they may not easily be knocked over separately. It is expedient to do this because of the unobservance of the diggers, so that, when you start tilling your nursery with mattocks or hoes, the slips which you have planted may not be injured.</p>

In the following and subsequent years, when the rootlets of the plants have gained strength, they should be cultivated with rakes; but for the first two years it is best to abstain from pruning, and in the third year two little branches should be left on each plant, and the nursery should be frequently hoed. In the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">6</span><span class="br"></span> fourth year the weaker of the two branches should be cut away. Thus cultivated the small trees are fit for transplantation in five years. In dry soil and
