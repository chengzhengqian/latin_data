troughs. On the contrary, in swampy ground they must be placed on the topmost back of the ridge, so that they may not suffer from too much moisture. Then in the first year after they have been thus<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">45</span><span class="br"></span> planted, the asparagus which they have put forth must be broken off; for if you should pull it up from the bottom while the little roots are still tender and weak, the whole “sponge” will come away as well. In the following years it will have to be pulled up by the roots and not picked; for unless this is done, the broken stalks cause pain to the “eyes” of the “sponges” and as it were blind them and do not allow them to produce any asparagus. However, the stalk, which comes up last of all in the autumn season, should not all be removed but some part should be allowed to grow to provide seed. Then when it has<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">46</span><span class="br"></span> formed a spike, after the seeds themselves have been gathered, the haulms, just as they are, should be burnt in their place, and then all the furrows must be hoed and the weeds removed. Directly thereafter either dung or ashes must be thrown on them, so that throughout the winter the moisture percolating through with the rain may reach the roots. Then, in the spring, before the asparagus begins to sprout, the ground should be stirred up with weeding-hoes, which are a two-pronged iron kind of implement, so that the stem may break through more easily and attain to a greater thickness in the loosened soil.</p>
