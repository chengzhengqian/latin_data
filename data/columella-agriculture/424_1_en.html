into a field, and the flock follows the clucking hen as though it were their mother. The latter is shut up in a coop and taken out to the field by the man who feeds them, and when it is let out it is secured by a long line attached to its foot. The chicks flutter round it and, when they have eaten their fill, they are brought back to the farm, following the clucking of their foster-mother, as I have already described. The authorities are pretty well agreed that the other<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">16</span><span class="br"></span> hens which are bringing up chickens of their own kind ought not to be fed in the same place; for when they have seen the little peachicks, they cease to care for their own chickens and abandon them before they reach maturity, evidently hating them because they do not equal the little peachicks either in size or in beauty.</p>
<p>The same diseases as usually harm farmyard fowls attack these birds also, and no remedies are applied to them other than those which are administered to ordinary cocks and hens; for the pip and indigestion and any other plagues which occur are checked by the same remedies as we have prescribed. When they<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">17</span><span class="br"></span> have passed the seventh month, they should be shut up with the others in the peacock-house for their night’s rest; but care will have to be taken that they do not remain on the ground. Those who go to sleep in this position must be picked up and placed on the perches, so that they may not suffer from the cold.</p>
<p>XII. The rearing of guinea-fowls is almost the
<span class="marginNote right">Guinea-fowls and “rustic” cocks.</span> same as that of peacocks. But woodland hens, which are called “rustic”-fowls, do not breed in captivity, and, therefore, we have no instructions to give about them except that they must be given their fill of food, so that they may be better suited for feasts to which guests are invited.</p>
