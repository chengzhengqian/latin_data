attention to mark the mother-hen when she leaps down and to visit the nest-box frequently and with his hand to turn the peahen’s eggs, which on account of their size are more difficult for the farmyard-hen to move; and so that he may carry out this task with greater care, one side of the eggs should be marked with ink and the poultry-man will then have a means of knowing whether the eggs have been turned by the hen. But, as I have said, we must remember that<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">13</span><span class="br"></span> farmyard hens of the greatest possible size are provided for this purpose; and if they are of only moderate build, they ought not to sit upon more than three peahen’s eggs and six of their own kind. When the hen has hatched the chickens, the farmyard chickens will have to be transferred to another nurse, and any young peafowls which are hatched from time to time should be collected round one nurse until a flock of twenty-five head is made up. But when the young<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">14</span><span class="br"></span> peafowls are hatched out, on the first day, like farmyard chickens, they should not be moved, but on the following day they should be transferred to a coop with the hen that is to bring them up, and during the first days they should be fed on barley-meal sprinkled with wine and with gruel made from any kind of cereal and allowed to grow cold. Then after a few days a Tarentine leek cut up small should be added to their diet and soft cheese which has been pressed out with great force, for whey is obviously harmful to chickens. Locusts too, whose feet have been removed,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">15</span><span class="br"></span> are regarded as useful for feeding the peachicks and they ought to eat them until the sixth month; afterwards it is enough to give them barley from the hand. After the thirty-fifth day following their birth they may even be quite safely taken out
