the better the cabbage thrives and the fuller the growth it makes in its stalks and sprouts. Some people set this vegetable in exceptionally sunny spots from March 1st onwards, but the greater part of it runs to sprouts and, when once it has been cut, it does not form thereafter a large winter stalk. But you can transplant even the biggest cabbage-stalks twice, and, if you do so, they are said to produce more seed and greater growth.</p>
<p>Lettuce ought to be transplanted when it has as<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">25</span><span class="br"></span> many leaves as the cabbage. Indeed in sunny districts near the sea it is best set in the autumn, but it is otherwise in inland and cold places, for in winter it cannot be planted out with such good effect.

Generally, however, in a sunny climate where there is plenty of water, lettuce can be sown almost throughout the year; but, so that it may form its stalk more
