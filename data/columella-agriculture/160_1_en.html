and have no experience in the making of quicksets. This kind of planting has been disapproved with good reason by most vinedressers of Italy, because the quickset is superior in very many particulars: for it is less likely to die, since, because of its strength,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span>
it has a readier endurance of heat and cold and other kinds of weather; and, in the next place, it reaches maturity earlier. The result is that it also comes more quickly into condition to bear fruit; and besides, there is no doubt that it is more generally transplanted.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_321_a" id="target_note_LCL361_321_a"><sup>a</sup></a> Still, a cutting may be set immediately in loose and light ground, in place of a quickset; but ground that is compact and heavy certainly requires a rooted vine.</p>
<p>XV. The planting, then, is made preferably in prepared ground that is well cleaned and harrowed and levelled off, leaving five feet between the rows in lean ground, and six feet in medium soil. But in fat soil intervals of seven feet must be allowed, so as to leave greater space of open ground over which the numerous and far-reaching branches of firm wood may spread themselves. This laying-out of vineyards in quincunx arrangement is accomplished by a very quick method: for a line is stitched with purple or some other striking colour at intervals of the same number of feet as you have determined upon for the distance between rows; and when so marked it is stretched along the dug ground, and a reed is thrust in beside each bit of purple. In this way the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span>
rows are equally spaced.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_321_b" id="target_note_LCL361_321_b"><sup>b</sup></a> When this has been done, the digger follows and, leaving spaces by turns along the rows, he digs a trench from one reed to the next, not less than two and one-half feet deep on the level, two and three-fourths feet on sloping
