<p>After the month of December, about the first of January, the olives will have to be stripped from the trees in the manner described above and immediately pressed; for if they have been stored in a loft they quickly grow heated, since, when the winter rains come, they engender more lees, which are a hindrance to the making of oil; you must, therefore, be particularly<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">18</span><span class="br"></span> on your guard against making oil for eating from such olives: this can be avoided in one way only, namely, if the berries are crushed and pressed immediately when they have been brought in from the field, being treated in the manner which I have described above. Most husbandmen have believed that, if the berries are stored under cover, the yield of oil is increased by putting the olives in a loft. This is quite as untrue as to say that grain increases on the threshing-floor. This falsehood the ancient writer Porcius
