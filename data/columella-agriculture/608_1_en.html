much of this preparation ought to be added to forty-eight <span class="italic">sexiarii</span> of must, because the calculation of the right amount must be based on the quality of the wine, and care must be taken that the flavour of the preservative is not noticeable, for that drives away<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">7</span><span class="br"></span> the purchaser. I personally, if the vintage is wet, usually mix a <span class="italic">triens</span> of the preservative in two <span class="italic">amphorae</span>; if it is dry, a <span class="italic">quadrans,</span> so that the quantity of must is four <span class="italic">urnae,</span> an <span class="italic">urna</span> being twenty-four <span class="italic">sextarii.</span>
I am aware that some husbandmen have put a <span class="italic">quadrans</span> of the preservative in each <span class="italic">amphora,</span> but that they were obliged to do so owing to the excessive weakness of the wine, which scarcely kept sound for thirty days. However, if there is plenty of wood,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">8</span><span class="br"></span> it is better to boil the must and clear off all the scum with the dregs; if this is done a tenth part will be lost, but the rest keeps good forever. But if there is a scarcity of wood, it will be necessary to mix an ounce of what is called the “flower” of marble or plaster and also two <span class="italic">sexiarii</span> of must boiled down to a third of its original quantity with each <span class="italic">amphora.</span> This, though it does not make the flavour of the wine last forever, yet at any rate generally preserves it until another vintage.</p>

boiled down to a third of its original volume and when boiled down, as I have said above, is called <span class="italic">defrutum.</span>
When it has cooled down, it is transferred to vessels and put in store that use may be made of it after a year. But it can also be added to wine nine days after it has cooled; but it is better if it has remained undisturbed for a year. A <span class="italic">sextarius</span> of this boiled-down
must is added to two <span class="italic">urnae</span> of must if the latter comes from vineyards in the hills; but if it comes
