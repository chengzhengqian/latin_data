necessity. He should not employ his master’s money<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">24</span><span class="br"></span> in purchasing cattle or anything else which is bought or sold; for doing this diverts him from his duties as a bailiff and makes him a trader rather than a farmer and makes it impossible to balance accounts with his master; but when a reckoning-up in money is being held, goods are displayed instead of cash. He will, therefore, regard it as a practice to be shunned, just as much indeed as zeal for hunting and fowling, by which many employees are distracted from their duties, is to be avoided.</p>
<p>He will have to observe those principles which it is<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">25</span><span class="br"></span> difficult to maintain in larger spheres of government, namely, not to deal either too cruelly or too leniently with those set under him: he should always cherish the good and diligent and spare those who are not as good as they ought to be, and use such moderation that they may rather respect his strictness than hate his cruelty. He will be able to guard against the latter contingency, if he prefers rather to take care that a labourer commits no offence than to punish him later on, when he has done so; for there is no more efficient means of restraining even the most wicked man than by daily exacting from him his task. For the oracular saying of Marcus Cato is full of<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">26</span><span class="br"></span> truth: “By doing nothing men learn to do evil.” The bailiff will, therefore, take care that a full day’s work is rendered, and he will obtain this without difficulty, if he himself always puts in an appearance; for thus the foremen of the different duties will<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">27</span><span class="br"></span> diligently carry out their tasks, and the slaves, being tired after the performance of their work, will turn their attention to food and rest and sleep, rather than to evil doing.</p>
