land, and even three feet in steep places. After the trenches are put down to this depth, the quicksets are set in such a way that they are laid flat, each by itself and in opposite directions from the middle of the trench, and raised upright alongside the reeds at opposite ends of the ditches. But the planter’s<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span>
duty is, first, to transfer the plant from the nursery in as fresh condition as possible, and, if this can be done, at the very moment that he wishes to plant it—removing it carefully and without mutilation; then to prune it all over like an old vine, reducing it to one very strong cane of firm wood and smoothing off the knots and scars; also, if any roots have been injured—and especial care must be taken that this does not happen in removing the vine—to cut them off; and then to set out the plant, bending it in such a way that the roots of two vines may not be intertwined. For this is easy to avoid by placing along the bottom, close to the opposite sides of the trenches, a few stones whose weight should not exceed five pounds each.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_323_a" id="target_note_LCL361_323_a"><sup>a</sup></a> These<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span>
seem, as Mago records, to ward off the winter’s wetness and the summer’s heat from the vine roots. Vergil, agreeing with Mago, teaches the safeguarding and strengthening of young plants in these words:</p>

<p class="noindent">and, a little later,</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">And some are found who cover them with rock<span class="linebreak"></span>
or heavy tile,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Thus offering shelter ’gainst the driving rains,<span class="linebreak"></span>

agape with thirst.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_323_c" id="target_note_LCL361_323_c"><sup>c</sup></a></span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
