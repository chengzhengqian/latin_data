When you have done so, the seed should be covered at once with wooden rakes—a matter of great importance—for
the seed is very soon burned by the sun. After the seed is sown, the place should not be touched with iron; and so, as I have said, it must be hoed with wooden implements and repeatedly freed of weeds, so that no other kind of growth may kill out the weak Medic. It will be best to make the first cutting<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">28</span><span class="br"></span>
rather late, after it has dropped some of its seed. Thereafter, when it has started up, you may cut it as tender as you please and feed it to stock, but somewhat sparingly at first, until they become accustomed to it, so that the novelty of the fodder may not harm them; for it causes bloating and greatly increases the blood supply. After cutting, water it rather frequently; then, a few days later, when it begins to send out new shoots, weed out all other kinds of growth. If cared for in this way, it can be cut six times a year and will last for ten years.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_175_b" id="target_note_LCL361_175_b"><sup>b</sup></a></p>

Both sowings may be made on untilled land, but with better results on broken ground; and this
