<p>The he-goat is quite ready for breeding purposes<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> at the age of seven months; for it is immoderate in its desires and, while it is still being fed at its motherâ€™s udder, it leaps upon her and tries to do her violence. Hence, before it has reached six years of age, it is fast becoming old, because it has worn itself out in early youth by premature indulgence of its desires; and so, when it is only five years old, it is regarded as unfit for impregnating the female. A<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span> she-goat is most highly approved which most closely resembles the he-goat which we have described, if it also has a very large udder and a great abundance of milk. If we live in a calm climate we shall acquire a she-goat without horns; for in a stormy and rainy climate we shall prefer one with horns; but always and in every district the fathers of the herd will have to be hornless, because those which have horns are generally dangerous because of their viciousness. One ought not to keep a larger number than a hundred<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span> head of goats in one enclosure, though one can equally easily keep a thousand sheep in the folds. When one is acquiring she-goats for the first time, it is better to buy a whole herd at once than to purchase them one by one from a number of sources; this prevents them from splitting up into small groups while they are pasturing and makes them settle down quickly and in greater harmony in goat-stalls. The heat is harmful to this creature, but the cold is even more so, especially to pregnant she-goats, for an unusually frosty winter destroys the embryo. But not only the abnormally frosty winter causes abortion; it also occurs if less than a sufficiency of mast is given them; and so the herd should not be allowed to eat mast unless a plentiful supply can be provided.</p>
