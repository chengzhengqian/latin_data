that this bending-back may cause a profusion of firm-wood branches, the strongest of which we may make the head of the vine in the following year. But long experience has taught me that it is much<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">23</span><span class="br"></span> more expedient to apply the pruning-hook to the vines on the first possible opportunity and not allow them to become bushy with superfluous shoots. I also hold that the firm-wood branch which is to be allowed to grow at first, should be cut back with the knife as far as the second or third bud, so that it may put forth more vigorous shoots, which, when they have taken hold of the first “story” of the tree, will be trained in different directions at the next pruning, and furthermore will every year be raised to the story above, one firm-wood branch being always left which, applied to the trunk, will face towards the top of the tree.</p>
<p>Once the vine is set in its place a fixed rule is<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">24</span><span class="br"></span> applied to it by husbandmen. Most of them crowd the lower “stories” with firm-wood branches, their object being a more abundant yield of fruit and easier cultivation. But those whose chief object is high quality in the wine, encourage the vine to mount to the top of the trees, and, as each firm-wood shoot offers itself, they stretch it out to the highest possible branch in such a way that the top of the vine keeps pace with the top of the tree, that is, that the two furthest vine-shoots are applied to the trunk of the tree so that they face its top and, as each branch gathers strength, it takes up the burden of the vine. On the stouter branches more shoots should be placed,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">25</span><span class="br"></span> separate from one another, but fewer on the slenderer branches, and the young vine should be attached to the tree with three bindings, one on the stem of the
