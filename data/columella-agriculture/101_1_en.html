greater advantage to the farmer to do this frequently rather than lavishly. And there is no doubt<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span>
that wet land requires a greater quantity of it, and dry land lessâ€”the one because, being chilled by constant moisture, it is warmed when manure is applied, and the other because, being naturally warm, it is parched by the increased aridity when this is added; for which reason such dressing should be neither deficient nor over-sufficient. If, however, no kind of<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span> manure is available, it will be very helpful to follow the practice which I remember my uncle, Marcus Columella, a very learned and painstaking farmer, frequently employed: that is, to heap clay on gravelly ground, and gravel on ground that was clayey and too stiff, and in this way to grow not only luxuriant crops of grain but also very fine vineyards. For this same authority used to say that dung<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span>
should not be applied to vines, because it spoiled the flavour of the wine; and he thought that a better dressing for making a heavy vintage was humus, either that which accumulates around bramble-thickets, or in fact any earth obtained elsewhere and brought in. But my opinion nowadays is that if the farmer is destitute of everything, at any rate there is no lack of lupine, that very ready aid; and if he will scatter this on lean ground about the middle of September, plough it in, and at the proper time cut it up with the ploughshare or the mattock, it will have the effect of the best manure. The lupine should be<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">6</span><span class="br"></span>
cut, moreover, in gravelly ground when it is in the second flower, and in sticky soils when it is in its third.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_203_a" id="target_note_LCL361_203_a"><sup>a</sup></a> In the former case it is turned under while it is tender,
