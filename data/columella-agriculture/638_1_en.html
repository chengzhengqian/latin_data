<p>Some people do not bruise olives but cut them with a sharp reed; this method is indeed more laborious but it is better, because the olive thus treated is whiter than one which acquires a bluish colour from the bruising. Other people, whether they have bruised or cut their olives, mix them with a little toasted salt and the sprigs mentioned above; they then pour over them must boiled down to half its original volume or raisin-wine, or, if they can get it, beeâ€™s-wax-water: how this is made we have described a little earlier in this present book<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL408_297_a" id="target_note_LCL408_297_a"><sup>a</sup></a>; all the rest of the process is carried out in the same manner.</p>

Then make a stuffing of the foliage of reeds and press the olives down with it, so that they are submerged in the liquid; pour in hard brine a second time, until it reaches the brim of the jar. However, this olive is not<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span> very pleasant by itself but is especially suitable for the preparation of preserves which are served at the more sumptuous repasts; for, when required, it is taken out of the jar and, after being crushed, blends with any other seasoning you like. Most people, however, cut up finely leeks and rue with young parsley and mint and mix them with crushed olives; then they add a little peppered vinegar and a very little honey or mead and sprinkle them with green olive-oil and then cover them with a bunch of green parsley.</p>
