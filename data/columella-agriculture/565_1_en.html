with a rammer or roller, for if you leave the soil loose, the seed usually rots.</p>
<p>The parsnip, skirwort and elecampane thrive in<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">35</span><span class="br"></span> deeply trenched and well-manured soil, but they must be planted far apart so that they may attain to a greater growth. Elecampane should be sown at intervals of three feet, for it grows huge bushes and has creeping roots like the “eyes” of a reed. All these vegetables require no cultivation except that the weeds should be removed by hoeing. It will be most suitable to plant them in the first part of September<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">36</span><span class="br"></span> or the last part of August. Alexanders, which some Greeks call πετροσέλινον (rock-parsley) and others σμυρναῖον,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL408_151_a" id="target_note_LCL408_151_a"><sup>a</sup></a> should be sown in well-trenched soil, preferably near a stone wall, since it delights in shade and thrives in any kind of soil. When once you have sown it, if you do not pull it all up by the roots but leave alternate bushes to go to seed, it goes on for ever and only needs a little cultivation by hoeing. It is sown from the feast of Vulcan<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL408_151_b" id="target_note_LCL408_151_b"><sup>b</sup></a> to September 1st, but also in the month of January. Mint<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL408_151_ca" id="target_note_LCL408_151_ca"><sup>c</sup></a> requires a<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">37</span><span class="br"></span> sweet, marshy soil; for which reason it is right to plant it near a spring in the month of March. If the seeds happen to have proved a failure, you can collect wild mint from fallow ground and then plant it with the top inverted, for this draws the wildness out of it and makes it tame. You should sow rue in the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">38</span><span class="br"></span> autumn and thin it out in March to a sunny place and heap ashes round it and cultivate it until it is strong, that it may not be killed by weeds. It will have to be weeded with the hand covered; for unless you wrap it up, pernicious ulcers form.
