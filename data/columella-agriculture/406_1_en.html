it into the nest-boxes, making the nest hollow so that the eggs may not roll out and fall when the hens fly in or leap down. Very many people also lay a little<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">12</span><span class="br"></span> grass under the litter in the nest-boxes and small branches of bay and also fasten underneath heads of garlic with iron nails, all of which things are regarded as preservatives against thunder by which the eggs are spoilt and the half-formed chickens killed before they can reach complete perfection in all their parts. The man who places the eggs is careful not to place<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">13</span><span class="br"></span> them one by one in the nest-box by hand, but should collect the complete number in a wooden basin and gently pour the whole clutch into the nest ready prepared. Food must be placed near the hens when<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">14</span><span class="br"></span> they are sitting, so that, being well satisfied, they may be more eager to remain on their nests and may not wander too far away and let the eggs grow cold.
