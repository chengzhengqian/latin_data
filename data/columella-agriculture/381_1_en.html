A litter ought not to number more than eight, not that I am ignorant that the fecundity of breeding-sows can produce more than this number, but because a sow which rears more than eight quickly becomes worn out. Those sows which are given a litter to rear, must be sustained with cooked barley, so that they may not be reduced to a state of extreme emaciation and from that to some fatal sickness.
