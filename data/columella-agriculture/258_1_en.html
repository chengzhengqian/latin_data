from injury by cattle. If possible, the tree should be cut through with a single blow; if not, it will have to be sawn through and the wound smoothed off with a pruning-hook and covered with mud mixed with straw, so that it may not be damaged by the sun or the rain. After a year or two, when the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">14</span><span class="br"></span> little branches which have come forth have duly gained strength, it will be fitting that those which are superfluous should be pruned away and those which are suitable should be allowed to grow freely and take their place in the row. If an elm has made good progress since it was planted, its topmost rods should be freed from knots with a pruning-hook; but if the small branches are vigorous, they should be cut off with a knife in such a way that you leave a little stump projecting from the trunk. Then when the tree has gained strength, whatever can be reached with a pruning-hook should be cut away and smoothed off, without, however, any wound being inflicted on the body of the mother-tree.

In stripping the tree care must be taken that the knobs which are left where the rods have been cut away do not project too much, and that
