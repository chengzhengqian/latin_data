<p class="noindent">When, therefore, the plant has been put into the ground, whether it be a mallet-shoot or a quick-set, it is proper to adjust it in such a way that the vine may stand up without any prop. This, however,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">8</span><span class="br"></span> cannot be achieved immediately. For unless you have provided the vine with a support when it is tender and weak, the young shoots will creep along and keep close to the ground. So, when the plant is set in the earth, a reed is attached to it, so that it may, as it were, watch over its infancy and train it and raise it to such stature as the husbandman allows it to reach. This, moreover, ought not to be high, for it must be checked when it reaches a foot and a half. Afterwards, when it gains strength and can already<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">9</span><span class="br"></span> stand without any help, it comes to maturity by the growth of its head or its branches. For here too there are two methods of cultivation, some people preferring vines which grow to a head, others those which grow out in arms. Those who delight in shaping a vine into arms should preserve whatever it puts forth near the scar where the young vine has had its top removed, and divide it into four arms a foot long in such a way that each of them looks towards a different region of the sky.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL407_35_b" id="target_note_LCL407_35_b"><sup>b</sup></a> But these arms<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">10</span><span class="br"></span> are not allowed to reach this height immediately in the first year, lest the vine be too heavily laden while it is still weak, but they must only reach the length which I have indicated after numerous prunings. Next there must be left projecting from these arms
