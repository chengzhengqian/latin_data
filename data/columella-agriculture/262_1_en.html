tree four feet from the ground, a second holding the vine at its top, and a third clasping it in the middle. A binding should not be placed at the bottom, since it takes away the strength of the vine; however, it is sometimes considered necessary when the tree has had its branches lopped off or when the vine, growing too strong, runs riot.</p>
<p>The other points to be observed in pruning are that<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">26</span><span class="br"></span> the old shoots, upon which the fruit of the previous year has hung, should be all cut away, but the new ones should be allowed to grow after their tendrils have been cut back all round and the side-shoots which have grown from them have been lopped off—if the vine is in a flourishing state, the furthest shoots should be let down<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL407_61_a" id="target_note_LCL407_61_a"><sup>a</sup></a> through the top of the branches, if the vine is slender, the shoots nearest to the stock, and if it is of middling size, those in the middle. For the furthest shoot produces the most fruit, the nearest the least and exhausts and enfeebles the vine.</p>
<p>It is of great benefit to vines to unbind them every<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">27</span><span class="br"></span> year; for they can then be more conveniently freed from knots and they are refreshed by being bound in another place and they are less damaged and recover strength better. Also it is expedient that the shoots themselves should be so placed upon the “stories” of the tree that they hang down, being attached at the third or fourth bud, and that they should not be bound too tightly, lest the vine-twig be cut by the osier. But if the “story” is so far away that the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">28</span><span class="br"></span> firm-wood branch cannot conveniently be made to reach it, we shall bind the shoot itself to the vine, attaching it above the third bud. We give instructions that this should be done because it is the part of the shoot that is bent over which is clothed with
