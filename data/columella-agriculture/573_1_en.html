August. A <span class="italic">iugerum</span> of land requires four <span class="italic">sextarii</span> of their seed, provided that it receives in addition to this amount a little more than a <span class="italic">hemina</span> of Syrian radish-seed.
He who sows this seed in the summer must<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">60</span><span class="br"></span> beware lest, as a result of drought, the ground-flea<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL408_167_a" id="target_note_LCL408_167_a"><sup>a</sup></a> does not devour the still tender leaves as they creep forth. To prevent this, the powder which is found above an arched roof or even the soot which adheres to the ceiling above the hearth should be collected; then, the day before the sowing takes place, it should be mixed with the seeds and sprinkled with water, so that they may have a whole night to absorb the juice; for if they are soaked in this way they will be in good condition for sowing the next day. Some<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">61</span><span class="br"></span> ancient authorities, Democritus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL408_167_b" id="target_note_LCL408_167_b"><sup>b</sup></a> for example, advise that all seeds should be doctored with the juice of the herb which is called house-leek<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL408_167_c" id="target_note_LCL408_167_c"><sup>c</sup></a> and that the same remedy should be used against small vermin, and experience has taught us that this is true. For all that, since there is not a large quantity of this plant available, we more frequently use soot and the above-mentioned
powder and thus satisfactorily ensure that the plants are not damaged. Hyginus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL408_167_d" id="target_note_LCL408_167_d"><sup>d</sup></a> is of<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">62</span><span class="br"></span> opinion that, after threshing, turnip-seeds ought to be scattered on the chaff that is still lying on the threshing-floor, since they make the heads grow more luxuriantly, because the hardness of the soil underneath does not allow the roots to penetrate deep into the earth. We have often tried this experiment without success, and so hold to the opinion that
