finally pruning can be carried out when the day is already getting warm.</p>
<p>In places that are exposed to the sun and are poor and arid the meadows must now be cleaned up and protected against cattle, so that there may be an abundant crop of hay. It is time also to break up<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">8</span><span class="br"></span> dry and rich lands; for lands which are marshy and of medium quality should be turned up towards summer, while very lean and dry soil should be ploughed up after the summer at the beginning of autumn and then sown. But a <span class="italic">iugerum</span> of rich land is conveniently broken up at this season of the year by two labourers, because the soil, being still wet from the winter rains, admits of easy cultivation. In the same month,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">9</span><span class="br"></span> before February 1st, the autumn-sown corn-lands must be hoed, whether they be sown with naked wheat, which some people call Italian wheat, or with emmer wheat; and the proper time for hoeing them is when the corn has sprung up and begins to consist of four blades. Those who have labour to spare ought now to hoe the early barley also. The bean<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">10</span><span class="br"></span> also requires the same treatment, if its stalk has already grown to the height of four inches; for it should not be hoed earlier when it is too tender.

Scions which are bearing their first blossom, should be immediately grafted about the 13th of the month, such as those of cherry-trees, tuber-apple-trees,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL408_75_a" id="target_note_LCL408_75_a"><sup>a</sup></a> almond-trees and peach-trees.
