<p>The bees, therefore, which behave like this ought<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span> especially to be kept under observation, so that, whether they sally forth to battle (for they wage a kind of civil war amongst themselves and as it were foreign wars with other swarms) or break out in order to escape, the keeper may be at hand, ready for either event. Fighting either of the bees of one swarm<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">6</span><span class="br"></span> quarrelling amongst themselves or of two swarms at variance with one another is easily quelled; for, as the same poet says,</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">By casting of a little dust the strife</span><span class="linebreak"></span> <span class="line">Is stayed and laid to rest,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL407_463_a" id="target_note_LCL407_463_a"><sup>a</sup></a></span><span class="linebreak"></span>

<p class="noindent">or else by sprinkling over them honey-water or raisin-wine or some similar liquid, that is to say the sweet taste of things familiar to them, abates their wrath. The same expedients too are wonderfully efficacious for reconciling king-bees when they are at enmity; for there are often several leaders of one people, and the common herd is as it were divided into factions by the quarrels of its chiefs. This must be prevented from happening often, since whole nations are destroyed by civil war. And so, if good<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">7</span><span class="br"></span> feeling exists between the princes, peace continues and no blood is shed. If, however, you have often noticed them fighting a pitched battle, you will take care to put to death the leaders of the factions; but when they are actually fighting, their battles can be calmed by the above-mentioned remedies. Next, when a host of bees has settled in a mass on the neighbouring branch of a leafy shrub, you should take notice whether the whole swarm hangs down in the form of a single bunch of grapes. This will be a sign either that there is only one king-bee in it
