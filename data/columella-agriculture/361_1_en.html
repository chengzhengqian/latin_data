their dams, deprived of their own lambs, are given the offspring of others to suckle; for each single lamb is put under two nurses and it is inexpedient that it should be deprived of any of their milk, that so. receiving a more satisfying quantity of milk, it may quickly grow strong, and that the ewe which has borne a lamb, having a nurse to share her duties, may have less difficulty in bringing her offspring up. Therefore you must be very careful to see that the lambs are daily put to the udders of their own mothers and also of strange ewes who have no maternal affection for them.<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span> But in flocks of this kind more males must be brought up than in those of coarse-wooll√≠ sheep; for the males are castrated before they can be mated, when they have completed two years, and are killed, and their skins sold to dealers at a much higher price than other fleeces because of the beauty of their wool. We shall remember to feed a Greek sheep on open fields free from all shoots and brambles, lest, as I have already said, its wool and its covering be torn away. Nor, because it does not go out to pasture every day,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span> does it require less but more diligent care at home than out of doors; for it must frequently be uncovered and allowed to cool and its wool pulled apart and soaked with wine and oil. Sometimes too the whole animal must be washed, if sunny weather allows it, but it is enough to do this three times a year. The fold must be frequently swept and cleansed and all moisture due to urine must be brushed away, the best method of keeping it dry being the use of boards with holes in them with which the sheep-folds are paved, so that the flock may lie down on them. The shelters must be free<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">6</span><span class="br"></span>
