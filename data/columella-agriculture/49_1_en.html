honesty than in the others, for the reason that the vine-dresser should do his work in company with others and under supervision, and because the unruly are for the most part possessed of quicker understanding, which is what the nature of this work requires. For it demands of the helper that he be not merely strong but also quick-witted; and on this account vineyards are commonly tended by slaves in fetters. Still there is nothing that an honest man of equal<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span> quickness will not do better than a rogue.</p>
<p>I have inserted this that no one may think me obsessed of such a notion as to wish to till my land with criminals rather than with honest men. But this too I believe: that the duties of the slaves should not be confused to the point where all take a hand in every task. For this is by no means to<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">6</span><span class="br"></span> the advantage of the husbandman, either because no one regards any particular task as his own or because, when he does make an effort, he is performing a service that is not his own but common to all, and therefore shirks his work to a great extent; and yet the fault cannot be fastened upon any one man because many have a hand in it. For this reason ploughmen must be distinguished from vine-dressers, and vine-dressers from ploughmen, and both of these from men of all work. Furthermore, squads should be formed, not to exceed<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">7</span><span class="br"></span> ten men each, which the ancients called <span class="italic">decuriae</span> and approved of highly, because that limited number was most conveniently guarded while at work, and the size was not disconcerting to the person in charge as he led the way. Therefore, if the field is of considerable<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">8</span><span class="br"></span> extent, such squads should be distributed over sections of it and the work should be so apportioned
