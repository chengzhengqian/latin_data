a good plan to heat up lye prepared beforehand, made with cinders of brushwood in a brazen cauldron or a large new earthenware pot, and when it boils to add a little of the best possible oil and mix it in. Then two or three clusters of grapes according to their size should be tied together and plunged into the boiling cauldron and left there for a short time until they are dis-coloured, but you must not, on the other hand, give them time to be thoroughly boiled; for you must use a certain restraint and moderation.

But if it appears that there is not enough oil in the cauldron, let the necessary quantity be added in small amounts, so that the raisins may be richer and brighter in colour.</p>
