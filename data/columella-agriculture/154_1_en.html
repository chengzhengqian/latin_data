All of this, in my<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span>
opinion, is of greater advantage when climatic conditions also are favourable: and in this matter there is long-standing disagreement as to what quarter of the heavens the vineyards should face, Saserna favouring the east especially, and next to that the south, and then the west; Tremelius Scrofa thinking a southern exposure superior to all others, Vergil explicitly rejecting the west in the words,</p>

If, however, your tracts are subject to the aforementioned winds, it will be better to entrust them to the north or the west wind; but in hot provinces, such as Egypt and Numidia, they will be exposed more properly to the north alone. And now that all these matters have been carefully examined, we shall take up at last the trenching of the ground.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_309_b" id="target_note_LCL361_309_b"><sup>b</sup></a></p>
