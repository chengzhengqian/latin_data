to be the most suitable for this purpose, a tree which closely resembles the cornel-tree. Indeed the cornel-tree, the horn-beam and sometimes the mountain-ash and the willow are planted by most people to this very end; but willows should not be planted except in watery places, where other trees take root with difficulty, because it spoils the flavour of the wine. The elm also can be adapted to this purpose<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL407_69_a" id="target_note_LCL407_69_a"><sup>a</sup></a> by having its top cut off while it is still young, so that it does not exceed the height of fifteen feet; for I have noticed that the plantation of dwarf trees is usually so ordered that the “stories”<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> are arranged at the height of eight feet in dry, sloping places, and twelve feet on flat, marshy ground. But usually this tree is divided up into three branches, upon each of which several arms are allowed to grow on both sides; then almost all the rods are pared off at the time when the vines are pruned, so that they may not cause a shade.</p>
<p>If no cereal is sown amongst the dwarf trees, spaces<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> of twenty feet are left on either side; but if one indulges in crops, forty feet are left on one side and twenty on the other. In all other respects operations are carried out on the same principle as in an Italian plantation, namely, that the vines are planted in long holes, that they may be looked after with the same care, and trained along the boughs of the trees, and the young cross-branches joined together every year from the nearest trees and the old ones cut off. If one cross-branch does not reach to another, it<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span> should be connected by a rod running between them. When later the fruit bows the vine down with its weight, it should be supported by props put underneath it. This kind of plantation, just like all
