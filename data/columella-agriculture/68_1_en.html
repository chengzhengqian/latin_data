On level ground piles of manure, about five <span class="italic">modii</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_137_a" id="target_note_LCL361_137_a"><sup>a</sup></a> to the pile, should be placed farther apart, and on hilly land closer together: on the level it will suffice to leave an interval of eight feet each way, on a slope two feet less. My own preference is that this be done when the moon is waning, for this frees the crops from weeds.

The seeds of first importance and most useful to mankind are grains of wheat and emmer.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_137_c" id="target_note_LCL361_137_c"><sup>c</sup></a> We know of several varieties of wheat; but of this number that called <span class="italic">robus</span> or “ruddy” is most suitable for sowing, because it is superior in both weight and brightness.
