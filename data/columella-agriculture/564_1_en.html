to serve as a sort of base, so that heads of a larger growth may be formed. But the cultivation of<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">32</span><span class="br"></span> headed leeks consists in hoeing and manuring them continually; nor does treatment of cut leek differ from this, except that every time it is cut it ought to be watered, manured and hoed. Its seed is sown in January in warm districts, in February in cold places; in order that it may have greater growth several seeds are tied up in a piece of linen of loose texture and then planted. When it has come up in places where it cannot be supplied with water, it ought to be spaced out about the autumn equinox, but when you can provide moisture, it is correct to move it in the month of May.</p>
<p>You can raise parsley equally well from plants or<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">33</span><span class="br"></span> from seed; it takes a special delight in water and for that reason is most advantageously placed near a spring. But if anyone wishes to grow parsley with a broad leaf, he should tie up as much seed as three of his fingers can hold in a piece of linen of loose texture and plant it out in a regular arrangement in small beds. If he prefers that it should grow with curly leaves, he should put the seed into a mortar and pound it with a pestle of willow-wood and smooth it out and tie it up in the same manner as before in a piece of linen and cover it with ground. It can also<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">34</span><span class="br"></span>
be made to grow with curly leaves without all this trouble, in whatever manner it is sown, if, when it has come up, you check its growth by passing a roller over it. The best time for sowing it is from May 15th to the solstice, for it needs warmth. It is generally at this season that basil also is sown; the seed after being put into the ground is carefully pressed down
