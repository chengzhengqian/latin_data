It was a species of the asafoetida-producing group, similar in appearance to <span class="italic">Narthex asa foetida</span> and closely related to <span class="italic">Scorodosma foetida.</span> The laser from Cyrene referred to in <span class="italic">De Arboribus</span> 23.1. was silphium juice, but the Syrian laser suggested as a substitute for silphium (xn. lix. 5) was asa foetida, used as a substitute when the Cyrenian variety had become extinct (Pliny, <span class="italic">N.H.</span> XIX. 38 ff. XXII. 100 ff.).</p>
