<p>LII. The beginning of the month of December
<span class="marginNote right">How to make olive-oil.</span> generally falls in the middle of the olive-harvest, for, earlier than this, the oil that is made, the so-called “summer” oil, is bitter, and this month is about the time when the green oil is pressed and then afterwards the ripe oil. But, because the yield is small, it is not to the interest of the master of the household to make bitter oil, unless the berries have fallen to the ground owing to storms and it is necessary to gather them up, so that they may not be consumed by domestic or wild animals. But it is<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> most expedient that the master should make some of the green kind, because the yield of it is satisfactory and it almost doubles his profit by the price which it fetches; but if the olive-groves are extensive, it is essential that some part of them should be reserved for the ripe fruit.</p>
<p>The place in which the oil should be made has been described in an earlier volume;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL408_309_a" id="target_note_LCL408_309_a"><sup>a</sup></a> there are, however, a few points connected with this subject which I had omitted before and must mention now. A loft to<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> which the olives may be carried is necessary, though we have already given instructions that each day’s picking should be immediately placed under millstones and the press. However, since the large quantity of berries sometimes defeats the efforts of the men who work the presses, there ought to be a storeroom supported on arches, to which the fruit may be conveyed. This loft ought to be like a granary and contain as many bins as the quantity of olives will require, so that each day’s picking may be kept apart
