<p>It is correct to plant the pomegranate in the spring<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">15</span><span class="br"></span> up to April 1st. But if it bears fruit which is bitter and not sweet, this will be remedied by the following method: moisten the roots with sow-dung and human ordure and stale urine. This will both render the tree fertile and during the first years cause the fruit to have a vinous taste; after five years it makes it sweet and its kernels soft.
