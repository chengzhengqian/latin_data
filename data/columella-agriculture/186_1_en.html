coming of cold weather, the vine must be ablaqueated.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_373_a" id="target_note_LCL361_373_a"><sup>a</sup></a> This operation lays bare the summer rootlets, and the wise husbandman cuts these off with a knife. For if he allows them to grow strong, the lower roots waste away; and the result is that the vine puts out its roots at the very surface of the earth, to be injured by the cold and burned to a greater degree by the heat, and to force a violent thirst upon the mother vine at the rising of the Dog Star.

this reason, when you ablaqueate the vine, anything that has sprouted out of it within a foot and a half must be cut off. But the method of this root-pruning is not the same as that proposed for the upper part of the vine. For the wound is not to be smoothed off, and by no means is the knife to be applied to the mother herself; because, if you cut away a root close to the stock, either more roots will spring from the scar, or the rains of winter which stand in hollows in the loosened soil will gall the fresh wounds by freezing in midwinter and will penetrate to the very pith.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_373_b" id="target_note_LCL361_373_b"><sup>b</sup></a> That this may not happen, it will be proper to keep a distance of about one fingerâ€™s breadth from the stock itself, and so to trim off the small roots; when they are removed in this manner, they sprout out no more and protect the stem from further injury.
