<p>The above plantings are to be made, in our opinion, for the sake of man, and then come several kinds of cattle fodder, such as Medic clover,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_173_aa" id="target_note_LCL361_173_aa"><sup>a</sup></a> vetch, mixed fodder of barley and oats, fenugreek, and also bitter vetch and chick-pea; for we do not think it worth while to enumerate the rest, and still less to sow them, excepting only the cytisus [shrub-clover] of which we shall speak in those books<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_173_b" id="target_note_LCL361_173_b"><sup>b</sup></a> which we have in writing on the various kinds of young shoots.
