that is either well watered or abounding in marshland is best for nourishing the willow, and yet level and rich ground is not unsuitable. And this ground should be turned with the double spade; for the ancients direct us to trench ground intended for a willow-bed to a depth of two and one-half feet. And it makes no difference what kind of osier you plant, if only it is very pliant. Still they think that there<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span>
are chiefly three kinds of willows:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_451_b" id="target_note_LCL361_451_b"><sup>b</sup></a> the Greek, the Gallic, and the Sabine, which most people call the Amerine. The Greek is of a yellow colour; the Gallic of a dingy purple, and with very slender switches; and the Amerine has a slim and reddish rod. And either top-shoots or truncheons of these are planted. Top rods of moderate stoutness, which, however, should not exceed the thickness of a circular two-pound weight,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_451_c" id="target_note_LCL361_451_c"><sup>c</sup></a> are best planted if they are put down as far as solid ground.

one-half feet are stuck into the earth and covered over with a little of it. A well-watered spot requires wider spaces, and spaces of six feet in the quincunx arrangement do very well; a place that is normally dry needs closer planting, but in such a way as to give easy access to those who cultivate it. In this case it is satisfactory that the distance between rows be five feet, yet so that the plants may stand at two-foot intervals in the line of planting, alternating with empty spaces between. The time for planting them is before they<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">6</span><span class="br"></span>
