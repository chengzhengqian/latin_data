bottom to the uppermost part. The pond is either hewn in the rock, which only rarely occurs, or built of plaster on the shore; but in whatever way it is<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> constructed, if it is kept cold by the swirl of water which is constantly flowing in, it ought to contain recesses near the bottom, some of them simple and straight to which the “scaly flocks”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL407_409_a" id="target_note_LCL407_409_a"><sup>a</sup></a> may retire, others twisted into a spiral and not too wide, in which the murries may lurk. Some people, however, hold that murries should not be mixed with fishes of another kind, because, if they are seized with madness, which sometimes happens to this sort of fish just as it happens to dogs, they very often pursue their scaly companions and chew them up and devour great numbers of them. If the nature of the ground<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> permits, channels should be provided for the water on every side of the fish-pond; for the old water is more easily carried away if there is an outlet on the side opposite to that from which the wave forces its way in. We are of opinion that these passages, if the lie of the ground is suitable, should be made along the lowest part of the enclosure, so that a plummet placed on the bottom of the pond may show that the level of the sea is seven feet higher; for this measurement in the depth of the water is fully enough for the fish in the pond, and there is no doubt that, the greater the depth of the sea from which the water comes, the colder it is, and this suits the swimming fishes very well. But if the place<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span> where we think of constructing the fish-pond is on a level with the surface of the sea, the pond should be excavated to the depth of nine feet, and two feet below the top streams of water should be conducted along small channels, and care must be taken that
