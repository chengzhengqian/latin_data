then when it has swollen up as a result of the blows, it is opened with a lancet, and on the following day blood is again drawn from the same spot and the animal is given two days’ rest from work. Then on the third day a light task is enjoined upon it, which is gradually increased until it does a full day’s work. If, however,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span> the neck does not incline to either side but is swollen in the middle, blood is let from both ears. If bleeding is not performed within three days after the ox has got the disease, the neck swells up and the sinews become taut and as a result a hard lump is formed which cannot endure the pressure of the yoke. For this kind of malady we have discovered<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span> a suitable remedy composed of liquid pitch, beef-marrow,
goat’s fat, and stale oil in equal quantities and cooked together. This compound should be used in the following manner: when the ox is unharnessed after its work, the swelling on its neck is moistened with water in the trough from which it drinks and then massaged and rubbed and smeared with the medicament described above. If the animal<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">6</span><span class="br"></span> absolutely refuses the yoke because of the swelling on its neck, it must be given a few days’ rest from work; then the neck must be rubbed with cold water and anointed with litharge of silver. Celsus indeed recommends that to a swollen neck the herb called groundsel should, as I have already said, be crushed and applied. The warts which generally infest the neck constitute only a minor malady; for they can easily be cured with oil dripped on them from a burning lamp. A better plan, however, is to take care that<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">7</span><span class="br"></span> they do not form and that the necks of the oxen do not become bald, for they only become hairless when the neck is moistened by sweat or rain during work.
