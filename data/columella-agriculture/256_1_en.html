sprinkled from time to time rather than soaked, and when the plantshave growth three feet high, they should be transferred to another nursery-bed, and that they may not strike their roots too deep (for this afterwards involves much labour in lifting them when we are going to transfer them to another nursery-bed), we shall have to dig not very large plant-holes a foot and a half apart. Next the roots, if they are short, will have to be bent as it were into a knot, or, if they are too long, into a circle resembling a crown and, after being smeared with ox-dung, they must be lowered into small plant-holes and carefully trodden down all round. The plants, too, which are<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">9</span><span class="br"></span> gathered on their stocks<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL407_49_a" id="target_note_LCL407_49_a"><sup>a</sup></a> can be set out in the same manner, and this is essential in the case of the Atinian elm which is not raised from seed. It is better to set this kind of elm in the autumn rather than in the spring, and its small branches are twisted little by little by hand, since in its first two years it dreads the blow of an iron implement. Finally, in its third year it is scraped with a sharp pruning-hook,
and when it is fit for transplantation (that is, from the season of autumn, when the ground has been thoroughly soaked with rain, until the spring, before the root of the elm is likely to lose its bark while being removed from the soil), then is the proper time for planting it. Next plant-holes measuring three<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">10</span><span class="br"></span> feet each way must be made if the soil is loose, but, if it is dense, furrows of the same depth and width must be prepared to receive the trees. But also in a soil which is exposed to dew and mist the elms must be planted in such a way that their branches may be directed towards the east and west, in order that the middle of the trees, to which the
