Afterwards, on the fortieth day, they pour out all the liquid and mix three parts of must boiled down to a third or a half of its original volume with one part of vinegar and fill up the jar again.

must mixed with one part of vinegar. The royal and the orchite olive could also be treated by this method of preserving.</p>
