accessible and unfavourably situated with reference to the sun and the sun-warmed breezes; and if it is cut off from these, no other force can dry up or clear away the night frosts and any mould or dirt that has settled there.

<p>But one who desires to erect a building on a<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">9</span><span class="br"></span> sloping site should always begin operations at the lower side; for when the foundations start from the less elevated point, they will not only easily support their own superstructure but will also serve as a buttress and underpinning for any additions which may later be made to the upper side, if it should prove desirable to enlarge the villa—for of course the previous structure below will offer strong support for any that may be built above and rest on it afterwards.
