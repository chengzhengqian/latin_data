manure to the <span class="italic">iugerum</span> and spread it; and just as before, when we have scattered the seed on the unbroken ground, we shall plough it in, form ridges, and harrow, though there are some who say that beans should not be harrowed in cold regions because the projecting clods shelter them from the frosts while they are still young and provide some warmth when they are suffering from the cold. There are<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">7</span><span class="br"></span>
people, too, who think that in cultivated land this same plant takes the place of manure<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_161_a" id="target_note_LCL361_161_a"><sup>a</sup></a>—a belief which I take as meaning, not that the ground is enriched by the sowing of it, but that it uses up the strength of the soil less than other crops. For I am convinced that land which has borne no crop is better suited for grain than one which bore a crop of this legume the preceding year. A <span class="italic">iugerum</span> of land<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">8</span><span class="br"></span>
requires four <span class="italic">modii</span> of beans, as Tremelius thinks, but six, in my opinion, if the ground is rich, and somewhat more if it is just ordinary; and it does not tolerate lean ground or a foggy situation, though it often does well on heavy soil. It should be sown, part at the middle of seed-time, and part at the end—the sowing called “septimontial.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_161_ba" id="target_note_LCL361_161_ba"><sup>b</sup></a> The early sowing is more common, though the late one is sometimes better. There is little use in sowing it after the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">9</span><span class="br"></span>
winter solstice, and the very worst time is spring; although there is also a three-months bean which may be sown in February, using one-fifth more than for the early variety, but which yields scanty straw
