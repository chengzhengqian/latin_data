ornately than by Vergil, or more elegantly than by Celsus.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL407_429_a" id="target_note_LCL407_429_a"><sup>a</sup></a> Hyginus has industriously collected the opinions of ancient authors dispersed in their different writings; Vergil has embellished the subject with the flowers of poetry; and Celsus has applied the method of both the above-mentioned authors.<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> Therefore, we ought never to have even attempted to discourse on this subject, did not the fulfilment of the promise which we made call for the treatment of this part of our subject also, lest the body of the work begun, looked at as a whole, should appear mutilated and imperfect, as if a limb had been cut off. The tradition of the fabulous origin of the bees which Hyginus has not passed over I would rather attribute to poetic licence than submit to the test of our belief; nor indeed is it a fit question for a husbandman to<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> ask whether there ever existed a woman of surpassing beauty called Melissa, whom Jupiter changed into a bee, or whether (as Euhemerus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL407_429_b" id="target_note_LCL407_429_b"><sup>b</sup></a> the poet says) the bees were bred from hornets and the sun, and that the nymphs, the daughters of Phryxon,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL407_429_c" id="target_note_LCL407_429_c"><sup>c</sup></a> reared them, and that soon after they became the nurses of Jupiter in the Dictaean Cave<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL407_429_d" id="target_note_LCL407_429_d"><sup>d</sup></a> and that, by the gift of the god, they had allotted to them the food with which they themselves had reared their little foster-child. Upon this story, though not unworthy of a poet, Vergil touched briefly and lightly in a single line when he said:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">‘Neath Dicte’s cave they fed the king of heaven.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL407_429_e" id="target_note_LCL407_429_e"><sup>e</sup></a></span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
