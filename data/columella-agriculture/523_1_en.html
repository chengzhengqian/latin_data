<p>Furthermore, in everything which concerns the bailiff’s profession, as in life generally, it is of the greatest value that every one should realize that he does not know that of which he is ignorant and that he should always desire to learn it. For, although know-ledge<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">28</span><span class="br"></span> is a great advantage, ignorance or carelessness does more harm than knowledge does good, especially in agriculture, of which art the chief point is to have done, once and for all, whatever the method of cultivation shall have required; for, though ignorance and carelessness, which have caused something to be done amiss, can sometimes be remedied, yet the master’s property has already been impaired and cannot afterwards yield a great enough increase to make up for the loss of capital and restore the lost profit.
