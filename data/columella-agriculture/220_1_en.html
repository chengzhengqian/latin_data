importance that the twig which is ingrafted be not long; and also that there be many eyes on it, from which it may put forth shoots. And so, if the joints are long, it will be necessary to shorten the scion to one or at most two eyes, lest we make it so long that it cannot endure the storms and winds and rains without being disturbed.</p>
<p>Now when a vine is grafted it is either cut off or left<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">7</span><span class="br"></span>
whole and bored through with an auger;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_441_a" id="target_note_LCL361_441_a"><sup>a</sup></a> but the former is the more usual graft and is known to almost all farmers, while the latter is less common and is employed by few. Therefore I shall discuss first the method which is more in use. The vine is generally<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">8</span><span class="br"></span>
cut above ground, though sometimes below, in the place where it is most solid and free from knots. When it is grafted close to the ground, the graft is covered with earth to its very top; but when the graft is higher above ground, the cleft is carefully daubed with kneaded clay and bound with an overlaying of moss to ward off heat and rains. The scion is so shaped as to be not unlike a reed pen. The piece that is pared off you should hold against the cleft;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_441_b" id="target_note_LCL361_441_b"><sup>b</sup></a> and under this cleft there is need of a node in the vine, to bind it together, as it were, and not allow the crack to advance beyond that point. Even<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">9</span><span class="br"></span>
if this node is four finger-breadths distant from the point of cutting, still it will be proper that it be bound before the vine is split, lest the wound spread wider
