remaining boiled water and turn it over and over until it becomes bright-red in colour; then, after straining it, we shall allow it to stand in the sun for fourteen days, so that any moisture which has remained from the water may be dried up. At night, however, the vessel must be covered so that the dew may not fall upon it. When we have prepared the pitch in this manner and wish to preserve wines when they have finished fermenting for the second time, we shall add two <span class="italic">cyathi</span> of the above-mentioned pitch to forty-eight <span class="italic">sextarii</span> of must in the following manner: we shall have to take two sextarii of must from the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> quantity which we are about to preserve, and then gradually pour must from these two <span class="italic">sextarii</span> into a <span class="italic">sextarius</span> of pitch and turn it over and over with the hand, as one does honey-water, to make it amalgamate more easily, and when the whole of the two <span class="italic">sextarii</span> have amalgamated with the pitch and formed, as it were, a single substance, it will then be proper to pour them into the vessel from which we had taken them and to stir them with a wooden ladle so that the preservative may be thoroughly mixed in.</p>

Rain-water<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> is most suitable for this process, or, failing that, water flowing from a very clear spring. Therefore you will take care to place as much as possible of one or other of these in the best vessels available five years beforehand in the sun; then, when it has putrefied, you must leave it alone till it has returned to its former
