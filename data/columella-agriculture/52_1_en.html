<p>I. You ask me, Publius Silvinus, and I have no hesitation in informing you at once, why in the preceding book I immediately at the start<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_105_a" id="target_note_LCL361_105_a"><sup>a</sup></a> rejected the long-standing opinion of almost all who have discoursed on the subject of agriculture, and repudiated as mistaken the views of those who hold that the soil, wearied and exhausted by age-long wasting away and by cultivation now extending over a long period of time, has become barren. And I am not unaware<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> that you hold in reverence, not only the authority of other renowned writers, but particularly that of Tremelius, who, in handing down to posterity a very great number of agricultural precepts set forth with refinement as well as learning, being obviously misled through too great deference to the ancients who treat of a like subject, held the mistaken belief that the earth, the mother of all things, like womankind now worn out with old age, is incapable of bearing offspring. This fact I too should admit if no fruits whatever were being produced; for the old age of<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> a human being also is pronounced barren, not when a woman no longer gives birth to triplets and twins, but only when she is able to conceive and bring forth no offspring at all. Thus, after the period of youth is past, even though a long life still remains, still parturition is denied to years and is not restored.
