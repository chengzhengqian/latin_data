harrowing, four of hoeing and two at the second hoeing, and two days of harvesting—a total of fifteen days. Hemp is sown as we have directed above, but<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">6</span><span class="br"></span>
the amount of expense and attention required is not fixed. Medic, however, is put in the ground, not with the plough, but, as I have said, with small wooden rakes. One <span class="italic">iugerum</span> of this is harrowed by two men, hoed by one, and harvested by one.</p>
<p>From this summing up of the days of labour required<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">7</span><span class="br"></span>
it is concluded that two hundred <span class="italic">iugera</span> of land can be worked with two yoke of oxen, the same number of ploughmen, and six common labourers, provided it be free of trees; but the same amount, when it is planted with trees, Saserna says can be satisfactorily cultivated with three additional men. This calculation shows us that one yoke of oxen can meet the requirements of one hundred and twenty-five <span class="italic">modii</span> of wheat and the same of legumes, so that the autumn sowing may total two hundred and fifty <span class="italic">modii</span>, and even after that seventy-five <span class="italic">modii</span> of three-months crops may still be sown. The proof of this is as<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">8</span><span class="br"></span> follows: Seeds that are sown at the fourth ploughing require, for twenty-five <span class="italic">iugera</span>, one hundred and fifteen days’ labour of the ploughmen; for such a plot of ground, however hard, is broken in fifty days, re-ploughed in twenty-five, ploughed a third time and then sown in forty days. Other legumes<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">9</span><span class="br"></span>
require sixty days, that is, two months. Forty-five days also are allowed for rainy weather and holidays, on which no ploughing is done; likewise thirty days after the sowing is finished, in which there is a period
