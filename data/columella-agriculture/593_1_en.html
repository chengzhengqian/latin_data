<p>IX. Lettuce is preserved in the following manner.
<span class="marginNote right">The pre servation lettuce.</span> The stalks of the lettuce should be stripped off from the bottom upwards up to a point where the leaves appear
to be tender, and salted in a basin and let stand a day and a night till they yield up the brine; then wash out the brine and after squeezing them spread them out on hurdles till they become dry; then strew underneath them dry dill and fennel and cut up a little rue and leek and mix it in; then, when the stalks are dry, you should so arrange them that entire green calavance may be placed between them, which themselves will have to be steeped for a day and a night in hard brine and, after being similarly dried, must be<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> pickled with the bunches of lettuce, and a liquid, consisting of two parts of vinegar and one of brine, must be poured over them; then they must be pressed down with a dried plug of fennel in such a manner that the liquid floats above them. To do this effectively, the person charged with the task will have frequently to pour the liquid on to them and not allow the pickle to become dry, but he must wipe the outside of the vessels with a clean sponge and cool them with the freshest possible spring-water. Chickory and tops of rue should be pickled in the same way as lettuce, also the tops of thyme, savory and marjoram and likewise the sprouts of the wild radish. All the above preparations are made during the spring.</p>
