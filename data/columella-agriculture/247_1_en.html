are planted. Inquiry, however, must first be made into the excellence of the soil; for if the plants are going to be set in hungry and poor land, planting-holes
or furrows must be made just before the time of planting. If they are made a year before the vineyard<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span>
is planted, it is quite enough for the planting-hole
to be dug three feet in length and depth, but two feet in width; or, if we are going to leave four feet between the rows, it is generally reckoned more convenient to give the planting-hole the same measurement in every dimension without, however, sinking them to a greater depth than three feet. Each plant, then, will be staked with lines running to the four corners after fine soil has been put into the bottom of the planting-holes, which will then be filled in.</p>
<p>As to the spaces between the rows we have this<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> much advice to offer, that farmers should understand that, if they intend to cultivate their vineyards with the plough, wider intervals must be left, but they can be narrower if hoes<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL407_31_a" id="target_note_LCL407_31_a"><sup>a</sup></a> are used; but they should never be wider than ten feet or narrower than four. Many people, however, arrange the rows so as to leave two or at most three feet in a straight line between the plants, while on the other hand they make the transverse spaces wider, so that the digger or ploughman may pass freely.</p>
<p>The precautions taken in planting ought not to<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span> differ from those which I directed in my Third Book.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL407_31_b" id="target_note_LCL407_31_b"><sup>b</sup></a> Mago, the Carthaginian, however, makes one addition to this system of planting, namely, that the plants should be put into the ground in such a way that the whole plant-hole is not immediately filled with soil but about half of it is gradually levelled up in the two following years; for he thinks that in this
