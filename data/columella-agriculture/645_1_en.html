and stored separately. The floor of these bins must<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span> be paved with stones or tiles and made to slope so that all moisture may flow quickly away by gutters or pipes; for lees are most harmful to the oil, and if they remain in the berries, spoil the flavour of the oil. So, when you have constructed the receptacles in the manner which we have described, place on the floor small boards half a foot distant from one another and put reeds on the top carefully, closely woven so as not to allow the berries to pass through and yet be able to support the weight of the olives. Adjoining all the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span> bins on the side where the lees flow down from them, under the pipes themselves, there will have to be a concave pavement in the form of little trenches or else a stone channel, in which any liquid which has flowed down may stand and from which it can be drawn off. Moreover it will be necessary that vats or barrels should be kept in readiness indoors to receive the lees of each kind of olive separately, whether they be such as flow down without admixture with anything else or have been salted; for both kinds are suitable for very many purposes.</p>
