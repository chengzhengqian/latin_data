The same remedy has an excellent effect after the removal of a piece of wood from the hoof, if the ox has by chance trodden on a shoot or pierced its hoof with a sharp tile or stone. If, however, the wound is rather deep, a wider cut is made round it with a knife and it is then cauterized according to the method which I have described above; next the hoof is covered with a “slipper” made of broom and treated for three days with a suffusion of vinegar.

The feet are rubbed underneath and are washed with warmed ox-urine; then a bundle of twigs is burnt and when now the fire has sunk to embers, the animal is made to stand on the glowing ashes and the horny parts of the hoof are anointed with liquid pitch mixed with oil or axle-grease. Cattle, however, will be less likely to go lame, if their feet are washed in plenty of cold water when they are unyoked after work, and if their hocks, the crowns of their hoofs and the division itself between the two halves of the hoofs are rubbed with stale axle-grease.</p>
