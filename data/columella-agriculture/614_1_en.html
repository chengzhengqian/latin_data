condition. When it has done so, you must have other vessels ready, and gradually strain the water into them, until you reach the dregs; for some sediment is always found in water which has been allowed to stand. When the water has been thus treated, it<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> must be boiled down to a third of its original volume, in the same way as must which is boiled down. Then a <span class="italic">sextarius</span> of white salt and a <span class="italic">sextarius</span> of the best honey are added to fifty <span class="italic">sextarii</span> of fresh water, which must be likewise boiled down and all impurities removed.

But before you draw the must from the vat, you should fumigate the vessels with rosemary or bay or myrtle and fill them to the brim, so that the wine may purify itself in the process of fermentation; afterwards you should rub the vessels with pine-cones. Wine which you wish to<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span> have rather sweet you will have to preserve on the day after you take it out of the vat, but, if you want it rather harsh in flavour, on the fifth day. You must then fill up the vessels and seal them. Some people, after fumigating the jars, put the preservative in first and then pour in the must.</p>
