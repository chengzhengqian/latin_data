<p>IV. Next in order is the precept of Caesonius,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_53_a" id="target_note_LCL361_53_a"><sup>a</sup></a> which Marcus Cato<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_53_b" id="target_note_LCL361_53_b"><sup>b</sup></a> also is said to have employed, that land which one intends to purchase should be visited again and again; for at the first examination it does not reveal the hidden qualities, bad or good, which are more readily apparent to those who go over it again soon afterwards. Our ancestors, too, have handed down to us what may be called a standard for the appraisal of rich and fertile land, of whose properties we shall speak in a fitting place, when we come to the discussion of types of soil.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_53_c" id="target_note_LCL361_53_c"><sup>c</sup></a> I have,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> however, a general rule which should be an attesting witness, so to speak, and should be proclaimed again and again; a rule which Marcus Atilius Regulus, a general of the greatest renown in the first Punic War, is reported to have laid down: that as a farm, even of the richest soil, is not to be purchased if it be unwholesome, just so we are not to buy a piece of worn-out land even though it be most wholesome.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_53_d" id="target_note_LCL361_53_d"><sup>d</sup></a> This advice Atilius gave to the husbandmen of his day with the greater authority as coming from the knowledge of experience; for history relates that he was<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> once the tiller of a pestilential and lean piece of ground in Pupinia<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_53_e" id="target_note_LCL361_53_e"><sup>e</sup></a> Wherefore, though it may be the part of a wise man not to buy anywhere and everywhere and not to be beguiled by either the allurements of fruitful land or the charm of its beauty, it is just as truly the part of an industrious master to render fruitful and profitable any land that he has acquired by purchase or otherwise; for our predecessors have left to us many means of relief from a noxious climate, whereby pernicious plagues may be alleviated, and even on lean land the good sense and painstaking of the husbandman
