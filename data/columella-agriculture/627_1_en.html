may be immediately dipped, may be boiling hot. Pour an <span class="italic">amphora</span> of boiled-down must into a barrel well coated with pitch; then press in cross-pieces of wood close together in such a way as not to touch the boiled-down must; then put on the top new earthenware dishes and put the grapes on them in such a way that they do not touch one another; then put covers on the dishes and seal them up. Next construct another story similarly above, and then a third, and continue the process as long as the size of the barrel allows, and arrange the grapes in the same manner. Then, after treating the lid of the barrel with pitch, smear it generously with boiled-down must and then, when you have put it on, stop it up with ashes.</p>
<p>Some people, after pouring in the boiled-down<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> must, are content with putting the cross-pieces in close together and hanging the grapes from them so as not to touch the must, and then putting on the lid and sealing it up. Some people, after gathering the grapes in the manner I have described above, dry small, new barrels in the sun without any pitch; then, when they have cooled in the shade, they put barley-bran
into them and place the grapes on the top so that they do not press upon one another; then they pour in barley-bran of the same kind and arrange another layer of grapes in the same way as before. This they do until they fill the barrel with alternate strata of bran and grapes. Next they put on the lids and seal them up and store the grapes in a very dry and cool loft.</p>
<p>Some people, after the same method, preserve<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span> green grapes in dry saw-dust of poplar-wood or fir; others cover up the grapes, which they have picked
