cheerful is the appearance of the bird, and so squeamish is it that it often takes a dislike to its own home and abandons it if it is given the opportunity to fly away. This is wont to happen often in districts where the birds are allowed free egress. For the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">7</span><span class="br"></span> prevention of such an escape, there is an ancient precept of Democritus. There is a kind of hawk which the country-folk call a <span class="italic">tinnunculus</span> (kestrel) and which generally makes its nest in buildings. The young of this bird are enclosed separately in earthenware pots, and while they are still breathing, lids are put over the pots which are smeared with plaster and hung up in the corners of the pigeon-houses. This induces in the birds such a love for the place that they never desert it.</p>
<p>For the rearing of the young chicks female birds must be chosen which are neither old nor too young, but they should be very large, and care must be taken that, if possible, the chicks should never be separated but be kept together as they were hatched; for if this principle is observed in mating them, they generally rear larger broods. If this is not done, at<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">8</span><span class="br"></span> any rate birds of different breeds, for example the Alexandrine and the Campanian, should not be mated; for they feel less affection for hen-birds unlike themselves and so have little intercourse with them and do not often produce offspring. The same colour of plumage is not approved always or by everybody; it is, therefore, not easy to say which is the best. White, which is generally to be seen<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">9</span><span class="br"></span> everywhere, is not very highly commended by some people; it should not, however, be avoided for birds which are kept in confinement, but for those which wander freely it is much to be condemned,
