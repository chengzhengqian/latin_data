elm is less flourishing. The elm is preferred by most people, because it both accommodates itself very well to the vine and provides food most acceptable to oxen and flourishes in various kinds of soil. So if it is desired to establish a new plantation, nurseries of elms or ash-trees should be prepared on the system which we have described hereafter; for poplars are better put straight into the plantation in the form of tree-tops planted in the ground. We will, therefore,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">6</span><span class="br"></span> prepare the ground with a double mattock where the earth is rich and moderately moist, and in the spring-time, after the soil has been carefully harrowed and broken up, we shall mark it out into beds. We shall then cast upon the beds the elm-seed which will now be of a ruddy colour and has been exposed to the sun for several days, but still retaining some juice and stickiness, and we shall thickly cover the beds all over with the seed and scatter crumbling earth over them with a sieve to the depth of two inches and give them a moderate watering and cover the beds with straw, so that the heads of the plants, when they come up, may not be pecked off by birds. Then, when the plants have crept forth, we shall<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">7</span><span class="br"></span> collect the straw and pull up the weeds by handâ€”a process which must be carried out gently and carefully, so that the still tender and short little roots of the elms may not be pulled up with the weeds. We shall have the beds themselves planned so as to be so narrow that those who are going to weed them can easily reach to the middle of them with their hands; for, if they are broader, the seedlings themselves will be trodden upon and receive damage. Then in the summer, before the sun rises<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">8</span><span class="br"></span> or towards evening, the nursery-beds ought to be
