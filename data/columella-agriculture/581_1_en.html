may have as little as possible to do indoors, since he ought to go forth early in the morning with the slaves and return weary at twilight, when his work is done.</p>
<p>However, while we fix the duties of the bailiff’s<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span> wife, we do not relieve the bailiff of responsibility for household matters but merely lighten his task by giving him an assistant. In fact the duties which are undertaken at home must not be left entirely to be carried out by the woman but must be so delegated to her that they are at the same time watched over by the bailiff’s eye. For she will be more diligent if she remembers that there is someone on the spot to whom a frequent account must be rendered. Also<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span> she will have to be absolutely convinced that she must remain entirely, or at any rate for the most part, at home; and that she must send out of doors those slaves who have some work to do in the fields, and keep within the walls those for whom it seems that there is some duty to perform in the villa; and she must see that the daily tasks are not spoilt by inaction. She must carefully inspect everything that is brought into the house to see that it is not damaged, and receive it after it has been examined and found intact; then she must set apart what has to be consumed and guard what can be placed in reserve, so that the provision for a year may not be spent in a month. Again, if any member of the household is beginning<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">6</span><span class="br"></span> to be affected by bad health, she will have to see that he is given the most suitable treatment; for attention of this kind is a source of kindly feeling and also of obedience. Moreover, those who have recovered their health, after careful attention has been given them when they were ill, are eager to give more faithful service than before.</p>
