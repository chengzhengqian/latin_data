For there is no soil so destitute of shrubs as not to produce some shoots, such as wild pears and plums or at least brambles; for even though these are varieties of thorns, still it is their common habit to grow up strong and thrifty and heavy with fruit. Therefore, if we observe that they<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">6</span><span class="br"></span>

most suitable for the nourishing of the young shoot? And that for a like reason free gravel, pebbly ground, and loose stones are approved? on condition, however, that they are mixed with fat soil, for they meet with the greatest disapproval in lean ground. Moreover, the flint-stone also, in my<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">8</span><span class="br"></span>
