Some people allow the geese themselves to rear the last clutch, because for the rest of the year they will be taking a holiday from laying. The female birds must not on any account be allowed to lay outside the enclosure, but, when they seem to be looking for a nesting-place, they must be stopped and must be examined; for if they are near laying, the eggs, which are in the nearest part of the genital organs, can be felt with the finger.

But, after the last laying, when we wish the geese themselves to sit, the eggs of each will have to be marked so that they may be put under those which
