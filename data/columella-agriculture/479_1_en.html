We conclude that the honey is ripe when we notice that the drones are being expelled and put to flight by the bees. They are insects of a larger growth, very like bees, but as Vergil<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL407_495_a" id="target_note_LCL407_495_a"><sup>a</sup></a> says “a lazy herd” and idle, sitting near the honey-combs without doing any work; for they do not collect food but consume that<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> which is brought in by others. Nevertheless these drones seem to contribute something to the procreation of the younger generation by sitting on the seeds from which the bees are formed, and so they are admitted on terms of some intimacy in order to sit upon the eggs which produce the new offspring; then, when the young bees are hatched, they are hustled out of the hives and, as the same poet says, “they are kept away from the fold.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL407_495_b" id="target_note_LCL407_495_b"><sup>b</sup></a> Some<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> people recommend that they should be entirely exterminated; but I agree with Mago that this should not be done, but that a limit ought to be set to cruelty.
