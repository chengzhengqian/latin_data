February 13th and March 15th, provided that the tree does not loosen its bark. In the same month is<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">42</span><span class="br"></span> the last season for planting cuttings of olive in a nursery-bed which has been trenched and, when you have set them, you should smear them with a mixture of dung and ashes and put moss over them, so that they may not be split by the sunâ€™s heat; this work, however, will be better carried out in the last part of March or in the first part of April and at the other times at which we recommend the planting of nurseries with plants or branches.</p>
<p>On May 15th the Lyre rises early; the wind is<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">43</span><span class="br"></span> South or East; it is sometimes a moist day. May 16th is of the same character as the day before. On May 17th and 18th the wind is East or South accompanied by rain. On May 19th the Sun makes his entry into the Twins. On May 21st the Hyades rise: the winds are northerly or sometimes there is a South wind with rain. On May 22nd and 23rd Arcturus sets in the morning: a storm is portended. On May 25th, 26th and 27th the Goat rises in the morning: the winds are northerly.</p>
<p>From May 15th to June 1st you should again dig<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">44</span><span class="br"></span> over an old-established vineyard before it begins to flower, and trim it and all the other vineyards. If you do this rather frequently, one boy-worker will trim a <span class="italic">iugerum</span> of vineyard in a day. In some districts sheep are sheared at this time, and a survey is taken of the stock which has been born and that which has been lost. Also he who sows lupines for manuring the land now finally turns it in with the plough.</p>
<p>On June 1st and 2nd Aquila rises: the weather is<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">45</span><span class="br"></span> windy and sometimes rainy. On June 7th Arcturus
