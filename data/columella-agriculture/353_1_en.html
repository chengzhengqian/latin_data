<p>These are, roughly speaking, the general points<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">8</span><span class="br"></span> which must be observed when you are buying sheep; the following points must be observed in their management. Their folds should be built low and extended in length rather than in breadth, so that they may be warm in winter and also that lack of space may not cause the ewes to cast their young. They should be placed so as to face the mid-day sun; for sheep, though naturally the best clothed of animals, can least endure cold, or summer heat either. For this reason a closed court with a high wall ought to be constructed in front of the entrance, so that there may be a safe way out for the animal when it is affected by the heat; and care must be taken to prevent there being any standing water by always keeping their folds strewn with the driest possible fern or straw, so that the ewes after lambing may have something clean and soft on which to lie, and that the folds may be very clean, and that the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">9</span><span class="br"></span> health of the ewes, which must be specially guarded, may not be impaired by dampness.
