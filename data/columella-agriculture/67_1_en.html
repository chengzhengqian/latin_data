always to run the furrow crosswise to the slope; for by this method the difficulty of the ascent is mitigated, and the toil of man and beast is thereby lessened most handily. Still, whenever it is reworked, the furrows should be run somewhat obliquely, now uphill, now downhill, so that we may tear up the ground in both directions and not work it in the same track. Lean land which lies level and is well watered<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">11</span><span class="br"></span>
should be ploughed for the first time during the latter part of the month of August, then gone over again a second time in September, and put in readiness for sowing about the time of the equinox. In ground of this sort, moreover, the work is easier, and for this reason fewer days of labour are expended; for three days are sufficient for one <span class="italic">iugerum.</span> Lean and sloping ground, likewise, is not to be ploughed in summer, but around the Calends of September;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_135_a" id="target_note_LCL361_135_a"><sup>a</sup></a> for if it is broken before this time, the earth, being exhausted and destitute of moisture, is burned by the summer sun and has no reserves of strength.
