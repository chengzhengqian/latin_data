<p>XIX. The length that a cutting should have is not absolutely fixed, since it should be made shorter if its eyes are close together, or longer if they are far apart. Still, it should be not more than a foot nor less than nine inches in length: lest in the latter case, being at the surface of the earth, it dry out in hot weather; while in the former case, if set too deep, it may make removal difficult after it has made some growth. But the above applies to planting in level ground. For on hillsides, where the land falls off rapidly, it may be set to a depth of a foot and a palm. A<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span>
situation in a valley or a wet plain allows even a cutting of three buds, which is a little less than nine inches but in any case more than half a foot in length. And this cutting is called “three-budded,” not from the fact that it consists of three eyes in all—since it is usually full of sprouts about the wound where it was cut from its mother—but because, apart from those buds with which it is crowded at the butt, it has three joints in succession and the same number of buds. In addition, I offer this advice also to one who is planting either the cutting or the rooted vine—to avoid excessive wind and sun, lest the plants dry out; and both of these are warded off without inconvenience by throwing a garment or any sort of thick covering around the plants. However, it is better to<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span>
choose for the planting a day when the air is still or at least stirring but lightly. For the sun is easily kept off by canopies.</p>
<p>But, before putting an end to this discussion, we must speak of a matter which we have not yet touched upon—whether vines of one or several kinds are to be kept, and whether these are to be separated and kept apart, sort by sort, or jumbled
