and when these have hardened they are tied up into a kind of crown. This is done for two reasons: firstly, lest, if they are allowed to run free, the shoots should creep forward and become over-luxuriant,
and use up all the shootâ€™s nourishment, and, secondly, in order that the vine, being tied back, may give the ploughman and the digger free access again for carrying on the cultivation of it.</p>
<p>The following will be the method of trimming.<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">14</span><span class="br"></span> In places which are shady and damp and cold, the vine should be stripped in summer and the leaves plucked from the shoots, so that the fruit may reach maturity and not become mouldy and rot away. In dry, warm and sunny places, on the contrary, the clusters of grapes should be covered by its shoots, and, if the vine is not sufficiently covered with foliage, the fruit should be protected with leaves brought from elsewhere and sometimes with straw. Indeed, my<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">15</span><span class="br"></span> paternal uncle, Marcus Columella, a man learned in the noble sciences and a most industrious farmer of the province of Baetica, used to shelter his vines about the rising of the Dogstar with palm-mats, because usually during the period of the said constellation some parts of that district are so troubled by the East wind, which the inhabitants call Vulturnus, that, unless the vines are shaded with coverings, the fruit is scorched as it were with a fiery breath.</p>
<p>Such is the method of cultivating both the vine which grows into a head and that which grows into arms.
