by 6, because there are 6 sides: the product is 2340. We shall say, therefore, that this is the number of square feet.

<p>III. Having grasped what may be called the first
<span class="marginNote right">How many plants can a iugerum of land contain at intervals of three to ten feet apart?</span> principles of this kind of calculation, we shall have no difficulty about entering upon the measurement of pieces of land, with the various kinds of which it is a long and arduous task to deal at this point. I will now also add, in addition to those which I have already set forth, two rules which husbandmen often employ in the setting out of plants.</p>
<p>Suppose that you have a piece of land 1200 feet long and 120 feet wide, in which vines have to be so arranged that five feet are left between the rows. How many plants, I ask, are necessary when spaces of five feet are required between the plants. I take<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> a fifth of the length, which makes 240, and a fifth of the breadth, which makes 24. To each of these numbers always add one unit, which forms the outermost row, and which they call the angular row; one number, therefore amounts to 241, the other to 25. Multiply these figures as follows: 25 times 241 makes 6025. This, you will say, is the number<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> of plants required.</p>
<p>Similarly, if you wish to set them six feet apart, you will take a sixth of the longitude (which is 1200), that is 200, and a sixth of the breadth (which is 120), that is 20. To each of these figures you will add what I called the angular units. The numbers are
