possible; while the last named wants no middling ground, being sown either in very rich or very poor soil. Even though you sow the first mentioned in ground that is still muddy and wet after continuous rains, if necessity so demands, it withstands the injury; if you commit the last named to miry ground, it dies. However, if the field is moderately chalky or<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span>
marshy, you need for a sowing of the white winter wheat or common wheat somewhat more than the five <span class="italic">modii</span> that I mentioned above. But if the ground is dry and loose, no matter whether it be rich or poor, only four; for, conversely, lean land requires the same amount of seed, because if it is not sown thinly it produces a small and empty head. But when<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">6</span><span class="br"></span>
it forms a stool of several stalks from one seed it makes a heavy stand even from a light sowing. Among other things, too, we should not overlook the fact that a field planted with trees for supporting vines requires one fifth more seed than a treeless and open field.</p>
<p>We have been speaking thus far of the autumn sowing, for this we regard as the most important. There is another sowing, however, when necessity<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">7</span><span class="br"></span> requires it—what farmers call the “half-month sowing.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_147_a" id="target_note_LCL361_147_a"><sup>a</sup></a> This is practised to advantage in very cold and snowy regions where the summer is damp and free from intense heat, but in other places it very seldom yields a return. And even in this sowing it will be better to finish it quickly, and certainly before the spring equinox; in fact, if conditions of ground and of weather allow it, the sooner we sow the better the result will be. For there is no seed that naturally<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">8</span><span class="br"></span>
requires three months, as many have believed, and
