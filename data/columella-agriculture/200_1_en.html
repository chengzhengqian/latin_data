forth more vigorous wood which may immediately shoot up to the frame.</p>
<p>XXI. There is no other pruning for a vine five years old than that it shall be shaped as I have undertaken to describe above, and that it shall not spread too far; but that the head of the stock shall be about one foot below the frame and that, with its four arms, which some call <span class="italic">duramenta,</span> or “hardened branches,” it shall be spread out into a corresponding number of spaces. It will suffice for a time that these arms be reduced
to one fruiting branch each, until the vines are of proper strength. Then, some years later, when they have entered the juvenile stage, so to speak, it is uncertain how many branches should be left. For<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span>
richness of situation requires more, and leanness fewer; since, indeed, a vine of rank growth, unless it is checked by bearing, casts its blossoms badly and runs to wood and foliage; while a weak vine, on the contrary, is impaired when burdened with fruit. And so in rich ground it will be permissible to impose two rods upon each arm, but not to burden them with a number beyond the point where one vine supports
eight rods, unless its very excessive fruitfulness
shall demand more; for the vine which is extended with firm wood beyond this limit has the appearance of an arbour rather than of a vine. And<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span>
we should not allow the arms to be larger than the stock; but when presently the growth of lateral shoots from them is permitted, the upper hard canes must be constantly cut away so that they may not go beyond the frame; but the vine should always be renewed with young branches. These laterals, if they have made sufficient growth, should be placed upon the frame; but if one of them is broken or not
