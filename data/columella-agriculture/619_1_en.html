<p>XXXIV. Those who wish to make squill-vinegar
<span class="marginNote right">How to make squill-vinegar.</span> put just the same weight of squill as is given above into two <span class="italic">urnae</span> of vinegar and allow it to remain there
for forty days. For sauces you put into three <span class="italic">amphorae</span> of must a <span class="italic">congius</span> of sharp vinegar, or double the amount if it is not sharp, and boil it in a pot which holds three <span class="italic">amphorae</span>, down to a <span class="italic">palmus,</span> that is, a quarter of its original volume, or, if the must is not sweet, to a third; the scum should then be removed. The must should be under pressure of a heavy weight<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL408_259_a" id="target_note_LCL408_259_a"><sup>a</sup></a> and transparent.</p>
<p>XXXV. The following is the way to make up wines
<span class="marginNote right">How to make wine flavoured with worm-wood, etc.</span> flavoured with wormwood, hyssop, southern-wood, thyme, fennel and pennyroyal. Take a pound of Pontic<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL408_259_b" id="target_note_LCL408_259_b"><sup>b</sup></a> wormwood and four <span class="italic">sextarii</span> of must and boil
down to a quarter of the original quantity and put what remains when it is cold into an <span class="italic">urna</span> of Aminean must. Do the same with the other things mentioned above. Three pounds of dry pennyroyal in a <span class="italic">congius</span> of must can also be boiled down to a third part, and the liquid, when it has cooled, and the pennyroyal is removed, can be added to an <span class="italic">urna</span> of must. This is presently given, and properly, to those who have coughs in the winter; it is called the pennyroyal brand of wine.</p>
<p>XXXVI. “Squeezed” must is that which is
<span class="marginNote right">“Squeezed” must.</span> pressed out after the first pressing of the grape-skins, when the pedicles have been cut away. This must
you will pour into a new wine-jar and fill it to the brim; you will then add little branches of dried rosemary tied together with flax and allow them to ferment together for seven days. Then you will take out the bundle of little branches and carefully plaster up the wine after cleansing it. It will be enough
