upon vipers and lizards, which, provoked by its weight, inflict a bite upon it. The shrew-mouse, which the Greeks call <span class="italic">mygale,</span> though its teeth are small, gives rise to a malady which is far from being slight. A viper’s poison can be expelled by scarifying with a knife the part affected and applying to it the herb called burdock, pounded up and mixed with salt.
