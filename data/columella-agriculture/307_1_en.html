<p>VII. Pain in the belly and intestines is assuaged
<span class="marginNote right">Remedy for internal pains in oxen.</span> by the sight of swimming birds, especially a duck. If an ox which has a pain in its intestines sees a duck, it is quickly delivered from its torment. The sight of a duck is also even more successful in curing mules and the race of horses. Sometimes, however, no remedy is of any avail and colic follows, the sign of which is a flux of blood and mucous matter from the belly. The cure for this consists of fifteen<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> cypress-cones and the same number of oak-apples and very old cheese equal in weight to the other two ingredients. When these have been pounded up together, four <span class="italic">sextarii</span> of rough wine are mixed with them, and the mixture is administered in equal doses for four days; nor should tops of mastic and myrtle and wild olive be lacking. Diarrhoea<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL407_151_a" id="target_note_LCL407_151_a"><sup>a</sup></a> wastes the body and the strength and renders an animal useless for work. When this happens, the ox will have to be kept from drinking for two days and on the first day must be kept from eating; but soon thereafter tops of<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> wild olive and of reeds must be given, also berries of mastic and myrtle, but no opportunity of drinking water must be allowed except as sparingly as possible. Some people crush a pound of tender leaves of bay and the same quantity of horned southernwood<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL407_151_b" id="target_note_LCL407_151_b"><sup>b</sup></a> in two <span class="italic">sextarii</span> of hot water and pour it down the animal’s throat and put before it the same food as I mentioned above.
