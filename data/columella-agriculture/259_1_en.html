they are not, on the other hand, so much smoothed away that the trunk itself is damaged or stripped of its bark; for an elm takes little pleasure in being bared to the quick. Also we must avoid making one wound out of two, for the bark does not easily grow over a scar of this kind. The elm requires constant<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">17</span><span class="br"></span> attention, not only in training it carefully but also in digging round the trunk and in alternate years cutting off with a knife or tying back any foliage which has grown from it, so that excessive shade may not harm the vine. Then when the tree has reached a good age, a wound will be made in it near the ground in such a way that a hole is made reaching to the pith and a passage thus given to the moisture, which it has formed in its upper portion. It is well also to plant the vine before the tree has reached its full strength.</p>
<p>But if you wed a tender young elm to a vine, it will<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">18</span><span class="br"></span> now not support the weight; if you couple a vine with an old elm, it will kill its mate. The trees and the vines, therefore, ought to be nearly equal in age and strength. In order to wed the tree and the vine, a trench ought to be made for the quick-set two feet wide and the same number of feet deep, if the soil is light (but if it is heavy, two feet and three-quarters deep) and six or at least five feet long. The trench, however, should not be less than a foot and a half from the tree; for if you put the vine close to the roots of the elm, it will not strike root properly and, when it has taken hold, it will be smothered by the growth of the tree. If circumstances allow, make<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">19</span><span class="br"></span> the trench in the autumn, that it may be softened by the rains and frosts; then, about the time of the spring equinox, in order more quickly to clothe the
