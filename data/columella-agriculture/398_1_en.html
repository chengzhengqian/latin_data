In this cell entrances should be made in the right and left party walls, one leading to each of the other two cells and adjoining the wall which faces those who enter the central cell. To this wall a hearth should be fixed of such a length as not to block the entrances already mentioned and to allow the smoke from it to penetrate into each of the other two cells.

The<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> height should be divided up by lofts with four unoccupied feet above them and seven below, since they themselves take up one foot. Both lofts ought to be used to accommodate the hens and should each be lighted by a small window on the east side, which may also provide the birds with a means of exit in the morning into the poultry-yard and a means of entrance in the evening; but care must be taken that they are always kept closed at night that the fowls may remain in greater safety.
