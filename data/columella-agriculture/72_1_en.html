<p>IX. A <span class="italic">iugerum</span> of rich land usually requires four <span class="italic">modii</span> of wheat;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_145_a" id="target_note_LCL361_145_a"><sup>a</sup></a> land of medium quality, five; it calls for nine <span class="italic">modii</span> of emmer if the soil is fertile, and ten if it is ordinary. For although there is little agreement among authorities as to the quantity, yet my own experience has shown that this amount seems best suited; and anyone who does not care to comply with this may follow the directions of those who instruct us to sow a rich field with eight <span class="italic">modii</span> of wheat a <span class="italic">iugerum,</span> and the same for emmer, and who hold that seed should be supplied to medium land in this proportion. My opinion is that not even the amount<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span>
which I have mentioned above is always to be held to, for the reason that conditions of place or season or weather cause it to vary: of place, according as the grain is sown on level ground or hillsides, and these, too, either fat or medium or lean; of season, according as we cast the seed in autumn or even at the onset of winter, for the earlier sowing allows a lighter seeding while the later requires it to be heavier; of weather, according as it is rainy or dry, for the former requires the same as the early sowing, and the latter the same as the late. Further, every sort of grain especially<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span>
delights in ground that is open and sloping toward the sun, warm and loose; for though hilly ground produces a somewhat stronger grain, it yields a smaller crop of wheat. Soil that is heavy, chalky, and wet is not unsuited to the growing of winter wheat and emmer. Barley tolerates no place except one that is loose and dry. And the first mentioned<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span>
grains require ground that lies fallow and is worked by turns in alternate years and that is as rich as
