They do not, however, suffer castration by the loss of their genital organs but by having their spurs burnt with a red-hot iron; when these have been consumed by the force of the fire, they are smeared with potter’s clay until the sores which have been caused heal up.</p>
<p>The profit from keeping the farm-yard type of fowl<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span> is not to be despised if a scientific method of rearing them is put into operation, which most of the Greeks and in particular the people of Delos have made famous. The Greeks, however, since they desired height of body and determined courage in the fray, esteemed most highly the Tanagran<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL407_325_a" id="target_note_LCL407_325_a"><sup>a</sup></a> and Rhodian breeds and likewise the Chalcidian<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL407_325_b" id="target_note_LCL407_325_b"><sup>b</sup></a> and Median<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL407_325_c" id="target_note_LCL407_325_c"><sup>c</sup></a> (called by the ignorant vulgar Melian,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL407_325_d" id="target_note_LCL407_325_d"><sup>d</sup></a> by the change of one letter).
