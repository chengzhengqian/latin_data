from vineyards in the plains, three <span class="italic">heminae</span> are added. When the must has been removed from the vat, we<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> allow it to cool off for two days and to become clear. On the third day we add the boiled-down must; then, after an interval of two days, when the must together with the boiled-down must has finished fermenting, it is purified, and a heaped spoonful or a half-ounce measure generously filled with roasted and pounded salt should be added to each two <span class="italic">urnae</span> of must. For this purpose the whitest possible salt is thrown into an earthenware ewer which has not been treated with pitch; this, when it receives the salt, is carefully smeared all over with clay mixed with chaff and then put on the fire, and allowed to roast as long as it continues to crackle; when it begins to be silent, the process of cooking is complete.</p>

Then, when the must has quite left off fermenting and has been standing for some time, we mix in the same amount of the flower of gypsum as we had already added of salt; then, on the next day, we cleanse the wine-jar and cover up the wine which has been preserved and seal it up.</p>
