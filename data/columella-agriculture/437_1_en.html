Many people think that in the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span> sides of ponds of this kind deep recesses and winding caves should be constructed for the fishes, so that there may be shadier places of retreat for them when they feel the heat. But if a change of sea water is not continually passing through the pond, the result is to cause a contrary condition, for lurking-places of this kind do not easily admit a change of water and only with difficulty get rid of the stale water, and more harm results from the putrid water than benefit from the shade. There ought, however, to be<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">6</span><span class="br"></span> excavated in the sides of the pond what may be described as a series of similar cells which may serve to protect the fish when they want to avoid the heat of the sun and yet at the same time let the water, which they have received, easily flow out again. It will be well to remember that gratings made of brass with small holes should be fixed in front of the channels through which the fish-pond pours out its waters, to prevent the fish from escaping. If space allows, it will not be amiss to place in various parts of the pond rocks from the sea-shore, especially those which are covered with bunches of sea-weed<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL407_411_a" id="target_note_LCL407_411_a"><sup>a</sup></a> and, as far as the wit of man can contrive, to represent the appearance of the sea, so that, though they are prisoners, the fish may feel their captivity as little as possible.</p>
