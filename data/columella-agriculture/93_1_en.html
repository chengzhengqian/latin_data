<p>XII. And now to reckon up the number of days’ labour required to bring to the threshing-floor what we have committed to the earth, four or five <span class="italic">modii</span> of common wheat<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_187_b" id="target_note_LCL361_187_b"><sup>b</sup></a> take up four days’ work of the ploughmen, one of the narrower, two of the hoer for the first hoeing and one for the second, one of the weeder, and one and a half of the reaper—a total of ten and one-half days of labour. Five <span class="italic">modii</span> of winter wheat require the same number of days.

three days’ labour of the ploughman, one day of harrowing, one and a half of hoeing, and one of reaping—six and a half days in all. Four or six <span class="italic">modii</span> of beans use up two days’ work of the ploughmen in old fallow ground, but one in land under cultivation; they are harrowed in a day and a half, hoed in a day and a half, hoed a second time in one day and a third time in one day, and harvested in one day—the total amounting to seven or eight days.
