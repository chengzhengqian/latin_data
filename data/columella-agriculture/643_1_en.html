<p>LI. Black olives are gathered very ripe when the
<span class="marginNote right">The preservation of black olives (continued.).</span> weather is fair and are spread in the shade on reeds for one day, and any damaged berries are set aside, Also any pedicles which have adhered to the fruit are removed, and any leaves and twigs which are intermingled with them are picked out. On the following day the olives are carefully sifted in order that any dirt which is among them may be separated: then the unbruised olives are enclosed in a new frail and put under the press that they may be squeezed for a whole night. Next day they are thrown into<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> mills which are as clean as possible and are suspended<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL408_307_a" id="target_note_LCL408_307_a"><sup>a</sup></a> so that the kernels may not be broken, and when they are reduced to a pulp, salt which has been toasted and rubbed in the hand is mixed with the other dry seasonings, which are caraway, cumin, fennel seed and Egyptian anise-seed. It will, however, be enough to add the same number of <span class="italic">heminae</span> of salt as there are <span class="italic">modii</span> of olives and to pour oil upon the top so that they may not become dry; this will have to be done whenever they seem to be getting dry.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that the preparation which<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> is made from the Pausean olive has the best flavour, but it does not remain unimpaired for more than two months. Other kinds of olives seem more suitable for this purpose, such as the Licinian and Culminian; however the Calabrian olive, which some people call the “little wild olive,” because of its resemblance to the wild olive, is regarded as particularly good for these purposes.</p>
