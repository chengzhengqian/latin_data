<p>II. Every piece of land is square, or long, or wedge-shaped,
<span class="marginNote right">The shapes of land and their dimensions</span> or triangular, or round, or else presents the form of a semi-circle or of the arc of a circle, sometimes also of a polygon. The measuring of a square is very easy; for, since it has the same number of feet on every one of its sides, two sides are multiplied together and the product of this multiplication we shall say is the number of square feet. For example

<figure id="fig_LCL407.13.1">
<a class="imageLink" href="/view/LCL407/figures/LCL407-p13-f1.png" target="_blank" title="diagram: 100 feet 100 feet 10,000 square feet 100 feet 100 feet "><img alt="diagram: 100 feet 100 feet 10,000 square feet 100 feet 100 feet " src="/view/LCL407/figures/LCL407-p13-f1.png"/></a></figure>
if an area were 100 feet each way, we multiply 100 by 100 and the result is 10,000. We shall, therefore, say<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> that the area contains 10,000 square feet, which make a <span class="italic">triens</span> â…“ plus a <span class="italic">sextula</span> 1/72 of a <span class="italic">iugerum,</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL407_13_a" id="target_note_LCL407_13_a"><sup>a</sup></a> and on the basis of this fraction we shall have to calculate the amount of work done.</p>
<p>If it is longer than it is broad (for example let the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> form of the <span class="italic">iugerum</span> have 240 feet of length and 120 of breadth), as I said just now, you will multiply the feet of the breadth with the feet of the length in the following manner: 120 times 240 make 28,800, and we shall say that the <span class="italic">iugerum</span> of land contains this number
