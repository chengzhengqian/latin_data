the sowing should be governed by this rule in land that is temperate and not at all moist; but in sections<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span>

<p class="noindent">so that the roots of the grain may gain strength before they are attacked by winter rains or cold or frost. But even though the sowing be finished in good season, still we must be careful to make wide ridges and frequent water-furrows, which some call <span class="italic">elices,</span> and to turn off all water into drains<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_143_b" id="target_note_LCL361_143_b"><sup>b</sup></a> and hence outside the grain-fields.

ancient authorities have left directions that fields should not be sown except after the ground is well soaked with rain; and that this is to the greater advantage of the farmer, if it comes in due season, I have no doubt. But if the rains are late, as sometimes happens, the seed is safely intrusted to ground however thirsty; and that is actually the practice in certain provinces where such weather conditions exist. For seed that is put into dry ground and harrowed in, is no more injured than if it were stored away in a granary; and when the rain does come, the sowing of many daysâ€™ standing sprouts up in one.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_143_c" id="target_note_LCL361_143_c"><sup>c</sup></a> Tremelius, in fact, makes the statement<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span>
