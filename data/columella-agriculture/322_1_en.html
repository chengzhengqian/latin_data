They do not require rivers and streams so much as artificial ponds, since river-water, which is generally colder, cause abortion, while rain-water is pleasanter to the taste. Cows, however, endure every outdoor cold better than horses and so can easily pass the winter under the open sky.</p>

The best cow-sheds are floored with stone or gravel, though sandy floors are also suitable, the former because they keep out rainwater, the latter because they quickly absorb it and drain it away. In either case they must be shelving, so as to make the moisture flow away, and they should face the south that they may dry easily and not be exposed to the cold winds.

Salt sprinkled on the stones and water-courses near the enclosures contributes to the good bodily health of the cattle and they gladly have recourse to it after they have eaten their fill, when what may be called the cowherdâ€™s signal for retreat is sounded; for this too ought always to be<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> given at dusk, so that any cattle which have remained in the woods may be accustomed, when the horn
