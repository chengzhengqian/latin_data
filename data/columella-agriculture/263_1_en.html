fruit, and it is the part which, being tied with a band, grows upwards that provides the firm-wood branches for the following year. There are two kinds of the fruit-bearing<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">29</span><span class="br"></span> shoots themselves, one that comes out of the hard-wood of the vine, which, because in the first year it usually puts forth leaves but no fruit, is called a tendril-bearing shoot, and another which is produced from a one-year-old shoot and, because it bears fruit immediately, is called a fructuary shoot. In order that we may have plenty of shoots of this kind in our vineyard, the portions of the shoots up to three buds must be tied back, so that whatever is below the band may produce firm-wood. Then, afterwards,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">30</span><span class="br"></span> when the vine has increased in years and strength, the cross-branches must be conveyed to all the nearest trees and after two years must be cut away and others which are younger must be trained across; for when they grow old they wear out the vine. Sometimes too, when the vine cannot occupy the whole tree, it has been found useful to bend part of it down and sink it into the earth and raise two or three layers again into the same tree, so that it may be surrounded by several vines and so be more quickly covered.</p>
<p>A tendril-bearing shoot ought not to be allowed to<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">31</span><span class="br"></span> grow on a young vine, unless it has grown in a place where it is required, so that it may be wedded to a branch which lacks a vine-shoot. Tendril-bearing shoots which grow in the right place on old vines are useful and are generally cut back to the third bud and allowed to grow with very good results; for in the following year they produce firm-wood in abundance. But if any tendril growing in the right place is broken<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">32</span><span class="br"></span> in the process of pruning or tying, provided that it
