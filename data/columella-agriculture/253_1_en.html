such a distance that, as it lies on the ground, it does not reach beyond the space between the rows. Nor<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">18</span><span class="br"></span> is there a great difference between the pruning of a procumbent vine and of one which stands upright, except that the firm-wood branches in the vine which lies on the ground should be allowed to grow to a shorter length and the stumps ought to be left narrower so as to resemble knobs. But after the pruning, which in this kind of vine ought naturally to be carried out in the autumn, the whole vine is bent aside into one of the two spaces between the rows; and the part which was previously occupied is either dug up or ploughed, and when it has been thoroughly cultivated, it receives the same vine back again, so that the other space may also be cultivated. About<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">19</span><span class="br"></span> the trimming of this kind of vineyard, there is little agreement between the authorities. Some say that the vine ought not to be stripped, that it may the better conceal the fruit from injury by the wind and by wild beasts; others hold that it should be trimmed only sparingly, so that the vine may not be wholly burdened with superfluous leaves and yet may be able to cover or conceal the fruit. The later method seems to me too to be the more expedient.</p>
<p>VI. We have now said enough about vines; we

vines with the trees set at equal distances from one another will take care that it does not grow sparse because the trees have died and will be careful to remove any tree as soon as it is afflicted with old age or damaged by storm and substitute a young growth in its place. This he will easily be able to achieve if he has a nursery for elms ready prepared.
