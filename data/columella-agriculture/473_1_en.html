the developed moths must be killed. These pests which generally adhere to the honey-combs fall off, if you mix oxâ€™s marrow with dung and, after setting the mixture on fire, bring the smell of burning near them. As a result of this precaution the swarms will be strengthened during the period which we have mentioned and will apply themselves to their work with more vigour.</p>
<p>But very great care must be taken by the man in<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> charge, who feeds the bees, when he must handle the hives, that the day before he has abstained from sexual relations and does not approach them when drunk and only after washing himself, and that he abstain from all edibles which have a strong flavour, such as pickled fish and all the liquids which accompany them, and also from the acrimonious stench of garlic and onions and all other similar things.
