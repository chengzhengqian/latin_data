not be fenced on holidays; they also forbid the washing of sheep for the good of the fleece, except as a curative measure. Vergil is instructing us as to the lawfulness of washing the flock in a river on holidays, and for that reason he adds “to dip in wholesome stream”—that is, in a healing stream; for there are ailments because of which it is expedient to bathe the cattle.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_221_a" id="target_note_LCL361_221_a"><sup>a</sup></a> Furthermore, the religious observances<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span>
of our forefathers permit these tasks also on holidays:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_221_b" id="target_note_LCL361_221_b"><sup>b</sup></a> the braying of spelt; the cutting of torches; the dipping of candles; the tilling of a leased vineyard; the clearing out and cleaning of fish-ponds, cisterns, and old ditches; the sickling<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_221_c" id="target_note_LCL361_221_c"><sup>c</sup></a> of meadows; the spreading of manure; the storing of hay in the loft; the gathering of the fruits of a leased olive-grove; the spreading of apples, pears, and figs to dry; the making of cheese; the carrying of trees for planting, either on our own shoulders or with a pack mule. But it is not permitted to haul them with a yoked animal, nor to plant them after they are transported, nor to open the ground, nor to thin a tree;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_221_d" id="target_note_LCL361_221_d"><sup>d</sup></a> and not to assist<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span>
in the sowing either unless you have first sacrificed a puppy, nor to cut hay or bind it or haul it; and it is not permissible either by the ordinances of the priests for the vintage to be gathered on feast days, nor to shear sheep, unless you have sacrificed a puppy. It is also lawful to make boiled must and to boil wine. To gather grapes and olives for preserving is likewise lawful. It is not lawful to clothe sheep with skins.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_221_e" id="target_note_LCL361_221_e"><sup>e</sup></a>
