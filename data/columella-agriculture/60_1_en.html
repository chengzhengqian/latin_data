you try to put back and tread down in trenches the earth that has been removed, if there is an excess as by some sort of leavening, it will be a sure sign that the soil is fat; if it is insufficient, that it is poor; if it makes an even fill, that it is ordinary.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_121_a" id="target_note_LCL361_121_a"><sup>a</sup></a> And yet the statements which I have just now made may seem not so trustworthy in the case of blackish earth (<span class="italic">pulla</span>),<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_121_b" id="target_note_LCL361_121_b"><sup>b</sup></a> which is better tested by its yield of crops.

from that part of the field which displeases us most, clods should be dug and soaked in an earthen vessel, then thoroughly mixed with fresh water and, after careful straining in the manner of dreggy wine, examined by tasting;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_121_c" id="target_note_LCL361_121_c"><sup>c</sup></a> for, whatever is the taste transmitted from the clods to the water, such we shall take to be the taste of that soil. But, apart from this experiment, there are many signs which show that ground is sweet and suitable for grain—for example, the rush, the reed, grass, trefoil, the dwarf-elder, bramble bushes, wild plums, and many other things which are well known also to searchers for springs,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_121_d" id="target_note_LCL361_121_d"><sup>d</sup></a> and which are not nourished except by veins of sweet water in the ground.

with the first appearance of surface soil, but should take pains to investigate the character of what lies beneath—whether it is earthy or not. It will be satisfactory for grain, however, if the soil below is equally good to a depth of two feet; for trees, a depth of four feet is sufficient.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_121_e" id="target_note_LCL361_121_e"><sup>e</sup></a> When we have investigated these points as stated, we shall put our
