they may put more energy into the sexual act. One bull is quite enough for fifteen cows; and, when it has covered a heifer there are definite signs by which you can tell what is the sex of the offspring which it has begotten; since, if he uncouples towards the right side, it is clear that he has begotten a male, if towards the left, a female. But whether this is really true is only apparent when after one copulation the pregnant cow refuses to admit the bull again, and this actually happens only rarely; for although<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span> the cow may have conceived, she is not satisfied in her desires; so true is it that the seductive allurements of pleasure exercise the greatest power even over cattle beyond the bounds prescribed by nature.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that where there is a great luxuriance of forage, a calf can be reared from the same cow every year, but where food is scarce, the cow must be used for breeding only every other year. This rule is particularly observed where cows are employed for work, in order that, firstly, the calves may have abundance of milk for the space of a year, and, secondly, that a breeding cow may not have to bear the burden of work and pregnancy at the same time. When she has given birth to a calf, however good a mother she may be, if she is worn out by work, she denies the calf its due nourishment if her diet does not give her enough support. That<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span> is why green shrub-trefoil and toasted barley and sodden bitter-vetch are given to a cow which has borne a calf, and her tender young is given a drench of grilled millet ground up and mixed with milk.
