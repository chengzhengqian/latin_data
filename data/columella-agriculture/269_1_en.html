It can, however, be planted on corn-land or where the strawberry-tree or holm-oak have stood; for the ordinary oak, even if it has been cut down, leaves behind roots harmful to the olive-grove, the poison from which kills the olive.

This is quite easy if you have first made a forked support and protect with hay or straw the part above which you are going to cut the branch, so that the slips which are placed in the fork may be severed gently without any damage to their bark. The slips then should be<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> cut to the length of a foot and a half with the saw, and their wounds at each end smoothed with a pruning-knife and marked with ruddle, in order that the portion of the branch may be properly placed in the position which the branch, had occupied on the tree, and with its top towards the sky; for, if it is
