Surely those things that are planted by our hands<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span>
cannot be immortal; and yet we take such thought for their permanence that we set other plants in place of those that have died, and do not allow the whole genus to be brought to destruction through many years of neglect. Moreover, frequent diggings<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_391_a" id="target_note_LCL361_391_a"><sup>a</sup></a> must be given, although one may be subtracted from the number of the first yearâ€™s cultivation. Leaf-pruning also must be practised often; for it does not suffice to remove excess leafage from the vine only once or twice in a whole summer. And especially must<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span>
everything be broken off which has sprouted out below the head of the main stem. Likewise if any single eyes just below the frame should put out two shoots, even though they give evidence of an abundance of fruit, one branch must be pulled off from each, so that the remaining branch of strong wood may make more vigorous growth and better nourish the fruit that is left.</p>
<p>After the forty-second month, when the vintage has been gathered, the pruning must be so managed, by allowing the growth of more shoots, that the vine may be spread out in the form of a star.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_391_b" id="target_note_LCL361_391_b"><sup>b</sup></a> But it is<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span>
the duty of the pruner to check the vine at a distance of about one foot short of the cross-bar, so that any tender growth that is sent out from the head may be drawn out in the form of arms and that, after being bent over the frame, it may be dropped down to a length which cannot reach the ground. But a limit must be observed in proportion to the strength of the stock, that no more branches may be allowed to grow than the vine is able to support. And in general, when the soil is fertile and the stock thrifty, the aforesaid
