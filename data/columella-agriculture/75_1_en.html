crushed root of the same, dilute it with water, and after soaking the seeds in the same way they consign them to the earth.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_151_a" id="target_note_LCL361_151_a"><sup>a</sup></a> Others sprinkle the furrows with this same liquid or with unsalted lees of oil, when the crop begins to be infested, and so drive off the destructive creatures.</p>
<p>The next direction that I have to offer is that when the crops have been harvested and are on the threshing-floor, we should consider the sowing that is to follow. For, as Celsus remarks, when the harvest<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">11</span><span class="br"></span> is just ordinary we should select all the best heads and store the seed from them by itself; when, in turn, there is a more generous yield, everything that is threshed out should be cleaned with a sieve, and the grain that settles to the bottom because of its size and weight should always be kept for seed. This is a most beneficial measure because, while grain deteriorates more rapidly in damp places, it also does so in dry places unless such pains are taken.

there is no doubt that from strong seed there can be produced seed that has no strength; but it is obvious that what is produced continuously from weak seed can never acquire strength. For that reason Vergil, in treating of other matters, has also expressed himself very clearly on the subject of seeds, as follows;</p>
