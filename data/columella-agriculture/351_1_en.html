<span class="line">If under his wet palate a black tongue</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Lurks, then reject it, lest with dusky spots</span><span class="linebreak"></span>

<p class="noindent">The same reasoning applies both to red and to black<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> rams, in whom, likewise, as I said just now, neither the tongue nor the palate ought to be different in colour from the wool, still less should the whole skin be variegated with spots. Sheep, therefore, should never be bought unless they still have their wool on their backs, so that it may be easier to see that they are of one colour only, because, unless this is a prominent feature of the rams, the marks on the father generally persist in the offspring.</p>
<p>The points which are most highly esteemed in a<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> ram are breadth and height of stature, a belly which hangs down and is woolly, a very long tail, a thick fleece, a broad forehead, large testicles and curling hornsâ€”not because such a ram is more useful (for it is better without horns), but because horns do much less harm if they are curling than if they are up-standing and spreading. In some localities, however, where the climate is damp and windy, we should prefer that both he-goats and rams should have very large horns, because, being thus wide-spreading and lofty, they protect most of the head from the storm. So, if the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span> winter generally tends to be severe, we shall choose rams of this type; if it is milder, we shall prefer a ram which is hornless; for there is this disadvantage about a sheep with horns, that, being
