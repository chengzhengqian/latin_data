nor placed in position until evening comes, so that the bees may go forth quietly in the morning after a whole nightâ€™s rest, and we shall need to watch carefully for about three days to see whether they all sally forth in a body; for when they do this, they are meditating escape. We will presently prescribe what remedies we ought to apply to prevent this.</p>
<p>Bees which come to us by gift or by capture are<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span> accepted less scrupulously, although even in these circumstances I would not care to possess any but the best, since good and bad bees require the same expenditure and the same labour on the part of their keeper; also (and this is especially important) inferior bees should not be mixed with those of high quality, since they bring discredit upon them; for a smaller yield of honey rewards your efforts when the idler swarms take part in the gathering of it. Never-theless,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">6</span><span class="br"></span> since sometimes, owing to local conditions, an indifferent set of bees has to be procured (though never on any account should a bad one be acquired), we shall exercise care in seeking out swarms by the following method. Wherever there are suitable<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">7</span><span class="br"></span> woodlands where honey can be gathered, there is nothing that the bees would sooner do than make choice of springs near at hand for their use. It is a good plan, therefore, usually to frequent these springs from the second hour onwards and watch how many bees come to them for water. For if only a few are flying about (unless there are several sources of water which attract them and cause them to be more widely dispersed) we must conclude that there is a scarcity of them, which will make us suspect that the place will not produce much honey.
