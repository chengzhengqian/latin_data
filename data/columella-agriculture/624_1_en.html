Some people prepare old<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span> rain-water for this purpose and boil it down to a third of its original volume; then, when they have dried the grapes in the manner described above, they add the boiled-down water instead of wine and carry out the rest of the process in the same manner.

On the next day tread it and, when it is thus thoroughly mixed, put it under the press. Then put what has flowed out either into barrels or jars and, when it has fermented, close the vessels up. It is more convenient to keep it in wine-jars. Marcus Columella used to make this same after-wine with old water and frequently kept it without its spoiling for more than two years.</p>
