<p>It is enough to have discussed the duties of the ploughman up to this point. Our next step is to give directions also as to the seasons for breaking up ploughland.</p>
<p>IV. Rich plains which hold water for a considerable length of time are to be broken at a time of year when it is growing warm, after they have put forth all their vegetation and while the seeds of this vegetation have not yet ripened; but they should be ploughed with furrows so numerous and close together that it can hardly be told in what direction the ploughshare has been driven, for in this way all the roots of the growth are broken off and killed. But fallow<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> land<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_129_a" id="target_note_LCL361_129_a"><sup>a</sup></a> should be so pulverized by much re-ploughing that it will require no harrowing, or very little, after we have put in the seed. For the ancient Romans said that a field was poorly prepared when it had to be harrowed after the crop was in the ground. Furthermore, a farmer should examine it<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span>
frequently to see whether it is properly ploughedâ€”and
not merely by sight, which is sometimes mistaken when earth is scattered over unploughed skips that lie hidden, but also by touch, which is deceived the less when a strong and stiff pole is put to use and pushed into the furrows crosswise. If it goes in to a uniform depth and without striking anything, it is clear that all the ground has been stirred in turn; but if some harder spot obstructs its entrance, it shows that there is unbroken fallow. When ploughmen observe that this is done rather frequently, they are not guilty of leaving skips.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_129_b" id="target_note_LCL361_129_b"><sup>b</sup></a> Wet
