When they have grown up to this<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span>
height, their tops should be broken off, so that they may rather grow in thickness and strength than make a slender growth of useless length. However, we will leaf-prune this same stem, which we let grow into firm wood, up to three and one-half feet from the bottom, and will frequently pull off all the stock-shoots that sprout from it within this space. Anything that sprouts forth then<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span> above that point shall be left untouched. For it will be better that the upper part be cut away with the pruning-knife the following autumn than that superfluous shoots be removed in summer time, since from that spot from which you have taken the secondary shoot<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_369_aa" id="target_note_LCL361_369_aa"><sup>a</sup></a> it immediately puts forth a second; and when this has sprouted, there remains in the firm wood no eye to sprout and produce fruit the following year.</p>
