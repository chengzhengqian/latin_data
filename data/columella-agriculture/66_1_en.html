For either the point of the plough is rejected by the hardness of the ground or, if it does enter at some spot, it does not break the soil into fine particles, but tears up huge clods; and when these lie in the way, the plough-land is under a handicap and cannot be properly worked at the second ploughing, because the ploughshare is thrown out of the furrow by the weight of the clods as though by some deep-seated obstructions, with the result that hard skips are left even in the re-ploughing and that the oxen are severely injured by the unevenness of the strain. Added to this is that all ground, though it be never<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">7</span><span class="br"></span>
so rich, still has poorer soil underneath, and when the larger clods are turned up they bring this with them; the result being that the less productive soil, mixed with the richer, grows a less bountiful crop, and in addition the accounting of the farmer is made more difficult by the poor progress of his work; for the proper tasks cannot be completed when the ground is hard. For this reason my advice is, in dry<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">8</span><span class="br"></span>
weather, to replough ground already broken, and to wait for rain which, by its soaking of the earth, makes cultivation easy for us.
