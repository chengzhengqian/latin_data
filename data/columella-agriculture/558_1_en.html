to lay out in the autumn, in order that the clods of earth may be broken up by the winter cold or the summer heat, and the roots of the weeds may be killed; and we shall have to manure it not long in advance; but when the time for sowing approaches, the ground will have to be weeded and manured five days beforehand and so carefully dug up a second time that the earth mixes with the dung. The best dung<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">12</span><span class="br"></span> for the purpose is that of asses, because it grows the fewest weeds; next is that of either cattle or sheep, if it has soaked for a year. Human ordure, although it is reckoned to be most excellent, should not necessarily be employed except for bare gravel or very loose sand which has no strength, that is, when more powerful nourishment is required. We shall,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">13</span><span class="br"></span> therefore, after the autumn let the soil which we have decided to sow in the spring lie, when it has been dug up, so that it may be nipped by the cold and frosts of mid-winter; for by a contrary process like the heat of summer, so the violence of the cold refines the earth and breaks it up after causing it to ferment. Therefore, when mid-winter is past, the time has at last come when the dung is to be spread, and about January 13th the ground, having been dug over again, is divided into beds, which, however, should be so contrived that the hands of those who weed them can easily reach the middle of their breadth, so that those who are going after weeds may not be forced to tread on the seedlings, but rather may make their way along paths and weed first one and then the other half of the bed.</p>
