hopes of our catching swarms of them; and the following is the method of finding them. First we must try to discover how far away they are, and for this purpose liquid red-ochre must be prepared; then, after touching the backs of the bees with stalks smeared with this liquid as they are drinking at the spring, waiting in the same place you will be able more easily to recognize the bees when they return. If they are not slow in returning, you will know that they dwell in the neighbourhood; but if they are late in doing so, you will calculate the distance by the period of their delay. If you notice them returning<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">9</span><span class="br"></span> quickly, you will have no difficulty in following the course of their flight and will be led to where the swarm has its home. As regards those who apparently go farther away, a more ingenious plan will be adopted, as follows. The joint of a reed with the knots at either end is cut and a hole bored in the side of the rod thus formed, through which you should drop a little honey or boiled-down must. The rod is then placed near a spring. Then when a number of bees, attracted by the smell of the sweet liquid, have crept into it, the rod is taken away and the thumb placed on the hole and one bee only released at a time, which, when it has escaped, shows the line of its flight to the observer, and he, as long as he can keep up, follows it as it flies away. Then,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">10</span><span class="br"></span> when he can no longer see the bee, he lets out another, and if it seeks the same quarter of the heavens he persists in following his former tracks. Otherwise he opens the hole and allows them to
