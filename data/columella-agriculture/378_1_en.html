the udder, they may feed on stubble and the fruits also which fall from leguminous plants. This is the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span> practice in out-of-the-way regions where raising stock is the only thing which pays; for in districts near towns the sucking pig must be turned into money, for then its mother is saved trouble by not having to rear it and will more quickly conceive and produce another litter, and so bear twice in the same year. The males are castrated, so that they may be enabled to grow fat, either at six months, when they first begin to cover the sows, or else at three or four years of age, when they have been often used for breeding. An operation<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL407_293_a" id="target_note_LCL407_293_a"><sup>a</sup></a> is also performed with the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span> knife on the wombs of the females to make them suppurate and close up as a result of scarring over, so that they cannot breed. I do not know the reason for doing this, unless it is lack of food; for where there is abundance of fodder, it always pays to rear stock.</p>

For they find suitable pasture both in the mountains and in the plains, though it is better on marshy ground than on dry. The most convenient feeding-grounds are woods covered with oaks, cork-oaks, beeches, Turkey oaks, holm-oaks, wild olive trees, terebinth-trees,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL407_293_b" id="target_note_LCL407_293_b"><sup>b</sup></a> hazels, wild fruit-trees like the oxyacanth, carob-pods,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL407_293_c" id="target_note_LCL407_293_c"><sup>c</sup></a> junipers, nettle-trees, vine-tendrils, cornel-trees, strawberry-trees, plum-trees, Christ’s thorn, and wild pear-trees. For these ripen at different times and provide plenty of food for the herd almost all the year round.
