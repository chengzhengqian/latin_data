And there is no doubt that the nature of some<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">7</span><span class="br"></span> vines is such that in the quality of their wine they sometimes excel, sometimes are excelled, according to their situation. The Aminean varieties<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_237_a" id="target_note_LCL361_237_a"><sup>a</sup></a> alone, except where the climate is exceedingly cold, and even if they decline in quality in comparison with their best, are said to provide wines of more or less true taste and to surpass all other varieties in flavour. Though they bear one name, they are not of the same<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">8</span><span class="br"></span> appearance. We know of two “sister” vines, of which the smaller is earlier and better in casting its blossoms and may be trained to tree and trellis<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_237_b" id="target_note_LCL361_237_b"><sup>b</sup></a> alike. On the tree it requires rich ground; on the trellis, ordinary soil. And it far surpasses the larger variety by reason of its sturdier endurance of rain and wind. For the larger sort is quickly spoiled in<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">9</span><span class="br"></span>
the blossom, and more so on trellises than on trees; and on this account it is not suitable for vineyards, and hardly fit for an arbustum<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_237_c" id="target_note_LCL361_237_c"><sup>c</sup></a> except in ground that is very rich and vigorous; for it does not thrive in ordinary ground, and much less so in lean ground. It is distinguished by its great amount of rank woody growth and the large size of its leaves, clusters, and berries; it is also longer from joint to joint. In quantity of fruit it is surpassed by the smaller variety; it is not outdone in flavour. And both
