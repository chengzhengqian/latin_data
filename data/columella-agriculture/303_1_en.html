of equal weights of the crushed leaves of the lupine and of the cypress, which is mixed with water and left out of doors for a night. This should be done four times a year—at the end of the spring, of the summer, of the autumn and of the winter. Lassitude and nausea also can often be dispelled if<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> you force a whole raw hen’s egg down the animal’s throat when it has eaten nothing; then on the following day you should crush spikes of “Cyprian” or ordinary garlic in wine and pour it into its nostrils. Nor are these the only remedies which make for health. Many people mix also a generous quantity of salt with the fodder; some grate white hore-hound in oil and wine; some infuse fibres of leek, others grains of frankincense, others savin<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL407_143_a" id="target_note_LCL407_143_a"><sup>a</sup></a> and crushed rue in unmixed wine and give them these medicaments to drink. Many people use the stalks<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> of white-vine (bryony) and the shells of bitter-vetch as a medicine for oxen; some crush a snake’s skin and mix it with wine. Thyme crushed in sweet wine and squill cut up and soaked in water are also used as remedies. All the above-mentioned potions in doses of three <span class="italic">heminae</span> given daily for three days purge the bowel and renew the animal’s strength by driving away its maladies. But lees of olive-oil<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span> are regarded as particularly salutary if you mix them with an equal portion of water and accustom the cattle to them; this remedy cannot be administered all at once, but at first is sprinkled on the food, next a small portion is infused in the water, and then the animal is given as much as it can take mixed in equal portions of both ingredients.</p>
