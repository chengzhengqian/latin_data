The earliest sowing of common<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">33</span><span class="br"></span> millet and Italian millet is also made at this time and should be finished about April 13th.

<p>On April 12th the Hyades are hidden; the weather<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">35</span><span class="br"></span> is wintry. During these days in cold districts the first digging of the vineyards must be finished, at any rate before the 13th, and such operations as ought to have been performed in March when the equinox was over, ought now at last to be carried out as quickly as possible. It is still the right season for engrafting fig-trees and vines; and seed-nurseries, which have been made earlier, can still advantageously be weeded and dug up.
