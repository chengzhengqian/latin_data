they will easily outdo in the increase of their ancestral estates all those who hold fast to their hay and pot-herbs. And he is not mistaken in this; for, like a careful accountant, he sees, when his calculations are made, that this kind of husbandry is of the greatest advantage to his estate. For, admitting<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">8</span><span class="br"></span>
that vineyards demand a very generous outlay, still seven <span class="italic">iugera</span> require the labour of not more than one vinedresser, upon whom people in general set a low value, thinking that even some malefactor may be acquired from the auction-block;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_259_a" id="target_note_LCL361_259_a"><sup>a</sup></a> but I, disagreeing with the opinion of the majority, consider a high-priced vinedresser of first importance. And supposing his purchase price to be 6000 or, better, 8000 <span class="italic">sesterces,</span> when I estimate the seven <span class="italic">iugera</span> of ground as acquired for just as many thousands of <span class="italic">sesterces</span>,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_259_b" id="target_note_LCL361_259_b"><sup>b</sup></a> and that the vineyards with their dowry—that is, with stakes and withes—are set out for 2000 <span class="italic">sesterces</span> per <span class="italic">iugerum,</span> still the total cost, reckoned to the last farthing, amounts to 29,000 <span class="italic">sesterces.</span> Added to this is interest at six per cent, per annum,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">9</span><span class="br"></span>
