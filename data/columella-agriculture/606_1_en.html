<p>XX. Furthermore, boiled-down must, though carefully made, is, like wine, apt to go sour. This being so, let us be mindful to preserve our wine with boiled-down must of a year old, the soundness of which has been already tested; for the fruit which has been gathered in is corrupted by bad methods of preservation. The vessels themselves in which the thickened and boiled-down must is boiled should be of lead rather than of brass; for, in the boiling, brazen vessels<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> throw off copper-rust and spoil the flavour of the preservative. The odours boiled with the must which are generally speaking suitable for wine are iris, fenugreek and sweet-rush; a pound of each of them ought to be put in the boiling-cauldron, which has received ninety <span class="italic">amphorae</span> of must, when it has just gone off the boil and has been cleared of scum. Then if the must is naturally thin, when it has been boiled down to a third of its original quantity, the fire must be removed from below it and the furnace immediately cooled with water; even if we have done this, the boiled-down must nevertheless sinks to a level lower than the third of the vessel. But,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> although this is some disadvantage, it is nevertheless beneficial; for the more the must is boiled down,—provided it be not burnt—the better and the thicker it becomes. Of this boiled-down must, when it has been thus treated, it is enough if one <span class="italic">sextarius</span> is mixed with one <span class="italic">amphora</span> of wine. When you have boiled ninety <span class="italic">amphorae</span> of must in the boiling-cauldron to such an extent that only a little of the whole remains (which means that it has been boiled down to a third),
