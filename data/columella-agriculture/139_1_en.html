very few in number, to be sure, but so fruitful that on a trellis each of them yielded three <span class="italic">urnae,</span> while on pergolas they produced ten amphorae to each vine.

should not seem beyond belief. For how could Terentius Varro, and Marcus Cato before him, maintain that every <span class="italic">iugerum</span> of vineyard yielded the old-time husbandmen six hundred <span class="italic">urnae</span> of wine,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_279_a" id="target_note_LCL361_279_a"><sup>a</sup></a> if fruitfulness was wanting in the Amineansâ€”the only vines, for the most part, with which the ancients were acquainted? Unless, despite our belief up to this time that our most ancient vines are the Amineans, we are to suppose that they cultivated vineyards of the Bituric or Basilic varieties, vines which, being but recently indeed imported from far distant countries, have just come to our notice.
