<p>XXIII. Now, since we seem not to have said enough about the pruning of vineyards, we shall set forth with greater care that most necessary part of the work proposed. It is proper, if a gentle and temperate
mildness of climate permits it in that region which we are cultivating, to begin the pruning after the Ides of October,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_409_a" id="target_note_LCL361_409_a"><sup>a</sup></a>when the vintage is finished: on condition, however, that the equinoctial rains have come before and that the branches have arrived at their proper maturity; for dry weather makes the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span>

For any one of these that is neglected brings great loss to the owner. Moreover, when the vine is trained out into<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span>
