await the luck of the vintage with four varieties, or five at the most.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_339_a" id="target_note_LCL361_339_a"><sup>a</sup></a></p>
<p>As for the other point, which I had next proposed,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span>
I have no doubt that vines should be separated according to their species and set in their proper plots, and marked off by foot-paths and boundary lines;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_339_b" id="target_note_LCL361_339_b"><sup>b</sup></a> not that I myself have been able to obtain this of my household, or that any one of those before me accomplished it, however much he may have approved. For this is the most difficult of the farmerâ€™s tasks, because it requires the utmost care in the selection of plants, and in separating them there is need, for the most part, of the greatest good fortune combined with wisdom. But sometimes, as the divine author Plato says, the beauty of a thing attracts us to the pursuit even of those ends to which, because of the frailty of human nature, we cannot attain. And yet if our<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span>
years suffice, and if our knowledge and means are in accord with our desires, we shall accomplish the task without great difficulty; though we must persist for more than a brief portion of our lives, so that a large number may be classified over a period of several years. For not every period of time permits a decision in this matter, seeing that vines which cannot be distinguished because of their likeness in colour or stock or shoots or berry make themselves known by the ripening of their fruit and by their foliage. Nevertheless, I would not say that this care can be employed by anyone except the head of the family; for it is folly to intrust it to an overseer or vinedresser,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">6</span><span class="br"></span>
