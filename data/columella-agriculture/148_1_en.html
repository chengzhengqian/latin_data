period of observation, as we certainly have discovered, that a shoot which has borne four clusters, when it is cut off and put into the ground, degenerates so far from the fruitfulness of the parent stock as to produce sometimes one, occasionally even two clusters fewer than before, to what extent do we think that<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">20</span><span class="br"></span>
they will fall short which have produced two clusters or usually one on the parent stock, when even the most fruitful shoots often dread transplanting? And so I gladly profess myself a demonstrator of this method, rather than its inventor, lest anyone should think that our ancestors are unjustly deprived of the praise that is their due. For there is no doubt that they knew of it, even though it has been handed down in no writing except those lines of Vergil which we have quoted, and yet in such a way as to give directions for the seed of legumes.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_297_a" id="target_note_LCL361_297_a"><sup>a</sup></a> For why did they<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">21</span><span class="br"></span>
