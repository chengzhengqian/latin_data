reckon the quantity of berries added for the oil-making, you will find that there has not been a profit but a loss.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL408_323_a" id="target_note_LCL408_323_a"><sup>a</sup></a> Therefore, we ought not to hesitate to crush the olives, when they have been picked, at the first possible opportunity and put them under the press.</p>
<p>I know perfectly well too that oil for ordinary<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">21</span><span class="br"></span> eating has to be made. For when the olive drops from the tree because it has been eaten by small worms or has fallen down into the mud owing to storms or rain, immediate recourse is had to warm water and the cauldron should be heated up so that the dirty berries may be washed. This, however, ought not to be done with very hot but with moderately warm water, so that the taste of the oil may be more agreeable; for if the agreeable taste is boiled out, the heat draws out the flavour of the worms and the other impurities. When the olives have been washed, the rest of the process is as described above.</p>
<p>The superior oil and the ordinary eating-oil must<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">22</span><span class="br"></span> not be pressed in the same frails; for old frails ought to be fitted for the fallen olives but new ones for the first-class oil, and when the batches of olives have been pressed, the frails ought to be washed out immediately two or three times in very hot water; then, if there is running water at hand, they should be sunk in it by having heavy stones put on the top of them, so that they may be kept under water by the pressure of the weight; or if there is no stream, they should be soaked in a lake or pond of the purest possible water and afterwards beaten with rods that the dirt and lees may fall off them, and then they must be washed again, and finally dried.</p>
