from the vines when they were not too ripe, in dry flower of gypsum. Others, when they have picked a bunch, cut off with shears any defective grapes in it, and then hang it up in the granary where there is wheat stored below them. But this method causes the grapes to become shrivelled and almost as sweet as raisins.</p>
<p>Marcus Columella, my uncle, used to order broad<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span> vessels like dishes to be made of clay of which wine-jars
