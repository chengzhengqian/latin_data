little glory to have possessed yourself of a share. Who, therefore, you say, will teach the future bailiff, if there is no professor of the art? I, too, am aware that it is very difficult to attain to a knowledge of all the precepts of agriculture from, as it were, a single authority; nevertheless, though you will find scarcely anyone acquainted with the whole art, yet you will find very many masters of parts of it, with whose help you can form the perfect bailiff. For a good ploughman can be found and an excellent digger or mower, and likewise a forester and vinedresser, also a farrier and a good shepherd, no one of whom would refuse to impart to one desirous of learning them the principles of his art.</p>
<p>Therefore, when he who is to take up the duties of<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">13</span><span class="br"></span> a bailiff has been instructed in the arts of a number of different husbandmen, let him particularly avoid intimacy with members of the household and even much more with strangers. He should be most abstemious in respect of wine and sleep, both of which are quite incompatible with diligence; for as a drunkard loses his memory, so he becomes careless in his duties, and very many things escape the notice of one who is unduly given to sleep. For what can a man himself do or order someone else<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">14</span><span class="br"></span> to do, while he is asleep? Further, he should also have an aversion to sexual indulgence; for, if he gives himself up to it, he will not be able to think of anything else than the object of his affection; for his mind being effused by vices of this kind thinks that there is no reward more agreeable than the gratification of his lust and no punishment more heavy than the frustration of his desire.</p>
