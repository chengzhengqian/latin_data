Of these the berry of the Posia is the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span> most agreeable, that of the Royal the showiest, and both are more suitable for eating than for oil. The oil from the Posia has an excellent flavour as long as it is green, but it goes bad within a year. The Orchis also and the Shuttle-olive are better gathered for eating than for their oil. The Licinian produces the best oil, the Sergian the most abundant, and, generally speaking, all the bigger olives are more suitable for eating, the smaller for oil. No olive-<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span> trees of these kinds can stand a very warm or a very cold climate; and so in very hot regions the olive-tree rejoices in the north side of a hill, in cool districts in the south side; but it does not like either low-lying
or lofty situations but prefers moderate slopes such as we see in the Sabine territory in Italy and all over the province of Baetica.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL407_73_a" id="target_note_LCL407_73_a"><sup>a</sup></a> Most people think that this tree either cannot live or is not productive more than a hundred miles from the sea, but in some places it thrives well.

<p>The most suitable kind of ground for olive-trees is that which has gravel underneath, if chalk mixed with coarse sand forms the top-soil. Not less highly esteemed is ground where there is rich sand, but denser soil also is well adapted to receive this tree, if it is moist and fertile. Chalk must be wholly rejected, and even more land which abounds in springs and where ooze is always standing. Land which is lean because of sand is unfriendly to the olive-tree; so is
