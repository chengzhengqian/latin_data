be built so thick as to allow nesting-places for the hens to be cut out of them in a row, where either the eggs may be laid or the chickens hatched; for this is both healthier and neater than what some people do when they forcibly drive pegs into the walls and support wicker-work baskets on them. But in front of either<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span> the walls which have been hollowed, as we have described, or of the wicker-work basket, porches must be placed through which the breeding-hens may reach their nests for the purpose of either laying eggs or sitting on them; for they ought not to fly into the nests themselves, lest, as they leap into them, they break the eggs with their feet. Next a means of<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">6</span><span class="br"></span> ascent for the hens to the lofts across each of the cells is provided by attaching to the wall moderately sized planks which are roughened a little by having steps made on them, so that the hens may not find them slippery when they fly on to them. Similarly little ladders should be attached on the outside leading from the poultry-yard to the little windows mentioned above, by which the birds may creep in for their nightly repose. But we shall take particular care that these poultry-houses and those about which we shall be speaking presently, are made smooth, within and without, with plaster-work, so that no cat or snake may have access to the fowls and that equally hurtful pests may be kept away.</p>
<p>It is not expedient that the hen should rest on a<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">7</span><span class="br"></span> loftâ€™s floor when it is asleep, lest it be harmed by its own dung, because this, if it has adhered to its crooked feet, causes gout. That this calamity may be avoided, perches should be hewn square lest their rounded smoothness should fail to give the bird a good hold when it springs up. After being squared
