<p>XV. But when the vineyard, at the age of one year and six months, is brought to the vintage, it must be recruited to full strength<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_385_a" id="target_note_LCL361_385_a"><sup>a</sup></a> immediately after the fruit has been removed, and reserve cuttings which were planted for this purpose must be set in the gaps; or, if these also are wanting, a layer<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_385_b" id="target_note_LCL361_385_b"><sup>b</sup></a> must be led from a vine in the row to another stake. For it is of the utmost importance up to this time that every prop be clothed with a new planting, and that the vineyard shall not be in a state of replanting later, when it is time to be taking its fruits. There is one kind of layer where the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span>
vine is bent above ground close to its support, and so, being carried underground by a deep trench, is brought out beside a vacant stake; then from the “bow”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_385_c" id="target_note_LCL361_385_c"><sup>c</sup></a> it puts forth a vigorous shoot of firm wood, which is immediately
attached to its prop and brought up to the cross-bar. Then in the following year a cut is made<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span>

Next, when two years old, it is chopped off close to the branch which has been caused to spring up from the bow. And what is cut away and separated from the mother vine, immediately has the ground dug deep about it; then a small hole is made, and it is cut off at the very lowest point and covered with earth, so that it may drive its roots downwards and not sprout out near the top of the ground by being carelessly cut at the surface. Moreover, there is no time better<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span>
