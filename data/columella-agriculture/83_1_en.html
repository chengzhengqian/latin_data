To keep it from being destroyed by weevils—for they eat it even when it is in the pod—care must be taken that, as soon as it is threshed out, it be sunk in water, and that the sound grains be separated from the empty, which come at once to the surface; then that it be dried in the sun, sprinkled and rubbed with the bruised root of silphium<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_167_a" id="target_note_LCL361_167_a"><sup>a</sup></a> mixed with vinegar, and again dried in the sun; and presently, after cooling, that it be stored away—in the bin if the amount is rather large, or in olive jars and salt-fish jars if there is not much of it. If these are sealed with gypsum immediately upon being filled, we shall find the lentil sound whenever we take it out for use. Still, it can be kept satisfactorily without such treatment if mixed with ashes.</p>
