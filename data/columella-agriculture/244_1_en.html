201 and 21. These sums you will multiply together, 21 times 201, and you will get 4221. This, you will say, is the number of plants required.</p>
<p>Similarly, if you wish to set them seven feet apart,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span> you will take a seventh of the length and of the breadth and you will add the angular units, and by the same method and the same arrangement you will make up the number of the plants. In a word, however<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span> many feet you have decided for the distance between the plants, you will take the total length and the total breadth and add the units mentioned above. This being so, it follows that the <span class="italic">iugerum</span> of land, which is 240 feet long and 120 feet broad, if the distance between the plants is three feet (and this we consider to be the smallest distance which should be left when planting vines), will accommodate 81 plants in its length, and in its breadth, with a distance of five feet between them, it will hold 25 plants. These numbers when multiplied together make 2025.</p>
<p>If the vineyard is arranged with intervals of four<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">6</span><span class="br"></span> feet each way, the row which runs lengthways will contain 61 plants, and the row which runs breadthways 31 plants; this gives 1891 vines to a <span class="italic">iugerum.</span> If the vineyard be laid out so that there are intervals of four feet lengthways and five feet breadthways, the row which runs lengthways will have 61 plants and that which runs breadthways 25 plants. If the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">7</span><span class="br"></span> planting is carried out with intervals of five feet, the row will contain 49 plants lengthways and 25 breadthways; the two numbers multiplied together make 1225. If, however, you have decided to lay out the same area
