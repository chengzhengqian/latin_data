list which I have begun of the other branches of agriculture. Therefore from March 1st to 23rd<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">26</span><span class="br"></span> is an excellent time for pruning vines, provided, however, that there is not any movement yet in the buds. Now also is above all the time for choosing with advantage scions which are not yet shooting, and it is the very best moment for engrafting vines and trees. Also in cold and damp localities it is the principal time for planting vines, and it is also the time when the tops of fig-trees, which are already beginning to swell, can be set most advantageously. It is an excellent time also for hoeing the cornfields a second time; one labourer can very well hoe in a day land in which three modii of seed have been sown. It is now seasonable to cleanse the meadows and<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">27</span><span class="br"></span> prevent the cattle from entering them; indeed in warm, dry districts this ought to be done, as we have said above, from the month of January onwards; for in cold places the meadows may well be allowed to go to grass only from the Quinquatria.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL408_85_a" id="target_note_LCL408_85_a"><sup>a</sup></a> It is the time<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">28</span><span class="br"></span> when planting-holes of every kind will have to be made for the trees which you are going to plant in the autumn; if the ground is suitable, one man in a day can make fourteen of them measuring four feet each way or eighteen measuring three feet each way. But for planting vines or trees of no great growth a furrow a hundred and twenty feet long and two feet broad ought to be sunk to a depth of two feet and a half, and this task a labourer similarly carries out in a day. Now is the time to have finished digging and<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">29</span><span class="br"></span> preparing your late rose bed. It will also be advantageous to pour oil-lees, which have no salt in them,
