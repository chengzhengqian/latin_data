well-manured, fennels and brambles planted in alternate rows, and then, when the equinox is past, to cut them a little below the surface of the ground and, after loosening with a wooden prong the pith of the bramble or fennel, to put dung into them and thus insert the cucumber-seeds, so that, as they grow, they may unite with the brambles and fennels, for by this method, they are nourished not from their own roots but from what may be called the mother-root; and the stock thus engrafted yields the fruit of the cucumber even in cold weather. The season observed for the second sowing is about the time of the festival of the Quinquatria.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL408_163_a" id="target_note_LCL408_163_a"><sup>a</sup></a></p>
<p>The caper-plant in most provinces grows of its own<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">54</span><span class="br"></span> accord on fallow land; but in places where it is scarce, if it has to be sown, it will require dry ground. And so it will have to be surrounded beforehand by a small ditch, which should be filled with stones and lime or Carthaginian clay, so as to form a kind of breast-work, so that the bushes which grow from the aforesaid seed may not break their way out; for they usually<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">55</span><span class="br"></span> wander over the whole ground, unless there is some barrier to prevent them. This is not so much an inconvenience in itself, for they can be rooted out from time to time, as that they contain a harmful poison and with their juice make the soil barren. The caper is content with very slight cultivation or none at all; for it thrives even in deserted fields without any effort on the part of the husbandman. It is sown at the time of the two equinoxes.</p>
<p>An onion-bed requires soil that has been frequently<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">56</span><span class="br"></span> broken up rather than turned over to any depth. Therefore from November 1st onwards the ground ought to be cut up, so that it may crumble with the cold
