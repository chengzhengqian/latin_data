called the <span class="italic">sinus</span> or “bend”; that which runs on from the curve is the <span class="italic">scalprum</span> or “paring-edge”; the hook which comes next is called the <span class="italic">rostrum</span> or “beak,” and the figure of the half-moon above it is called the <span class="italic">securis</span> or “hatchet”; and the spike-like part which projects straight forward from it is called the <span class="italic">mucro</span> or “point.” Each of these parts performs its own peculiar tasks, if only the vine-dressev is skilful in using them. For when he is to cut something<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span>
with a thrust of the hand away from him, he uses the <span class="italic">culter</span>; when he is to draw it toward him, he uses the sinus; when he wishes to smoothe something, he uses the <span class="italic">scalprum,</span> or, to hollow it out, the <span class="italic">rostrum</span>; when he is to cut something with a blow, he uses the <span class="italic">securis</span>; and when he wants to clear away something in a narrow place, he makes use of the <span class="italic">mucro.</span> But the greater part of the work in a vineyard must be done by drawing the knife toward you rather than by hacking; for the wound which is made in this way is smoothed with one impression, since the pruner first puts the knife in place and so cuts off what he has intended to cut. One who attacks the vine by<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span>
chopping, if he misses his aim, as often happens, wounds the stock with many blows. Therefore that pruning is safer and more advantageous which, as I have said, is accomplished by the drawing of the knife and not by striking.</p>
