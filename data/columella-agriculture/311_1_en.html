This same blood, unless it is drawn off, will give rise to a bruise, and, if this suppurates, it will take a long time to heal. First a cut must be made round it with a knife and it must be cleaned, then it is brought to a healthy condition by having rags pressed against it soaked in vinegar, salt and oil, and afterwards by treatment with stale axle-grease

If the blood is in the lower part of the hoof, the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> extremity of the hoof itself is cut to the quick and the blood thus discharged, and the foot is wrapped in bandages and protected with a “slipper” of broom. It is not advisable to open the middle of the hoof from below, unless suppuration has already taken place in that part. If the lameness is due to pain in the sinews, the knees, the ham and the legs should be rubbed with oil and salt until it is cured.</p>
