<p class="noindent">Further, if a red grain, when cut in two, shows the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">13</span><span class="br"></span>
same colour throughout, we have no doubt that it is sound; but one that is whitish outside and is also seen to be white inside, that should be set down as light and lacking in substance. And let us not be misled into thinking that <span class="italic">siligo</span> is desirable for farmers; for this is a degenerate kind of wheat, and though superior in whiteness, it is inferior in weight. It does well, however, in a humid climate, and for that reason is better suited to springy places. Still we need not go a great distance or to great pains to find it; for in wet ground every kind of wheat turns into <span class="italic">siligo</span> after the third sowing.</p>

It is sown in loose, dry ground, either very rich or poor, because it is agreed that land is weakened by crops of it; for this reason it is committed to a very fertile field, whose excessive strength cannot be impaired, or to a lean one to which nothing else is entrusted. The seed should be cast at the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">15</span><span class="br"></span>
