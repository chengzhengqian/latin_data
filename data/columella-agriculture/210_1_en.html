frosts and shaded from the sun. Secondly, that the cut shall not be made like an arrow-point but hoofshaped<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_421_a" id="target_note_LCL361_421_a"><sup>a</sup></a>
rather; for the former dies more quickly and over a wider area, while the latter is checked more slowly and within narrower limits. There is also a practice which I observe to be employed, and very wrongly, which should be especially avoided; for in their attention to graceful appearance, so that the reserve stub may be shorter and like a thumb, they cut the branch close to the joint. But this is<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">16</span><span class="br"></span>
very detrimental, because the bud, being placed next to the wound, suffers from frost and cold, and afterwards from heat also. The best plan, then, is to clip the subsidiary branch about midway between the joints and to make a sloping cut behind the bud, so that, as I have already said,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_421_b" id="target_note_LCL361_421_b"><sup>b</sup></a> its tears may not drop upon the budding eye and blind it. If there is<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">17</span><span class="br"></span>
no opportunity for a cut branch, we must look about for a knob which, even though cut very close in the manner of a wart, may put forth a firm wood branch the following spring, which we may leave either for an arm or for fruit. If such a knob is not to be found, the vine must be wounded with the knife and caused to form a “sore” in that place where we wish to draw out a shoot.</p>
<p>Now I strongly believe that those branches which we are making ready for bearing should be freed of tendrils and secondary shoots. But one method<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">18</span><span class="br"></span>
is employed in cutting these away, and another in removing those that come out of the main stem. For
