And for this reason, if it is necessary that the knife be applied to stems that have already hardened, the cut must be made at a little distance from the mother vine, and spur-like ends<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_371_a" id="target_note_LCL361_371_a"><sup>a</sup></a> must be left to take upon themselves the injury of the heat up to the place where the shoots sprout from her side; for the heat’s energy creeps no farther.
