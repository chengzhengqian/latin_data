full moon itself, you scatter on the same day all the beans which you intend to sow; afterwards you may cover them up with earth as a protection against birds and cattle, and, if the course of the moon shall fall suitably, have them harrowed before November 13th in ground which is fresh and as rich as possible and, if not, in soil as well manured as possible. It will be<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">86</span><span class="br"></span> enough to cart eighteen loads of dung to each <span class="italic">iugerum.</span> Now one load of dung consists of eighty <span class="italic">modii,</span> from which it can be inferred that you ought to scatter five <span class="italic">modii</span> of dung over an area measuring ten feet each way. This calculation shows us that one thousand four hundred and forty <span class="italic">modii</span> are enough for a whole <span class="italic">iugerum.</span> At this time it is also proper to dig round the olive-trees and, if they are not fruitful 87 enough, or if the foliage on their tops is shrivelled up, you ought to sprinkle four <span class="italic">modii</span> of goat’s dung around each big tree and observe the same proportion for the others according to their size. At the same time, after the vineyards have been dug up, you ought to pour what amounts to one <span class="italic">sextarius</span> of pigeon’s dung on each vine, or a <span class="italic">congius</span> of human urine or four <span class="italic">sextarii</span> of some other kind of dung. Two labourers in one day dig up a <span class="italic">iugerum</span> of vines planted six feet apart.</p>
<p>November 13th is an uncertain day: it is oftener<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">88</span><span class="br"></span> calm than not. On November 16th the Lyre rises in the morning: the wind is South, though sometimes it is strong North-east. On November 17th the wind is from the North-east, sometimes from the South accompanied by rain. On November 18th the Sun makes its entry into Sagittarius: the Hyades rise in the morning: a storm is portended. On November 20th the horns of the Bull set in the evening: there is a cold North-east wind and rain. On November<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">89</span><span class="br"></span>
