month after July 15th, at which time some people carry out the “emplastration” of other trees also. In some places, for instance in Baetica in the coastal<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">60</span><span class="br"></span> regions and in Africa, the vintage is finished; but in the colder districts they carry out the pulverization of the soil, which the farmers call harrowing, when all the clods in the vineyards are broken up and reduced to powder. In the same period, before the vineyards are pulverized, if the soil is very thin or the vine itself scanty, three or four <span class="italic">modii</span> of lupine-seed are scattered on each <span class="italic">iugerum</span> and then harrowed in; these when they have sprouted, having then been turned under with the first digging, provide the vines with quite good manure. Many people also, if the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">61</span><span class="br"></span> climatic conditions are rainy, as in the district of Italy near the capital, strip the vines of their tendrils, so that the fruit may be able to ripen and not be rotted by the rain. But in warmer places, on the contrary, as in the provinces named just now, about the time of the vintage the grapes are shaded either with straw or some other covering, so that they may not be dried up by the winds or the heat. This is<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">62</span><span class="br"></span> also the season for making raisins and dried figs; how they are to be dried, we will describe in the proper place, when we treat of the duties of the bailiff’s wife.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL408_105_a" id="target_note_LCL408_105_a"><sup>a</sup></a> It is also right to uproot ferns and sedge, wherever they grow, during the month of August; it had better, however, be done about July 15th before the rising of the Dogstar.</p>
