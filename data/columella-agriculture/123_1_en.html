of the tree than at the lower part. It produces much wood and many clusters. For those Greekling vines—such as the Mareotic, the Thasian, the Psithian, and the Sophortian—though they have an agreeable taste, still in our localities they yield little juice because of the looseness of the bunches and the small size of the berries. Nevertheless the black Inerticulan, which certain Greeks call <span class="italic">amethystos</span>,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_247_a" id="target_note_LCL361_247_a"><sup>a</sup></a> may be placed in the second tribe, so to speak, because it makes good wine and is harmless; from this fact, too, it takes its name, because it is considered inactive (<span class="italic">iners</span>) in its effect on the sinews, although not dull in taste.</p>
<p>Celsus makes a third class of those vines which<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">25</span><span class="br"></span> are commended for fruitfulness alone, such as the three Helvenacans,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_247_b" id="target_note_LCL361_247_b"><sup>b</sup></a> of which the two larger are considered by no means equal to the smaller in the quality and quantity of their must.

The<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">26</span><span class="br"></span>
smallest and best of the three is very readily recognized by its leaf, for it bears the roundest leaf of all of them; and it is praiseworthy because it endures drought best of all, because it bears cold
