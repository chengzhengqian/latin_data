where there is very little moisture the plants are best put out in the olive-grove during the autumn, but, where the soil is rich and damp, in the spring just before they come into bud. Four-foot plant-holes<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">7</span><span class="br"></span> are prepared for them a year earlier, or, if there is not an abundance of time before the trees are planted, let straw and twigs be thrown in and the plant-holes burnt, so that the fire may make them friable, as the sun and frost ought to have done. On ground which is rich and fit for growing corn the space between the rows ought to be sixty feet in one direction and forty in the other: if the soil is poor and not suitable for crops, twenty-five feet. But it is proper that the rows should be aligned towards the west, that they may be cooled by the summer-breeze blowing through them.</p>

Next let a space of one foot be left round the little tree in a circle and then let the plant be pulled up with its own turf, and that this turf may not be broken up in the process of removal, you must weave together moderate-sized twigs taken from rods and apply them to the lump of earth which is being removed and so bind it with
