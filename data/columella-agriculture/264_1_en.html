has some bud left, it should not be entirely removed, since in the following year it will produce an even stronger firm-wood branch from a single bud. Shoots<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">33</span><span class="br"></span> are called “precipitated” which, sprung from rods one year old, are tied to the hard wood. These bear fruit very freely but do much damage to the mother-vine; and so a shoot ought not to be “precipitated” except from the ends of the branches or if the vine has surmounted the top of the tree. If, however, anyone<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">34</span><span class="br"></span> wishes to let this kind of stem grow freely for the sake of the fruit, let him twist the shoot, and then tie it in that position and bend it over; for it will put forth flourishing firm-wood behind the point at which you have twisted it, and also, when it is bent over, it will attract less strength to itself, even though it bears an abundance of fruit. A shoot which has been bent over ought not to be allowed to continue so for more than one year.</p>
<p>Another kind of shoot which grows from a young<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">35</span><span class="br"></span> vine and hangs down tied to the tender part of the vine, we call firm-wood; it produces a good crop both of fruit and of new sprouts, and if two rods are allowed to grow from one head, both, nevertheless, are called firm-wood; for I have pointed out above what strength the leaf-bearing shoot possesses. The
“throat-shoot”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL407_65_a" id="target_note_LCL407_65_a"><sup>a</sup></a> is that which grows out of the middle between two branches, as it were in a fork. This I have found to be the worst kind of shoot, because it does not bear fruit and it weakens both of the branches between which it has grown. It must, therefore, be removed.</p>
<p>Most people have believed that a strong, luxuriant<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">36</span><span class="br"></span> vine becomes more fertile, if it is loaded with many shoots which are allowed to grow, but they are
