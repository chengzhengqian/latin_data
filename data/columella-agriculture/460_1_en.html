Then, when it has been cut off at both ends, it is covered with a clean garment (for this too is very important), and if there are any gaping holes,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL407_457_a" id="target_note_LCL407_457_a"><sup>a</sup></a> they are daubed over, and it is carried to the place where the bees are kept, and, small holes being left in it, as I have said, it is put in position like the rest of the hives.
