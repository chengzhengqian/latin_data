The root of the starwort, the bushy part of which is yellow and its flower purple, has the best effect of all; it is boiled with old Aminean wine and pressed and then the juice is strained and given as a remedy. Hyginus indeed, in the book which he wrote about bees, says: “Aristomachus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL407_477_b" id="target_note_LCL407_477_b"><sup>b</sup></a> is of opinion that help ought to be brought to bees which are sick in the following manner: first, all the diseased combs should be removed and entirely fresh food placed for the bees, and then they should be fumigated.” He<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">9</span><span class="br"></span> thinks also that it is beneficial to add a new swarm to the bees who are wasted by old age, although there is a danger that they may be destroyed by sedition, nevertheless they are likely to rejoice because their number is increased.
