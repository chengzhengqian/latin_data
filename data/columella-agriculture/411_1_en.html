Very clean chaff should be spread under them or soft hay, that is, hay of the second crop; for if their bed is hard they do not easily fatten. All the feathers should be cleared away from their heads and under their wings and hind-quarters, from the head and wings so that they may not breed lice, and from their hind-quarters so that sores may not be caused by dung in the private parts.</p>

The latter is the common precaution taken by fatteners of birds: but those who wish to make the birds not only plump but also tender, sprinkle meal of the kind already mentioned with fresh honey-water and then cram them with it. Some people mix one part of good wine with three parts of water and fatten the bird with wheaten-bread soaked in it. If the process of cramming is begun at the new moon (for this date too should be observed), the fowl is quite fat by the twentieth day: but, if it takes a dislike to its food, you will have to<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span> lessen the amount for the same number of days as the cramming has already proceeded, but only provided
