<p>Dig a trench measuring four feet each way at such a distance from an olive-tree that the ends of the branches can reach it. Then plant a small fig-tree in the trench, and be careful that it grows strong and healthy. After two years, when it has made enough<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">14</span><span class="br"></span> growth, bend down the branch of the olive-tree which seems to be the healthiest and bind it to the stock of the fig-tree. Then lop off the rest of the branches and leave only the tops which you wish to engraft; then cut through the trunk of the fig-tree and smooth off the wound and split it in the middle with a wedge. Then pare the tops of the olive-tree,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">15</span><span class="br"></span> still adhering to the mother-tree, on both sides, and then insert<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL407_111_a" id="target_note_LCL407_111_a"><sup>a</sup></a> them in the cleft in the fig-tree, and take away the wedge and carefully tie the little branches so that no force may tear them away. Then after an interval of three years the fig-tree will coalesce with the olive-tree, and finally, in the fourth year, when they have become properly united, you will cut off the little olive branches from the mother-tree, just as if they were layers. This is the way in which you will graft any kind of scion on any kind of tree. But before we make an end of this book, since in the earlier books we treat of almost every kind of small tree, I regard it as a brief and opportune task to give instructions about the shrub-trefoil.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL407_111_b" id="target_note_LCL407_111_b"><sup>b</sup></a></p>
