them enclosed for about three days, leaving only small breathing-holes, until they are accustomed to live together. There are some people who prefer<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> to get rid of a king-bee that is old, but this is harmful; for the crowd of older bees, who form a kind of senate, do not think fit to obey the juniors and, through obstinately despising the orders of those who are stronger than themselves, are visited with punishment and death. The trouble, indeed, which usually<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> befalls a younger swarm, when the king of the old bees whom we have left in power has failed through old age and wild discord arises through lack of control (just as happens in a family when its head dies), can easily be met. For one leader is chosen from those hives which have several chiefs and is transferred to those which have no one to govern them, and set up as ruler.</p>
<p>In those quarters which are afflicted by some pestilence the lack of bees can be remedied with less trouble; for when the disaster to the crowded hive<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span> is recognized, you must examine any combs which it contains. You must then next cut away, from the wax which holds the seeds, that part in which the offspring of the kingly race comes to life. It is easy to see this, since almost at the very end of the wax there appears as it were the nipple of a breast projecting somewhat and with a wider cavity than the rest of the holes, in which the young bees of the common kind are enclosed. Celsus indeed declares that there are<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span> transverse cavities in the outermost combs which contain the royal progeny. Hyginus, too, following the authority of the Greeks, says that the ruler is not formed, like the rest of the bees, from a small worm, but that, on the circumference of the combs, straight holes are to be found somewhat larger than those
