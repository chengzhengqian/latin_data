taken down to the press and be enclosed, while still whole, in new frails and put under the presses to be squeezed for the shortest possible time. Next, when their skins have been opened and softened, after the addition of two <span class="italic">sextarii</span> of natural salt to each <span class="italic">modius,</span> the pulp will have to be squeezed out either with the disks of the press,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL408_315_a" id="target_note_LCL408_315_a"><sup>a</sup></a> if it is the custom of the locality, or at any rate in new frails. Then immediately the man who is using the ladle must empty out what first has flowed into the round pan, for that is better than a square leaden vessel or a built-up receiver with two divisions in it, and pour it into the earthenware tubs prepared for this purpose.</p>
<p>In the oil-cellar there should be three rows of pans,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">11</span><span class="br"></span> one to hold oil of the first quality, that is of the first pressing, another of the second and a third of the third; for it is very important not to mix the second pressing, much less the third with the first pressing, because the first pressing has a far better flavour, because it has flowed from a less violent use of the press as though it had not been treated.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL408_315_b" id="target_note_LCL408_315_b"><sup>b</sup></a> Then when the oil has stood for a very short time in the first<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL408_315_c" id="target_note_LCL408_315_c"><sup>c</sup></a> pans, the man who holds the ladle will have to strain, it into the second and then into the next until he comes to the last; for the more often it is aerated by being transferred from one pan to another and, as it were, kept moving, the more transparent it becomes and the freer from dregs. It will be enough for<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">12</span><span class="br"></span> thirty pans to be placed in each row, unless the olive-groves are extensive and require a larger number.</p>
