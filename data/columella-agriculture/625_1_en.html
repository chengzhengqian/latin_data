will store the must in a flagon and immediately seal it up with plaster and order it to be placed in a loft. If you wish to make more, you will add honey in the proportion mentioned above. After thirty-one

<span class="marginNote right">How to make fruit syrup.</span> called “fruit-syrup” is made as follows. An <span class="italic">urna</span> of must made from Aminean grapes grown on trees is boiled in a new earthenware or tin cooking-pot with twenty large quinces which have been well cleaned and are sound, sweet pomegranates, which are called Carthaginian apples, and service-apples which are not very soft and have been split and had their seeds removed, a quantity weighing about three <span class="italic">sextarii</span>. These are boiled so that all the fruit dissolves<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> in the must, and there should be a boy to stir the fruit with a wooden slice or a reed, so that it cannot burn. Then when they have been boiled down so that not much juice remains, they are allowed to cool and are strained, and what is left at the bottom of the strainer is carefully crushed and pulverized and then boiled again a second time in its own juice upon a slow charcoal fire, so that it may not burn, until a thick sediment, resembling lees, is formed. But before the preparation is removed from the fire,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> three <span class="italic">heminae</span> of Syrian rosemary, crushed and sifted, are added on the top of all and mixed in with a spatula, so that it may unite with the other ingredients. Then, when the preparation has cooled, it is put into a new earthenware vessel treated with pitch, and this is then plastered over and hung up high so that it may not acquire a pale colour.</p>
