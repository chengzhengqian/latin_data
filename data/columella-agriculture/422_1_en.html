For usually peahens, having come to seek rest at night, lay their eggs while they are roosting on the perches, which have already been described, and when the eggs have fallen from a lesser height and more softly, they keep their soundness unimpaired. Every day, therefore, during the period of laying you will have to go carefully round the peacock-houses in the early morning and collect the eggs which are lying about, and the fresher they are when they are set under the hen, the better are the prospects of a good hatch, and that this should be done is very much to the householder’s advantage.
