Care must also be taken that each kind is stored<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">6</span><span class="br"></span> separately in its own chest; for when different kinds are shut up together, they disagree with one another and more quickly deteriorate. It is for this reason too that the wine from vineyards in which different kinds of vines are planted does not keep so well as when you have stored unmixed Aminean or Apian bee-wine<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL408_291_b" id="target_note_LCL408_291_b"><sup>b</sup></a> or even faecinian<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL408_291_c" id="target_note_LCL408_291_c"><sup>c</sup></a> wine by themselves. But, as I have said above, when the apples have been carefully arranged, they should be covered with the lids of the chests and these should be smeared with clay mixed with chaff, so that the air cannot enter. Furthermore, these very apples some people keep, as we have already mentioned above in speaking of other kinds, by putting poplar- or fir-tree-sawdust between them; but these apples should be picked when they are not ripe but still very bitter.</p>

Then cook them slightly in a brass pot in vinegar so that the slices may not be half raw. After this they should be dried for three days in the shade and then stored in a jar treated
