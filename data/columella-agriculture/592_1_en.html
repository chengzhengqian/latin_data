Next, after an interval of two days, again let out the whey and block up the hole and add as much pounded salt as shall suffice, and mix the whole together. Then put the cover on the vessel and seal it up, and do not open the vessel until the contents are required for use.</p>

Some people mix the young leaves of dittander in a vessel with sweet milk and, after the third day, draw off the whey as we have directed; they then find some green savory and also some dry seeds of coriander, dill, thyme and parsley well pounded into a mass and add them to it and mix in some salt which has been well roasted and sifted. The rest of the operations are the same as in the above recipe.</p>
