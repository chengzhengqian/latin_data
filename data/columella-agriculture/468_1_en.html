<span class="marginNote right">Remedies for the diseases of bees.</span> those which are suffering from disease or pestilence, The ruinous disease of ‘pestilence’ is rare in bees, nor can I find anything which ought to be done other than what we have prescribed in the case of the other animals (except that the hives should be moved far away); but the causes of common ailments<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL407_473_a" id="target_note_LCL407_473_a"><sup>a</sup></a> in bees are more easily diagnosed and remedies found for them.
