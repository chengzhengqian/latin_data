people when dealing with “staked” vines, especially those of the Helvenacan<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL407_41_a" id="target_note_LCL407_41_a"><sup>a</sup></a> kind, bury the sprawling shoots, as though they were layers, under the surface of the soil, and then again erect them on reeds and let them grow for fruit-bearing. These our husbandmen call <span class="italic">mergi</span> (“divers”), while the Gauls call them <span class="italic">candosocci</span> (“layers”), and they bury them for the simple reason that they think that the earth provides more nourishment for the fruit-bearing whips; and so after the vintage they cut them off as useless shoots and remove them from the stem. Our advice, however, is that these same rods, when they have been cut away from the mother-vine, should be planted as quick-sets in any vacant spaces in the rows where vines have died or in a new vineyard which anyone wants to establish; for indeed the parts of the shoots which had been buried have enough roots to take hold immediately if they are put into plant-holes.</p>
<p>There still remains the cultivation of the procumbent<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">17</span><span class="br"></span> vine; but this should not be undertaken except where the climate is very boisterous; for it presents a difficult task for the husbandmen and it never produces wine of a generous flavour. Where local conditions admit of this form of cultivation only, a hammer-shoot is put into plant-holes two feet deep. When it has budded, it is reduced to one firm-wood branch; this in the first year is confined to two “eyes.” Then in the following year, when it has put forth a profusion of shoots, one is allowed to grow and the rest are struck off. The shoot which has been allowed to grow, when it has produced fruit, is pruned back to
