and a light lowered to the bottom of it, the moths rush together from all sides and, flitting round the flame, are scorched because they cannot easily fly upwards from the narrow space or retire to a distance from the fire, since they are hemmed in by the brazen sides of the vessel. They are, therefore, consumed by the burning heat which is near them.</p>
<p>About fifty days from the rising of the Dog-star<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">10</span><span class="br"></span> is the rising of Arcturus, at which time the bees make their honey from the dew-drenched flowers of thyme and marjoram and savory. Honey of the finest quality is at its best at the autumn equinox, which falls before the first of October, when the sun reaches the eighth degree of Libra. But great care will have to be exercised between the rising of the Dog-star and that of Arcturus that the bees are not surprised by violent attacks from hornets, which generally lie in wait in front of the hives for them to come out. After the rising of Arcturus about the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">11</span><span class="br"></span> time of the equinox, which takes place when the sun is in the Balance (as I have said), the second extraction of honey-combs takes place. Then from the equinox, which occurs about September 24th, until the setting of the Pleiads, a period of forty days, the bees store up the honey which they have collected for winter food from the tamarisk flowers and woodland shrubs. Of this nothing at all must be extracted, lest the bees, disheartened by continual ill-treatment and, as it were, in despair, should take to flight. From the setting of the Pleiads till the winter solstice,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">12</span><span class="br"></span> which falls about December 23rd in the eighth degree of Capricorn, the bees make use of the honey already stored up and are sustained by it until the rising of Arcturus. I am well acquainted with the reckoning
