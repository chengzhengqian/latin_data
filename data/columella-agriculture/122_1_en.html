They have a greater fondness for the trellis than for trees, though the Argitis is productive even on high supports and makes a luxuriant growth of wood and grape clusters.

Visula, better suited to very low frames, makes little wood but tough and broad leaves, whose size affords the fruit very good protection against hail; but if this is not gathered as soon as it is ripe, it falls to the ground; and in wet weather it rots even before it falls off. There are also the Helvolans,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_245_c" id="target_note_LCL361_245_c"><sup>c</sup></a> which<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">23</span><span class="br"></span>
some call <span class="italic">variae</span> (variegated); they are neither purple nor black, and get their name, if I mistake not, from their dun (<span class="italic">helvus</span>) shade. The one which is more nearly black is the better as to quantity of wine, while the other is more highly prized in the matter of flavour. In neither of them does the colour of the berries appear to be uniform. Both yield white must in greater or smaller quantity every year They make a better covering on a tree, though doing well on a trellis. They are productive also in mediocre soil, as are the smaller and larger Pretians.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_245_c" id="target_note_LCL361_245_c"><sup>c</sup></a> But the latter are commended more highly for the quality of their wine, and they put forth much wood and foliage and ripen quickly.
