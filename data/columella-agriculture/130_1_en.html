vineyards are of the very worst sort, still, if taken care of, they will yield certainly one <span class="italic">culleus</span> of wine to the <span class="italic">iugerum</span>; and even though every forty urns are sold for 300 <span class="italic">sesterces</span>, which is the lowest market price, nevertheless seven <span class="italic">cullei</span> make a total of 2100 <span class="italic">sesterces</span>â€”a sum far in excess of the interest at six per cent. And these figures, as we have given<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">11</span><span class="br"></span>
them, take account of the calculations of Graecinus. But our own opinion is that vineyards which yield less than three <span class="italic">cullei</span> to the <span class="italic">iugerum</span> should be rooted out. And, even so, we have made our calculations up to this point as if there were no quicksets<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_261_a" id="target_note_LCL361_261_a"><sup>a</sup></a> to be taken from the trenched ground; though this item alone, at a favourable price, would clear the entire cost of the land, if only the land belongs, not to the provinces, but to Italy. And no one should be<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">12</span><span class="br"></span>
skeptical of this statement when he distinguishes between my method and that of Julius Atticus; for I am now planting between the rows 20,000 mallet-shoots<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_261_b" id="target_note_LCL361_261_b"><sup>b</sup></a> to every <span class="italic">iugerum</span> of vineyard, while he sets out four thousand fewer.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_261_c" id="target_note_LCL361_261_c"><sup>c</sup></a> Assuming that his way is the better one, still no ground, even the most unfavourable, will fail to yield a return exceeding the expense incurred; since, even though<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">13</span><span class="br"></span>
6000 of the plants die through the carelessness of the vinedresser, still the remaining 10,000 will be purchased by contract-vineyardists, cheerfully and at a profit, for 3000 <span class="italic">sesterces.</span> This sum exceeds by one third the 2000 <span class="italic">sesterces</span> which we have named above as the cost of planting one <span class="italic">iugerum</span> of vines, and yet our own management has now progressed to the point where husbandmen are not
