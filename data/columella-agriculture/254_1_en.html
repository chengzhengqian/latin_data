In what manner and of what kind of trees it must be formed, I shall have no objection to stating forthwith.</p>
<p>It is generally agreed that there are two kinds of<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> elms, the Gallic and the native; the former is called the Atinian,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL407_45_a" id="target_note_LCL407_45_a"><sup>a</sup></a> the latter our own Italian. Tremellius Scrofa<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL407_45_b" id="target_note_LCL407_45_b"><sup>b</sup></a> was wrong when he expressed the opinion that the Atinian elm does not bear <span class="italic">samera</span>, which is the seed of that tree; it certainly produces it but rather thinly and for that reason most people think that it is actually barren, since the seeds are hidden among the foliage which it produces at its first budding. That is why no one now grows it from seed<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> but by means of shoots. This elm is much more luxuriant and taller than ours and produces foliage which is more acceptable to oxen; when you have fed cattle on it constantly and then begin to give them foliage of the other kind, you will cause them to feel a loathing for the latter. Therefore, if possible,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span> we shall plant a whole field with the Atinian kind of elm only, or, failing that, we shall take care, in arranging the rows, to plant native and Atinian elms to the same number alternately. In this way we shall always have a mixture of foliage for use and the cattle, attracted by this kind of seasoning for their food, will finish off with greater heartiness the full ration allotted to them.</p>
<p>But the poplar seems to sustain the vine best of all trees, then the elm, and after it the ash. The<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span> poplar tree, because it provides foliage which is scanty and unsuitable for cattle, has been rejected by most people; the ash, because it is most acceptable to goats and sheep and of some use for oxen, is rightly planted in rough and mountainous places in which the
