laid them; for it is said that a goose does not hatch anotherâ€™s eggs unless she has some of her own also beneath her. Goose eggs, like those of peahens, are put under ordinary hens, the maximum numbers being five and the minimum three, whereas a minimum of seven and a maximum of fifteen are put under the geese themselves. But care must be<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">7</span><span class="br"></span> taken, when stalks of nettle (which are used as a remedy to cure disease) are placed under the eggs, that they may not possibly hurt the goslings when they are hatched; for nettles kill them if they sting them when they are quite young. Thirty days are required for the forming and hatching of the goslings when the weather is cold; for when it is warm, twenty-five days are enough, but more often the gosling is hatched on the thirtieth day. While it is<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">8</span><span class="br"></span> quite small, for the first ten days it is shut up with its mother in the pen and fed there; afterwards, when calm weather allows, it is taken out into the meadows and to the ponds. Care must be taken that it is not stung by the prickles of the nettle or sent out hungry to pasture, but that it has had its fill beforehand of chopped chicory or lettuce leaves; for if it is still not very strong and arrives hungry at the pasture-ground, it struggles so persistently with shrubs or the tougher plants that it breaks its neck. It is also well to provide it with millet or even wheat mixed with water. When it has become a little stronger, it is driven out to join a flock of birds of its own age and fed on barley, the provision of which for laying geese also is not without advantage. It is not<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">9</span><span class="br"></span> expedient to assign more than twenty goslings to each goose-pen, nor, again, must they be shut up at all with birds older than themselves, since the stronger
