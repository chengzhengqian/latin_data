others use it instead of boiled-down must for preserving olives, for which purpose I regard it as more suitable, because it has a flavour which goes well with food; it cannot be used as a remedy instead of honey-water for those who are sick, because, if it be drunk, it causes inflation of the stomach and intestines.
