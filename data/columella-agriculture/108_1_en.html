that the grain may grow larger on the floor<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_217_a" id="target_note_LCL361_217_a"><sup>a</sup></a> and in the stack rather than in the field. For it is an established fact that, if cut at the proper time, it makes some growth afterwards. There are, furthermore,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span>
several methods of reaping: many cut the straw in the middle with cradle-scythes, and these either bill-shaped or toothed; many gather the heads only with forks, and others with combs<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_217_ba" id="target_note_LCL361_217_ba"><sup>b</sup></a>â€”an operation which is very easy in a thin crop, but very difficult in a thick one.</p>
<p>But if the grain, with a part of the straw, is cut with sickles, it is at once gathered into a pile or carried into the shed,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_217_c" id="target_note_LCL361_217_c"><sup>c</sup></a> and then after repeated drying in the sun, as opportunity offers, it is threshed.

however, the heads only are cut off they may be carried into the granary and then, during the winter, be beaten out with flails or trodden out by cattle. But if it is convenient to have the grain threshed on the floor, there is no doubt that this work is better done with horses than with oxen; and if you have few teams you may hitch to them a threshing-sledge and a drag, either of which very easily breaks up the straw. It is better, however, that the heads themselves be beaten with flails and winnowed with fans. But when the grain is mixed with the chaff it is cleaned<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span>
