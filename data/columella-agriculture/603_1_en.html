press, and during the vintage neither the wine-press nor the wine-cellar must ever be deserted so as to ensure that those who are making the new wine may do everything in a pure and clean manner and that no opportunity may be offered to a thief to carry off part of the fruit.</p>
<p>The barrels too and the jars and the other vessels<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span> should be treated with pitch forty days before the vintage, a different process being applied to those which are sunk into the earth and those which stand above ground. For those which are sunk into the earth are heated with burning iron torches, and when the pitch has dripped down into the bottom of the vessel, the torch is removed, and what has dripped to the bottom or stuck to the sides is spread with a wooden ladle and a curved iron scraper. The vessel is then wiped with a brush, and very hot pitch having been poured in, is covered with pitch by means of another new ladle and with a small broom. But vessels which<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">6</span><span class="br"></span> stand above ground are put out in the sun for several days before they are treated; then, when they have been sufficiently exposed to the sun, they are turned with their openings downwards and raised from the ground by the placing of three small stones underneath them; then a fire is placed underneath and allowed to burn until so strong a heat reaches the bottom that a hand placed there cannot endure it. Then the vessel is let down on to the ground and laid on its side, and very hot pitch is poured into it and it is rolled round and round that every part of it is coated with pitch. This operation, however, ought<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">7</span><span class="br"></span> to be carried out on a day which is quiet and windless, so that the vessels may not burst because the fire has been applied to them in a blowing wind.
