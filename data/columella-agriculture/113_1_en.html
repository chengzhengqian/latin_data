<h3><span class="ac">Book III</span></h3>
<p>I. “Thus far of the tillage of the land,” as says that most excellent poet.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_227_a" id="target_note_LCL361_227_a"><sup>a</sup></a> For, Publius Silvinus, as we are about to speak on the same topics, there is nothing to keep us from beginning under good omens with the opening words of that most renowned poem. There follows the management of trees, which is a most important part of rural husbandry. They are diverse in kind, and of many shapes; for trees of various sorts, as the same author relates,</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line indent7">of their own will come forth,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">By mortals not constrained;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_227_b" id="target_note_LCL361_227_b"><sup>b</sup></a></span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">and many, too, grow from seed planted by our own hand.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_227_c" id="target_note_LCL361_227_c"><sup>c</sup></a> But those that are propagated without<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span>
human aid, the wild and untamed, bear fruits or seeds according to their several natures; while those on which labour is spent are fitted for a greater yield.</p>
<p>I must speak first, then, of that kind which supplies us with food. And of this there is a threefold division: for from a small shoot there comes forth either a tree, as the olive; or a shrub, as the palm of the plains; or a third something which we can properly call neither tree nor shrub, as is the vine.
