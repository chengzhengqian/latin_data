another. Finally then they are taken indoors and the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> sour or defective grapes are cut off with shears; and, when they have cooled off a little in the shade, three or even four bunches, according to the capacity of the vessels, are let down into each pot and the lids are carefully closed up with pitch so that they may not let any moisture pass in. Then a foot of grape-skins well squeezed in the wine-press is emptied out and, after the stalks have been pretty well separated and the mass of the skins broken up, it is spread on the bottom of a barrel and the pots are arranged inside it with their mouths downwards at such a distance from one another that the grape-skins can be trodden between them; and when these have been carefully<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> pressed together and have formed a first layer, other pots are arranged similarly and complete a second layer. Then in like manner more pots are piled up in the barrels and are closely trodden in. Next the grape-skins are packed in right up to the brim and immediately the cover is put on the top and the barrel is sealed with ashes mixed like plaster. The would-be purchaser, however, will have to be warned not to buy pots which absorb moisture or are badly baked; for both those defects spoil the grapes by letting in the moisture. Moreover, when the pots are brought out for use, whole layers will have to be moved together; for closely packed grape-skins, once they are moved, quickly turn sour and spoil the grapes.</p>
