the Greeks call σνζυγίαι ἐναντιοτήτων, and which we may fairly render “the couplings of opposites.” Furthermore, it must be pointed out that, of all things which the earth brings forth, more thrive better on a plain than on a hill, and more in fat land than in lean. As to dry ground and wet ground,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span> we have not ascertained which of these excels in number, since there are, in each case, almost limitless things which thrive in dry places, and the same in wet areas; but of this number there is nothing that does not grow better in loose soil than in dense. This, too, our own Vergil said when, after recounting the other good points of a fruitful field, he added:</p>
<blockquote><p>

<p class="noindent">For cultivation is nothing else than the loosening and breaking up of the ground; and on this account a<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span> field which is both rich and mellow yields the greatest returns, because in producing most it demands least, and what it does require is supplied with trifling labour and expense. Such a soil may therefore with justice be called the very best. Next in order to this is the combination of rich and dense, a soil which rewards the expense and toil of the husbandman with rich increase. Third in rank is a well-watered place,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">6</span><span class="br"></span> because it can produce fruits without expense. Cato, who rated the yield of meadow lands far ahead of other returns, used to say that this kind of land was first;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_111_b" id="target_note_LCL361_111_b"><sup>b</sup></a> but we are now speaking of land under cultivation, not of that left untilled.
