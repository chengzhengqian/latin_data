Worst<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> of all is swamp-water, which creeps along with sluggish flow; and water that always remains stagnant in a swamp is laden with death. But this same water, harmful though its nature is, is purified by the rains of the winter season and loses its virulence; from this fact water from the heavens is known to be most healthful, as it even washes away the pollution of poisonous water, and we have stated that this is most approved for drinking.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_61_a" id="target_note_LCL361_61_a"><sup>a</sup></a> On<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span> the other hand, bubbling brooks contribute greatly to the alleviation of summer heat and to the attractiveness of places; and, if local conditions will allow, I think that they, by all means, should be conducted into the villa, regardless of the quality of the water if only it is sweet.</p>
