For the poppy and the dill the conditions of sowing are the same as for the chervil and orach. The seeds of garden asparagus<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">43</span><span class="br"></span> and what the country folk call <span class="italic">corruda</span> (wild asparagus) take almost two years to prepare.
