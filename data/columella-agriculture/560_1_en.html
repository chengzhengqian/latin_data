passably well transplanted about May 15th. After this, when the summer is coming on, nothing ought to be put in the ground except parsley-seed, and this only if you intend to water it; for then it comes on very well during the summer. In August about the time of the feast of Vulcan<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL408_141_a" id="target_note_LCL408_141_a"><sup>a</sup></a> comes the third sowing time; it is the best time for sowing radish and turnips, also navew, skirwort and alexanders.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL408_141_b" id="target_note_LCL408_141_b"><sup>b</sup></a></p>

This<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">21</span><span class="br"></span> ridge is like the “balk” which farmers make when they are sowing their fields, that they may avoid dampness. This must be constructed on a smaller scale in gardens, and along the top of it, that is, on the back of the ridge, cloves of African or ordinary garlic (for the latter is planted in the same manner as the former) must be set at the distance of a hand’s breadth from one another.
