merely on this point, in that they allowed the first year’s foliage of plants to go untouched, but also after two years, when the quickset was to be cut back, they lopped off all the upper part right down to the ground, close to the very joint, so that it might make new growth from the hard wood. But experience, the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span>
master of arts, has taught us to regulate the growth of first-year cuttings and not to allow a vine to run wild with a rank growth of useless leafage; and, on the other hand, not to hold it back to the extent that the ancients directed, to the point of lopping off all the upper part. In fact, this method is most harmful;<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span>
in the first place because, when you cut to the ground, most plants die, being visited, as it were, by an unbearable
wound; while some of them also, which have a more stubborn hold on life, produce less fruitful wood—seeing that, by the admission of everyone, shoots which sprout from the hard wood are very often destitute of fruit.

But the present, or first, year does not yet require a strong prop or stake; for it has been my observation that, for the most part, a young vine is better satisfied with a support of moderate size than with a stout prop. And so we shall attach each young
