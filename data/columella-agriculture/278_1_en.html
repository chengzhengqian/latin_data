convey water through them to the roots. Set trees and seedlings with roots in autumn, that is, about October 15th, but plant cuttings and branches in<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">9</span><span class="br"></span> the early spring before the trees begin to bud; and, in order that the caterpillar may not damage fig-tree seedlings, put in the bottom of the trench a slip from a mastic-tree with its top inverted.</p>
<p>Do not plant a fig-tree in cold weather. It likes sunny positions, where there are pebbles and gravel, and sometimes also rocky places. This kind of tree quickly gains strength if you make your trenches roomy and wide.

In cold places and where the autumn season is wet, you should plant those whose fruits ripen early, so that you may gather the fruit before the rain comes; but plant winter figs in warm places. If, on the other hand, you wish to make a fig-tree bear late fruit, which it does not naturally do, shake down the unripe or early fruit, and it will then produce another crop which it will defer to the winter. Sometimes too, when the trees begin to bear leaves, it is beneficial to cut off the extreme tops of the fig-tree with a knife; the trees are then sturdier and more prolific. It will be always a good plan, as soon as the fig-tree begins to put forth leaves, to dissolve ruddle in lees of olive-oil and pour it together with human ordure over the roots.
