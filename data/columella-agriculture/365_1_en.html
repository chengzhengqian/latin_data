fodder causes emaciation, and emaciation causes the scab. This disease can be diagnosed in the following<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">6</span><span class="br"></span> way when it begins to creep in: the sheep either gnaw the part affected, or strike it with horn or hoof, or rub it against a tree or wipe it upon the walls. When you see any sheep acting in these ways, it will be best to take hold of the animal and draw its wool apart, for there is a rough skin underneath it and a kind of crust. This must be treated at the first possible opportunity, lest it infect the whole flock, since, while other cattle are readily attacked by contagious disease, sheep are particularly so.
