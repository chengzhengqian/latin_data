that begotten by a male ass, though up to a certain point the progeny of a wild ass can be compared to it, except that, being both difficult to train and rebellious against servitude, it exhibits the wild character and lean condition of its sire. A stallion, therefore, of this kind is more useful for the production of descendants in the second than in the first generation; for, when the offspring of a she-ass and a wild ass is put to a mare, the ferocity of the wild animal has been broken down, and any offspring of this union reproduces the form and mild temper of its sire and the strength and quickness of its grandsire.
The progeny conceived and procreated from<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span> a horse and an ass, though they have derived their name of “hinny” from their sire,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL407_219_a" id="target_note_LCL407_219_a"><sup>a</sup></a> show in every respect a greater resemblance to their dam; it is, therefore, most advantageous to choose a donkey as sire for a race of mules whose appearance, as I have said, is proved by experience to be handsomer.
