answer to their own name.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_243_a" id="target_note_LCL361_243_a"><sup>a</sup></a> The same is true of the Allobrogian<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_243_b" id="target_note_LCL361_243_b"><sup>b</sup></a> vines: the agreeableness of their wines is affected by a change of region. The three<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">17</span><span class="br"></span> Apian<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_243_c" id="target_note_LCL361_243_c"><sup>c</sup></a> also are recommended for their great qualities; all of them fruitful and quite suitable for the trellis and for trees, though the one with bare leaves is superior. For the two lanate varieties, though of like appearance as to leaves and branches, differ in the quality of their juice, as one of them is slower in acquiring flatness of taste from long keeping. They are very prolific in rich ground,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">18</span><span class="br"></span>
and fruitful also in average soil; their fruit ripens early, and for that reason they are very well suited for cold localities; they yield a sweet wine, but are not good for the head, sinews, and veins. If they are not gathered at the proper time they become the prey of rains, winds, and bees; and it is because of this plundering that they are surnamed from the word meaning “bees” (<span class="italic">apes</span>). And these are the vines most renowned for their precious flavours.</p>
<p>There are, nevertheless, vines of second quality<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">19</span><span class="br"></span> which can be commended for their growth and fruitfulness, such as the Bituric<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_243_d" id="target_note_LCL361_243_d"><sup>d</sup></a> and the Basilic, the smaller of which the Spaniards call <span class="italic">coccolobis</span>,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_243_e" id="target_note_LCL361_243_e"><sup>e</sup></a>—both of them by far the closest to the very best; for their wine stands long keeping and attains some degree of excellence with age. And in fact they<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">20</span><span class="br"></span>
surpass in productiveness all that I have mentioned above, and also in hardiness; for they withstand storms and rain with the greatest fortitude, they have a good amount of juice, and do not fail in lean ground. They endure cold better than wetness, and wetness better than dryness, and yet they are
