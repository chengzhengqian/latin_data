dilatory farmer, for often, while we are waiting, a raging storm surprises us. Therefore the threshed grain should be heaped on the threshing-floor in such a way that it can be winnowed with any gentle wind. But if the air is quiet in every quarter for many days, the grain should be cleaned with winnowing-fans, for fear that after excessive stillness of the winds a mighty storm may bring to naught the toil of an entire year. Then the pure grain, if it is being laid away for a<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">6</span><span class="br"></span>
term of years, should be threshed again, for the better it is scoured the less it is preyed upon by weevils; but if it is intended for immediate use, there is no need of a second cleaning and it is sufficient that it be cooled in the shade and so carried to the granary. The handling of legumes, too, differs not at all from that of other grains, for they also are either consumed at once or stored away. And this is the crowning reward of the husbandman—reaping the harvest of the seed that he has entrusted to the earth.</p>

<span class="line">No sacred law forbids to fetch the irrigating rills,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">A hedge along the field to stretch, for birds a<span class="linebreak"></span>
snare to lay,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">And briars to burn, and bleating flocks to dip in<span class="linebreak"></span> wholesome stream.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_219_b" id="target_note_LCL361_219_b"><sup>b</sup></a></span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
