chickens. For it is by attention to these points and management that the business of poultry-keeping which the Greeks call ὀρνιθοτροφία (bird-rearing),<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL407_327_a" id="target_note_LCL407_327_a"><sup>a</sup></a> is carried out.</p>
<p>Two hundred head are the limit which should be<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">7</span><span class="br"></span> acquired fully to employ the care of one person to feed them, provided, however, that an industrious old woman or a boy be set to watch over the fowls which go astray, so that they may not be carried off by the wiles of men or of animals which lie in wait for them. Further only the most prolific fowls should be bought. They should have red or darkish plumage and black wings; and, if this is possible, they should be chosen of the latter colour all over and of the nearest colour to it. Failing these colours, white hens should be avoided; for, while they are delicate and not very long-lived, it is also not easy to find white fowls which are prolific: also, being conspicuous owing to their remarkably light colour they are rather often carried off by hawks and eagles. Let<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">8</span><span class="br"></span> your brood-hens, therefore, be of a red colour, squarebuilt,
big-breasted, with large heads, straight, red crests, white ears; they should be the largest obtainable which present this appearance and should not have an even number of claws. Those are reckoned the best-bred which have five toesb but without any cross-spurs projecting from their legs; for a hen which has this masculine characteristic is refractory and disdains to admit the male to intercourse and is rarely prolific, and, when she does sit, breaks the eggs with the sharp points of her spurs.</p>
