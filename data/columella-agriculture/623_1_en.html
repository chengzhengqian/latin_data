Fix in the ground forks or stakes four feet apart for supporting reeds and yoke them together with poles, then put reeds on the top of them and spread out the grapes in the sun, covering them at night so that the dew may not fall on them. Then when they have dried, pluck the berries and throw them into a barrel or wine-jar and add the best possible must thereto so that the grapes are submerged.
