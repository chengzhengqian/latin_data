promptly cleaned and washed out once and again with lye, which should not be very hot, lest they should lose their wax, and then they should be gently rubbed with the hands in tepid water and rinsed out several times and all the moisture dried<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">15</span><span class="br"></span> out with a sponge. Some people dissolve potterâ€™s clay to form a kind of liquid sediment and, after they have washed the vessels, daub them inside with this soup-like preparation and let it dry; afterwards, when they require them for use, they wash them out with pure water. Some people wash the vessels thoroughly first with lees, then with water, and dry them; they then examine the jars to see if they require fresh wax; for the ancients declared that they ought to be waxed about every sixth oil-making. I do not understand how this can be done; for, while<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">16</span><span class="br"></span> new vessels, if they are heated, readily admit the wax, yet I cannot believe that old vessels, being saturated with oil-juice, can bear the application of wax. However, this very process of waxing has been abandoned by the husbandmen of our own day and they have come to the opinion that it is enough to wash new jars thoroughly with liquid gum and, when they are dry, to fumigate them from below with white wax, that they may not take on a pallid colour or an evil odour. In their opinion this fumigation ought always to be carried out whenever new or old vessels are being treated and prepared for new oil. Many people, when once they have daubed their new<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">17</span><span class="br"></span> jars and barrels with thick gum, are satisfied forever with one gumming, and certainly a vessel which has once absorbed oil does not admit of a second gumming; for the fatty nature of the oil rejects such matter as gum.</p>
