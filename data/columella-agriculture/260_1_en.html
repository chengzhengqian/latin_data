elm, two vines a foot apart should be put into the trench, and care should be taken that they are not planted when the north winds are blowing, nor when the vines are wet with dew, but when they are dry.</p>
<p>This rule I lay down not only when vines are being<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">20</span><span class="br"></span> planted but also elms and the other trees; also, that, when they are removed from the nursery-bed, one side should be marked with ruddle to warn us not to plant trees in any position other than that in which they stood in the nursery-bed; for it is very important that they should face that quarter of the sky to which they have been accustomed from their early days. In sunny positions, however, when the climate is neither very cold nor too rainy, both trees and vines are better planted in the autumn after the equinox. They should be planted on the principle of putting<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">21</span><span class="br"></span> beneath them to a depth of half a foot top-soil which has been broken by the plough and uncoiling all the roots and covering the plants when they are set with dunged soil, which I consider the best course, or, if not, at least with broken soil, and treading round the actual stem of the plant. The vines should be set at the edge of the trench and their firm-wood branches stretched along the trench and then erected into the tree and protected by railings from damage by cattle. In very hot localities the plants should be attached<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">22</span><span class="br"></span> to the tree on the north side, in cold places to the south side, in a temperate climate either on the east or on the west side, so that they may not have to endure the sun or the shade all day.</p>
