slowly, it should have a small piece of earthenware placed in its centre, when it has grown to some extent; for being checked by having to support, as it were, the weight of this, it spreads out in breadth. The same method is used also for the endive, except that it stands the winter better, and therefore can be sown even in cold districts in the early autumn.</p>
<p>We shall do better to plant out slips of cardoon<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">28</span><span class="br"></span> during the autumn equinox and sow the seed more advantageously about March 1st and set the plants before November 1st and manure them with plenty of ashes; for this kind of manure seems the most suitable for this vegetable. Mustard and coriander<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">29</span><span class="br"></span> and also rocket and basil are left undisturbed as they were sown and require no other cultivation than manuring and weeding. They can be sown not only in autumn but also in spring. Mustard plants transplanted in the early winter produce more sprouts in the spring. All-heal is planted very thinly at both seasons in light and well-worked soil so as to make greater growth; but the spring is the better season for it. If you wish to grow leeks, the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">30</span><span class="br"></span> ancients directed that it should be sown rather thickly and left to grow and that then, when it increased, it should be cut; but experience has taught us that it does much better if you space it out, and set it in the same way as the headed leek, with moderate spaces between the plants, that is to say, intervals of four inches, and cut it when it has grown up. As for the leek which you wish to form a large<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">31</span><span class="br"></span> head, you must take care that, before you transplant it and re-set it, you cut off all the small roots and shear off the tops of the fibres; then small pieces of earthenware or shells are buried beneath each of the seedlings
