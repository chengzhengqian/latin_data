to the navew and the turnip, as both of them are filling food for country people. The turnips, however, are more profitable, because they yield a greater increase and serve as food, not only for mankind, but also for cattle, especially in Gaul, where this vegetable provides winter fodder for the aforesaid animals. Both require a loamy, loose soil, and do not grow in heavy ground. Turnips, however, like level and<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">23</span><span class="br"></span>
moist places, while the navew prefers ground that is sloping and dry with more of a tendency to leanness; and so it grows better in gravelly and sandy lands. The nature of the situation changes the seed of both: thus, turnips sown in one soil are changed into navews in two years’ time, while in the other the navew likewise takes on the appearance of the turnip.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_171_b" id="target_note_LCL361_171_b"><sup>b</sup></a> In well-watered
