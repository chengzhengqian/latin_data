from the more costly foods, is reduced to an ordinary fare. The cultivation, therefore, of gardens, since<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> their produce is now in greater demand, calls for more careful instruction from us than our forefathers have handed down; and I should be adding it in prose to my earlier books, as I had intended to do, had not your repeated appeals overruled my resolve and charged me to complete in poetic numbers those parts of the <span class="italic">Georgics</span> which were omitted by Vergil and which, as he himself had intimated,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL408_5_a" id="target_note_LCL408_5_a"><sup>a</sup></a> he left to be dealt with by later writers. For indeed I ought not to have ventured on the task,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL408_5_b" id="target_note_LCL408_5_b"><sup>b</sup></a> were it not in compliance with the wish of that greatly revered poet, at whose instigation, which almost seemed a divine<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span> summons—tardily, no doubt, owing to the difficulty of the task, but all the same not without hope of a prosperous result—I have undertaken to deal with material which is very meagre and almost devoid of substance and so inconsiderable that in my work taken as a whole it can only be accounted as a small fraction of my task, and taken by itself and confined within its own limits it cannot by any means make much of a show. For, although there are many branches of the subject, so to speak, about which we can find something to say, they are, nevertheless, as unimportant as the imperceptible grains of sand out of which, according to the Greek saying, it is impossible to make a rope.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL408_5_c" id="target_note_LCL408_5_c"><sup>c</sup></a> Whatever, therefore,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span> has resulted from burning the midnight oil, is so far from claiming for itself any special commendation as to be satisfied if it brings no disgrace on my previously published writings. But enough by way of preface.</p>
