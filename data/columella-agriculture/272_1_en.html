Before it is placed in the ground, you will have to dig up the soil in the plant-hole with hoes; then you should put in soil which has been broken up with the plough, provided that the top-soil shall be rather rich, and strew it with seeds underneath;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL407_81_a" id="target_note_LCL407_81_a"><sup>a</sup></a> and, if there is any water standing in the plant-holes, it should all be drained away before the trees are put in. Next minute stones or gravel mixed with rich soil must be thrown in and, after seeds have been put in, the sides of the plant-hole must be pared away all round and some manure put in among them. If, however, it is not convenient to remove the plant<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">10</span><span class="br"></span> with its own earth, it is best to strip the stem of all its leaves and, after smoothing its wounds and daubing them with mud and ashes, place it in the plant-hole or furrow.
