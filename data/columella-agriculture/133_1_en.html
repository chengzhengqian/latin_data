young plants at the proper time in lean ground, they will be conscious of no great change when transferred from mediocre to poor soil; or if a more fertile field is to be planted, they gain strength far more quickly in the rich ground. On the other hand,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span>
it is not at all consistent with reason to make a nursery of vines in the very poorest ground, since the majority of the slips die, and such as do survive are slow in becoming fit for transplanting. A piece of average and moderately dry ground, then, is best suited for the nursery; and it should first be worked with the trenching-spade,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_267_aa" id="target_note_LCL361_267_aa"><sup>a</sup></a> which equals the depth of the trenching when the ground is turned up to two and one-half feet. Then, leaving three-foot spaces for the cultivation of the plants, 600 cuttings are to be set in each of the rows which measure 240 feet. This number makes a total of 24,000 plants to the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span>

But the choice must be made with two considerations in mind; for it is not enough merely that the mother vine from which the cuttings are sought should be prolific, but a more discriminating method must be employed, that they may be taken from those parts of her body which are both generative and especially fruitful. Moreover, the prolific vine<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span>
