vine either to two old reeds, lest new ones strike root; or, if local conditions allow it, to brier canes, to which single cross-bars may be tied along one side of the row—a kind of frame which farmers call a <span class="italic">canterius</span><span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span>
or “horse.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_381_a" id="target_note_LCL361_381_a"><sup>a</sup></a> It is of the greatest importance
that this be such that the young vine-shoot, as it creeps forth, shall immediately grasp it a little below the point of its bending and spread out on the crossbars
rather than on the uprights, and so, resting upon the “horse,” may more easily bear up against the winds. And it is proper that this frame should be raised up to less than four feet, until the vine becomes strong.</p>

And if the vine is set close to the stake, as has pleased some authorities, the man who ties it will have to guard against the notion that, in fastening the firm wood, he must follow the curve in the stake if it happens to be bent, for that makes a crooked vine; or, if space is left between the vines and the stake, as has seemed best to Atticus and some other husbandmen and is not displeasing to me, a straight reed must be joined to the stock, and so by numerous bindings the vine is to be guided up to the frame. What sort of bands they are with which the plants are tied, is of the greatest
importance. For while the vine is young, it must<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span>
be tied with the very softest kind; because, if you bind with withes of willow or elm, the growing vine cuts itself. The best, then, is broom, or the rush that is cut in marshy places, or sedge; and yet the leaves
