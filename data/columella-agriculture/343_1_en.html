badly-bred, ordinary donkey is brought to seek her compliance; he should not, however, be allowed to cover her, but if the mare is inclined to submit to his desires, the more ignoble donkey is promptly driven away and the mare is covered by the valuable stallion. A special place is constructed for these purposes—10 the countryfolk call it a “machine”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL407_223_a" id="target_note_LCL407_223_a"><sup>a</sup></a>—it consists of two lateral walls built into gently-rising ground, having a narrow space between them, so that the mare cannot struggle or turn away from the donkey when he tries to mount her. There is an entrance at each end, that on the lower level being provided with cross-bars, to which the mare is fastened with a halter and stands with her forefeet at the bottom of the slope, so that, leaning forward she may the better receive the insemination of the donkey and make it easier for a quadruped smaller than herself to mount upon her back from the higher ground. When the mare has given birth to a foal of which the donkey is the sire, she rears it during the following year without being with foal again. This method is better than that which some people follow, who cause her to be covered again by the stallion and to be with foal, although she has only just foaled. When a she-mule<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">11</span><span class="br"></span> is a year old, it is right to take it away from its dam and put it to feed far away in the mountains or in wild places, so that it may harden its hoofs and presently be fit for long journeys. Now the male is better than the female mule for carrying a pack-saddle, whereas the latter is more nimble; but both sexes step out well on a journey and are useful for breaking up the soil, unless the price of the animal is too burdensome an expense for the farmer, or a soil, being of heavy sod, demands the strength of oxen.</p>
