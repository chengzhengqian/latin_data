<p>On June 13th the heat begins. On June 19th the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">49</span><span class="br"></span> sun makes its entrance into the Crab: a storm is portended. On June 21st Serpentarius, which the Greeks call ὀφιοῦχος, sets in the morning; a storm is portended. On June 24th, 25th and 26th is the solstice: there is a West wind and it is hot. On June 29th there is windy weather.</p>
<p>On these days the same tasks should be performed<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">50</span><span class="br"></span> as I mentioned above; but you must also cut tare<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL408_99_a" id="target_note_LCL408_99_a"><sup>a</sup></a> for fodder before its pods become hard, reap barley, pull up the late beans, crush ripe beans and store up their pods carefully, thresh the barley and store up all the chaff. You should clean out the beehives, which ought to be examined and attended to at times every ninth or tenth day from May 1st. If the honey-combs are full and sealed up, they should now be harvested, but, if they are for the most part empty and left open and unsealed, it is a sign that they are not yet ripe, and so the gathering of the honey must be postponed. In the overseas provinces some people sow sesame in this or the following month.</p>
<p>On July 1st the wind is West or South-west: the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">51</span><span class="br"></span> weather is hot. On July 4th the Crown sets in the morning. On July 6th the middle of Cancer (the Crab) sets: the weather is hot. On July 8th the middle of Capricorn sets. On July 9th Cepheus rises in the evening: a storm is portended. On July 10th the Harbinger Winds begin to blow.</p>
<p>During these days the tasks mentioned above<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">52</span><span class="br"></span> must be carried on; but it is also a very good thing at this time to break up for the second time fallow land which has already been broken up once, and woodland can most advantageously be cleared of stumps while the moon is waning.</p>
