<p class="noindent">This precept, which a most learned man has expressed<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">9</span><span class="br"></span> in verse, is, in my opinion, a heritage from antiquity, inasmuch as it is agreed that the Carthaginians, a very shrewd people, had the saying that the farm should be weaker than the farmer; for, as he must wrestle with it, if the land prove the stronger, the master is crushed. And there is no doubt that an extensive field, not properly cultivated, brings in a smaller return than a little one tilled with exceeding care.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_49_b" id="target_note_LCL361_49_b"><sup>b</sup></a> For this reason those seven <span class="italic">iugera</span> of<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">10</span><span class="br"></span> Licinius,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_49_ca" id="target_note_LCL361_49_ca"><sup>c</sup></a> which the tribune of the plebs distributed to each man after the expulsion of the kings, rewarded the ancients with greater returns than our very extensive fallow-lands bestow upon us nowadays.
