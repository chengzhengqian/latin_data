may devote itself to a vine of different origin. However, this is not done in the case of a traverse shoot, which is nourished at its mother’s breast until it grows into the other vine.</p>
<p>But there is one type of iron tool with which our<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">15</span><span class="br"></span>
ancestors used to bore through the vine,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_447_a" id="target_note_LCL361_447_a"><sup>a</sup></a> and a different sort which I myself have now found by experience to be more suitable. For the ancient gimlet—the only kind that old-time farmers knew—would make sawdust and would burn the place which it perforated. Moreover, it was seldom that the burned part would revive or unite with the former and that the grafted scion would take hold. Then, too, the sawdust was never so completely removed that some did not remain in the hole; and this, by its intervention, kept the body of the scion from being closely joined to the body of the vine. We, having<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">16</span><span class="br"></span>
devised what we call the “Gallic auger”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_447_b" id="target_note_LCL361_447_b"><sup>b</sup></a> for this kind of grafting, have found it far more suitable and practical. For it hollows out the stock in such a way as not to burn the hole, because it does not make dust but shavings; and when these are removed a smooth wound is left, which can more easily touch the seated scion on every side, since there is no interference of that woolly matter which the ancient gimlet produced. [Therefore see to it that the grafting of your vines is<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">17</span><span class="br"></span> 
finished immediately after the vernal equinox; and graft the black vine in places that are parched and dry, the white vine in wet places.]<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_447_c" id="target_note_LCL361_447_c"><sup>c</sup></a> [And there is no
