Also, on account of the rain, the hives should be protected above with colonnades, or, failing these, they should be overshadowed by green foliage daubed over with Carthaginian clay, forming a covering which keeps off both the cold and rain and also the heat. However the heat of summer is not so harmful to this kind of creature as the cold of winter,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL407_449_a" id="target_note_LCL407_449_a"><sup>a</sup></a> and so there should always be a building behind the apiary to intercept the violence of the north wind and provide warmth for the hives. Likewise the beesâ€™ dwelling-places, although they<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span> are protected by buildings, ought to be so arranged as to face the south-east, in order that the bees may enjoy the sun when they go out in the morning and may be more wide-awake; for cold begets sloth.
