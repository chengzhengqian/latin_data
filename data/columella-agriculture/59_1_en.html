husbandry but also in nature as a whole, went so far astray, both in his thinking and in his observation, that the many marshes and the many stretches of salt meadows, in which the above-mentioned colours are usually present, did not attract his notice. For our casual observations reveal no<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">16</span><span class="br"></span> place, provided it contains stagnant water, which is not of a black or ashy colour; unless perhaps I am myself mistaken in thinking that luxuriant grain crops cannot be produced in the soil of slimy swamp and brackish marshland or in a region of salt deposits along the seacoast. But this mistake of the ancients is too apparent to require refutation by further argument. It is not the colour, then, that is, so to speak, the infallible voucher and witness of goodness of ploughland; and for that reason grain-land,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">17</span><span class="br"></span> that is rich land, is to be judged rather by other qualities. For, as the sturdiest of farm animals have been allotted different and almost countless colours, just so the strongest soils have them in very great number and variety. Accordingly, we must take care that the soil which we intend to cultivate is rich. Still this of itself is not sufficient if it lacks<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">18</span><span class="br"></span> sweetness; and we may come to know both qualities by a very easy method.
