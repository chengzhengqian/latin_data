which they keep for one night in the open air, and then pour it down the animalâ€™s throat. Then after an interval of an hour they put before it four pounds of soaked bitter-vetch and keep it away from any other drink. This should be continued for three days,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> so that every cause of lassitude is dissipated. If indigestion is neglected, inflation of the belly and more severe pain in the intestines follow, which does not allow the animal to take its food, causes it to bellow, does not suffer it to remain in one place, and makes it lie down frequently, toss its head and lash its tail continually.
