He should not stop in the middle of the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">27</span><span class="br"></span> furrow, but should allow a rest at the end of it, so that the ox will exert himself more energetically the whole way in the hope of stopping. But to run a furrow more than one hundred and twenty feet in length is injurious to a beast, for he is wearied more than is right when he goes beyond this limit.
