be free from such injury by cattle. The plants must<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">11</span><span class="br"></span> also be watered, when droughts occur, and they must not be touched with the knife unless two years have passed; and, firstly, they ought to be trimmed so that there is only a single stem which exceeds the height of the tallest ox; and, secondly, lest in ploughing an ox should hit it with his haunch or any other part of his body, it is best to protect the plants with fences, even plants that are established.</p>
<p>When the olive grove is established and has reached maturity, you must divide it into two parts, so that they may be clothed with fruit in alternate years; for the olive-tree does not produce an abundance two years in succession. When the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">12</span><span class="br"></span> ground underneath has not been sown with a crop, the tree is putting forth its shoots; when the ground is full of sown crop, the tree is bearing fruit; the olive-grove, therefore, being thus divided, gives an equal return every year. But it ought to be ploughed at least twice a year and dug deep all round the trees with hoes; for after the solstice, when the ground gapes open from the heat, care must be taken that the sun does not penetrate to the roots of the trees through the cracks. After the autumn equinox the trees ought<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">13</span><span class="br"></span> to be trenched all round, so that, if the olive-grove is on a slope, ditches may be formed from the higher ground to convey water to the trunks of the trees. Next every shoot which springs from the lowest part of the stem must be removed each year, and every third year the olive-trees must be fed with dung. The olive-grove will be manured by the same method as that which I suggested in the second book,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL407_83_a" id="target_note_LCL407_83_a"><sup>a</sup></a> if,
