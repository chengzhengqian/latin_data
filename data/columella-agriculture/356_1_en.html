and why the number should be made up with young stock. Whoever is going to follow this system will have to take care not to put a lamb under a ewe which is less than four years or more than eight years old, for a ewe of neither of these ages is fit to bring up its young; moreover, the offspring of aged stock generally reproduces the qualities of old age inherited from its parents, being either sterile or weakly. The delivery of a pregnant ewe<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">16</span><span class="br"></span> should be watched over with as much care as midwives
exercise; for this animal produces its offspring just in the same way as a woman, and its labour is painful even more often since it is devoid of all reasoning. Hence the owner of a flock ought to have some knowledge of veterinary medicine, so that, if circumstances require it, when the lambkin becomes struck crosswise in the genital organs, he may either extract it whole, or be able to remove it from the womb, after dividing it with a knife without causing the mother’s death—an operation which the Greeks call <span class="italic">embryulkein.</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL407_249_a" id="target_note_LCL407_249_a"><sup>a</sup></a> The lamb, when it has been<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">17</span><span class="br"></span> brought forth, ought to be set upon its feet and put near its mother’s udder; then its mouth should be opened and moistened by pressing the mother’s teats, so that it may learn to derive its nourishment from her. But, before this is done, a little milk should be drawn off, which shepherds call “biestings,” for, if this is not to some extent extracted, it does harm to the lamb, which for the first two days after its birth should be shut up with its mother, so that she may cherish her offspring, and that it may learn to know her.
