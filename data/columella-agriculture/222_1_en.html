loosened when moved by the wind, or the tender shoot be pulled out. And when this shoot has increased in size it must be deprived of its secondary shoots, unless because of the poverty or baldness of the place they are reserved for layers. Then autumn applies the pruning-knife to the matured branches. But the following method of pruning is observed in grafted vines—that, where there is no desire for a layer, one shoot is brought up to the frame; and a second is cut back to such an extent that the wound is flush with the stock, though in such a way that nothing is pared from the hard wood. Excess foliage<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">12</span><span class="br"></span>
must be removed just as in the case of the young quickset; but the pruning is to be done in such a way that demands are put upon it very sparingly up to the fourth year, until the wound of the trunk forms a scar. This, then, is the method of procedure in cleft-grafting.</p>
<p>The procedure by terebration or boring is as follows:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_445_a" id="target_note_LCL361_445_a"><sup>a</sup></a><span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">13</span><span class="br"></span>
first, to take note of the most fruitful vine in the vicinity, from which you may draw over a traverse branch, so to speak, still clinging to its parent vine, and pass it through the hole. For this is a safer and surer way of grafting because, even though it does not take hold the next spring, at any rate it is forced to be united in the spring following, when it has grown larger; and presently it is cut loose from its mother, and the upper part of the grafted vine is lopped off close to the place where the scion was admitted. If<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">14</span><span class="br"></span>
there is no opportunity for such a traverse branch, then a twig is selected—one taken as fresh as possible from the vine—and, being lightly pared all around in such a way that the bark alone is removed, it is fitted to the hole; and then the vine is cut back and daubed over with clay, that the whole stock
