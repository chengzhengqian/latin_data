trees in the autumn season and which were spread over her are presently turned under by the ploughshare and mixed with the subsoil, which is usually thinner, and are used up, the result is that the soil, being deprived of its old-time nourishment, grows lean. It is not, therefore, because of weariness, as<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">7</span><span class="br"></span> very many have believed, nor because of old age, but manifestly because of our own lack of energy that our cultivated lands yield us a less generous return. For we may reap greater harvests if the earth is quickened again by frequent, timely, and moderate manuring. As I promised in the preceding book to speak of its cultivation, I shall now begin the discussion.</p>
<p>II. Those who are most experienced in agricultural affairs have said, Silvinus, that there are three kinds of terrain—champaign, hilly, and mountainous.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_109_a" id="target_note_LCL361_109_a"><sup>a</sup></a> Of champaign land they favoured especially that lying, not in a perfectly even and level plain, but in a somewhat sloping one; of hilly land, that with a gentle and gradual rise; of mountainous land, the high and rugged, but wooded and grassy.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_109_b" id="target_note_LCL361_109_b"><sup>b</sup></a> Furthermore,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> under each of these classes there fall six species of soil—fat or lean, loose or compact, moist or dry; and these qualities, in combination and in alternation with one another, produce a very great variety of soils. To enumerate them is not the mark of a skilled farmer; for it is not the business of any art to roam about over the species, which are countless, but to proceed through the classes, for these can readily be connected in the imagination and brought within the compass of words.
