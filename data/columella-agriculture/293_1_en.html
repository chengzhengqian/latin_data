profit from cattle more than makes up for a moderate amount of carelessness on the part of their owner.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL407_123_a" id="target_note_LCL407_123_a"><sup>a</sup></a></p>
<p>It is on this account, Silvinus, that, following the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">6</span><span class="br"></span> precepts of our forefathers, we have taken all the pains which we can to hand on to posterity an account of this department of agriculture also. There are, then, two classes of fourfooted animals, one of which we procure to share our labours, such as the ox, the mule, the horse and the ass, and the other which we keep for our pleasure and the profit which they bring us or for keeping watch, such as the sheep, the goat, the pig and the dog. We will deal first with the class which we employ to take part in our work. There is<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">7</span><span class="br"></span> no doubt, as Varro says, that the ox ought to be ranked above all other cattle, especially in Italy, which is believed to have derived its name from this animal, which the Greeks formerly called <span class="italic">italos,</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL407_123_b" id="target_note_LCL407_123_b"><sup>b</sup></a> and in that city<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL407_123_c" id="target_note_LCL407_123_c"><sup>c</sup></a> at the founding of whose walls an ox and a cow drew the plough which marked its boundaries; also because, to go still further back, at Athens in Attica the ox too is said to have been the attendant of Ceres (Demeter) and Triptolemus, and because it has its place in the heavens, among the most brilliant constellations, and, lastly, because it is still man’s most hardworking associate in agriculture, and so great was the respect in which it was held among the ancients that it was equally a capital crime to have killed an ox and to have killed a fellow-citizen. Let us, therefore, begin the task before us with the ox.</p>
