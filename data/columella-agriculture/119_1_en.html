The smaller of the two is everywhere very well known, because it covers those most famous slopes of Vesuvius and of Surrentum<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_239_a" id="target_note_LCL361_239_a"><sup>a</sup></a> in Campania. It is sprightly amid the western breezes of summer, but downcast in southern winds; and so in other<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">11</span><span class="br"></span>
sections of Italy it is suitable, not so much for vineyards, as for the arbustum, although in the regions above mentioned it bears the yoke<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_239_b" id="target_note_LCL361_239_b"><sup>b</sup></a> very well. It produces wood and fruit—except for its double clusters—not unlike the smaller “sister” vine, just as the larger “twin” is like the larger “sister”; but the smaller vine is the better in that it is more fruitful even in ordinary soil, for I have already said that the other does not yield except in very rich ground.

“woolly” Aminean, which acquires this epithet not from the fact that it alone, of all the Aminean varieties, is hoary with down, but because it is especially so. A producer of exceedingly good wine, though mellower than those above mentioned, it also makes a rank growth; and for this reason, because of the compactness of its foliage, it often does not cast its blossoms perfectly, and it also rots quickly after the fruit has matured. In addition to the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">13</span><span class="br"></span>
number that we have mentioned, there is included a “single”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL361_239_c" id="target_note_LCL361_239_c"><sup>c</sup></a> Aminean not unlike the larger “twin”—a
