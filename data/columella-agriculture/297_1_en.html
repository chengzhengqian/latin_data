ticks, which generally fasten on the thighs, may be removed. In doing this the trainer ought to stand at the side, so that the animal may not reach him with its hoof. After this you should pull the jaws<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">7</span><span class="br"></span> apart and draw out the tongue and rub the whole mouth and palate with salt and put down the animal’s throat cakes of a pound’s weight of meal moistened with well-salted drippings of fat, and pour into their jaws a <span class="italic">sextarius</span> of wine at a time by means of a horn; for by blandishments of this kind they generally become tame in three days and allow themselves to be yoked on the fourth day. This yoke has the bough of a tree tied to it instead of a pole;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL407_131_a" id="target_note_LCL407_131_a"><sup>a</sup></a> sometimes too a weight is attached, so that the capacity of the animal for enduring toil may be tested by the greater effort which is involved. After experiments of this kind the bullocks should<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">8</span><span class="br"></span> be yoked, to an empty wagon and gradually be made to go longer journeys with loads. Soon after they have been thus broken in, they should be set to draw the plough, but over land already tilled, so that they may not be frightened at first by the difficulty of their task and that their still tender necks may not be bruised by the tough first breaking of the ground. I have already in my first book<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL407_131_b" id="target_note_LCL407_131_b"><sup>b</sup></a> given instructions how the ploughman is to train the ox in ploughing. Care must be taken that the ox does not strike anyone with his hoof or his horn while he is being trained; for, unless precautions are taken against this, it will never be possible to get rid of faults of this kind, though the animal has been broken in.</p>
