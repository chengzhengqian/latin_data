to which the firm-wood branches are tied. These some people call “staked” vines. The type which<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> comes last in esteem is the procumbent vine which, being as it were projected from the stock as soon as it grows out of the earth, stretches over the ground.</p>
<p>The conditions under which all these vines are planted are almost identical. The plants are placed either in a plant-hole or in a furrow, since the farmers of foreign races are unacquainted with trenching, which indeed is almost superfluous in places where the soil crumbles and has fallen to pieces of its own accord, for, as Vergil says;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL407_29_a" id="target_note_LCL407_29_a"><sup>a</sup></a></p>

<p>V. But that I may deal particularly with each
<span class="marginNote right">Methods of cultivating vines.</span> kind of the vine of which I have proposed to speak, I will resume the order already mentioned. The vine which stands by virtue of its own strength without any prop must in rather loose soil be placed in a planting-hole, in denser soil in a furrow, but both planting-holes and furrows are very beneficial, if, in temperate regions where the summer is not excessively hot, they are made a year before the vine-yards
