<span class="marginNote right">How to preserve Pausean olives.</span> follows. In the month of September or October, while the vintage is still going on, crush the bitter Pausean olive and, after soaking it for a short time in hot water, squeeze it, and after mixing it slightly for a short time with fennel and mastic seeds together with toasted salt put it in a jar and pour in the freshest possible must. Then put on the top a bunch of green fennel and sink it so that the olives may be pressed down and the liquid rise above them. Having thus treated your olive, you may use it on the third day.</p>
<p>When you are going to bruise the white Pausean,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> or the orchites or the shuttle olive or the royal olive, first of all plunge each of them into cold brine, so that it may not lose its colour, and when you have enough ready to fill a jar, spread a bunch of dry fennel in the bottom of it; then have sprigs of green fennel and mastic ready stripped and cleaned in a small pot. Take the olives out of the brine and squeeze them, and mixing them with the said sprigs put them into the vessel. Next, when the olives have reached the neck of the vessel, put bunches of dry fennel on the top of them and then add a mixture of two parts of fresh must and one of hard brine. Olives which have<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> been treated by this method of preservation you can perfectly well use for a whole year.</p>
