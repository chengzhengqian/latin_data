There is the noble stock which supplies horses for the circus and the Sacred Games; then there is the stock used for breeding mules which in the price which its offspring fetches is a match for the noble breed; and there is the common breed which produces ordinary mares and horses. The more excellent each class is, the richer must be<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> the pasturage assigned to it.
