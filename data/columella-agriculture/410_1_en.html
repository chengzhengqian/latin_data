the time when the hens cease to lay, that is, from the 13th of November, the more expensive food must be withheld and grape-husks be supplied, which form quite a suitable diet, if refuse from wheat is added from time to time.</p>
<p>VI. The keeping of eggs over a longer period is also
<span class="marginNote right">Of eggs.</span> germane to the subject which we are now considering. In winter they are conveniently preserved if
you bury them in chaff, in summer if you put them in bran. Some people cover them first for six hours with pounded salt; next they wash them and then bury them in chaff or bran. Some people cover them with a heap of whole beans, many with a heap of bruised beans; others bury them in unpounded salt: others harden them in lukewarm brine. But salt in<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> any form, although it does not allow the eggs to rot, shrinks them and prevents them from remaining full: and this is a deterrent to the purchaser. Thus even those who plunge the eggs in brine do not completely preserve their original condition.</p>
<p>VII. Although it is the business of the poulterer
<span class="marginNote right">On fattening hens.</span> rather than of the farmer to fatten hens, yet, since it
is not a difficult task, I thought that I ought to give directions on the subject. A spot is required for this purpose which is very warm and has very little light, where the birds may be hung, shut up each separately in rather narrow coops or plaited cages and confined in so close a space that they cannot turn round. They should, however, have holes on either side, one<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> through which they can put out their head and the other through which they can put out their tail and hind-quarters, so that they may be able both to take their food and also get rid of it when it has been digested and so may not be befouled with dung.
