what may be called horns, and thus the whole vine must be spread in a circular form on all sides. The<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">11</span><span class="br"></span> method of pruning is the same as for vines which are trained on frames, though it differs in one respect, namely, that instead of longer firm-wood branches stumps with four or five “eyes” are left, and instead of “keepers”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL407_37_a" id="target_note_LCL407_37_a"><sup>a</sup></a> short-cut branches with two “eyes” are formed. Then in the vine which we described as growing to a head, the shoot is pulled off close to the mother-vine right up to the stock, one or two “eyes” only being left which adhere to the trunk itself. This can be done with safety in well-watered<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">12</span><span class="br"></span>
and very rich districts when the strength of the earth can supply both fruit and firm-wood. Those who have vineyards formed in this way cultivate them mainly with ploughs and follow this method of pulling off the arms from the vines, because the heads themselves, having nothing projecting<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL407_37_b" id="target_note_LCL407_37_b"><sup>b</sup></a> from them, are not liable to damage from the plough or from the oxen. For in vines which grow out into arms it generally happens that the small branches are broken off by the legs or horns of the oxen, and often too by the handle of the plough while the careful ploughman is striving to graze the edge of the row with the ploughshare and to cultivate the ground as near as possible to the vines.</p>
<p>Such then is the cultivation applied to vines<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">13</span><span class="br"></span> whether they grow to arms or to a head, before they bud. When they have budded, a digger follows the ploughman and breaks with a hoe the parts which the ploughman could not reach. Then, when the vine puts forth its firm-wood branches, the vine-trimmer follows and clears away the superfluous shoots and allows those which are fruitful to grow,
