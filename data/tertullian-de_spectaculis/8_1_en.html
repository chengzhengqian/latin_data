<p>There are many authors who have published memoirs on the matter. They give this account of the origin of the games. Lydians from Asia migrated and settled in Etruria, so Timaeus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL250_245_a" id="target_note_LCL250_245_a"><sup>a</sup></a> tells us, under the leadership of Tyrrhenus, who in a dispute about the kingship had given way to his brother. In Etruria, then, among other rites involved by their superstitions, they institute public shows in the name of religion. From Etruria the Romans fetch the performers, and with them they borrow also the time and the name—the <span class="italic">ludii</span> are so called from the Lydians. Even if Varro<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL250_245_b" id="target_note_LCL250_245_b"><sup>b</sup></a> derives the <span class="italic">ludii</span> from <span class="italic">ludus</span> (that is, from playing)—just as they used to call the Luperci <span class="italic">ludii</span> because in play they run hither and thither,—he nevertheless reckons this playing of the youths as belonging to festal days, temples and matters of religion. But the verbal issue does not matter, when the real issue is idolatry. For since in a general way the games were called Liberalia, the sound of the name clearly signified the honour of Father Liber (Bacchus). For they were first held in honour of Liber by the countryfolk on account of the good service which they say he did them in making wine known. Then came the games originally held in honour of Neptune and called Consualia. For he is also styled Consus. After that Romulus named the Ecurria,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL250_245_ca" id="target_note_LCL250_245_ca"><sup>c</sup></a> from horses, in honour of Mars—though they claim the Consualia as well for Romulus, arguing that he instituted them for Consus, the god (they say) of counsel—meaning the particular counsel

The Lydian origin of the Etruscans is in Herodotus, i. 94—“they sailed away to seek a livelihood and a country, till at last they came to the Ombrikoi where they founded cities and have dwelt ever since.” Modern historians have from time to time rejected, accepted, and modified this story. Etruscan influence on Rome is much more decidedly historical.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL250_245_a').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL250_245_b"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL250_245_b" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">b</sup>Varro, the great Roman antiquary, a contemporary of Cicero, somewhat dreaded by Cicero and much used by St. Augustine.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL250_245_b').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL250_245_ca"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL250_245_ca" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">c</sup>More usually spelled <span class="italic">Equirria.</span> There appear to have been two such festivals, 27th February and 14th March, both in honour of Mars and both celebrated with horse-races.
