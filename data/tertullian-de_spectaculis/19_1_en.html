do not lack the pomp of the devil nor the invocation of demons.</p>
<p>Finally, what am I to say about that dreadful place, the amphitheatre? Even perjury could not face it.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL250_267_a" id="target_note_LCL250_267_a"><sup>a</sup></a> For it is dedicated to more names, and more awful names, than the Capitol itself; it is the temple of all demons. There are as many unclean spirits gathered there as it can seat men. And, by way of a last word on the arts concerned, we know that Mars and Diana are the patrons of both types of games.</p>

<p>XIII. Enough, I think, has been said to complete our plan of procedure, in proving in what ways, and in how many ways, the spectacles involve idolatry. We have dealt with origins, names, equipment, place and arts. So that we may be certain that in no aspect are the spectacles consonant with our twofold<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL250_267_b" id="target_note_LCL250_267_b"><sup>b</sup></a> profession of the renunciation of idols. “ Not that an idol is anything,” says the apostle, “ but what they do, they do in honour of demons,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL250_267_c" id="target_note_LCL250_267_c"><sup>c</sup></a> who plant themselves in the consecrated images of—whatever they are, dead men or, as <span class="italic">they</span> think, gods. So on that account, since both kinds of idol stand on the same footing (dead men and gods are one and the same thing), we abstain from both kinds of idolatry. Temples or tombs, we abominate both equally; we know neither sort of altar; we adore neither sort of image; we pay no sacrifice; we pay no funeral rite. No, and we do not eat of what is offered in sacrificial or funeral rite, because “ we cannot eat of the Lord’s supper and the supper of demons. ”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL250_267_d" id="target_note_LCL250_267_d"><sup>d</sup></a> If then we try to keep our gullet and belly free from defilement, how much more our nobler parts, our eyes and ears, do we guard from the pleasures of idol sacrifice and sacrifice to the dead—pleasures
