Christians, a race of men ever ready for death, are trained in that stubbornness<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL250_233_a" id="target_note_LCL250_233_a"><sup>a</sup></a> of theirs by the renunciation of pleasures, that they may find it easier to despise life, when once its ties (if the word be allowed) are severed, and they no longer crave what they have emptied of meaning for themselves. This would make it a rule of human prudence and fore thought rather than of divine command. It would forsooth go against the grain to die for the Lord, if such pleasures could still have continued! Though, to be sure, if it were so, stubbornness in a rule of life such as ours might well pay attention to a plan so apt.</p>

<p>II. In the next place, there is no one who fails to produce this excuse—that all things were created by God and given to man (as we Christians teach), and that they are really all good, all being the work of a good Creator; and that among them we must reckon all the various things that go to make the public shows, the horse, for example, and the lion, and strength of body and charm of voice. It follows, they urge, that a thing cannot be counted foreign to God or hostile to Him that exists by His creation, nor must we suppose a thing hostile to God’s worshippers, which is not hostile to God because it is not foreign to God. Obviously the structures of the places,—the stones, cement, marbles, columns,—are all God’s own, who gave all those things to furnish the earth; yes, and the performances themselves are carried through under God’s heaven.</p>
<p>How clever in argument human ignorance seems to itself! especially when it is afraid of losing something of this kind, some delight or enjoyment of the world!
