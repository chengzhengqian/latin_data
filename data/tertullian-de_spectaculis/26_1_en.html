of pleasure, put forward the plea that no mention of such self-denial is made in Scripture, in definite terms or definite passage, directly forbidding the servant of God to push himself into gatherings of that kind! But the other day I heard a novel defence from one of these play-lovers. “The sun,” says he, “yes! and God Himself from heaven look on, and are not defiled.” Why, yes, the sun sends his rays into the sewer and is not polluted.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL250_281_a" id="target_note_LCL250_281_a"><sup>a</sup></a> Would that God looked on at no sins of men, that we might all escape judgement! But God looks on at brigandage, God looks at cheating, adultery, fraud, idolatry, yes, and the spectacles, too. And that is why we will not look at them, that we may not be seen by Him who looks on at everything. Man! you are putting defendant and judge on one level!—the defendant who is a defendant because he is seen, the judge who because he sees is judge. Do you then really suggest that outside the circus as well as inside it we should practise frenzy? Outside the theatre stimulate lust as well as inside? Outside the stadium as well as inside give the rein to bad manners, to cruelty outside as well as inside the amphitheatre? all because God has eyes outside the portico, the tier, and the curtain? No, we are wrong! Nowhere and never is what God condemns free from guilt. Nowhere and never is that permitted which is not permitted always and everywhere. Here is the perfection of truth—and hence the full discipline, the uniform fear, the obedient faith due to truth—here, in that it never changes its decision, never wavers in its judgement. What is good, really good, cannot be anything but good; nor what is evil anything but evil. In God’s truth all things are definite.</p>
