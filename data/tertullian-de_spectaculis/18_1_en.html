<p>If we are considering names,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL250_265_c" id="target_note_LCL250_265_c"><sup>c</sup></a>—though this class of public entertainment has passed from being a compliment to the dead to being a compliment to the living on entering office (I mean quaestorships, magistracies, flaminates and priesthoods),—still, since the guilt of idolatry sticks to the dignity of the name, whatever is done in the name of dignity must inevitably share the taint of its origin.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL250_265_d" id="target_note_LCL250_265_d"><sup>d</sup></a></p>
