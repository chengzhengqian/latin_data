this case too the saying is germane to the prohibition of the public shows. For if then he called a mere handful of Jews “a gathering of the impious,” how much this vast assemblage of a heathen people? Are the heathen less impious, less sinners, less the enemies of Christ, than the Jews were then? And how all the rest of it chimes in! For at the public shows there is sitting in the seat and standing in the way. For they use the word <span class="italic">viae</span> for the alleys by the barriers around the arena, and for the gangways up and down that separate the common people’s sections on the sloping sides of the amphitheatre; and <span class="italic">cathedra</span> is the term for the space in the recess assigned for chairs.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL250_241_aa" id="target_note_LCL250_241_aa"><sup>a</sup></a> So, conversely, “he is unhappy who has gone into any gathering whatever of the impious, and stood in any way at all of sinners, and has sat in any chair of pestilences.” Let us take the general application, even when some other special interpretation is admissible. For there are things said with special intent which are of general bearing. When God recalls the Israelites to discipline or upbraids them, it surely applies to all men. When He threatens destruction to Egypt and Ethiopia, assuredly He warns every sinful nation of judgement to come. Thus the single case stands for the general class; every sinful race is Egypt and Ethiopia, in the same way as every public show is a gathering of the impious, the general class covering the single case.</p>
