authority of our “seal.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL250_243_a" id="target_note_LCL250_243_a"><sup>a</sup></a> When we enter the water and profess the Christian faith in the terms prescribed by its law, we profess with our mouths that we have renounced the devil, his pomp and his angels. What shall we call the chief and outstanding matter, in which the devil and his pomps and his angels are recognized, rather than idolatry? From which every unclean and evil spirit, I may say<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL250_243_ba" id="target_note_LCL250_243_ba"><sup>b</sup></a>—but no more of that. So, if it shall be established that the whole equipment of the public shows is idolatry pure and simple, we have an indubitable decision laid down in advance, that this profession of renunciation made in baptism touches the public shows too, since they, being idolatry, belong to the devil, his pomp and his angels. We will therefore cite<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL250_243_c" id="target_note_LCL250_243_c"><sup>c</sup></a> the origins of one set of spectacles and another—showing how they were cradled in the world; next in order, the titles they bear, the names, to wit, by which they are called; next again their equipments, and the superstitions they serve; thereafter the places, and to what presiding spirits they are dedicated; and then the arts employed and their reputed authors. If among all these anything shall be found unconnected with an idol, we shall pronounce it to have no bearing on idolatry, to have no connexion with our renunciation.</p>

<p>V. First as to the origins, not universally known, indeed unknown among most of our people, we must go further afield in our inquiry, and our authority must be no other than the books of heathen literature.</p>
