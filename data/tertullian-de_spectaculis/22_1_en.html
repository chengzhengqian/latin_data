about its bets! The praetor is too slow for them; all the time their eyes are on his urn, in it, as if rolling with the lots he shakes up in it. The signal is to be given. They are all in suspense, anxious suspense. One frenzy, one voice! (Recognize their frenzy from their empty-mindedness.) “He has thrown it!”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL250_273_a" id="target_note_LCL250_273_a"><sup>a</sup></a> they cry; everyone tells everybody else what every one of them saw, all of them on the instant. I catch at that evidence of their blindness; they do not see what was thrown—a handkerchief, they think; no! a picture of the devil hurled from heaven!<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL250_273_b" id="target_note_LCL250_273_b"><sup>b</sup></a> So it begins and so it goes on,—to madness, anger, discord—to everything forbidden to the priests of peace. Next taunts or mutual abuse without any warrant of hate, and applause, unsupported by affection. What of their own are they going to achieve who act there in that way—when they are not their own? Unless it be merely the loss of their self-control<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL250_273_c" id="target_note_LCL250_273_c"><sup>c</sup></a>; they are plunged in grief by another’s bad luck, high in delight at another’s success. What they long to see, what they dread to see,—neither has anything to do with them; their love is without reason, their hatred without justice. Or is it allowed us to love without cause any more than to hate without cause? God, at any rate, forbids us to hate even with cause, when He bids us love our enemies. God does not allow us to curse even with cause, when He teaches us to bless those who curse us. But what can be more merciless than the circus, where men do not even spare their princes or their fellow-citizens? If any of these forms of madness, with which the circus rages, is anywhere permitted to saints, then it will be lawful in the circus also; but if nowhere, then neither in the circus.</p>
