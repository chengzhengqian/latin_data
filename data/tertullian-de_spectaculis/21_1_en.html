Where there is eagerness, there is rivalry which gives its flavour to eagerness. Yes, and then, where there is rivalry, there also are madness, bile, anger, pain, and all the things that follow from them, and (like them) are incompatible with moral discipline.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL250_271_b" id="target_note_LCL250_271_b"><sup>b</sup></a> For even if a man enjoy the spectacles in modest and upright fashion, agreeably to his dignity, his age, and his natural character, still he cannot with a mind quite unstirred or without some unspoken agitation of spirit. No one ever comes to pleasure without some feeling, no one has this feeling without some lapse; and the lapses actually contribute to the feeling.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL250_271_c" id="target_note_LCL250_271_c"><sup>c</sup></a> But if this feeling flags, pleasure there is none; and the man may be condemned as an empty-minded fellow, who goes where he gains nothing. But, I think, the empty-minded is foreign to us. And, further, what of this?—that a man really condemns himself when he finds himself set among others, with whom he does not wish to be,—which means that he owns to himself he detests them? It is not enough for us to abstain ourselves from doing such things, unless we also keep clear of those who do them. “If thou sawest a thief,” says Scripture,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL250_271_d" id="target_note_LCL250_271_d"><sup>d</sup></a> “thou didst consent with him.” Oh! if only we had not to live in the world along with them! Still, we are separated from them in all that is worldly. For the world is God’s; what is worldly is the devil’s.</p>

<p>XVI. Seeing then that madness is forbidden us, we keep ourselves from every public spectacle—including the circus, where madness of its own right rules. Look at the populace coming to the show—mad already! disorderly, blind, excited already
