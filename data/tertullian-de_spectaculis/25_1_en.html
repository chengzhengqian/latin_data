<p>XIX. And are we to wait now for a scriptural condemnation of the amphitheatre? If we can plead that cruelty is allowed us, if impiety, if brute savagery, by all means let us go to the amphitheatre. If we are what people say we are,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL250_279_a" id="target_note_LCL250_279_a"><sup>a</sup></a> let us take our delight in the blood of men. “It is a good thing, when the guilty are punished.” Who will deny that, unless he is one of the guilty? And yet the innocent cannot take pleasure in the punishment of another, when it better befits the innocent to lament that a man like himself has become so guilty that a punishment so cruel must be awarded him. But who will pledge himself to me that it is always the guilty who are condemned to the beasts, or whatever the punishment, and that it is never inflicted on innocence too, through the vindictiveness of the judge it may be, the weakness of the advocate, the severity of torture?

No one however can fully set out the whole story here, unless he be still a spectator. I prefer to leave it incomplete than to remember.</p>
