Why, you will find more men turned from our school<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL250_235_a" id="target_note_LCL250_235_a"><sup>a</sup></a> by the danger to pleasure than by the danger to life! For even a fool does not dread death beyond a certain point—he feels it inevitable; but pleasure, a thing of such high value, even a sage does not despise; since neither fool nor sage has any delight in life apart from pleasure. No one denies—because nobody is unaware of it and even nature tells it us—that God is the creator of the universe, and that the universe is good and is given to man. But because they do not really know God—knowing Him only by natural law and not by right of sonship—knowing Him from afar and not at close quarters,—they are necessarily ignorant as to how He bids or forbids the things of His creation to be used. They are also unaware of the rival powers that confront God for the abuse of what divine creation has given for use. For where your knowledge of God is defective, you can neither know His mind nor His adversary. We have not then merely to consider by whom all things were created, but also by whom they are perverted. For in that way it will appear for what use they were created, if it once appear for what use they were not. There is great difference between the corrupted and the uncorrupted because there is great difference between the Creator and the perverter.</p>
<p>Yet every form of evil, the evils that the heathen, as well as we, forbid and guard against, comes from something God made. You see murder committed by means of iron, drug, magical incantation : but iron is as much God’s creature as the plants or the angels.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL250_235_b" id="target_note_LCL250_235_b"><sup>b</sup></a> But did the Creator of them design those things for the destruction of man? No! He interdicts every kind of man­slaying
