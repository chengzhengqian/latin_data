<p>You, O Christian, will hate the things, when you cannot but hate the authors of them.</p>
<p>And now we would add a word on the arts and the things, whose authors we execrate in their very names. We know that the names of dead men are nothing—just as their images are nothing—but we are not unaware who are at work under those names and behind the images set up for them,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL250_261_a" id="target_note_LCL250_261_a"><sup>a</sup></a> what joy they take in them, and how they feign deity,—I mean, evil spirits, demons. We see then the arts consecrated to their glorification, who usurp the names of the authors of those arts, and that the arts do not lack the taint of idolatry when those who instituted them are as a result called gods.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL250_261_ba" id="target_note_LCL250_261_ba"><sup>b</sup></a> Further, as regards the arts, we ought to have entered our demurrer at an earlier point and pled that the demons from the very beginning took thought for themselves and among the other pollutions of idolatry devised those of the spectacles for the purpose of turning man from his Lord and binding him to their own glorification, and so inspired these ingenious arts. For no others but they would have devised what should turn to their profit; nor would they have given the arts to the world at that time through the agency of any other men than those by whose names and images and legends they determined they would negotiate the trick of their own consecration.
