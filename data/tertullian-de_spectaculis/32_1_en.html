<p>XXVII. It is our duty to hate these assemblies and gatherings of the heathen, were it only that there the name of God is blasphemed; that there, every day, the shout is raised to set the lion upon us<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL250_293_a" id="target_note_LCL250_293_a"><sup>a</sup></a>; that from there persecution begins; that there temptation has its base.

No one mixes poison with gall and hellebore; no, it is into delicacies well made, well flavoured, and, for the most part, sweet things, that he drops the venom. So does the devil; the deadly draught he brews, he flavours with the most agreeable, the most welcome gifts of God. So count all you find there—brave and honest, resounding, musical, exquisite,—as so much honey dropping from a poisoned bit of pastry; and do not count your appetite for the pleasure worth the risk in the sweetness.</p>
