<p>On the analogy of treaties with some Gallic and Illyrian tribes which contain a clause forbidding Rome to confer citizenship on any of their members, the prosecutor argues that such a veto must apply to the treaty with Gades, though not specifically mentioned in it.

Marcius Septimus, and formally renewed or concluded (78 <span class="sc">b.c.</span>) by the Senate, not by the Assembly. Even if the treaty had been formally ratified by a vote of the Assembly, and thereby made <span class="italic">sacrosanctum</span>, there was no clause in it forbidding the conferment of Roman citizenship upon a citizen of Gades. The treaty contained two provisions<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL447_726_a" id="target_note_LCL447_726_a"><sup>a</sup></a> only: “There shall be a holy and everlasting peace (between Rome and Gades)”; and, “Let them (the people of Gades) uphold the greatness of the Roman People in a friendly way.” As for these two provisions I can disprove the prosecutor’s interpretation of a word (<span class="italic">comiter</span>) contained in one of them.</p>
