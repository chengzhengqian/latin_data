<p class="noindent"><span class="sc">Cicero's</span> defence of Balbus is based on two essential ideas<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL447_718_a" id="target_note_LCL447_718_a"><sup>a</sup></a>: no member of an allied state has ever been prosecuted for his assumption of Roman citizenship, on the ground that his state “had not given its consent,” or that his right to change his citizenship was forbidden by a treaty; no one who had become a citizen by favour of a Roman general had ever lost this status by the verdict of a court of law.</p>
<p>Two scholars have expressed these ideas in words which may be appropriately borrowed. “Pompey had conferred the <span class="italic">civitas</span> on Balbus by virtue of the <span class="italic">lex Gellia Cornelia.</span> Balbus was a citizen of Gades, and it was argued that, just as the whole of the Gaditani could not become Romans unless a Roman law offering them the franchise had been definitely accepted by them, so an express acceptance of the <span class="italic">lex Gellia Cornelia</span> by the community was necessary to validate the gift of the <span class="italic">civitas</span> to Balbus. In other words, it was alleged that the municipality to which a non-Roman belonged had a right of veto on his acceptance of the Roman citizenship. This was of course untenable.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL447_718_b" id="target_note_LCL447_718_b"><sup>b</sup></a></p>
