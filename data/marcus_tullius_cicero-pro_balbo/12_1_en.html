rewards and favours! How could greater ignorance be shown than by saying that states bound to us by treaty must “give consent”? For this is a condition which does not apply to states bound to us by treaty any more than to free states in general. In fact, gentlemen, this whole practice<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL447_649_a" id="target_note_LCL447_649_a"><sup>a</sup></a> was always based upon this principle and intention that, when the Roman People had made any law, if the allied states and the Latins adopted it, and if that same law, which we observed, had, as it were, settled down “on solid ground”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL447_649_b" id="target_note_LCL447_649_b"><sup>b</sup></a> in some state, then that state should be bound by the same law. The purpose was, not that our own legal system should be in any way weakened, but that those states either might make use of that legal principle which had been established by us, or might enjoy some advantage or privilege.</p>
<p>In the days of our forefathers Gaius Furius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL447_649_c" id="target_note_LCL447_649_c"><sup>c</sup></a> passed<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">21</span><span class="br"></span> a law concerning wills, Quintus Voconius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL447_649_d" id="target_note_LCL447_649_d"><sup>d</sup></a> one concerning women’s inheritances, and countless other laws were passed dealing with civil law<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL447_649_e" id="target_note_LCL447_649_e"><sup>e</sup></a>; of these the Latins adopted what they pleased. Last of all came the Julian Law<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL447_649_f" id="target_note_LCL447_649_f"><sup>f</sup></a> itself under which citizenship was offered to the Allies and the Latins on condition that those states which had not “given consent,” should not hold the citizenship. This was the cause of a lively dispute among the citizens of Heraclea and of Neapolis, since a great part of the inhabitants of those states preferred to our citizenship the freedom enjoyed
