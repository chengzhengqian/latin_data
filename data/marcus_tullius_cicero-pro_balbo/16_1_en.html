upon their citizens as a reward of courage can have no validity. For, if rewards for valour were abolished, we should not enjoy their services to any greater degree than if they were totally forbidden to take part in our wars. Since, in fact, even for the sake of their own country, few men, within human history, have been found who have actually risked their lives before the weapons of an enemy when no rewards are offered, do you think that, for the sake of a foreign state, there will be anyone prepared to expose himself to dangers, not merely when no reward is offered but even when it is definitely forbidden?</p>

<p>XI. But, not only did the prosecutor show gross<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">27</span><span class="br"></span> ignorance by saying,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL447_657_a" id="target_note_LCL447_657_a"><sup>a</sup></a> with reference to peoples “giving consent,” that this was a principle which applied to free peoples and was not restricted to those bound to us by treaty—the deduction which must be drawn from this statement being that no one from our allies nor even from states under treaty can become a Roman citizen—, but he also, this mentor of ours,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL447_657_b" id="target_note_LCL447_657_b"><sup>b</sup></a> knows nothing whatever about our legal principle governing change of citizenship, which depends not merely upon the laws of the State but also upon the wishes of individuals. For, by our law, a man cannot change his citizenship against his will,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL447_657_c" id="target_note_LCL447_657_c"><sup>c</sup></a> and, if he should wish to change it, he cannot be prevented from doing so, provided he be adopted by that state of which he should desire to become a citizen. For example, if the people of Gades were to pass a decree expressly about some Roman citizen, that he should become a citizen of Gades, our fellow-citizen would have full power to change his citizenship, nor would he be debarred by treaty from being able to become a citizen of Gades instead of a citizen of Rome.</p>
