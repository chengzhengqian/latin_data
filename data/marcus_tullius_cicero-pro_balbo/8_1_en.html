For was the man who waged a desperate and most important war in Spain ignorant of the nature of the rights of the people of Gades, or, although he knew what were the rights of that people, had he not grasped the meaning of the treaty? Will then anyone dare to say that Gnaeus Pompeius was ignorant of what ordinary men, without any experience, without any interest in military matters, what even mere copyists claim to know? For my part, gentlemen, I think on the contrary,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">15</span><span class="br"></span> that while Gnaeus Pompeius excels in every sort and variety of accomplishments, even those which it is not easy to acquire without much leisure, his quite outstanding merit is his most remarkable knowledge of treaties, of agreements, of terms<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL447_641_c" id="target_note_LCL447_641_c"><sup>c</sup></a> imposed upon peoples, kings, and foreign races, and, in fact, of the whole code of law that deals with war and peace<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL447_641_d" id="target_note_LCL447_641_d"><sup>d</sup></a>;
