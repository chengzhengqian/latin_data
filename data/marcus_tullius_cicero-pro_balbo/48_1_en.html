Rome, such a restriction must apply to the treaty with Gades, though not expressly mentioned in it. Cicero replied that such a restriction was not only not found in the treaty itself but would have been overruled<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL447_721_a" id="target_note_LCL447_721_a"><sup>a</sup></a> by the <span class="italic">lex Gellia Cornelia</span>. Lastly, the prosecutor submitted that the <span class="italic">lex Gellia Cornelia</span> contained a saving clause which denied its validity against any enactment by nature <span class="italic">sacrosanctum</span>, such as the treaty with Gades. Cicero’s reply was that the treaty with Gades was not <span class="italic">sacrosanctum</span>, as it had never been formally ratified by the <span class="italic">populus Romanus.</span></p>
<p>3. <span class="italic">Sections 38–55.</span></p>
<p>Cicero reinforces his legal arguments by supplementary pleas. He stresses Gades’ strong support of Balbus’ case and Balbus’ loyal interest in his native city. He then dwells at some length on recent enfranchisements of foreigners by Roman commanders: by Marius, whose experience and personality are invoked in aid of Balbus, and by others. Pompey ought not to be attacked for following the example of other commanders. All these grants of citizenship have been approved by our courts and our government. If Roman citizenship can be won as a reward for a successful prosecution, why penalize gallantry in the service of Rome?</p>
<p>4. <span class="italic">Sections 56–65.</span></p>
<p>In his peroration Cicero passes to the personal and political setting of the prosecution. Although Balbus’ wealth and social success have aroused envious detractors, he has no real enemies and his prosecution is nothing but a veiled attack on Pompey and Caesar.
