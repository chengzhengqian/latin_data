People. It was the wish of our fathers, gentlemen, that the rites of Ceres should be performed with the strictest reverence and ceremonial; and since they were introduced from Greece, they were always performed through Greek priestesses and all the terms in use are Greek.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL447_703_a" id="target_note_LCL447_703_a"><sup>a</sup></a> But, although they chose from Greece a woman who should expound and perform that Greek rite, yet they saw fit that she should be a citizen when she performed rites on behalf of Roman citizens, so that she might offer prayers to the immortal gods with knowledge that was foreign and from abroad, but in a spirit that was of our own home and citizenship. I observe that these priestesses were nearly always from Neapolis<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL447_703_b" id="target_note_LCL447_703_b"><sup>b</sup></a> or Velia,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL447_703_ca" id="target_note_LCL447_703_ca"><sup>c</sup></a> which were undoubtedly federate cities. Passing over instances from ancient times, I say that quite recently, before citizenship was conferred upon the people of Velia,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL447_703_d" id="target_note_LCL447_703_d"><sup>d</sup></a> Gaius Valerius Flaccus, as city praetor,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL447_703_e" id="target_note_LCL447_703_e"><sup>e</sup></a> in accordance with a resolution of the Senate, expressly submitted a proposal to the People that Calliphana of Velia should be made a Roman citizen. Do we then believe either that the people of Velia “gave their consent,” or that that priestess was not made a Roman citizen, or that the treaty was violated both by the Senate and by the People of Rome?</p>

The temple, on the slope of the Aventine, near the west end of the Circus Maximus, was of political importance, as the worship of Ceres was essentially plebeian.
