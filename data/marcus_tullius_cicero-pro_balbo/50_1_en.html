<p>Our legal principle governing change of citizenship is that Roman citizens enjoy complete freedom to migrate and acquire citizenship in another state, save that no one can be a citizen of Rome and of other cities at the same time. For example, a Roman citizen can become a citizen of Gades by exercising the right of exile (<span class="italic">ius exsilii</span>), or by surrender of his Roman citizenship. Conversely, there is no reason why a citizen of Gades should not be allowed to become a citizen of Rome. The closer the political relations between Rome and foreign states, the more closely should these states be associated with us by the bonds of privilege, reward, and citizenship. But between Roman and foreign practice in this matter there is this difference that, whereas no Roman can be a citizen of Rome and of another city at the same time, a foreigner who is not a Roman citizen can hold the citizenship of many other cities. A citizen of a Greek city, for example, can at the same time be a citizen of other cities. A Roman citizen, however, on acquiring, say, Athenian citizenship, would lose his Roman citizenship unless he should recover it by exercising <span class="italic">ius postliminii</span>, the right of “subsequent return.” Foreigners enjoy an unrestricted right to acquire Roman citizenship if Rome chooses to confer it. By the admission to Roman citizenship of members of Italian states, an admirable practice traditionally begun by Romulus, the power of Rome has been firmly established and extended. The conferment of Roman citizenship upon members of Italian states would not have been regarded as an infringement of any treaty concluded with them.</p>
