do not agree with everybody, nor do I think it a mark of inconsistency to direct my opinion and course, as one might a ship, according to the weather which the State encounters. But if there be any, of whom I see<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">62</span><span class="br"></span> there are several, who cherish eternal hatred against those whom they have hated once, let them fight with the leaders themselves, not with their attendants and adherents. For the former course some will perhaps consider as obstinacy,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL447_713_a" id="target_note_LCL447_713_a"><sup>a</sup></a> others as virtue, but all will consider the latter as injustice, with some admixture of cruelty. But if, gentlemen, there are no means by which we can appease the feelings of certain men, I am fully confident that your minds have been appeased, not by words of mine but by your own human feelings.</p>

<p>XXVIII. For why should not my client’s friendship<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">63</span><span class="br"></span> with Caesar be regarded as crowning his glory rather than as causing him the least injury? When he was a young man he became acquainted with Caesar; he attracted a most discerning man; among Caesar’s large circle of friends he ranked with his closest intimates. When praetor and when consul Caesar appointed him as his “Chief Engineer,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL447_713_b" id="target_note_LCL447_713_b"><sup>b</sup></a> he approved of the man’s judgment, he appreciated his loyalty, he valued highly his services and his respect. At different times Balbus has shared in many of his toils; to-day, possibly, he shares in some of his advantages.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL447_713_c" id="target_note_LCL447_713_c"><sup>c</sup></a> And if these matters should harm him in your eyes, I fail to see what advantage any man will gain from virtue with men such as you.</p>
