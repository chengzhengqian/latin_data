unless perhaps, what books teach us in the quiet of a sheltered life is something which neither books could teach Gnaeus Pompeius when he had leisure, nor foreign countries themselves when he was in the field.</p>
<p>And now, gentlemen, in my opinion my case is finished. But owing to the faults of our times rather than the nature of this trial, I shall have more to say.</p>
<p>Now it is a sort of blot and blemish of this age to be envious of virtue, to seek to crush merit in its very bloom. For if Pompeius had lived five hundred years<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">16</span><span class="br"></span> ago, a man from whom the Senate, when he was a mere youth and a Roman Knight,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL447_643_a" id="target_note_LCL447_643_a"><sup>a</sup></a> had often sought help for the safety of the State, whose exploits, crowned by glorious victory on land and sea had compassed all peoples, whose three triumphs<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL447_643_ba" id="target_note_LCL447_643_ba"><sup>b</sup></a> were a witness that the whole world was subject to our Empire, whom the Roman People had invested with unexampled and outstanding honours,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL447_643_c" id="target_note_LCL447_643_c"><sup>c</sup></a>—if to-day it should be said among us that what such a man had done was done contrary to a treaty, who would listen? In my opinion, no one. For when death had hushed the voice of envy, his exploits would shine<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL447_643_d" id="target_note_LCL447_643_d"><sup>d</sup></a> by the glory of his immortal name. If a mere report of a man’s merit could leave no room for hesitation—is
such merit when actually seen and experienced to be attacked by the voice of traducers?</p>
