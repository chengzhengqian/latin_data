is to say, that the Roman People should wish to have their own greatness upheld. But, supposing for a moment that this were so—impossible as it is—, none the less a stipulation would be made about our own greatness, not about theirs. Can our own greatness, then, be upheld “in a friendly way” by the people of Gades, if we are unable to attract them by rewards to preserve it? Lastly, can there be any greatness at all, if we are prevented from conferring upon our commanders, through the Roman People, the power of bestowing favours as a reward of courage?</p>
