<p>Cicero dealt ably and effectively with what were presumably the prosecutor’s arguments, and did not fail to urge every consideration which could influence the jury in favour of his client. The speech throws light upon the Roman law and practice of citizenship and upon relations with <span class="italic">civitates foederatae.</span> There is much intricate legal and constitutional argument. Yet while the <span class="italic">Pro Balbo</span> was a highly competent and successful speech, it cannot be said to be a moving one. Cicero was no longer a free agent: he was speaking to order. Fulsome compliments are of course paid to his masters, especially to Pompey (§§ 2–3; 9–16).
