slaves of Gades? Again, did not Quintus Metellus Pius, that most righteous man, most scrupulous, most law-abiding, bestow it upon Quintus Fabius of Saguntum?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL447_695_a" id="target_note_LCL447_695_a"><sup>a</sup></a>
Again, did not this man here before us, by whom all that I am now touching upon lightly has been elaborated in great detail,—did not Marcus Crassus bestow it upon an inhabitant of Avennio,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL447_695_b" id="target_note_LCL447_695_b"><sup>b</sup></a> a federate city, himself a man distinguished for his force of personality and his wisdom arid even over-sparing
in granting citizenship?</p>
<p>Do you, in this Court, endeavour to invalidate a<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">51</span><span class="br"></span> favour, or rather a decision and a deed of Gnaeus Pompeius, who did what he had heard Gaius Marius had done, what he had heard Publius Crassus, Lucius Sulla, Quintus Metellus, Marcus Crassus had done, and, lastly, that for which he had authority in his own house in what he had seen his father do?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL447_695_c" id="target_note_LCL447_695_c"><sup>c</sup></a> Nor did he bestow citizenship in the instance of Cornelius alone. For he bestowed it also upon Hasdrubal of Gades after that war in Africa,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL447_695_d" id="target_note_LCL447_695_d"><sup>d</sup></a> upon the Ovii descendants of the Mamertines,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL447_695_ea" id="target_note_LCL447_695_ea"><sup>e</sup></a> and upon certain Fabii of Utica<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL447_695_f" id="target_note_LCL447_695_f"><sup>f</sup></a> and of Saguntum. In fact, if those who defend our State at the cost of their own toil and danger are worthy of other rewards, then assuredly are they most worthy to be presented with that citizenship, to defend which they have braved dangers and the weapons of war.
