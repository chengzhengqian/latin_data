<p>Now I am convinced that it is befitting to the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span> dignity of the State, a debt owed to the outstanding renown of this eminent man, a matter which is essential to your duty, and a sufficient plea, that what is known to have been done by Gnaeus Pompeius should be admitted by all to have been lawfully done. For nothing is more true than what he himself said yesterday—that Lucius Cornelius was fighting for his very existence, but was not charged with any offence. For he is accused neither of having stolen the citizenship, nor of having given a false account of his family, nor of having skulked behind some shameless lie, nor of having sneaked into the censors’ list. One reproach is made—that he was born at Gades; and that nobody denies. As for the rest, the accuser admits that when a most arduous war was being fought in Spain, Balbus served under Quintus Metellus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL447_631_a" id="target_note_LCL447_631_a"><sup>a</sup></a> and Gaius Memmius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL447_631_a" id="target_note_LCL447_631_a"><sup>a</sup></a> on both sea and land; that from the time when Pompeius came to Spain<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL447_631_b" id="target_note_LCL447_631_b"><sup>b</sup></a> and chose Memmius as his quaestor, Balbus never left Memmius; that he was besieged in Carthage<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL447_631_ca" id="target_note_LCL447_631_ca"><sup>c</sup></a>; that he fought in those fierce and desperate battles on the Sucro<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL447_631_d" id="target_note_LCL447_631_d"><sup>d</sup></a> and the Turia<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL447_631_e" id="target_note_LCL447_631_e"><sup>e</sup></a>; that he was with Pompeius till the very end of the war. This is what Cornelius claims as his own: affection<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">6</span><span class="br"></span> for our State, toil, industry, hard fighting, valour
