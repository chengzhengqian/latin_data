I say nothing about many favours which they may obtain every day, either wholly or certainly more easily, by the efforts and devotion of my client. Accordingly, the chief men of his state are both present here and defend him by their affection as a citizen of their own, by their testimony as a citizen of our own, by their kindly offices as one who from a most distinguished citizen has become a revered guest-friend, and by their zeal as a most painstaking champion of their interests.</p>
<p>And lest the people of Gades themselves should<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">44</span><span class="br"></span> imagine that, although they have no inconvenience put upon them, should their citizens be entitled to earn our citizenship by gallantry, yet their treaty becomes for this very reason less favourable than that of other peoples, I will reassure both these excellent gentlemen here present, and that city, most loyal and devoted to us, and I will also remind you, gentlemen, although you well know it already, that the legal point which this Court has to decide never has been in any possible doubt.</p>
<p>Who, then, are those whom we consider to be the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">45</span><span class="br"></span> most skilled interpreters of treaties, the most learned in military law, the most scrupulous in investigating the relations of states to ourselves and their legal position? Undoubtedly those who have already commanded armies and waged wars.</p>
