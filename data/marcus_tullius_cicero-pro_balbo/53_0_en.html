enemies of his friends. Balbus himself has no real enemies and, though he was associated with Caesar at a time of violent political conflict (59–58 <span class="sc">b.c.</span>), he never gave offence to any member of the senatorial party. During my exile Balbus was kindness itself to my family, a service which I am now repaying. His worst enemies are attacking Pompey through him, but, if I may speak from my own recent experience, they would be well advised to drop that unequal struggle. Political conflicts, commendable though they may be to a point, should not be carried to the disadvantage of the State.</p>
<p>I abandoned my unsuccessful opposition to Caesar, for I myself proposed the great distinctions which the Senate has recently conferred upon him. Political behaviour should be adjusted to the conditions of the moment. The enemies of Pompey and Caesar should not attack adherents like Balbus, but those leaders themselves. Balbus’ friendship with Caesar, the reward of his services, should stand to his credit. Do not let Caesar hear that Balbus has been condemned, and not for any crime but for his association with him. Pompey’s act of enfranchisement, for which Balbus is on trial, is strongly supported by precedents. Indeed this charge is an indictment of many famous commanders, some now dead, of the Senate, of the Roman People, of our jurors, of states allied with us. Save Balbus from condemnation, not for any offence but for having won the friendship of illustrious men. “You are about to judge, not whether Lucius Cornelius has committed an offence, but whether Gnaeus Pompeius has rendered a service.”</p>
