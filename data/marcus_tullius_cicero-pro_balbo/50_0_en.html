<span class="italic">Cornelia</span> unless they had adopted it themselves, argued that this grant of Roman citizenship to Balbus was invalid. I reply that <span class="italic">civitates foederatae</span> and the Latin states, enjoying an option to adopt such Roman laws as they liked, adopted the lex <span class="italic">Furia</span>, the <span class="italic">lex Voconia,</span> and many other civil laws. That such adoption was not compulsory is clear from the hesitation felt at Heraclea and Neapolis to accept Roman citizenship under the <span class="italic">lex Iulia</span> (90 <span class="sc">b.c.</span>). Formal adoption of a Roman law was necessary when its operation would affect the internal affairs of an allied state, but was not required when the interests of Rome alone were concerned. The privilege enjoyed by <span class="italic">civitates foederatae</span> of adopting Roman laws must in no way restrict the power of Rome to reward by citizenship any special services rendered to her by individual members of such states.</p>

<p>It would be deplorable for Rome to be deprived of the aid in war of citizens of <span class="italic">civitates foederatae</span> like Massilia, Gades and Saguntum, and for the citizens of such states to be debarred from winning Roman citizenship, a reward which is open to members of tributary states, to enemies who have gone over to Roman commanders and even to the slave population. It is illogical to refuse the people of Gades that privilege of citizenship which we have made open even to our enemies. We should be resentful if Gades formally forbade its citizens to serve Rome at their own risks. But that is virtually the effect of the prosecutor’s contention, for he would empower the people of Gades to prevent those who volunteer for Roman service from gaining their due reward.</p>
