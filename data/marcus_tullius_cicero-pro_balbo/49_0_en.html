Political animus should not be carried to extremes, and political behaviour, as Cicero’s own change of attitude towards Caesar had recently demonstrated, should be adapted to the needs of the moment. In enfranchising Balbus Pompey has merely followed admirable precedents, and Balbus should not be condemned either on that score or for having won the friendship of great men.</p>
<p>The following is a summary of the speech.</p>
<p><span class="italic">Sections 1–4.</span></p>
<p>Although, compared with the distinguished counsel who have already defended Balbus, I have little to offer, I can at least express gratitude to my benefactors (Pompey and Balbus). The brilliance of Pompey’s speech was remarkable for one whose military career has denied him opportunity for the study of oratory.</p>
<p><span class="italic">Sections 5–10.</span></p>
<p>Balbus, who is fighting for the citizenship conferred on him by Pompey as a reward for distinguished services in the Sertorian War, is not charged with any offence. He is bearing the brunt of an attack which properly ought to be made against Pompey. But that Pompey is incapable of any unlawful action should be obvious from his brilliant military career, his ability, his high character.</p>

<p>The legality of Pompey’s actions is comparable with the financial integrity of Q. Metellus Numidicus. We should no more call in question Pompey’s respect for laws and treaties than the Athenians could doubt
