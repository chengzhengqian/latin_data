<p>After announcing his theme explicitly (73), he distinguishes real freedom from technical, legal freedom (73–82) and then argues that even if we think we are free, we suffer slavery in many forms because we do not understand the nature of true (Stoic) freedom (83–131). To clarify this, Persius supplies extended examples. The first is slavery to Greed (132–41) and the second slavery to Luxury (141–54)—an “alternating enslavement” (154–6). The next example is introduced with the graphic image of the dog trailing from her neck the chain she has broken (157–60): enslavement to Love (161–75). Finally, after a brief glance at Ambition (176–9), Persius attacks the slavery imposed by Superstition (179–88). Throughout this sermon Persius has presented an extreme version of Stoic attitudes. The only corrective appears in the last lines, with the picture of soldiers with their bulging varicose veins mocking the sentiments of the sermon (189–91). Readers are left to form their own view of the balance between these extremes.</p>
