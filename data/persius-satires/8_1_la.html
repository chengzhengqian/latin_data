<h2><span class="ac">Note on Satire 2</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">Satire 2 maintains the intolerant rejection of contemporary society and its decadent standards from Satire 1. It is presented as a <span class="italic">genethliakon</span> or “birthday poem” to a friend and fellow student of Persius, Plotius Macrinus (whose name may suggest “Long life”), but becomes a fierce diatribe on prayer, a standard philosophical and satirical theme. Persius contrasts the prayers that Macrinus will offer to his <span class="italic">genius</span> (his personal god) with those of the hypocrites who observe proper religious ceremony but secretly pray for money (1–16). He indignantly suggests that God is not fooled by this charade (17–30). He then criticises the foolish prayers of a grandma or superstitious aunt (31–40) and satirises the illogicality of spending one’s wealth on expensive offerings that are designed to win greater wealth (41–51). He condemns the use of gold and other precious substances in temples (52–70). The only acceptable offering consists of “justice and right blended in the spirit, the mind pure in its inner depths and a breast imbued with noble honour” (71–5). This “holier-than-thou” tone adopted by Persius’ persona characterises him as an intolerant prig, who modulates from friendly advice into delivering a sermon to the world.</p>
