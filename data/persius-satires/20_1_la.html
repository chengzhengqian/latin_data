<h2><span class="ac">Note on Satire 4</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">The theme of this Satire is essentially the ancient maxim from Delphi: “Know Yourself.” Persius uses Socrates as the voice of self-knowledge, first in conversation with the young politician Alcibiades, and then in two anecdotes which illustrate people’s lack of self-knowledge. Socrates is first imagined addressing his student, Alcibiades, attacking him for his superficiality, lack of knowledge and expertise, and unfitness to hold political power (1–22). After expressing regret that “No one attempts the descent into themselves, no one!” (23–4), Socrates illustrates how we criticise the faults of others but don’t see our own, in two vignettes (24–42). In the first, an innocent question about a millionaire elicits a savage attack on his stinginess from a third party (25–32). In the second, a complete stranger launches an unprovoked harangue on the immorality of a person who is innocently sunbathing in the nude (33–41). Socrates concludes that we all try to conceal our weaknesses, whatever they are, by pretending they don’t exist (43–50). All this is ammunition for the central, climactic message of the poem (51–2), expressed most memorably in Persius’ typically physical and graphic version of the Delphic maxim, “Spit out what isn’t you.”</p>
