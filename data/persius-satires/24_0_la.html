<h2><span class="ac">Note on Satire 5</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">This, the longest of the poems, draws together many of the themes and characteristics of Persius’ satire. It opens in autobiographical mode with a brief interchange between Persius and his tutor and mentor Lucius Annaeus Cornutus (1–29), in which Cornutus responds to Persius’ wish for the hundred tongues that poets pray for by reminding him that he has no need of anything but his usual “language of the toga” for his purpose of “scraping sick morals” (14–16). In reply, Persius offers a personal tribute to Cornutus: “I offer you my heart for unfolding, and it is my pleasure to demonstrate to you how much of my soul is yours, Cornutus, dear friend” (21–4). Maintaining the autobiographical presentation, Persius recalls how he learned from Cornutus by spending time with him, and concludes that their lives are in harmony (30–51). Whatever the reality of this relationship, its representation here is closely modelled upon Horace’s presentation of his relationship with his father in <span class="italic">Satires</span> 1.4 and 1.6.</p>
<p>As if to prove his hard-line Stoicism to his tutor in philosophy, Persius then proceeds to incorporate into Satire 5 a substantial sermon on the Stoic theme of freedom, modelled upon Horace, <span class="italic">Satires</span> 2.7. As an introduction to his speech, Persius remarks upon the variety of human experience and argues for the importance of philosophy (52–72).</p>
