man wearies of the yoke, by a single step he may pass to freedom. O Life, by the favour of Death I hold thee dear!</p>
<p>Think how great a boon a timely death offers, how many have been harmed by living too long! If Gnaeus Pompeius, that glory and stay of the realm, had been carried off by his illness at Naples,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL254_71_a" id="target_note_LCL254_71_a"><sup>a</sup></a> he would have departed the unchallenged head of the Roman people. But as it was, a very brief extension of time cast him down from his pinnacle. He saw his legions slaughtered before his eyes, and from that battle where the first line was the senate,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL254_71_b" id="target_note_LCL254_71_b"><sup>b</sup></a> he saw—what a melancholy remnant<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL254_71_c" id="target_note_LCL254_71_c"><sup>c</sup></a>!—the commander himself left alive! He saw an Egyptian his executioner, and yielded to a slave a body that was sacrosanct to the victors,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL254_71_d" id="target_note_LCL254_71_d"><sup>d</sup></a> though even had he been unharmed, he would have repented of his escape; for what were baser than that a Pompey should live by the bounty of a king!</p>
<p>If Marcus Cicero had fallen at the moment when he escaped the daggers of Catiline, which were aimed not less at him than at his country, if he had fallen as the saviour of the commonwealth which he had freed, if his death had followed close upon that of his daughter,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL254_71_e" id="target_note_LCL254_71_e"><sup>e</sup></a> even then he might have died happy. He would not have seen swords drawn to take the lives of Roman citizens, nor assassins parcelling out the goods of their victims in order that these might even be murdered at their own cost, nor the spoils of a consul<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL254_71_f" id="target_note_LCL254_71_f"><sup>f</sup></a> put up at
