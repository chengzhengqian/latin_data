public auction, nor murders contracted for officially, nor brigandage and war and pillage—so many new Catilines!</p>
<p>If the sea had swallowed up Marcus Cato as he was returning from Cyprus and his stewardship of the royal legacy,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL254_73_a" id="target_note_LCL254_73_a"><sup>a</sup></a> and along with him even the money which he was bringing to defray the expense of the Civil War, would it not have been a blessing to him? This much at least he might have taken with him then—the conviction that no one would have the effrontery to do wrong in the presence of Cato! As it was, having gained the respite of a very few years, that hero, who was born no less for personal than for political freedom, was forced to flee from Caesar and to submit to Pompey.</p>
<p>To your son, therefore, though his death was premature, it brought no ill; rather has it released him from suffering ills of every sort.</p>
<p>“Yet,” you say, “he perished too soon and before his time.” In the first place, suppose he had survived—grant him the very longest life a man can have—how many years are there after all? Born as we are for the briefest space, and destined soon to yield place to another coming into his lease of time, we view our life as a sojourn at an inn. “Our” life do I say, when Time hurries it on with such incredible swiftness? Count the centuries of cities; you will see how even those that boast of their great age have not existed long. All things human are short-lived and perishable, and fill no part at all of infinite time. This earth with its cities and peoples, its rivers and the girdle of the sea, if measured by the universe, we may count a mere dot; our life, if compared with all time, is relatively even less than a dot; for the compass
