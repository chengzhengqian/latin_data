aloft throughout the universe, and from on high to look down in scorn upon the affairs of men. Hence it is that Plato<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL254_85_a" id="target_note_LCL254_85_a"><sup>a</sup></a> cries out that the wise man reaches out with all his mind toward death, longs for it, thinks upon it, and because of this passion moves through life striving ever for the things beyond.</p>
<p>Tell me, Marcia, when you saw in your son, youth that he was, the wisdom of an old man, a mind victorious over all sensual pleasures, unblemished, faultless, seeking riches without greed, honours without ostentation, pleasures without excess, did you think that you could long have the good fortune to keep him safe and unharmed? Whatever has reached perfection, is near its end. Ideal Virtue hurries away and is snatched from our eyes, and the fruits that ripen in their first days do not wait long for their last. The brighter a fire glows, the more quickly it dies; the fire that is kindled with tough and stubborn wood, and, shrouded in smoke, shines with a murky light is longer lived; for the same condition keeps it alive that provides it grudging food. So with men—the brighter their spirits, the briefer their day; for when there is no room for increase, destruction is near. Fabianus relates—our parents also actually saw him—that there was at Rome a boy who was as tall as a very tall man; but he soon died, and every sensible person said beforehand that he would promptly die, for he could not be expected to reach an age that he had already forestalled. And so it is—ripe maturity is the sign of impending destruction; when growth stops, the end approaches.</p>
