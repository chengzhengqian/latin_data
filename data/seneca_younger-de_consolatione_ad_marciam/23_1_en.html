It was already plain to his eyes that Gnaeus Pompeius would not endure with calmness that any other should become “great” in the commonwealth, and would place a check upon his own advancement, which seemed to cause him offence even when it was increasing to their common interest. Yet within three days he returned to his duties as a general, and conquered his grief as quickly as he was wont to conquer everything.</p>
<p>Why should I recall to you the bereavements of the other Caesars, whom Fortune seems to me at times deliberately to outrage in order that so also they may benefit the human race by showing that not even they who are said to be born from gods, and to be destined to give birth to gods,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL254_47_a" id="target_note_LCL254_47_a"><sup>a</sup></a> can have the same power over their own fortune that they have over the fortune of others. The deified Augustus, when he had lost his children and his grandchildren, and the supply of Caesars had been exhausted, bolstered his depleted house by adoption; nevertheless he bore his lot with the bravery of one who was already counting it a personal affair<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL254_47_b" id="target_note_LCL254_47_b"><sup>b</sup></a> and his deepest concern that no man should make complaint of the gods. Tiberius Caesar lost both the son he had begotten and the son he had adopted<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL254_47_c" id="target_note_LCL254_47_c"><sup>c</sup></a>; nevertheless he himself delivered a panegyric upon his own son<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL254_47_d" id="target_note_LCL254_47_d"><sup>d</sup></a> from the Rostra, and he stood there beside the corpse, which lay in plain view, with but a veil intervening, so that the eyes of a high-priest<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL254_47_e" id="target_note_LCL254_47_e"><sup>e</sup></a> might not look upon a corpse, and, while the Roman people wept, he did not even change countenance. To Sejanus, standing by his side, he offered an example of how patiently he could endure the loss of his dear ones!<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL254_47_f" id="target_note_LCL254_47_f"><sup>f</sup></a></p>
