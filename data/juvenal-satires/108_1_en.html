</a> But the consul<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL091_345_63" id="target_note_LCL091_345_63">
<sup>63</sup>
</a> is alert: he halts your banners. He—a “new man” from Arpinum, of humble origin, a municipal knight new to Rome—posts helmeted troops all around to protect the terrified people and is busy on every hill. So without stepping outside the walls, his peacetime toga brought him as much titled distinction as Octavius grabbed for himself at Leucas and on the fields of Thessaly with his sword wet from nonstop slaughter.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL091_345_64" id="target_note_LCL091_345_64">

<sup>66</sup>
</a> in a national emergency, he alone that protects a trembling Rome. And that’s why, when the ravens flew down to feast on the slaughtered heaps (and they had never fastened on corpses that were bigger), his nobly born fellow consul<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL091_345_67" id="target_note_LCL091_345_67">
<sup>67</sup>
</a> is honoured with the second-place
