<p>Do you wish to be greeted like Sejanus? To be as rich? To dispense the seats of highest office to some, and to appoint others to army commands? To be seen as the emperor’s guardian as he sits on the narrow rock of Capri with his herd of Chaldaeans?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL091_375_15" id="target_note_LCL091_375_15">

</a> I’m sure you’d like his javelins and cohorts and excellent cavalry and personal barracks. Why shouldn’t you? Even people with no desire to kill like to have the power to do so. But what prestige and prosperity is worth having, if success is matched by an equal measure of disasters? Would you prefer to wear the purple-edged toga of the man you see being dragged along, to being “the boss” at Fidenae or Gabii, to laying down the law over weights and measures, to smashing short vessels as aedile-in-rags at deserted Ulubrae?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL091_375_16" id="target_note_LCL091_375_16">

</a> Nothing else but the top position, sought by every trick in the book. Nothing else but ambitious prayers granted by malicious gods. Few kings go down to Ceres’ son-in-law<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL091_375_18" id="target_note_LCL091_375_18">

</a> without slaughter and carnage, few tyrants avoid a bloodless death.</p>
<p>The eloquence and reputation of Demosthenes or Cicero is what boys keep on praying for throughout the spring
