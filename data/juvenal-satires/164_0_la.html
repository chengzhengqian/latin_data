<h2><span class="ac">Note on Satire 14</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">Juvenal commences the poem, the longest in Book Five, with a general discussion of the bad example that parents set to their children (1–58), and advocates responsible, moral behaviour: “You should make yourself refrain” (38). He demonstrates how little thought parents give to their children’s moral well-being (59–85). Two specific examples follow, of fathers who instil in their sons an obsession with building and the practice of Jewish religion (86–106). At this point, Juvenal shifts into the particular topic of avarice (<span class="italic">avaritia</span>), which occupies the rest of the poem. (For other poems combining two topics, see Satires 2, 4, and 12.) This is the only vice which is commended by parents as a virtue (107–22). He shows the ways in which fathers instruct their sons in avarice (123–72 and 179–209), pinpointing avarice as the major cause of crime (173–8). As a warning to fathers who give this kind of training, Juvenal argues that their sons will learn the lesson so well that they will quickly outstrip their fathers, with potentially fatal consequences (210–55). He describes as “an exceptional entertainment” (256) the risks people take for money (256–302). That, combined with the difficulties of hanging onto money, suggests that a minimalist life is preferable
