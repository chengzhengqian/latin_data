<p class="noindent">Whenever a bad example is set, it doesn’t make the perpetrator feel good.

</a> Calvinus, what do you think people feel about this recent crime and about the charge of trust betrayed? Yet it’s not as if you’re a man of such slender means that the burden of a moderate loss will sink you. And your experience is something we see happen all too often. This is a case of bad luck familiar to many people. By now it’s banal, plucked at random from fortune’s heap. Let’s end this excessive grieving. A man’s resentment shouldn’t rage more fiercely than is reasonable, or exceed his injury. You can hardly put up with the tiniest, most minuscule crumb of misery, however trivial. You’re blazing, with your guts in a ferment, because a friend won’t give back the money you entrusted to him.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL091_435_2" id="target_note_LCL091_435_2">

</a> who’s got sixty years behind him? Have you gained no benefit whatsoever from all your experience of the world?</p>
