</a> collapses and spills an upturned mountain on top of the masses, what will be left of the bodies? Who will be able to find any limbs or bones? Every corpse, crushed indiscriminately, will disappear, exactly like its soul. Meanwhile the household is oblivious. By this time they are washing the dishes and puffing at the embers with full cheeks, clattering the oily strigils,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL091_189_48" id="target_note_LCL091_189_48">

So make a wish and a pathetic prayer as you go that they’ll be content with emptying their shallow basins on you. The drunken thug is in agony from failing, by some chance, to attack anyone.
