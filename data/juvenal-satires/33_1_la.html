narrative recounts the advice given and the dismissal of the <span class="italic">consilium</span> (130–49). In the coda, Juvenal expresses the wish that Domitian had always devoted himself to such trivialities (<span class="italic">nugae</span>) instead of committing murder wantonly (150–4), looking forward from the dramatic setting early in Domitian’s reign (see below) to his demise.</p>
<p>With this mock-epic narrative, Juvenal’s satire fulfils the possibility voiced in Satire 1 of satire replacing epic. A mock-epic tone is appropriate when an emperor is the object of attack, but it seems clear that Juvenal is engaging in epic parody with a specific target. Statius, an epic poet writing under Domitian, wrote a poem <span class="italic">On the German War</span> (<span class="italic">De Bello Germanico</span>) praising Domitian’s conduct of the war in 83. The poem (which has not survived) included a catalogue of the emperor’s right-hand men; three names which do survive from the catalogue occur in Juvenal’s poem. The incorporation of epic parody explains the disjunction between the attack on Crispinus and the attack on Domitian, which begins with the invocation of the Muse at 34–6.</p>
