over the bed, at once he sees the temple and the altar of the god he has insulted and—the sight that oppresses his mind with extraordinary sweats—he sees you in his dreams. In his terror, your image, supernatural and larger than life, disturbs him and drives him to confess. These are the men who quake and turn pale at every flash of lightning. Whenever it thunders, they faint at the first rumbling in the sky, as if the fire falls to earth not at random or from the frenzy of the winds, but in anger and as a judgment. If the last storm didn’t do them any harm, they dread the next one with deeper anxiety, as if it were just postponed by this lull. And another thing: if they have started to feel a pain in the side along with a fever that keeps them awake, they believe that illness has been inflicted upon their bodies by an angry power. They think these are the stones and missiles of the gods. They don’t have the courage to pledge a bleating animal to the little shrine or to promise to their hearth gods a cockerel’s crest. After all, is there anything that the guilty can legitimately hope for once they’re ill? Is there any sacrificial victim that doesn’t deserve to live more than they do? When they do something wicked, they have more than enough resolution. It’s only long after the crime has been committed that they begin to get a sense of right and wrong. Yet their nature, which is set and incapable of change, reverts to the ways it has condemned. After all, who ever put a limit on their own wrongdoing? When has the blush of shame been recuperated after it’s been banished from a hardened forehead? Have you ever seen anyone on earth draw the line at a single outrage? Our traitor will put his feet into the trap, and he will face the murky prison’s hook or some craggy rock in the Aegean Sea </p></section><notes></notes></section>
