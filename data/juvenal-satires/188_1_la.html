<h2><span class="ac">Note on Satire 16</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">The incompleteness of this poem precludes an analysis of its structural and thematic features. The stated programme is the advantages of military life (1–2), and in the 60 lines which survive the emphasis is on the immunity and privileges enjoyed by soldiers in legal matters (7–50), with a movement into the topic of financial advantages in the last few lines (51–60). To this extent, the poem appears to continue the earlier themes of the book: crime, punishment, the courts; money, gain, and greed. How the poem continued is open to speculation.</p>
