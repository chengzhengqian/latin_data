<h2><span class="ac">Note on Satire 15</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">The third poem in Book Five is a novel condemnation of anger, anger which manifests itself in the graphic form of religious intolerance, murder, and cannibalism. Juvenal starts by inviting his addressee to join in his amazement at Egyptian religious beliefs which elevate animals to the status of gods and condone the eating of human flesh (1–13), a claim that even Ulysses might have had trouble convincing people of (13–26). In contrast with the uncorroborated stories of Ulysses, Juvenal emphasises that his story, a story of “mob crime,” is from contemporary times (27–32). There follows the narrative of the atrocity (33–92), which occurs in the context of a religious feud between the people of Ombi and of Tentyra. The people of Tentyra attack the people of Ombi while they are off guard at a religious festival, and a brawl ensues. When the Ombites chase the Tentyrans away, one man slips and falls, is torn to bits and eaten raw. Juvenal then ponders other cases of cannibalism, but concludes that cannibalism induced by siege, such as the case of the Vascones, is completely different (93–131). He then praises the uniquely human quality of compassion (131–58), a concept which includes fellow-feeling, pity, a sense of community, and concord. This positive quality he finds missing in contemporary humans: he accordingly declares that some people behave worse than wild beasts (159–74).</p>
