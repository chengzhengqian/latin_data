<h2><span class="ac">Note on Satire 8</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">This poem, the centrepiece of Book Three, is essentially a persuasion addressed to an aristocratic-sounding man, Ponticus, to rely on his own worth and achievements, or rather, a dissuasion from relying on his inheritance, his blue blood, and the achievements of his ancestors. Though Ponticus is not known, his name suggests a descendant of a general who had achieved military success in the Pontic (Black Sea) region. Juvenal poses the central question immediately: “What’s the use of pedigrees?” (1). The theme is a commonplace, but Juvenal’s treatment unusual: he walks through an imaginary aristocratic atrium, pointing out the contradictions between high ancestry and corrupt morality (1–38), asserting that “the one and only nobility is personal excellence” (20). He then turns to Rubellius Blandus, who is puffed up with self-importance, and demands from him personal rather than inherited excellence (39–70). Returning to Ponticus, he repeats his warning and spells out the kind of conduct he would find acceptable (71–86). He imagines Ponticus as the governor of a wealthy province. He advises him to restrain both his own greed (87–126) and that of his entourage (127–41). Juvenal then shifts to another scandal—the consul Lateranus disgracing himself and his ancestors by driving his chariot himself and frequenting low diners, without incurring criticism
