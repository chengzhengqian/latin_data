<h2><span class="ac">Note on Satire 3</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">Satire 2 began with a wish to flee to the edge of the world, but Juvenal evidently remains in Rome. It is his (perhaps fictional) friend Umbricius who leaves the metropolis. Satire 3, the centrepiece of Book One, relays his long speech explaining his departure. Juvenal sets the scene in the prologue: this is a private conversation with Umbricius immediately prior to his departure, in a grotto near the Porta Capena from where the Via Appia headed south. In the description of the grotto—it is artificial and has been taken over by Jewish beggars—and in his own criticisms of the dangers of city life, Juvenal anticipates themes which Umbricius will develop in his long tirade. Accordingly, Umbricius first complains that he is driven from Rome by those who are dishonest and dishonourable (21–57). Then he complains that true Romans like himself are ousted by foreigners, especially, but not exclusively, Greeks (58–125). And then he deplores the displacement of poor clients like himself by the rich (126–314). The poem finishes with a return to the conversational setting as Umbricius wishes his friend goodbye (315–22).</p>
<p>Juvenal continues from Satire 1 the theme of dysfunctional patron-client relationships by giving Umbricius the perspective of an impoverished Roman client. Umbricius also maintains the indignant tone established in Satires 1
