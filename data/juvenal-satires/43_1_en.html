<h2><span class="ac">Satire 5</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">If you are not yet ashamed of your life plan and you persist in your view that the highest good is to live off someone else’s crumbs, if you can endure treatment which not even Sarmentus or abject Gabba would have put up with at Caesar’s hierarchical tables,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL091_215_1" id="target_note_LCL091_215_1">

</a> I’d hesitate to trust your word, even if you were on oath. I know of nothing less demanding than the belly. Yet, suppose you don’t have the little it takes to fill your empty guts, is there no beggar’s pitch vacant? Isn’t there a bridge or the smaller half of a shared mat anywhere?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL091_215_2" id="target_note_LCL091_215_2">

</a> Is the insult of a dinner worth so much? Is your hunger so famished? Wouldn’t it be more dignified to shiver where you are and gnaw filthy bits of dog’s bread?</p>
<p>In the first place, get this straight: an invitation to dinner is payment in full for your long-standing services. The reward of Great Friendship is—food. Your Lord enters this as a debt, yes, a debt, however infrequent. So if after two months it’s his whim to invite his forgotten client, so the third cushion on some empty couch won’t be vacant,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL091_215_3" id="target_note_LCL091_215_3">
