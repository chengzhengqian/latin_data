<h2><span class="ac">Note on Satire 12</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">The final poem in Book Four also has an addressee with a significant name. In the first part of the poem (1–16) Juvenal describes to Corvinus a sacrifice he is offering for the safe return of his friend Catullus from near shipwreck. This leads him into a lengthy mock-epic narrative of Catullus’ danger and his escape from the storm (17–82). Juvenal then returns to the opening context of his sacrifice (83–92), and reassures Corvinus that he is not sacrificing because he is after Catullus’ money (93–8). The remainder of the poem is a condemnation of legacy-hunters (a frequent theme of Horace, e.g. <span class="italic">Satires</span> 2.5). The final section of the poem may initially appear to have little connection with the first part. But the realisation that friendship is the central theme—true friendship, as shown by Juvenal in his celebration of his friend’s survival, and false friendship, as shown by the legacy-hunters—gives the poem shape and coherence. Moreover, if the addressee is himself a legacy-hunter, as his name (“raven,” a carrion-eating bird) seems to suggest, this makes even better sense of the themes and structure of the poem.</p>
