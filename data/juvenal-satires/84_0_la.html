<p class="noindent">The opening of Satire 7, the first poem of Book Three, marks a new departure for Juvenal: there are no angry questions or marks of indignation. This is a new, calmer persona who is even capable of optimism—for a moment—concerning the prospects for poets of patronage by the emperor (1–21), even if the usual pessimism of satire then takes over. In contrast with his optimism regarding imperial support, Juvenal is in no doubt that other patrons will do anything to avoid supporting poets (22–97). At this point, he moves on to the prospects for patronage and payment of other writers and intellectuals. Writers of history fare no better than poets (98–105). Advocates (<span class="italic">causidici</span>, that is, those who exercise their rhetorical skills in court) find that the rewards are thin (106–49) and so do the teachers of rhetoric (<span class="italic">rhetores</span>, 150–215), and schoolteachers (<span class="italic">grammatici</span>, 216–43). Yet this is not a simple lament on behalf of unappreciated clients. At the same time, by undermining the value of their skills and expertise, Juvenal hints that these intellectuals may not deserve patronage. The poem revisits the treatment of clients by patrons in Book One, but with a world-weary, ironic detachment which deplores but accepts the conduct of both parties. The clear structure of the poem enhances the impression
