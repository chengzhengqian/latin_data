<h2><span class="ac">Note on Satire 2</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">The next poem continues the themes and tone established in Satire 1. The victims in Satire 2 are men who behave effeminately and who prefer the passive role in same-sex relationships (pathics), an elaboration of the theme of deviations from the “norm” in Satire 1. The attack starts in the familiar indignant tone, first aimed at hypocritical Stoic moralists who try to hide their effeminacy (1–35), with the claim (line 8): “There’s no trusting appearances.” This angry condemnation is supplemented by more detached and ironic comments from a woman Laronia, evidently an adulteress, who defends her own sex against attacks by the moralists; this drives the hypocrites away (36–65). Juvenal then attacks another set of hypocrites, those aristocrats who make no secret of their proclivities while they pronounce upon morality (65–78). After a graphic image of contagion spreading from the centre (78–81), the attack then switches to closet (but not hypocritical) effeminates and pathics (82–116), then to those who expose their sexuality overtly, by making no secret of getting married and by entering the gladiatorial arena in a humiliating, shameful role (117–48). Juvenal closes the poem with a picture of the disgrace felt by the ghosts of famous, manly Romans in the Underworld (149–59) and with the phenomenon of young foreigners being morally corrupted by their visits to Rome (159–70).</p>
