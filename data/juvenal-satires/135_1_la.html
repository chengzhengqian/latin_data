<h2><span class="ac">Note on Satire 11</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">The next poem in Book Four opens with a contradiction between two extremes of behaviour, like Horace <span class="italic">Satires</span> 1.1–3, and emphasises the importance of self-knowledge, recalling Horace’s stress upon the “mean” in those and other poems (1–55). With the question “Do I practise what I preach?” (56) Juvenal introduces the theme of self-consistency and shifts into an epistolary style. The remainder of the poem is an invitation to dinner, reminiscent of Horace’s dinner invitation poem, <span class="italic">Epistles</span> I.5, addressed to someone called Persicus, a name that conjures up luxurious and exotic tastes (56–63). Juvenal outlines the food that will be served (64–89), the decor of the diningroom (90–135), the slaves who will serve at table (136–61), and the entertainments the guests will enjoy (162–82), all liberally spiced with antitheses designed to underline the moral value of the dinner here proposed. Juvenal concludes by inviting his addressee to leave behind his worries and give himself a holiday (183–208) with this country feast he proposes in the middle of the city—a paradox. The tone seems much more genial, but the satiric sting may reside in the addressee’s name, because if Persicus is accustomed to dining lavishly, this invitation may be construed as a reproach.</p>
