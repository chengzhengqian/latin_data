difference is that in Greek tragedy such crimes were committed out of passion, but now the motive is money (638–52). The poem finishes with a vision of a Rome populated by modern Clytemnestras—women who are intent on killing their husbands (652–61). This is clearly designed as the clinching argument against getting married. But in the course of this rant, essentially lacking in structure, Juvenal’s satiric persona has revealed himself as a misogynist who would find fault with any wife. This extreme creation—a truly epic satirist who reaches his climax with a simile worthy of epic (649–50)—seems to be as far as indignation can go. It is not surprising that Juvenal adopts a new approach in his next book of Satires.</p>
