<h2><span class="ac">Note on Satire 5</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">One of the themes of Satire 4 is the misuse of power and the complicity of those surrounding the source of power. Returning to the patron-client relationship, Satire 5 treats the same theme on a smaller scale than emperor-courtier. The poem presents the total breakdown of the patron-client relationship, which was supposed to be based upon mutual benefits and services. The breakdown is represented graphically by the two separate menus at the dinner (24–155), one for the patron and his peers, the other for the lowly clients. The double menu runs as follows: wine (24–37), wine cups (37–48), water (49–52), waiters (52–65), bread (66–79), starters (80–91), seafood dishes (92–106), the meat and truffles served to the patron but not the client (114–24), mushrooms (146–8), and apples (149–55). The description of the two-menu dinner is a vehement condemnation of the patron for failing to behave like patrons in the “good old days.” It is framed by passages in which Juvenal criticises the lowly client for enduring such humiliation (1–23 and 156–73) and interrupted by a request that the patron simply dine with his clients “on equal terms” (107–13), a plea that falls on deaf ears. The gulf is too wide for there to be any communication (125–31).</p>
