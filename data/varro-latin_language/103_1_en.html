of the Lower World,’ because at that time expiatory sacrifices are made to them; but I think that it was called February rather from the <span class="italic">dies februatus</span> ‘Purification Day,’ because then the people <span class="italic">februatur</span> ‘is purified,’ that is, the old Palatine town girt with flocks of people is passed around by the naked Luperci.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL333_207_e" id="target_note_LCL333_207_e"><sup>e</sup></a></p>
<p>V. 35. As to what pertains to Latin names of time ideas, let that which has been said up to this point be enough. Now I shall speak of what concerns those things which might be observed as taking place at some special time<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL333_207_a" id="target_note_LCL333_207_a"><sup>a</sup></a>—such as the following: <span class="italic">legisti</span> ‘thou didst read,’ <span class="italic">cursus</span> ‘act of running,’ <span class="italic">ludens</span> ‘playing.’ With regard to these there are two things which I wish to say in advance: how great their number is, and what features are less perspicuous than others.</p>
<p>36. The inflections of words are of four kinds: one which indicates the time and does not have <span class="italic">leges</span> ‘thou wilt gather or read,’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL333_207_a" id="target_note_LCL333_207_a"><sup>a</sup></a> <span class="italic">lege</span> ‘read thou,’ from <span class="italic">lego</span> ‘I gather or read’; a second, which has case and does not indicate time, as from lego lectio ‘collection, act of reading,’ <span class="italic">lector</span> ‘reader’; the third, which has both, time and case, as from <span class="italic">lego legens</span> ‘reading,’ <span class="italic">lecturus</span> ‘being about to read’; the third, which has neither, as from <span class="italic">lego lecte</span> ‘choicely,’ <span class="italic">lectissime</span> ‘most choicely.’ Therefore if the primitives of these words amount to one thousand, as Cosconius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL333_207_ba" id="target_note_LCL333_207_ba"><sup>b</sup></a> writes, then from the inflections of these words the different forms can be five hundred thousand in number for the reason that from each and every primitive word about five hundred forms are made by derivation and inflection.</p>
