Lesbos, and so on from other localities. Likewise <span class="italic">unguenta</span> ‘perfumes’ themselves are now properly spoken of in the plural, for of perfume there are now a number of kinds. If in like fashion there were great differences in olive-oil and vinegar and the other articles of this sort, in common use, then we should employ the plurals <span class="italic">olea</span> and <span class="italic">aceta</span>, like <span class="italic">vina</span>.
