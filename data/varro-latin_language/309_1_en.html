as I have said, a <span class="italic">proloquium</span> or ‘forthright statement’; but by Marcus Cicero<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL334_621_d" id="target_note_LCL334_621_d"><sup>d</sup></a> a <span class="italic">pronuntiatum</span> or ‘pronouncement,’ a word however which he declared that he used “only until I can find a better one.”</p>
<p>(9) But what the Greeks call a συνημμένον ἀξίωμα or ‘connected axiom,’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL334_621_e" id="target_note_LCL334_621_e"><sup>e</sup></a> some of our countrymen call <span class="italic">adiunctum</span> ‘adjoined,’ others call <span class="italic">conexum</span> ‘connected.’ The following are examples of this: “If Plato is walking, Plato is moving”; “If it is day, the sun is above the earth.” (10) Also what they call συμπεπλεγμένον or a ‘compound axiom,’ we call <span class="italic">coniunctum</span> ‘conjoined’ or <span class="italic">copulatum</span> ‘coupled’; for example: “Publius Scipio, son of Paulus, was twice consul and celebrated a triumph, and held the censorship, and was the colleague of Lucius Mummius in his consulship.” (11) But if in the whole of a proposition of this kind one member is false, even if the others are true, the whole is said to be false. For if to all those true statements which I have made about that Scipio<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL334_621_f" id="target_note_LCL334_621_f"><sup>f</sup></a> I add “and he worsted Hannibal in Africa,” which is false, all those other statements which have been made in conjunction will not be true, on account of this one false statement which has been added to them, because they will now all be spoken of together as one statement of fact.</p>
<p>(12) There is also another form, which the Greeks call a διεζευγμένον ἀξίωμα or ‘disjunctive proposition,’ and we call <span class="italic">disiunctum</span> ‘separated.’ For example: “Pleasure is either good or evil, or it is neither good nor evil.” (13) Now all statements which are contrasted ought to be opposed to each other, and their opposites, which the Greeks call ἀντικείμενα, ought also to be opposed.
