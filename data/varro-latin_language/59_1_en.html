<p>123.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL333_119_a" id="target_note_LCL333_119_a"><sup>a</sup></a> The source of a drink is aqua ‘water,’ so called because its surface is <span class="italic">aequa</span> ‘level.’ A <span class="italic">fans</span> ‘spring’ is that from which running water <span class="italic">funditur</span> ‘is poured’ out of the earth, just as a <span class="italic">fistula</span> ‘pipe’ is that from which there is a <span class="italic">fusus</span> ‘outpour’ of water. The <span class="italic">sinum</span> is a wine-jar of a larger sort, called from <span class="italic">sinus</span> ‘belly,’ because the <span class="italic">sinum</span> had a greater cavity than cups. Likewise there are those called <span class="italic">lepestae,</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL333_119_b" id="target_note_LCL333_119_b"><sup>b</sup></a> the kind of wine-jars that are even now, on the days of the Sabine festivals, placed on the table of the gods; I have found in ancient Greek writers a kind of cup called δεπέστα,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL333_119_c" id="target_note_LCL333_119_c"><sup>c</sup></a> for which reason the source of the name quite certainly set out from there into the Sabine and Roman territory.</p>
<p>124. Those who were giving wine in such a way as to pour it little by little, called the vessel a <span class="italic">guttus</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL333_119_a" id="target_note_LCL333_119_a"><sup>a</sup></a> ‘cruet,’ from the <span class="italic">guttae</span> ‘drops’; those who were taking it little by little from a larger container, called the instrument a <span class="italic">simpuvium</span> ‘dipping ladle,’ from <span class="italic">sumere</span> ‘to take out.’ Into its place, in banquets, there came from Greece the <span class="italic">epichysis</span> ‘pouring ladle’ and the <span class="italic">cyathus</span> ‘dipping ladle’; but in the sacrifices the <span class="italic">guttus</span> and the <span class="italic">simpuvium</span> remained in use.</p>
<p>125. A second kind of table for vessels was of stone, an oblong rectangle with one pedestal; it was called a <span class="italic">cartibulum.</span> When I was a boy this used to be placed in many persons’ houses near the opening in the roof of the court, and on and around it were set bronze vessels; perhaps <span class="italic">cartibulum</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL333_119_a" id="target_note_LCL333_119_a"><sup>a</sup></a> was said from <span class="italic">gerere</span> ‘to carry.’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL333_119_b" id="target_note_LCL333_119_b"><sup>b</sup></a></p>
