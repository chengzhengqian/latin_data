shall therefore go back and start from the origin of the likenesses which must be followed or avoided in the comparison of words and in their inflections.</p>
<p>14. The first division in speech is that some words are not changed into any other form whatsoever, like <span class="italic">vix</span> ‘hardly’ and <span class="italic">mox</span> ‘soon,’ and others are inflected, like genitive <span class="italic">limae</span> from <span class="italic">lima</span> ‘file,’ imperfect <span class="italic">ferebam</span> from <span class="italic">fero</span> ‘I bear’; and since Regularity cannot be present except in words which are inflected, he who says that <span class="italic">mox</span> and <span class="italic">nox</span> ‘night’ are alike, is mistaken, because the two words are not of the same kind, since <span class="italic">nox</span> must come under the system of case-forms, but <span class="italic">mox</span> must not and cannot.</p>
<p>15. The second division is that, of the words which can be changed by derivation and inflection, some are changed in accordance with will, and others in accordance with nature. I call it will, when from a name a person sets a name on something else, as <span class="italic">Romulus</span> gave a name to <span class="italic">Roma</span>; I call it nature, when we all accept a name but do not ask of the one who set it how he wishes it to be inflected, but ourselves inflect it, as genitive <span class="italic">Romae</span>, accusative <span class="italic">Romam</span>, ablative <span class="italic">Roma</span>. Of these two parts, voluntary derivation goes back to usage, and natural goes back to logical system.</p>
<p>16. For this reason we ought not to compare <span class="italic">Romanus</span> ‘Roman’ and <span class="italic">Capuanus</span> ‘Capuan’ as alike, and to say that <span class="italic">Capuanus</span> ought to be said from <span class="italic">Capua</span> just as <span class="italic">Romanus</span> is from <span class="italic">Roma</span>; for in such there is in actual usage an extreme fluctuation, since those who derive the words set the names on the things with utter lack of skill, and when usage has accepted the words from them, it must of necessity speak confused names variously derived.
