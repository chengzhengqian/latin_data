exists, when it passes from some form to another form in the same way in which that other word passes with which it is being compared.</p>
<p>78. There is the addition “not inconsistent with common usage,” because usage tolerates some words inflected contrary to the old practice, as it suffered Hortensius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL334_593_a" id="target_note_LCL334_593_a"><sup>a</sup></a> to say <span class="italic">cervix</span> ‘neck’ instead of the plural <span class="italic">cervices,</span> but does not tolerate certain others, as when you should say <span class="italic">faux</span> ‘throat’ instead of the plural <span class="italic">fauces</span>. When the addition “within a certain range”
is made, it means that in the relevant words not all the forms are in use, as, for example, there is derived from <span class="italic">amo</span> ‘I love’ and <span class="italic">vivo</span> ‘I live’ the passive <span class="italic">amor</span> but not the passive <span class="italic">vivor.</span></p>
<p>V. 79. What <span class="italic">Analogia</span> or Regularity in speech is seen to be and what categories it has, and which of these seem essential to follow, I have set forth as briefly as I could. Now I shall speak of the categories in which it ought not to exist and yet it is usually looked for just as if it ought to be there; these are in general of four kinds. First, Regularity ought not to be looked for in such words as are not inflected, for example <span class="italic">nequam</span> ‘worthless,’ <span class="italic">mox</span> ‘soon,’
<span class="italic">vix</span> ‘hardly.’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL334_593_a" id="target_note_LCL334_593_a"><sup>a</sup></a></p>
<p>80. Among these, a greater error is made in one word than in another. For they grant that <span class="italic">mox</span> and <span class="italic">vix</span> have no cases, but assert that <span class="italic">nequam</span> has, because we use it with nominative <span class="italic">hic</span> ‘this,’
with genitive <span class="italic">huius,</span> with dative <span class="italic">huic</span>. For when we say <span class="italic">hic nequam</span> and <span class="italic">huius nequam</span>, then we are uttering the cases of this man whom we wish to show as worthless, and before the word we then set <span class="italic">hic</span> to represent the name of him whose worthlessness we are considering.</p>
