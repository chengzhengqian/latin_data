the hand and say “with this <span class="italic">aes</span> ‘copper piece’ and <span class="italic">aenea libra</span> ‘pound of copper,’”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL334_507_c" id="target_note_LCL334_507_c"><sup>c</sup></a> and also in the legal formula “to have bequeathed a thousand (<span class="italic">asses</span>) of <span class="italic">aes</span> ‘copper.’”</p>
<p>84. Therefore, because the numerals from <span class="italic">tressis</span> to <span class="italic">centussis</span> are compounded of parts of the same kind, they have a likeness of the same kind; but the word <span class="italic">dupondius</span>, because it is different in formation, has a different system of declension, as it should have. So also the <span class="italic">as</span>, because it is a single unit and is the beginning, means one and has its own indefinite plural, for we say <span class="italic">asses</span>; but when we limit them numerically, we say <span class="italic">dupondius</span> and <span class="italic">tressis</span> and so on.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL334_507_a-1a" id="target_note_LCL334_507_a-1a"><sup>a</sup></a></p>
<p>85. Thus it seems to me that since the definite and the indefinite have an inherent difference, the two ought not to be spoken in the same fashion, the more so because in the words themselves, when they are attached to a definite number in the thousands, a form is used which is not the same as that used in other expressions. For they speak thus: <span class="italic">mille denarium</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL334_507_a-2" id="target_note_LCL334_507_a-2"><sup>a</sup></a>
‘thousand of <span class="italic">denarii</span>,’ not <span class="italic">denariorum</span>, and two <span class="italic">milia denarium</span> ‘thousands of <span class="italic">denarii</span>,’ not <span class="italic">denariorum</span>. If it were <span class="italic">denarii</span> in the nominative and it denoted an indefinite quantity, then it ought to be <span class="italic">denariorum</span> in the genitive; and the same distinction must be preserved, it seems to me, not only in <span class="italic">denarii, victoriati</span>,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL334_507_b-2" id="target_note_LCL334_507_b-2"><sup>b</sup></a> <span class="italic">drachmae</span>, and <span class="italic">nummi</span>, but also in <span class="italic">viri</span>, when we say
