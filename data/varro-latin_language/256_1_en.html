spoken words rest not only upon their form, but also upon some attached strength and power which is usually hidden from our eyes and ears. Therefore we often say that two apples that are identical in appearance are not alike, if they are of different flavour; and we say that some horses of the same appearance are not alike, if by breed they are different on the sire’s side.</p>
<p>93. Therefore in buying human beings as slaves, we pay a higher price for one that is better by nationality.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL334_515_a" id="target_note_LCL334_515_a"><sup>a</sup></a> And in all these matters we take the points of likeness not merely from the appearance, but also from other factors, as in horses their age, in asses the kind of colts that they beget, in fruits the flavour of their juice. If therefore one proceeds in the same way in deciding whether words are alike, he is not to be found fault with.</p>
<p>94. Wherefore as the pronoun<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL334_515_a" id="target_note_LCL334_515_a"><sup>a</sup></a> is sometimes taken as an aid to distinguish the resemblances, so we take some case-form, as in <span class="italic">nemus</span> ‘grove’ and <span class="italic">lepus</span> ‘hare,’ <span class="italic">lepus</span> being shown by it to be masculine and <span class="italic">nemus</span> neuter: therefore they go in different directions and the plurals are <span class="italic">lepores</span> and <span class="italic">nemora</span>. So also, if anything else whatsoever is taken from outside to enable a thorough examination of the problem of likeness to be made, it will not be too far from the natural qualities: for you cannot even see whether two magnetic stones are alike or not, unless you have brought close to them from outside a particle of steel, which like magnets attract to a like degree, and magnets different in strength attract with different powers.</p>
