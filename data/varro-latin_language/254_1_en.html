<p>88. To these, their descendants added a third and a fourth act, imposing names which started from <span class="italic">deciens</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL334_511_a" id="target_note_LCL334_511_a"><sup>a</sup></a> ‘million’ and <span class="italic">deciens miliens</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL334_511_b" id="target_note_LCL334_511_b"><sup>b</sup></a> ‘thousand million’; and though the names were not formed by logical relation with the lower numerals, still their formation is not in conflict with the Regularity about which we are writing. For inasmuch as <span class="italic">deciens</span> is used as a neuter singular like <span class="italic">mille</span>, so that both words are without change of form for the various cases,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL334_511_c" id="target_note_LCL334_511_c"><sup>c</sup></a> we shall use <span class="italic">deciens</span> unchanged as nominative and as genitive, even as we do <span class="italic">mille</span>; and none the less shall we set before <span class="italic">mille</span> the signs of nominative and of genitive plural, because <span class="italic">mille</span> is also in the other number—and so also shall we speak of’ these <span class="italic">deciens</span>’ in the same cases.</p>
<p>L. 89. When a noun is the same in the nominative though it has more than one meaning, in which instance they call it a homonymy, Regularity does not prevent the oblique cases from the same starting form in which the homonymy is, from being dissimilar. Therefore we say <span class="italic">Argus</span> in the masculine, when we mean the man, but when we mean the town we say, in Greek or in the Greek fashion, <span class="italic">Argos</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL334_511_a" id="target_note_LCL334_511_a"><sup>a</sup></a> in the neuter, though in Latin it is <span class="italic">Argi,</span> masculine plural. Likewise, if the same word denotes both a noun and a verb, we shall cause it to be inflected both for cases and for tenses, with different inflection for noun and verb, so that from <span class="italic">Meto</span> as a noun, a man’s name, we form gen. <span class="italic">Metonis</span>, acc. <span class="italic">Metonem</span>, but from <span class="italic">meto</span> as a verb, ‘I reap,’ we form the future <span class="italic">metam</span> and the imperfect <span class="italic">metebam.</span></p>
