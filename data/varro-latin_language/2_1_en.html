Of these two matters I shall speak in the following books, not keeping them apart, but giving less attention to the second.</p>
<p>3. These relations are often rather obscure for the following reasons: Not every word that has been applied, still exists, because lapse of time has blotted out some. Not every word that is in use, has been applied without inaccuracy of some kind, nor does every word which has been applied correctly remain as it originally was; for many words are disguised by change of the letters. There are some whose origin is not from native words of our own language. Many words indicate one thing now, but formerly meant something else, as is the case with <span class="italic">hostis</span> ‘enemy’: for in olden times by this word they meant a foreigner from a country independent of Roman laws, but now they give the name to him whom they then called <span class="italic">perduellis</span> ‘enemy.’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL333_5_a" id="target_note_LCL333_5_a"><sup>a</sup></a></p>
<p>4. I shall take as starting-point of my discussion that derivative or case-form of the words in which the origin can be more clearly seen. It is evident that we ought to operate in this way, because when we say <span class="italic">inpos</span> ‘lacking power’ in the nominative, it is less clear that it is from <span class="italic">potentia</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL333_5_a" id="target_note_LCL333_5_a"><sup>a</sup></a> ‘power’ than when we
