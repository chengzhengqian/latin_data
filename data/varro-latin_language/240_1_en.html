or what is neither, the nature of the male does not shift, nor that of the female, nor the neuter nature, and for this reason there is no saying of <span class="italic">feminus</span>, <span class="italic">femina, feminum</span>, and so with the rest. Therefore they are called by special and separate words.</p>
<p>58. Wherefore in the names of those things in which there is no likeness of nature or of use as the basis, a relation of this sort ought not to be sought. Accordingly, as a <span class="italic">surdus</span> ‘deaf’ man is a current term, and a <span class="italic">surda</span> woman, so also is a <span class="italic">surdum</span> theatre,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL334_483_a" id="target_note_LCL334_483_a"><sup>a</sup></a> because all three things are equally intended for the act of hearing. On the other hand, nobody says a <span class="italic">surdum</span> sleeping-room, because it is intended for silence and not for hearing; but if it has no window, it is called <span class="italic">caecum</span> ‘blind,’ as a man is called <span class="italic">caecus</span> and a woman <span class="italic">caeca</span>, because not all sleeping-rooms have the light which they ought to have.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL334_483_b" id="target_note_LCL334_483_b"><sup>b</sup></a></p>
<p>59. The male and the female have by nature a certain association with each other; but the neuters have no association with them, because they are different from them in kind, and even of these neuters there are very few which have any elements in common with other neuters. As for the fact that the names of a god and of a slave do not vary like our free names, there is the same reason, namely that the variation is connected with use, and had to be established with reference to free persons, but as to the rest had no consequence, because among slaves the clan quality has no foundation in practice, but it is necessary in the names of us who are in Latium and are free. Therefore in that class Regularity makes its appearance, and we say <span class="italic">Terentius</span> for a man, <span class="italic">Terentia</span> for a woman, and <span class="italic">Terentium</span> for the <span class="italic">genus</span> ‘stock.’</p>
