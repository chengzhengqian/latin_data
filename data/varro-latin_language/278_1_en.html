<p>31. The second subdivision<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL334_559_a" id="target_note_LCL334_559_a"><sup>a</sup></a> consists of those words which have tenses but not cases, and have persons. The categories of their inflections are six<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL334_559_b" id="target_note_LCL334_559_b"><sup>b</sup></a>: one which is that of the tenses, as <span class="italic">legebam</span> ‘I was reading,’ <span class="italic">gemebam</span> ‘I was groaning,’ <span class="italic">lego</span> ‘I read,’ <span class="italic">gemo</span> ‘I groan’; the second is that of the persons, as <span class="italic">sero</span> ‘I sow,’ <span class="italic">meto</span> ‘I reap,’ <span class="italic">seris</span> ‘thou sowest,’ <span class="italic">metis</span> ‘thou reapest’; the third is the interrogative, as <span class="italic">scribone</span> ‘do I write?’, <span class="italic">legone</span> ‘do I read?’, <span class="italic">scribisne, legisne</span>; the fourth is that of the answer, as <span class="italic">fingo</span> ‘I form,’ <span class="italic">pingo</span> ‘I paint,’ <span class="italic">fingis, pingis</span>; the fifth that of the wish, as <span class="italic">dicerem</span> ‘would I were saying,’ <span class="italic">facerem</span> ‘would I were making,’ <span class="italic">dicam</span> ‘may I say,’ <span class="italic">faciam</span> ‘may I make’; the sixth that of the command, as <span class="italic">cape</span> ‘take,’ <span class="italic">rape</span> ‘seize,’ <span class="italic">capito, rapito.</span></p>
<p>32. Likewise there are four categories of inflections which have tenses without persons<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL334_559_a" id="target_note_LCL334_559_a"><sup>a</sup></a>: in the interrogative, as <span class="italic">foditurne</span> ‘is digging going on? <span class="italic">seriturne</span> ‘is sowing going on?’ and <span class="italic">fodieturne</span> ‘will digging be done?’, <span class="italic">sereturne</span> ‘will sowing be done?’; of the category for the answer the same forms are used, but without the last syllable <span class="italic">ne</span>; the category for the wish, as <span class="italic">vivatur</span> ‘may there be living,’ <span class="italic">ametur</span> ‘may there be loving,’ <span class="italic">viveretur</span> ‘would there were living,’ <span class="italic">amaretur</span> ‘would there were loving.’ Whether the inflections for the impersonal command exist, is somewhat doubtful; there is also doubt about the scheme of the forms, which is given as <span class="italic">paretur</span> ‘let there be preparation,’ <span class="italic">pugnetur</span> ‘let there be righting,’ or <span class="italic">parator, pugnator.</span></p>
<p>33. There are added to these categories those which proceed from the four sets of pairs<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL334_559_a" id="target_note_LCL334_559_a"><sup>a</sup></a> consisting of the divisions: from that of the incomplete and the completed, as <span class="italic">emo</span> ‘I buy’ and <span class="italic">edo</span> ‘I eat,’ <span class="italic">emi</span> ‘I
