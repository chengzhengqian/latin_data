put down verb-forms from a division of one kind, they would not differ from one another; for all the forms denoting incomplete action are alike single, and the forms of completed action are in all verbs double, quite like one another: such as <span class="italic">amabar, amor, amabor</span>, and <span class="italic">amatus eram, amatus sum, amatus ero.</span></p>
<p>98. Wherefore likewise they do ill to cite <span class="italic">ferio</span> ‘I strike,’ future <span class="italic">feriam</span>, perfect <span class="italic">percussi</span>; because the proper order is <span class="italic">ferio, feriam, feriebam,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL334_519_a" id="target_note_LCL334_519_a"><sup>a</sup></a></span> and <span class="italic">percussi, percussero, percusseram.</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL334_519_b" id="target_note_LCL334_519_b"><sup>b</sup></a> And in this fashion answer can be made to the one who finds fault in the matter of the other tenses.</p>
<p>LVI. 99. They make a similar mistake who say that all verbs ought to change the radical syllables in both divisions, or no verb should—as in <span class="italic">pungo</span> ‘I prick,’ future <span class="italic">pungam</span>, perfect <span class="italic">pupugi</span>, and <span class="italic">tundo</span> ‘I pound,’ <span class="italic">tundam, tutudi</span>; for they are comparing unlikes, namely verbs of the incomplete phase with the completed. But if they were comparing only the incomplete, then all the stems of the verb would be seen to be unchangeable, as in <span class="italic">pungebam, pungo, pungam</span>, and on the other hand changeable, if they instanced the completed, as in <span class="italic">pupugeram, pupugi, pupugero.</span></p>
<p>LVII. 100. Likewise they do ill to compare <span class="italic">fui</span> ‘I was,’ <span class="italic">sum</span> ‘I am,’ <span class="italic">ero</span> ‘I shall be’; for <span class="italic">fui</span> is a form of completed time, whose series is consistent with itself in all its parts, as it should be, namely <span class="italic">fueram</span>, <span class="italic">fui, fuero.</span> Of the incomplete, that which is now pronounced <span class="italic">sum</span> used to be spoken <span class="italic">esum</span>,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL334_519_a" id="target_note_LCL334_519_a"><sup>a</sup></a> and the series is consistent in all its persons, because they
