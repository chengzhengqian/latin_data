In first names the situation is not the same, because these were in practice established as individual names, by which the clan names might be differentiated; from the numerals came Secunda, Tertia, Quarta for women, Quintus, Sextus, Decimus for men, and similarly other names from other things. When there were two or more persons of the name Terentius, then that they might have something individual to distinguish them they marked them perhaps in this way,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL334_485_a" id="target_note_LCL334_485_a"><sup>a</sup></a> that he should be Manius who was said to have been born <span class="italic">mane</span> ‘in the morning,’ and he who has been born <span class="italic">luci</span> ‘at dawn’ should be Lucius, and he who was born <span class="italic">post</span> ‘after’ his father’s death should be Postumus.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL334_485_b" id="target_note_LCL334_485_b"><sup>b</sup></a></p>

<p>62. Therefore as far as the nature and the use of a word have jointly advanced, so far has Regularity been extended in like manner by a corresponding relationship, since of the words in which there are voluntary inflections of male and female and neuter, those which are voluntary in inflection ought not to be inflected in similar manner, but in those in which there are natural inflections there are those regular
