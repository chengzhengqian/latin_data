a fine was imposed in <span class="italic">pecus</span> ‘cattle’ and there was a collection into the state treasury, of what had been diverted.</p>
<p>96. Regarding cattle from which there is larger profit, there is the same use of names here as among the Greeks: <span class="italic">sus</span> ‘swine,’ the same as ὗς; <span class="italic">bos</span> ‘cow,’ the same as βοῦς; <span class="italic">taurus</span> ‘bull,’ the same as ταῦρος; likewise <span class="italic">ovis</span> ‘sheep,’ the same as ὄις<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL333_93_a" id="target_note_LCL333_93_a"><sup>a</sup></a>: for thus the ancients used to say, not πρόβατον as they do now. This identity of the names in Latium and in Greece may be the result of invention after the natural utterances of the animals. <span class="italic">Armenta</span> ‘plough-oxen,’ because they raised oxen especially that they might select some of them for <span class="italic">arandum</span> ‘ploughing’; thence they were called <span class="italic">arimenta,</span> from which the third letter I was afterwards squeezed out. <span class="italic">Vitulus</span> calf,’ because in Greek it was anciently ἰταλός<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL333_93_b" id="target_note_LCL333_93_b"><sup>b</sup></a>; or from <span class="italic">vegitulus,</span> a name given because most calves are <span class="italic">vegeti</span> ‘frisky.’ A <span class="italic">iuvencus</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL333_93_c" id="target_note_LCL333_93_c"><sup>c</sup></a> ‘bullock’ was one which could now <span class="italic">iuvare</span> ‘help’ in tilling the fields.</p>
<p>97. <span class="italic">Capra</span> ‘she-goat’ was originally <span class="italic">carpa</span> ‘cropper,’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL333_93_a" id="target_note_LCL333_93_a"><sup>a</sup></a> from which is written</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Hircus</span> ‘buck,’ which the Sabines call <span class="italic">fircus</span>; and what there is <span class="italic">fedus,</span> in Latium is <span class="italic">hedus</span> ‘kid’ in the country, and in the City it is <span class="italic">haedus,</span> with an added A, as is the case with many words. <span class="italic">Porcus</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL333_93_b" id="target_note_LCL333_93_b"><sup>b</sup></a> ‘pig,’ because the Sabines say <span class="italic">aprunus</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL333_93_c" id="target_note_LCL333_93_c"><sup>c</sup></a> <span class="italic">porcus</span> ‘boar pig’; therefore <span class="italic">porcus</span> ‘pig,’ unless it comes from the Greeks, because at Athens in the <span class="italic">Books of the Sacrifices</span> πόρκη ‘female pig’ is written, and πόρκος ‘male pig.’</p>
