<p>42. The poets make a great use of this kind of relationship in their similes,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL334_567_a" id="target_note_LCL334_567_a"><sup>a</sup></a> and the geometricians use it with greatest keenness; in reference to speech, Aristarchus and the grammarians of his school use it with more care than others do, as when acc. <span class="italic">amorem</span> and dat. <span class="italic">amori</span>, acc. <span class="italic">dolorem</span> and dat. <span class="italic">dolori</span> are said to be like by comparative likeness,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL334_567_b" id="target_note_LCL334_567_b"><sup>b</sup></a> although they see that <span class="italic">amorem</span> is unlike <span class="italic">amori</span> because it is in another case, and likewise <span class="italic">dolorem</span> is unlike <span class="italic">dolori</span>; but they say that the four are like, because they come from like words.</p>
<p>43. Sometimes it has two crossed relationships, in such a way that one is vertical and the other crosswise. What I mean will become clearer by this: Suppose that some numerals are so set down</p>
<span class="line">that in the first line there are 1 2 4</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">in the second line there are 10 20 40</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">in the third line there are 100 200 400</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<p>In this scheme of numerals there will be two examples of what I have called <span class="italic">logos</span>, which make different systems of Regularity: one is the twofold which is in the crosswise lines, because two is to four as one is to two; the other is the tenfold relation in the vertical lines, because ten is to one hundred as one is to ten.</p>
<p>44. Likewise the inflections of words may go in two directions, because from the nominative case they are inflected into the oblique cases, and from the nominative to the nominative, so that they make a similar scheme; which is</p>
