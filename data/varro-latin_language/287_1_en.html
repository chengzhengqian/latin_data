to two, should the conclusion be drawn that in teaching the later thing cannot be the clearer, for the purpose of beginning from it, to show what the prior thing is. Therefore even those who deal with the nature of the universe and are on this account called <span class="italic">physici</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL334_577_a" id="target_note_LCL334_577_a"><sup>a</sup></a> ‘natural philosophers,’ proceed from nature as a whole and show by backward reasoning from the later things, what the beginnings of the world were. Though speech consists of letters,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL334_577_b" id="target_note_LCL334_577_b"><sup>b</sup></a> it is nevertheless from speech that the grammarians start in order to show the nature of the letters.</p>

Therefore in the explanation, since one ought rather to set out from that which is clearer than from that which is prior, and rather from the un-corrupted than from a corrupt original, from the nature of things rather than from the fancy of men, and since these three factors which are more to be followed are less present in the singulars than in the plurals, one can more easily commence from the plural than from the singular, because in the latter as starting-points<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL334_577_a-1" id="target_note_LCL334_577_a-1"><sup>a</sup></a> there is less of a basis for relationship in the forming of words. That the singular forms of words can be more easily interpreted from plural forms than plural forms from the singular, is shown by these words<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL334_577_b-1a" id="target_note_LCL334_577_b-1a"><sup>b</sup></a>: plural <span class="italic">trabes</span> ‘beams,’ singular <span class="italic">trabs</span>; plural <span class="italic">duces</span> ‘leaders,’ singular <span class="italic">dux.</span></p>
