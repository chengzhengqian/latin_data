It is found also in like things; in coins, for example, one denarius is to one victoriate<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL334_565_a" id="target_note_LCL334_565_a"><sup>a</sup></a> as a second denarius is to a second victoriate. So likewise in all other things those are said to be in a status of comparative likeness, wherein there is a fourfold nature of such a kind as among children the daughter is to the mother as the son is to
