<p>XXXIII. 46. As to what they say,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL334_473_a" id="target_note_LCL334_473_a"><sup>a</sup></a> that we find unlikeness pleasing and acceptable rather than likeness, and therefore in clothing and in furniture we take pleasure in variety, and not in having our wives’ undertunics all identical: I answer, that if variety is pleasure, then there is greater variety in that in which some things are alike and others are not; and just as a side-table is adorned with silver in such a way that some ornaments are alike and others are unlike, so also is speech adorned.</p>
<p>47. They ask why, if likeness is to be followed, we prefer to have some couches inlaid with ivory, others with tortoise-shell, and so on with some other kind of material. To which I say that unlikenesses are not the only thing which we follow, but often we follow likenesses. And this may be seen from the same piece of furniture; for no one makes the three couches of the dining-room other than alike in material and in height and in shape. Who makes the table-napkins not like each other? Or the cushions? And finally the other things which are several in number but of one sort?</p>
<p>48. Since speech, they say,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL334_473_a" id="target_note_LCL334_473_a"><sup>a</sup></a> was introduced for the sake of utility, we should follow not that kind of speech which has likeness, but that which has utility. I grant that speech has been produced for utility’s sake, but in the same way as garments have: therefore as in the latter we follow the likenesses, so that a man’s tunic is like a man’s, and a toga like a toga, and a woman’s dress is like a dress regularly and a cloak like a cloak, so also, as words that are names
