the active <span class="italic">amo,</span> and <span class="italic">amatus</span> is from the passive <span class="italic">amor.</span> But that which Regularity can offer, which the participles have, each in its own class, is case-forms, as <span class="italic">amatus</span>, dative <span class="italic">amato,</span> and plural <span class="italic">amati</span>, dative <span class="italic">amatis</span>; and so in the feminine, <span class="italic">amata</span> and plural <span class="italic">amatae.</span> Likewise <span class="italic">amaturus</span> has a declension of the same kind. <span class="italic">Amans</span> has a somewhat different declension; because all words of this kind have a regular likeness in their own class, <span class="italic">amans</span>, like others of its class, uses the same forms for masculine and for feminine.</p>
