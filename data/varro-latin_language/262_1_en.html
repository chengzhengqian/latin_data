<p>LXII. 108. Likewise, they present as an argument against the existence of Regularity the fact that like forms are not derived from likes, as from <span class="italic">dolo</span> ‘I chop’ and <span class="italic">colo</span> ‘I till’; for one forms the perfect <span class="italic">dolavi</span> and the other forms <span class="italic">colui.</span> In such instances something additional is wont to be taken to aid in the making of the other forms,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL334_527_aa" id="target_note_LCL334_527_aa"><sup>a</sup></a> just as we do in the tiny art-works of Myrmecides<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL334_527_b" id="target_note_LCL334_527_b"><sup>b</sup></a>: therefore in verbs, since the likeness is often so confusing that the distinction cannot be made unless you pass to another person or tense, you become aware that the words before you are not alike when passage is made to the second person, which is <span class="italic">dolas</span> in the one verb and <span class="italic">colis</span> in the other.</p>
<p>109. Thus in the rest of the paradigm of the verbs each follows its own special type. Whether in the second person the paradigm of verbs has in the final syllable AS or ES or ĬS or ĪS, is of importance for distinguishing the likenesses. Wherefore the mark of Regularity is in the second person rather than in the first, because in the first the unlikeness is concealed, as appears in <span class="italic">meo</span> ‘I go,’ <span class="italic">neo</span> ‘I sew,’ <span class="italic">ruo</span> ‘I fall’; for from these there develop unlike forms by the change from first to second person, because they are spoken thus: <span class="italic">meo meas, neo nes, ruo ruis</span>, each one of which preserves its own type of likeness.</p>
<p>LXIII. 110. Likewise, many find fault with Regularity in connexion with the so-called participles; wrongly: for it should not be said that the set of three participles comes from each individual verb, like <span class="italic">amaturus</span> ‘about to love,’ <span class="italic">amans</span> ‘loving,’ <span class="italic">amatus</span> ‘loved,’ because <span class="italic">amans</span> and <span class="italic">amaturus</span> are from
