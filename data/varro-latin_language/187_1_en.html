desired that male children be designated in such a way that from these the females might be indicated by inflection, as the feminine <span class="italic">Terentia</span> from the masculine <span class="italic">Terentius</span>; and that similarly from the names which they set in the nominative case, there might be other forms to which they could arrive by inflection. But they are supposed to have been unable to hold fast to these principles in everything, because the plural form <span class="italic">scopae</span> denotes either one or two brooms, and <span class="italic">aquila</span> ‘eagle’ denotes both the male and the female, and <span class="italic">vis</span> ‘force’ is used for the nominative and for an oblique case<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL334_377_b" id="target_note_LCL334_377_b"><sup>b</sup></a> of the word.</p>
<p>8. Why such words are not so much at fault as men think, it is in most instances not hard to explain, but it is not necessary to do so at this time; for it is not how they have been able to arrive at the words, but how they wished to express themselves, that is of import for the subject which is before us: inasmuch as genitive <span class="italic">scoparum</span> can be no less easily derived from the plural <span class="italic">scopae</span> which they did impose on the object as its name, than if they had given it the name <span class="italic">scopa</span> in the singular, and made the genitive <span class="italic">scopae</span> from this—and other words likewise.</p>
<p>III. 9. The reason, I say, why they made these inflected forms<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL334_377_a" id="target_note_LCL334_377_a"><sup>a</sup></a> from the names which they had set upon things, is that which I have shown; the next point is for me to sketch by classes, but briefly, the forms<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL334_377_a" id="target_note_LCL334_377_a"><sup>a</sup></a> at which they have wished to arrive by inflection, or have not wished to arrive. For there are two classes of words, one fruitful, which by inflection produces from itself many different forms, as for example <span class="italic">lego</span> ‘I gather,’ <span class="italic">legi</span> ‘I have gathered,’ <span class="italic">legam</span> ‘I shall
