from the children whether the parents are alike: those who say this are mistaken, for it does not come about from their oblique cases that the nominatives are shown to be of like appearance, but through the oblique cases can be more easily seen what evidential force lies in the likeness of the nominatives—even as a lamp in the dark, when brought, does not cause that the things which are there should be alike, but that they should be seen in their real character.</p>
