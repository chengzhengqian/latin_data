words like which denote like things, but those which are of such a stamp that such forms<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL334_555_a" id="target_note_LCL334_555_a"><sup>a</sup></a> are in most instances wont by custom to denote like things, as by a man’s tunic or a woman’s tunic we mean not a tunic that a man or a woman is wearing, but one which by custom a man or a woman ought to wear.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL334_555_b" id="target_note_LCL334_555_b"><sup>b</sup></a> For a man can wear a woman’s tunic, and a woman can wear a man’s, as we see done on the stage by actors; but we say that that is a woman’s tunic, which is of the kind that women customarily use to dress themselves in. As an actor may wear a woman’s dress, so <span class="italic">Perpenna</span> and <span class="italic">Caecina</span> and <span class="italic">Spurinna</span> are said to have names that are feminine in form; they are not said to have women’s names.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL334_555_c" id="target_note_LCL334_555_c"><sup>c</sup></a></p>
<p>28. The likeness of the inflection also must be watched, because the way which some words take is clear from the very words from which their inflection starts,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL334_555_a-1" id="target_note_LCL334_555_a-1"><sup>a</sup></a> as how it is proper to use <span class="italic">praetor</span> and <span class="italic">consul</span>, dative <span class="italic">praetori</span> and <span class="italic">consuli</span>. Others are properly appreciated only as a result of the change seen in the inflections, as in <span class="italic">socer</span> ‘father-in-law’ and <span class="italic">macer</span> ‘lean,’ because the one becomes <span class="italic">socerum</span> in the accusative, and the other <span class="italic">macrum</span>; after making this change, each of them follows its own way in the remaining forms,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL334_555_b-1a" id="target_note_LCL334_555_b-1a"><sup>b</sup></a> both in the inflections of the singular and in those of the plural. This method is employed<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL334_555_c-1" id="target_note_LCL334_555_c-1"><sup>c</sup></a> because in the inflections there are two kinds of natures which can be compared with each other, one which can be seen in the word itself, such as <span class="italic">homo</span> ‘man’ and <span class="italic">equus</span> ‘horse,’ but the second cannot be seen through without bringing in something
