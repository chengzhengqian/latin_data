<p>37. Primitive is the name applied to words like <span class="italic">lego</span> ‘I gather,’ <span class="italic">scribo</span> ‘I write,’ <span class="italic">sto</span> ‘I stand,’ <span class="italic">sedeo</span> ‘I sit,’ and the rest which are not from some other word,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL333_209_a" id="target_note_LCL333_209_a"><sup>a</sup></a> but have their own roots. On the other hand derivative words are those which do develop from some other word, as from <span class="italic">lego</span> come <span class="italic">legis</span> ‘thou gatherest,’ <span class="italic">legit</span> ‘he gathers,’ <span class="italic">legam</span> ‘I shall gather,’ and in this fashion from this same word come a great number of words. Therefore, if one has shown the origins of the primitive words, and if these are one thousand in number, he will have revealed at the same time the sources of five hundred thousand separate words; but if without showing the origin of a single primitive word he has shown how the rest have developed from the primitives, he will have said quite enough about the origins of words, since the original elements from which the words are sprung are few and the words which have sprung from them are countless.</p>
<p>38. There are besides an enormous number of words derived from these same original elements by the addition of a few prefixes, because by the addition of prefixes with or without change a word is repeatedly transformed; for as there is <span class="italic">processit</span> ‘he marched forward’ and <span class="italic">recessit</span> ‘drew back,’ so there is <span class="italic">accessit</span> ‘approached’ and <span class="italic">abscessit</span> ‘went off,’ likewise <span class="italic">incessit</span> ‘advanced’ and <span class="italic">excessit</span> ‘withdrew,’ so also <span class="italic">successit</span> ‘went up’ and <span class="italic">decessit</span> ‘went away,’ <span class="italic">discessit</span> ‘departed’ and <span class="italic">concessit</span> ‘gave way.’ But if there were only these ten prefixes, from the thousand primitives five million different forms can be made inasmuch as from one word there are five hundred derivational forms and when these are multiplied by ten through union with a prefix five thousand different forms are produced out of one primitive.</p>
