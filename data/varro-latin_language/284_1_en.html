has to <span class="italic">legam.</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL334_571_a" id="target_note_LCL334_571_a"><sup>a</sup></a> In this, almost all men make a mistake, because they cite these verbs wrongly in the three tenses, when they wish to express them in a proportion.</p>
<p>48. For since some verbs denote incomplete action, like <span class="italic">lego</span> ‘I read’ and <span class="italic">legis</span> ‘thou readest,’ and others denote completed action, like <span class="italic">legi</span> ‘I have read’ and <span class="italic">legisti</span> ‘thou hast read,’ and since in the conjoined form they ought to be connected with others of their own kind and by this principle <span class="italic">lego</span> is rightly related to <span class="italic">legebam—lego</span> is not rightly related to <span class="italic">legi</span>, because <span class="italic">legi</span> denotes something completed; so that they are wrong in finding fault with <span class="italic">tutudi</span> ‘I have pounded’
and <span class="italic">pupugi</span> ‘I have pricked,’ <span class="italic">tundo</span> and <span class="italic">pungo, tundam</span> and <span class="italic">pungam</span>, as well as <span class="italic">necatus sum</span> ‘I have been killed’
and <span class="italic">verberatus sum</span> ‘I have been beaten,’ <span class="italic">necor</span> and <span class="italic">verberor, necabor</span> and <span class="italic">verberabor</span>, because the tenses of incomplete action are like one another, and those of completed action are like one another. Thus we should say <span class="italic">tundebam tundo tundam</span>, and <span class="italic">tutuderam tutudi tutudero</span>, and in the same way <span class="italic">amabar amor amabor</span>, and <span class="italic">amatus eram, amatus sum, amatus ero.</span> Therefore those who speak against the Regularities are unfair in finding fault on the ground that whereas Regularity is fourfold by nature certain words are cited in a different way, in three tense-forms merely.</p>
<p>49. This seems sometimes to have fewer parts, as I have said; similarly it seems, at other times, to have more parts, as when it is thus: as one and two are to three, so two and four are to six. Yet this form is included in the fourfold type, because sets of two are compared with sets of one. In speech also, this will sometimes be found, thus: As nominative <span class="italic">Diomedes</span>
