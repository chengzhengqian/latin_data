The first gods were <span class="italic">Caelum</span> ‘Sky’ and <span class="italic">Terra</span> ‘Earth.’ These gods are the same as those who in Egypt are called Serapis and Isis,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL333_55_aa" id="target_note_LCL333_55_aa"><sup>a</sup></a> though Harpocrates with his finger make a sign to me to be silent. The same first gods were in Latium called Saturn and Ops.</p>

For Earth and Sky, as the mysteries of the Samothracians<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL333_55_a-1" id="target_note_LCL333_55_a-1"><sup>a</sup></a> teach, are Great Gods, and these whom I have mentioned under many names, are not those Great Gods whom Samothrace<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL333_55_b-1" id="target_note_LCL333_55_b-1"><sup>b</sup></a> represents by two male statues of bronze which she has set up before the city-gates, nor are they, as the populace thinks, the Samothracian gods,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL333_55_c-1" id="target_note_LCL333_55_c-1"><sup>c</sup></a> who are really Castor and Pollux; but these are a male and a female, these are those whom the <span class="italic">Books of the Augurs</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL333_55_d-1" id="target_note_LCL333_55_d-1"><sup>d</sup></a> mention in writing as “potent deities,” for what the Samothracians call “powerful gods.”</p>
<p>59. These two, Sky and Earth, are a pair like life<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL333_55_a-2" id="target_note_LCL333_55_a-2"><sup>a</sup></a> and body. Earth is a damp cold thing, whether</p>
