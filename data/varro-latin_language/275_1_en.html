are set upon simple objects, and those mentioned later apply to compounded objects<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL334_553_d" id="target_note_LCL334_553_d"><sup>d</sup></a>; thus <span class="italic">bigae</span> ‘two-horse team’ and <span class="italic">quadrigae</span> ‘four-horse team’ are employed in the plural because they denote a union of objects. Therefore we do not say one <span class="italic">biga,</span> like one <span class="italic">lata</span> ‘broad’ and <span class="italic">alba</span> ‘white,’ but one <span class="italic">bigae</span>, with the numeral also in the plural; nor do we say <span class="italic">duae</span> ‘two’ with reference to <span class="italic">bigae</span> and <span class="italic">quadrigae</span>, as we say <span class="italic">duae</span> ‘two’ with application to the plural forms <span class="italic">latae</span> and <span class="italic">albae</span>, but we say <span class="italic">binae</span> ‘two sets’ of <span class="italic">bigae</span> and <span class="italic">quadrigae.</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL334_553_e" id="target_note_LCL334_553_e"><sup>e</sup></a></p>
<p>25. Likewise the character of the form of a word is important, because in the form of the spoken word a change is sometimes made in the first part of the word, as in <span class="italic">sŭit</span> ‘sews’ and <span class="italic">sūit</span> ‘sewed’; sometimes in the middle, as in <span class="italic">curso</span> ‘I run to and fro,’ and <span class="italic">cursito</span>, of the same meaning; sometimes at the end, as in <span class="italic">doceo</span> ‘I teach’ and <span class="italic">docui</span> ‘I have taught’; sometimes the change is common to two parts, as in <span class="italic">lĕgo</span> ‘I read,’ <span class="italic">lēgi</span> ‘I have read.’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL334_553_a-1" id="target_note_LCL334_553_a-1"><sup>a</sup></a> It is important therefore to observe of what letters each word consists; and the last letter is especially important, because it is changed in the greatest number of instances.</p>
<p>26. Because of this, since the likenesses in these parts also are wont to be used in the comparison of case-forms, and this is done ill by some and well by others, we must see whether this has been done rightly or wrongly. Yet wherever the letters are altered, not only the altered letters must be noted, but also those which are next to them and are not affected; for this proximity has considerable influence in the inflections of words.</p>
