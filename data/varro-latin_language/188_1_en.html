gather,’ and similarly other words; and a second class which is barren,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL334_379_b" id="target_note_LCL334_379_b"><sup>b</sup></a> which produces nothing from itself, as for example <span class="italic">et</span> ‘and,’ <span class="italic">iam</span> ‘now,’ <span class="italic">vix</span> ‘hardly,’ <span class="italic">eras</span> ‘to-morrow,’ <span class="italic">magis</span> ‘more,’ <span class="italic">cur</span> ‘why.’</p>
<p>10. In those things whose use was simple, the inflection of the name also was simple; just as in a house where there is only one slave there is need of only one slave-name,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL334_379_a-1" id="target_note_LCL334_379_a-1"><sup>a</sup></a> but in a house where there are many slaves there is need of many such names. Therefore also in those things which are names, because the differentiations of the word are several, there are more offshoots, and in those things which are connectives and join words, because there was no need for them to be inflected into several forms, the words generally have but one form: for with one and the same thong you can fasten a man or a horse or anything else, whatever it is, which can be fastened to something else. Thus, for example, we say in our talking, “Tullius <span class="italic">et</span> ‘and’ Antonius were consuls”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL334_379_b-1" id="target_note_LCL334_379_b-1"><sup>b</sup></a>: with that same <span class="italic">et</span> we can link together any set of two consuls, or—to put it more strongly—any and all names, and even all words, while all the time that one-syllabled prop-word <span class="italic">et</span> remains unchanged. Therefore under nature’s guidance it has come about that we should not think that there are inflected forms from all these names which have been set upon things.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL334_379_c-1" id="target_note_LCL334_379_c-1"><sup>c</sup></a></p>
<p>IV. 11. In the word-classes in which inflections may develop, the parts of speech are two, unless, following Dion,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL334_379_a-2" id="target_note_LCL334_379_a-2"><sup>a</sup></a> we divide into three divisions the ideas which are indicated by words: one division
