<p>32. The various localities of Europe are inhabited by many different nations. They are in general denominated by names transferred from the men, like <span class="italic">Sabini</span> ‘the Sabine country,’ and <span class="italic">Lucani</span> ‘the country of the Lucanians,’ or derived from the names of the men, like Apulia and Latium, or both, like Etruria and <span class="italic">Tusci.</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL333_31_a" id="target_note_LCL333_31_a"><sup>a</sup></a> Where Latinus once had his kingdom, the field-lands as a whole are called Latian; but when taken piecemeal, they are named after the towns, as Praenestine from Praeneste, and Arician from Aricia.</p>
<p>33. As our State Augurs set forth,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL333_31_a" id="target_note_LCL333_31_a"><sup>a</sup></a> there are five kinds of fields: Roman, Gabine, peregrine, hostic, uncertain. ‘Roman’ field-land is so called from Romulus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL333_31_b" id="target_note_LCL333_31_b"><sup>b</sup></a> from whom Rome got its name. ‘Gabine’ is named from the town Gabii.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL333_31_c" id="target_note_LCL333_31_c"><sup>c</sup></a> The ‘peregrine’ is field-land won in war and reduced to peace, which is apart from the Roman and the Gabine, because in these latter the auspices are observed in one uniform manner: ‘peregrine’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL333_31_d" id="target_note_LCL333_31_d"><sup>d</sup></a> is named from <span class="italic">pergere</span> ‘to go ahead,’ that is, from <span class="italic">progredi</span> ‘to advance’; for into it their first advance was made out of the Roman field-land. By the same reasoning, the Gabine also is peregrine, but because it has auspices of its own special sort it is held separate from the rest.
