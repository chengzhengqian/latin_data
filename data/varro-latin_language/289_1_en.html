itself for the most part uncorrupted, unless somebody perverts it by ignorant use.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL334_581_e" id="target_note_LCL334_581_e"><sup>e</sup></a></p>
<p>61. Therefore, if one has founded the principle of Regularity on the natural cases rather than on the imposed case-forms, not many awkwardnesses will be his to face in usage; human fancifulness will be corrected by nature, and not nature by fancy, because those who have wished to follow imposition will in reality act in the opposite way.</p>
<p>62. But if one should prefer to start from the singular, he ought to start from the sixth case,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL334_581_aa" id="target_note_LCL334_581_aa"><sup>a</sup></a> which is a case peculiar to Latin; for by the differences in the letters<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL334_581_b" id="target_note_LCL334_581_b"><sup>b</sup></a> of this case-form he will be more easily able to discern the variation in the remaining cases, because the ablative forms end either in A, like <span class="italic">terra</span> ‘earth,’ or in E,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL334_581_c" id="target_note_LCL334_581_c"><sup>c</sup></a> like <span class="italic">lance</span> ‘platter,’ or in I, like <span class="italic">clavi</span> ‘key,’ or in O, like <span class="italic">caelo</span> ‘sky,’ or in U, like <span class="italic">versu</span> ‘verse.’ Therefore, for the explaining of the declensions, there is this way, which may proceed from either of two starting-points.</p>
<p>63. But where there is Regularity, there are three factors, one which is in the things, a second which is in the spoken words, a third which is in both; the first two are simple, the third is twofold. In view of this, attention must be given to the relation which they have to one another.</p>
<p>64. First, of the differences which exist in the things, there are some which have no bearing on speech, others which are connected with it. Those which are not connected with it are like those which the artificers observe in making buildings and statues
