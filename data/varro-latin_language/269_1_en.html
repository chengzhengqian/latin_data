we admit that they are alike as spoken words and in their separate syllables, but we see that they are unlike in their parts of speech, because one has tenses and the other has cases; and tenses and cases are the two features which in the highest degree serve to distinguish the different systems of Regularity.</p>
<p>8. Likewise, words that are even nearer alike in kind often cause a similar mistake, as in the fact that <span class="italic">nemus</span> ‘grove’ and <span class="italic">lepus</span> ‘hare’ seem to be alike since both have the same nominative<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL334_541_a" id="target_note_LCL334_541_a"><sup>a</sup></a>; but it is not an instance of likeness, because they stand in need of certain factors of likeness, among which is that they should be in the same noun-gender. But these two words are not, for <span class="italic">lepus</span> is masculine and <span class="italic">nemus</span> is neuter; for we say <span class="italic">hic</span> ‘this’ with <span class="italic">lepus</span> and <span class="italic">hoc</span> with <span class="italic">nemus</span>. If they were of the same gender, the same form would be set before both, and we should say either <span class="italic">hic lepus</span> and <span class="italic">hic nemus</span>, or <span class="italic">hoc nemus</span> and <span class="italic">hoc lepus.</span></p>
<p>9. Therefore he who asks whether the inflections of words stand in a regular relation, must examine to see what kinds of likenesses there are and of what sort they are, which pertain to this matter. And just because this topic is difficult, those who have written of these subjects either have avoided it or have begun it without being able to complete their treatment of it.</p>
<p>10. Therefore in this there is seen a lack of agreement, and not merely of one kind. For some have fixed the number of all the distinctions<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL334_541_a-1" id="target_note_LCL334_541_a-1"><sup>a</sup></a> as a whole, as did Dionysius of Sidon,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL334_541_b-1" id="target_note_LCL334_541_b-1"><sup>b</sup></a> who wrote that there were seventy-one of them; and others set the number of those distinctions which apply to the words which have cases: the same writer says that of these there are
