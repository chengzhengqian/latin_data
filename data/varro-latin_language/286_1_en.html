Therefore in fact this third can be divided into two parts and called the third and the fourth, because in it the argument can actually go both forward and backward.</p>
<p>53. He who makes the imposed forms the starting-point for the Regularity, will have to develop the oblique forms from these; he who makes the nature the starting-point, will have to work in the other direction; he who starts from both, will have to make the rest of the inflections from the changes of the same kind. The imposition is in our power, but we are under the control of the nature of the words: for each one imposes the name as he wishes, but he inflects it as its nature requires.</p>
