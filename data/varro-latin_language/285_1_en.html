is compared with genitive <span class="italic">Diomedi</span> and <span class="italic">Diomedis,</span> so from nominative <span class="italic">Hercules</span> are said the genitive forms <span class="italic">Herculi</span> and <span class="italic">Herculis.</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL334_573_a" id="target_note_LCL334_573_a"><sup>a</sup></a></p>
<p>50. And as these move away from one starting-point
and nominative into two oblique case-forms, so on the other hand from two starting-points of the nominative many words unite in a single oblique case-form. For as from the nominatives <span class="italic">Baebiei</span> (masc.) and <span class="italic">Baebiae</span> (fem.) comes the dative <span class="italic">Baebieis</span>,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL334_573_a" id="target_note_LCL334_573_a"><sup>a</sup></a> so from the nominatives <span class="italic">Caelii</span> and <span class="italic">Caeliae</span> comes <span class="italic">Caeliis</span>. From two like words forms are developed in unlike fashion, as happens in <span class="italic">nemus</span> ‘grove’ and <span class="italic">holus</span> ‘vegetable,’ plural <span class="italic">nemora</span> and <span class="italic">holera</span>. Others from unlike words are developed in like fashion, as in the articles the accusatives <span class="italic">hunc</span> and <span class="italic">istunc</span> come from <span class="italic">hic</span> ‘this’ and <span class="italic">iste</span> ‘that.’</p>
<p>51. Regularity has its foundations either in the will of men or in the nature of the words, or in both. By will I mean the imposition of the word-names: by nature I mean the inflection of the words, through which passage is made without special instruction. He who starts from the imposition, will say that if <span class="italic">dolus</span> ‘guile’ and <span class="italic">malus</span> ‘bad’ are alike in the nominative, there will be found in an oblique case <span class="italic">dolo</span> and <span class="italic">malo</span>. He who starts from the nature of the words, will say that if <span class="italic">Marco</span> and <span class="italic">Quinto</span> are alike in the oblique cases, there will be nominatives Marcus and <span class="italic">Quintus</span>. He who proceeds from both, will say that if there is a likeness, then as the change is in <span class="italic">servus</span> ‘slave’ and vocative <span class="italic">serve</span>, so also there will be <span class="italic">cervus</span> ‘stag’ and vocative <span class="italic">cerve.</span> It is a common feature of all, that the four word-forms have their inflectional changes in a proportional relation.</p>
