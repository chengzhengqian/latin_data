forty-seven, Aristocles<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL334_543_c" id="target_note_LCL334_543_c"><sup>c</sup></a> reduced them to fourteen headings, Parmeniscus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL334_543_d" id="target_note_LCL334_543_d"><sup>d</sup></a> to eight, and others made the number smaller or larger.</p>
<p>11. If the origin of these likenesses had been correctly grasped and their logical explanation had proceeded from that as a beginning, there would be less error in regard to the inflections of words. Of these likenesses there are, I think, first principles of two kinds only, by which the likenesses ought to be tested; of which one lies in the substance of the words,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL334_543_a" id="target_note_LCL334_543_a"><sup>a</sup></a> the other lies, so to speak, in the form<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL334_543_b" id="target_note_LCL334_543_b"><sup>b</sup></a> of that substance, which comes from inflection.</p>
<p>12. For there must be one, that the word be like the word from which it is inflected, and two, that in comparison from word to word the inflectional form with which the comparison is made should be of the same kind. For sometimes there are like forms reached by inflection from like words, such as datives <span class="italic">ero</span> and <span class="italic">fero</span> from <span class="italic">erus</span> ‘master’ and <span class="italic">ferus</span> ‘wild,’ and sometimes unlike forms, such as genitive <span class="italic">eri</span> and accusative <span class="italic">forum</span>, from <span class="italic">erus</span> and <span class="italic">ferus</span>. When both principles are fulfilled and word is like word and inflectional form like inflectional form, then and not before will I pronounce that the word is like, and has a twofold and perfect likeness to the other—which is what Regularity demands.</p>
<p>13. But I wish to avoid the appearance of trickiness in having declared that there are only two kinds of likenesses when both have a number of sub-forms—if
I say nothing about these, you may think that I am intentionally leaving myself a place of refuge; I
