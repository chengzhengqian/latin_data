<p>95. That which concerns the Regularity of nouns has, I think been so cleared up that material for answering all objections can be drawn from these sources.</p>
<p>LIII. We now come to the logical system of verbs; this has four parts: tenses, persons, kinds,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL334_517_aa" id="target_note_LCL334_517_aa"><sup>a</sup></a> and divisions.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL334_517_b" id="target_note_LCL334_517_b"><sup>b</sup></a> As they find fault with respect to each and every part, I shall make answer to the objections one by one.</p>
<p>LIV. 96. First as to their saying that the Regularities are not preserved in the tenses, when they give perfect <span class="italic">legi</span> ‘I have read,’ present <span class="italic">lego</span> ‘I read,’ future <span class="italic">legam</span> ‘I shall read,’ and others in just the same way: they are wrong in finding fault with those forms like <span class="italic">legi</span> as denoting completed actions and the other two, <span class="italic">lego</span> and <span class="italic">legam</span>, as denoting action only begun; for the same verb which has been taken from the same kind and the same division, can be paraded through the tenses of non-completion, like <span class="italic">discebam</span> ‘I was learning,’ <span class="italic">disco</span> ‘I learn,’ <span class="italic">discam</span> ‘I shall learn,’ and the same of completion, thus <span class="italic">didiceram</span>’
I had learned,’ <span class="italic">didici</span> ‘I have learned,’ <span class="italic">didicero</span> ‘I shall have learned.’</p>
<p>LV. From this one may know that the logical system of verbs is consistent with itself, but that those who try to speak the verbs in their three tenses, do this in an ignorant way;</p>
<p>97. that likewise those do so ignorantly who find fault because we say <span class="italic">amor</span> ‘I am loved,’ <span class="italic">amabor</span> ‘I shall be loved,’ <span class="italic">amatus sum</span> ‘I have been loved’; for, they say, in one and the same series there ought not to be one verb made up of two words while the other two verbs are each of one word.
