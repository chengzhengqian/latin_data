<p class="noindent">I. 1. <span class="sc">Speech</span> is naturally divided into three parts, as I have shown in the previous books: its first part is how names were imposed upon things; its second, in what way the derivatives of these names have arrived at their differences; its third, how the words, when united with one another reasonmgly, express an idea. Having set forth the first part, I shall from here begin upon the second. As every offshoot is secondary by nature, because that vertical trunk from which it comes is primary, and it is therefore declined<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL334_371_aa" id="target_note_LCL334_371_aa"><sup>a</sup></a>: so there is declension in words: <span class="italic">homo</span> ‘man’ is the vertical, <span class="italic">hominis</span> ‘man’s’ is the oblique, because it is declined from the vertical.</p>

The Greeks conceived the paradigm of the noun as the upper right quadrant of a circle: the nominative was the vertical radius, and the other cases were radii which ‘declined’ to the right, and were therefore called πτώσεις ‘fallings,’ which the Romans translated literally by <span class="italic">casus.</span> The <span class="italic">casus rectus</span> is therefore a contradiction in itself. The Latin verb <span class="italic">de</span>- <span class="italic">clinare</span> is used in the meanings ‘to decline (a noun),’ ‘to conjugate (a verb),’ and ‘to derive’ in general, as well as ‘to bend aside and down’ in a literal physical sense: it therefore offers great difficulties in translating.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL334_371_aa').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
