<p>6. In connexion with the first class, a historical narrative is necessary, for except by outright learning such words do not reach us; for the other class, the second, a grammatical treatment is necessary, and for this there is need of a few brief maxims. For the scheme by which you have learned to inflect in the instance of one noun, you can employ in a countless number of nouns: therefore when new nouns have been brought into common use, the whole people at once utters their declined forms without any hesitation. Moreover, those who have freshly become slaves and on purchase become members of a large household, quickly inflect the names of all their fellow-slaves in the oblique cases, provided only they have heard the nominative.</p>

Even those who first imposed names upon things perhaps made some slips in some instances: for they are supposed to have desired to designate things individually,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL334_375_a" id="target_note_LCL334_375_a"><sup>a</sup></a> that from these inflection might be made to indicate plurality, as <span class="italic">homines</span> ‘men’ from <span class="italic">homo</span> ‘man.’ They are supposed to have
