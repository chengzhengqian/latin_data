<span class="italic">utrei</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL334_489_a" id="target_note_LCL334_489_a"><sup>a</sup></a>: <span class="italic">uter poeta</span> ‘which of two poets’ in the singular, <span class="italic">utri poetae</span> ‘which of two sets of poets’ in the plural. Now that the nature of this has been explained it is clear that plural nouns are not all under obligations to have a like singular form; for all the numerals from two upwards are plural, and no one of them can have a singular to match it. Therefore it is quite wrongly that they demand that all singulars that there are, must have a corresponding plural form.</p>

Likewise those who find fault because there are no plurals <span class="italic">aceta</span> and <span class="italic">gara</span> to <span class="italic">acetum</span> ‘vinegar’ and <span class="italic">garum</span> ‘fish-sauce’ like <span class="italic">unguenta</span> to <span class="italic">unguentum</span> ‘perfume’ and <span class="italic">vina</span> to <span class="italic">vinum</span> ‘wine,’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL334_489_a-1" id="target_note_LCL334_489_a-1"><sup>a</sup></a> act ignorantly; they are looking for a plural name in connexion with things which come under the categories of quantity and weight rather than under that of number. For in <span class="italic">plumbum</span> ‘lead’ and <span class="italic">argentum</span> ‘silver,’ when there has been added an increase, we say <span class="italic">multum</span> ‘much’: thus <span class="italic">multum plumbum</span> or <span class="italic">argentum</span>, not <span class="italic">plumba</span> ‘leads’ and <span class="italic">argenta</span> ‘silvers,’ since articles made of these we call <span class="italic">plumbea</span> and <span class="italic">argentea</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL334_489_b-1" id="target_note_LCL334_489_b-1"><sup>b</sup></a> (silver is something else when it is <span class="italic">argenteum</span>, for that is what it is when it has now become a utensil; thus <span class="italic">argenteum</span> if it is a small cup or the like), because in this case we speak of many <span class="italic">argentea</span> ‘silver’ cups, and not of much <span class="italic">argentum</span> ‘silver.’</p>

But if those things which have by nature the idea of quantity rather than that of number, exist in several kinds and these kinds have come into use, then from the plurality of kinds they are spoken of in the plural, as for example <span class="italic">vina</span> ‘wines’ and <span class="italic">unguenta</span> ‘perfumes.’ For there is wine of one kind, which comes from Chios, another wine which is from
