compared with another, is either like or unlike; and often the words are different but the relation is the same, and sometimes the relation is different but the words are the same. The same relation which is in <span class="italic">amor</span> ‘love’ and dative <span class="italic">amori</span> is in <span class="italic">dolor</span> ‘pain’ and dative <span class="italic">dolori</span>, but not in <span class="italic">dolor</span> and accusative <span class="italic">dolorem.</span> The same relation which is in <span class="italic">amor</span> and genitive <span class="italic">amoris</span> is in plural <span class="italic">amores</span> and genitive <span class="italic">amorum</span>; and yet, because the subject-matter in it is not compared as it should be,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL334_563_a" id="target_note_LCL334_563_a"><sup>a</sup></a> this relation cannot of itself effect Regularities, on account of the differences in the forms of the spoken word, because a singular word has been associated with a plural. So, when it is by a proportionate likeness that the word has the same relation, then and not until then does this relation achieve what is demanded by <span class="italic">Analogia</span> or Regularity; of which I shall speak next.</p>
<p>III. 37. There follows the third topic: What is <span class="italic">Ratio</span> or Relation that is <span class="italic">pro portione</span> ‘by proportionate likeness’? This is in Greek called ‘according to <span class="italic">logos</span>’; and from analogue the term <span class="italic">Analogia</span> or Regularity is derived. If there are two things of the same class which belong to some relation though in some respect unlike each other, and if alongside these two things two other things which have the same relation are placed,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL334_563_a" id="target_note_LCL334_563_a"><sup>a</sup></a> then because the two sets of words belong to the same <span class="italic">logos</span> each one is said separately to be an analogue and the comparison of the four constitutes an <span class="italic">Analogia.</span></p>
<p>38. For it is as in a matter of twins: when we say that the one Menaechmus is like the other Menaechmus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL334_563_a" id="target_note_LCL334_563_a"><sup>a</sup></a> we are speaking of one only; but when we say that a likeness is present in them, we are speaking of both. So, when we say that a copper <span class="italic">as</span> has the same
