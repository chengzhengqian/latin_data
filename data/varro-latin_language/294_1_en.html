<p>75. I think that these things have been said with more care than clarity, but not more obscurely than are the definitions of the same subject given by the grammarians, such as Aristeas, Aristodemus, Aristocles,
and others,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL334_591_a" id="target_note_LCL334_591_a"><sup>a</sup></a> whose obscurities are the less to be found fault with, because most definitions, being on an unknown theme and being expressed with extreme brevity, are not easily understood unless they are expounded point by point.</p>
<p>76. Therefore the matter will be more apparent if there is a clear exposition of the parts one by one, as to what is meant by a word, what is meant by the likeness of the word, by inflection, by likeness of inflection not inconsistent with common usage, and by “within a certain range.”</p>
<p>77. By word I mean that part of spoken speech which is the smallest indivisible unit. If a word has natural inflection,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL334_591_a" id="target_note_LCL334_591_a"><sup>a</sup></a> then a word is like another word when it is similar to the other word in the thing which it denotes and in the spoken word by which it denotes the thing and in the form which it has after an inflectional change has taken place. Inflection<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL334_591_b" id="target_note_LCL334_591_b"><sup>b</sup></a> is that which takes place when some change of the spoken word is made from word-form to word-form or to a new word-stem by derivation, in order to express a change of the thought.
