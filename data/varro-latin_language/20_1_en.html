I am decidedly of the opinion, that it is from <span class="italic">advectus</span> ‘transport by water’; for of old the hill was cut off from everything else by swampy pools and streams. Therefore they <span class="italic">advehebantur</span> ‘were conveyed’ thither by rafts; and traces of this survive, in that the way by which they were then transported is now called <span class="italic">Velabrum</span> ‘ferry,’ and the place from which they landed at the bottom of New Street is a chapel of the Velabra.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL333_41_d" id="target_note_LCL333_41_d"><sup>d</sup></a></p>
