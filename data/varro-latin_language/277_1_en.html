from outside, as in <span class="italic">eques</span> ‘horseman’ and <span class="italic">equiso</span> ‘stable-boy’—for both are derived from <span class="italic">equus</span> ‘horse.’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL334_557_d" id="target_note_LCL334_557_d"><sup>d</sup></a></p>
<p>29. By this method, you will, on making a comparison, know that of men observed in person one is or is not like the other; but you could not say that the two are in like fashion taller than their brothers, if you should not know how tall those shorter brothers are with whom they are compared. In this way the likenesses of things broader and higher, and others of the same kind, cannot be examined without bringing in some help from outside. So therefore, inasmuch as certain case-forms are of this kind, it is not easy to say that they are like, if you observe the spoken words in one case only; to make a correct judgement, you will have to bring in another case-form to which the spoken word passes as it is inflected.</p>

It remains to speak of the articles, of which some are like nouns and others are different. For of the five classes the first two have the same properties, because they have forms for masculine, feminine, and neuter, they have some forms to denote the singular and others to denote the plural, and they have five cases; the vocative is not indicated by a separate spoken form. They have this of their own, that some are definite, like <span class="italic">hic</span> ‘this,’ feminine <span class="italic">haec</span>, and others are indefinite, like <span class="italic">quis</span> ‘which,’ feminine <span class="italic">quae</span>. But since their system of Regularity is shadowy and thin, it is not necessary to speak further of it in this book.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL334_557_a" id="target_note_LCL334_557_a"><sup>a</sup></a></p>
