Therefore likewise there are the two fundamentals, station and motion, each divided into four kinds: what is stationary or is in motion, is body; where it is in motion, is place; while it is in motion, is time; what is inherent in the motion, is action. The fourfold division will be clearer in this way: body is, so to speak, the runner, place is the race-course where he runs, time is the period during which he runs, action is the running.</p>

Therefore it comes about that for this reason all things, in general, are divided into four phases, and these universal; because there is never time without there being motion—for even an intermission of motion is time—; nor is there motion where there is not place and body, because the latter is that which is moved, and the former is where; nor where this motion is, does there fail to be action. Therefore place and body, time and action are the four-horse team of the elements.</p>
<p>13. Therefore because the primal classes of things are four in number, so many are the primal classes of words. From among these, concerning places and those things which are seen in them, I shall put a summary account in this book; but we shall follow them up wherever the kin of the word under discussion is, even if it has driven its roots beyond its own territory. For often the roots of a tree which is close to the line of the property have gone out under the neighbour’s cornfield.
