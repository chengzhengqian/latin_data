which indicates also case, a second which indicates also time, a third which indicates neither.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL334_381_b" id="target_note_LCL334_381_b"><sup>b</sup></a> Of these, Aristotle<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL334_381_c" id="target_note_LCL334_381_c"><sup>c</sup></a> says that there are two parts of speech; nouns, like <span class="italic">homo</span> ‘man’ and <span class="italic">equus</span> ‘horse,’ and verbs, like <span class="italic">legit</span> ‘gathers’ and <span class="italic">currit</span> ‘runs.’</p>
<p>12. Of the two kinds, noun and verb, certain words are primary and certain are secondary<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL334_381_a" id="target_note_LCL334_381_a"><sup>a</sup></a>: primary like <span class="italic">homo</span> ‘man’ and <span class="italic">scribit</span> ‘writes,’ and secondary like <span class="italic">doctus</span> ‘learned’ and <span class="italic">docte</span> ‘learnedly,’ for we say <span class="italic">homo doctus</span> ‘a learned man’ and <span class="italic">scribit docte</span> ‘writes learnedly.’ These ideas are attended by those of place and time, because neither <span class="italic">homo</span> nor <span class="italic">scribit</span> can be asserted without the presupposition of place and of time—yet in such a way that place is more closely associated with the idea of the noun <span class="italic">homo,</span> and time more closely with the act of writing.</p>
<p>13. Since among these the noun is first—for the noun comes ahead of the verb,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL334_381_a" id="target_note_LCL334_381_a"><sup>a</sup></a> and the other words stand later relatively to the noun and the verb—the nouns are accordingly first. Therefore I shall speak of the form-variations<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL334_381_b" id="target_note_LCL334_381_b"><sup>b</sup></a> of nouns before I take up those of verbs.</p>
<p>V. 14. Nouns are varied in form either to show differences in those things of which they are the names, as the woman’s name <span class="italic">Terentia</span> from the man’s name <span class="italic">Terentius</span>, or to denote those things outside, of which they are not the names, as <span class="italic">equiso</span> ‘stable-boy’ from <span class="italic">equus</span> ‘horse.’ To show differences in themselves they are varied in form either on account of the nature of the thing itself about which mention is
