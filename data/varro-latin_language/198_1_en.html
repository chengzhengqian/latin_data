<p>XVIII. 34. But if the proper thing is that all words that start from similar forms should be inflected similarly, it follows that from dissimilar starting forms dissimilar forms should be made by inflection; and this is not what is found. For from like forms some like forms are made, and other unlike forms, and from unlike forms also come some like forms and some unlike forms. For instance, from likes come likes, as from <span class="italic">bonus</span> ‘good’ and <span class="italic">malus</span> ‘bad’ come the neuter<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL334_399_a" id="target_note_LCL334_399_a"><sup>a</sup></a> forms <span class="italic">bonum</span> and <span class="italic">malum</span>; also from likes come unlikes, as from <span class="italic">lupus</span> ‘wolf’ and <span class="italic">lepus</span> ‘hare’ come the unlike datives <span class="italic">lupo</span> and <span class="italic">lepori.</span> On the other hand, from unlikes there are unlikes, as from the nominatives <span class="italic">Priamus</span> and <span class="italic">Paris</span> come the datives <span class="italic">Priamo</span> and <span class="italic">Pari</span>; also from unlikes there are likes, as nominatives <span class="italic">Iupiter</span> ‘Jupiter,’ <span class="italic">ovis</span> ‘sheep,’ and datives <span class="italic">Iovi</span> and <span class="italic">ovi.</span></p>
<p>35. So much the more now must it be denied that Regularities exist, because not only are unlikes made from likes, but also from identical words unlikes are made, and not merely likes, but identicals are made from unlikes. From identical names unlikes, it is clear, are made, because while there are two towns named <span class="italic">Alba,</span> the people of the one are called <span class="italic">Albani</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL334_399_a-1" id="target_note_LCL334_399_a-1"><sup>a</sup></a> and those of the other are called <span class="italic">Albenses</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL334_399_b-1" id="target_note_LCL334_399_b-1"><sup>b</sup></a>; while there are three cities named Athens, the people of the one are called <span class="italic">Athenaei</span>, those of the second are <span class="italic">Athenaiis</span>, those of the third <span class="italic">Athenaeopolitae.</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL334_399_c-1" id="target_note_LCL334_399_c-1"><sup>c</sup></a></p>
<p>36. Similarly, many words made in derivation from different words are found to be identical, as when I say accusative <span class="italic">Luam</span> from Saturn’s <span class="italic">Lua,</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL334_399_a-2" id="target_note_LCL334_399_a-2"><sup>a</sup></a> and
