<p>Fr. 28.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL334_619_a" id="target_note_LCL334_619_a"><sup>a</sup></a> (1) When I wished to be introduced to the science of logic and instructed in it, it was necessary to take up and learn what the logicians call εἰσαγωγαί, or ‘introductory exercises.’ (2) Then because at first I had to learn about axioms, which Marcus Varro calls, now <span class="italic">profata</span> or ‘propositions,’ and now <span class="italic">proloquia</span> or ‘forthright statements,’ I sought diligently for the <span class="italic">Commentary on Proloquia</span> of Lucius Aelius, a learned man, who was the teacher of Varro; and finding it in the Library of Peace,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL334_619_b" id="target_note_LCL334_619_b"><sup>b</sup></a> I read it. (3) But I found in it nothing that was written to instruct or to make the matter clear; Aelius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL334_619_c" id="target_note_LCL334_619_c"><sup>c</sup></a> seems to have made that book rather as suggestions for his own use than for the purpose of teaching others.</p>
<p>(4) I therefore of necessity returned to my Greek books. From these I obtained this definition of an axiom: “a proposition complete in itself, declared with reference to itself only.” (5) This I have forborne to turn into Latin, since it would have been necessary to use new and as yet uncoined words, such as, from their strangeness, the ear could hardly endure. (6) But Marcus Varro, in the twenty-fourth book of his treatise <span class="italic">On the Latin Language</span>, dedicated to Cicero, thus defines the word very briefly: “A <span class="italic">proloquium</span> is a statement in which nothing is lacking.”</p>
<p>(7) But his definition will be clearer if I give an example. An axiom, then, or a forthright statement, if you prefer, is of this kind: “Hannibal was a Carthaginian”; “Scipio destroyed Numantia”; “Milo was found guilty of murder”; “Pleasure is neither a good nor an evil”; (8) and in general any saying which is a full and perfect thought, so expressed in words that it is necessarily either true or false, is called by the logicians an axiom; by Marcus Varro,
