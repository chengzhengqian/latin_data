and <span class="italic">avi</span> ‘bird,’ others say <span class="italic">ove</span> and <span class="italic">ave</span>; in the plural, the nominative is <span class="italic">puppis</span> ‘ship’s sterns’ and <span class="italic">restis</span> ‘ropes,’ also <span class="italic">puppes</span> and <span class="italic">restes</span>; likewise there is the fact that in the genitive plural of words of this class there are used the variant forms <span class="italic">civitatum</span> ‘of states,’ <span class="italic">parentum</span> ‘of parents,’ and <span class="italic">civitatium, parentium</span>, and in the accusative plural <span class="italic">monies</span> ‘mountains,’ <span class="italic">fontes</span> ‘springs,’ and <span class="italic">montis, fontis</span>.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL334_425_a" id="target_note_LCL334_425_a"><sup>a</sup></a></p>

Likewise they say that, if there is Regularity, like forms ought to be made from like words declined alike, and that this can be shown not to take place; that therefore this theory is to be rejected. And yet this failure can be shown; for how can anything be more alike than gens ‘clan,’ <span class="italic">mens</span> ‘mind,’ <span class="italic">dens</span> ‘tooth’? Despite which their genitives and accusatives in the plural are unlike; for from the first word are made <span class="italic">gentium</span> and <span class="italic">gentis,</span> with I in both, from the second come <span class="italic">mentium</span> and <span class="italic">mentes</span>, with I in the former only, from the third <span class="italic">dentum</span> and <span class="italic">denies,</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL334_425_a" id="target_note_LCL334_425_a"><sup>a</sup></a> with I in neither form.</p>

So likewise since <span class="italic">surus</span> ‘stake,’ <span class="italic">lupus</span> ‘wolf,’ <span class="italic">lepus</span> ‘hare’ are alike in the nominative, they ask why there is not said in like fashion<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL334_425_a" id="target_note_LCL334_425_a"><sup>a</sup></a> <span class="italic">suro, lupo, lepo.</span> But if the answer is given that they are not alike, because in the vocative we use the unlike forms <span class="italic">sure</span>, <span class="italic">lupe, lepus</span> (this to be sure is what Aristarchus wished to say in reply to Crates; for when Crates had written that <span class="italic">Philomedes, Heraclides, Melicertes</span> were alike, he said that they were not alike, because in the vocative<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL334_425_b" id="target_note_LCL334_425_b"><sup>b</sup></a> <span class="italic">Philomedes</span> is said with a short E, <span class="italic">Heraclide</span>
