<p>2. From the manifold nature of this sort there are these causes of the differences: for what reason, and to what product,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL334_373_a" id="target_note_LCL334_373_a"><sup>a</sup></a> and in what way, in speaking, the words are declined. The first two of these I shall pass over briefly, for two reasons: because there will have to be a rehandling of the topics when I write of the stock of words,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL334_373_b" id="target_note_LCL334_373_b"><sup>b</sup></a> and because the third of them has numerous and extensive subdivisions of its own.</p>
<p>II. 3. Inflection<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL334_373_a" id="target_note_LCL334_373_a"><sup>a</sup></a> has been introduced not only into Latin speech, but into the speech of all men, because it is useful and necessary; for if this system had not developed, we could not learn such a great number of words as we have learned—for the possible forms into which they are inflected are numerically unlimited—nor from those which we should have learned would it be clear what relationship existed between them so far as their meanings were concerned. But as it is, we do see, for the reason that that which is the offshoot bears a similarity to the original: when <span class="italic">legi</span> ‘I have gathered’ is inflected from <span class="italic">lego</span> ‘I gather,’ two things are clear at the same time, namely that in some fashion the acts are said to be the same, and yet that their doing did not take place at the same time. But if, for the sake of a word, one of these two related ideas was called <span class="italic">Priamus</span> and the other <span class="italic">Hecuba,</span> there would be no indication of the unity of idea which is clear in <span class="italic">lego</span> and <span class="italic">legi,</span> and in nominative <span class="italic">Priamus,</span> dative <span class="italic">Priamo.</span></p>
<p>4. As among men there are certain kinships, some through the males, others through the clan, so there are among words. For as from an Aemilius were sprung the men named Aemilius, and the clan-members of the name, so from the name of <span class="italic">Aemilius</span> were inflected the words in the noun-clan: for from that
