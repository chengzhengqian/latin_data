others are of opinion that this should be disregarded and rather men should follow the dissimilar and irregular, which is found in ordinary habitual speech—which
they called the product of Anomaly.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL334_391_d" id="target_note_LCL334_391_d"><sup>d</sup></a> But in my opinion we ought to follow both, because in voluntary derivation there is Anomaly, and in the natural derivation there is even more strikingly Regularity.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL334_391_e" id="target_note_LCL334_391_e"><sup>e</sup></a></p>
<p>24. About these two kinds of derivation I shall write two sets of three books each: the first three about the principles of these derivations, and the latter set about the products of these principles. In the former set the first book will contain the views which may be offered against likeness in derivation and declension; the second will contain the arguments against unlikeness; the third will be about the shape and manner of the likenesses. What I have set in order on these topics, I shall write in the three separate books; then on the second set of topics I shall begin to write, with due division into the same number of books.</p>
<p>X. 25. Inasmuch as it is the task of this book to speak against those who follow likeness<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL334_391_a" id="target_note_LCL334_391_a"><sup>a</sup></a>—which is like the relation of boy to old man in the matter of human life, and like that of girl to old woman, and in verbs is the relation of <span class="italic">scribo</span> ‘I write’ and <span class="italic">scribam</span> ‘I shall write’—I shall speak first against Regularity in general, and then thereafter concerning its several subdivisions. I shall begin with the nature of human speech.</p>
<p>XI. 26. All speaking ought to be aimed at practical utility, and it attains this only if it is clear
