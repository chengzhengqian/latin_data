shrines of the Argei<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL333_43_b" id="target_note_LCL333_43_b"><sup>b</sup></a> were distributed among the four sections of the City.

From this hill the followers of Caeles are said, after his death, to have been brought down into the level ground, because they were in possession of a location which was too strongly fortified and their loyalty was somewhat under suspicion.
