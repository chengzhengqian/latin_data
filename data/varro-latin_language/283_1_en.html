<p>Therefore by the crosswise inflections there are made from these words systems of Regularity like <span class="italic">Albius</span> and <span class="italic">Atrius, Albio</span> and <span class="italic">Atrio</span>, which to be sure is only a small part of that binary scheme; and by the vertical inflections are made <span class="italic">Albius</span> and <span class="italic">Atrius, Albia</span> and <span class="italic">Atria</span>, which is a part of the tenfold scheme of Regularities of which I have spoken above.</p>
<p>45. Of that which is called Regularity, there are two kinds. One is disjoined, thus: as one is to two, so ten is to twenty. The other is conjoined, thus: as one is to two, so two is to four. Because in it two is said twice, both when we compare it with one, and then when we compare it with four,</p>
<p>46. this kind also is said to be fourfold by nature. So the cithers, though with seven strings, are none the less said to have two sets of four strings, because just as the sound of the first string stands in a certain relation to that of the fourth, so the fourth stands in the same relation to the seventh; the middle string is the first of the one set and the last of the other. The doctors who watch the seven days when a man is ill,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL334_569_a" id="target_note_LCL334_569_a"><sup>a</sup></a> note the symptoms of the illness with greater care on the fourth day, for the reason that the relation which the first day had to the fourth, foretells that the day which will be fourth from it, that is, seventh from the first, will bear the same relation to the fourth.</p>
<p>47. The Regularities are disjoined and fourfold in the cases of nouns, such as <span class="italic">rex</span> ‘king,’ dative <span class="italic">regi</span>, and <span class="italic">lex</span> ‘law,’ dative <span class="italic">legi</span>; they are conjoined and threefold in the three tenses of verbs, such as <span class="italic">legebam</span> ‘I was reading,’ present <span class="italic">lego</span>, future <span class="italic">legam</span>, because the relation which <span class="italic">legebam</span> has to <span class="italic">lego</span>, this same relation <span class="italic">lego</span>
