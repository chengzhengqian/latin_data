and other things, of which some are called harmonic, and others are called by other names; but no one of these becomes an element in speaking.</p>
<p>65. The differences which pertain to speech, consist of those things which are expressed by the words in a proportionate way, and yet do not have a likeness of the spoken words also to help in forming the inflections: such as nominative <span class="italic">Iupiter</span> and <span class="italic">Marspiter</span>, dative <span class="italic">Iovi</span> and <span class="italic">Marti.</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL334_583_a" id="target_note_LCL334_583_a"><sup>a</sup></a> For these are like one another in the gender of the nouns, and in the number, and in the cases; because both are nouns, and are masculine, and singular, and nominative and dative in case.</p>
<p>66. The second kind has to do with the sounds, in which the spoken words only are similar in a proportionate way—and not the things—as in <span class="italic">biga</span> and <span class="italic">bigae, nuptia</span> and <span class="italic">nuptiae.</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL334_583_a" id="target_note_LCL334_583_a"><sup>a</sup></a> For in these there is no underlying unit thing expressed by the singular when we say <span class="italic">biga</span> or <span class="italic">quadriga</span>, nor have the plural forms which are derived from these words any plural meaning. Yet all plurals which are derived from a unit singular, like <span class="italic">merulae</span> from <span class="italic">merula</span> ‘blackbird,’ do have such plural meaning; for they are of such a sort that there is subordination to a singular form: thus two <span class="italic">merulae</span> ‘blackbirds,’ three <span class="italic">catulae</span> ‘female puppies,’ four <span class="italic">faculae</span> ‘torches.’</p>
<p>67. Therefore since there cannot be the same subordinating relation because we do not say <span class="italic">una biga, duae quadrigae, tres nuptiae</span>, but instead <span class="italic">unae bigae</span> ‘one two-horse team,’ <span class="italic">binae quadrigae</span> ‘two teams of four horses,’ <span class="italic">trinae nuptiae</span> ‘three sets of nuptials,’ it is clear that <span class="italic">bigae</span> and <span class="italic">quadrigae</span> are not from <span class="italic">biga</span> and <span class="italic">quadriga</span>, but belong to another series: the usual
