Equator to the Tropic of Cancer, and from there to the Arctic Circle, is not also its counterpart, extending from the Tropic of Capricorn in the other direction, likewise divided into equal sections? Is it not a fact that as far as the North Pole is removed from the Arctic Circle and this from the Tropic of Cancer, around which the sun travels when it comes to the summer solstice, so far the South Pole is from that Circle which the astronomers call the Antarctic, and this from the Tropic of Capricorn? Is it not true that in the fashion in which each constellation has risen in the sky this year, in just the same fashion it rises each and every year?</p>
<p>25. The sun does not come in one way from the Tropic of Capricorn to the Equator, does it, and on the other hand, when it comes to the Tropic of Cancer, return in a different way to the Equator and thence to Capricorn? The moon, when it goes away from the sun to the north and returns from there into the same path which the sun pursues, goes on from there to the south and comes back again in just the same way, does it not? But why should I speak further of the stars, in the case of which there is unusual difficulty in finding any irregularity which exists or takes place in their motions?</p>

But in the sea, I suppose, the motions do not have the twofold likenesses<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL334_457_a" id="target_note_LCL334_457_a"><sup>a</sup></a>—the motions which in twenty-four lunar<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL334_457_b" id="target_note_LCL334_457_b"><sup>b</sup></a> hours change themselves four times, and when the tides have risen for six hours, and have ebbed for just as many, they likewise rise again, and in the same fashion ebb after this time. Or do they keep this Regularity for a day’s space, and not likewise for a month, since similarly they have another set of motions<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL334_457_c" id="target_note_LCL334_457_c"><sup>c</sup></a> which
