the first is the <span class="italic">agitatus</span> ‘motion’ of the mind, because we must first <span class="italic">cogitare</span> ‘consider’ those things which we are <span class="italic">acturi</span> ‘going to do,’ and then thereafter say them and do them. Of these three, the common folk practically never thinks that <span class="italic">cogitatio</span> ‘consideration’ is an action; but it thinks that the third, in which we do something, is the most important. But also when we <span class="italic">cogitamus</span> ‘consider’ something and <span class="italic">agitamus</span> ‘turn it over’ in mind, we <span class="italic">agimus</span> ‘are acting,’ and when we make an utterance, we <span class="italic">agimus</span> ‘are acting.’ Therefore from this the orator is said <span class="italic">agere</span> ‘to plead’ the case, and the augurs are said<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL333_213_a" id="target_note_LCL333_213_a"><sup>a</sup></a> <span class="italic">agere</span> ‘to practice’ augury, although in it there is more saying than doing.</p>
<p>43. <span class="italic">Cogitare</span> ‘to consider’ is said from <span class="italic">cogere</span> ‘to bring together’: the mind <span class="italic">cogit</span> ‘brings together’ several things into one place, from which it can choose. Thus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL333_213_a" id="target_note_LCL333_213_a"><sup>a</sup></a> from milk that is <span class="italic">coactum</span> ‘pressed,’ <span class="italic">caseus</span> ‘cheese’ was named; thus from men brought together was the <span class="italic">contio</span> ‘mass meeting’ called, thus <span class="italic">coemptio</span> ‘marriage by mutual sale,’ thus <span class="italic">compitum</span> ‘cross-roads.’ From <span class="italic">cogitatio</span> consideration’ came <span class="italic">concilium</span> ‘council,’ and from that came <span class="italic">consilium</span> ‘counsel’;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL333_213_b" id="target_note_LCL333_213_b"><sup>b</sup></a> and the <span class="italic">concilium</span> is said <span class="italic">conciliari</span> ‘to be brought into unity’ like a garment when it <span class="italic">cogitur</span> ‘is pressed’ at the cleaner’s.</p>
<p>44. Thus <span class="italic">reminisci</span> ‘to recall,’ when those things which have been held by mind and memory are fetched back again by considering (<span class="italic">cogitando</span>). From this also <span class="italic">comminisci</span> ‘to fabricate a story’ is said, from <span class="italic">con</span> ‘together’ and <span class="italic">mens</span> ‘mind,’ when things which are not, are devised in the mind; and from that comes the word <span class="italic">eminisci</span> ‘to use the imagination,’ when the <span class="italic">commentum</span> ‘fabrication’ is uttered.
