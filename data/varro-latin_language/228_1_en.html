agree with one another? Of these I have written in the book which I composed <span class="italic">On Tidal Inlets.</span></p>
<p>XX. 27. On the earth, is not Regularity preserved in the case of plantings? Does it not give us to-day fruits of precisely the same kind as it has given us in the past? Does it not regularly return to us a crop of barley when barley has been sown, even as it returns a crop of wheat when wheat has been sown? Does not Asia have rivers and lakes, mountains and plains, even as Europe has?</p>
<p>XXI. 28. Is not Regularity preserved among the birds, according to their kind? As the progeny of eagles are eagles and the progeny of thrushes are thrushes, are not the progeny of the other birds all of their own proper and special kind?</p>
<p>XXII. Does the process go on in another way in the water, than in the air? Are not the shell-fish here all like their own kind, despite their countless number? Are not the fishes? Is a sea-bass or a sea-carp produced of a moray? Is not one head of cattle like another, when compared, and so also the calves which are procreated by them? Even where the offspring is unlike the parents, as the mule born of a he-ass and a mare, even there there is Regularity none the less: the offspring of any ass and mare whatsoever is a mule, male or female, as the offspring of a stallion and a she-ass is a hinny.</p>
<p>XXIII. 29. Are not in this way all the offspring of man and woman alike, in that they are boys and girls? Do these not have all their limbs mutually alike, in such a way that item by item they are pairs in likeness, in their own special kinds? As all are made up of soul and body, are not also the parts of soul and body alike with the same regularity?</p>
