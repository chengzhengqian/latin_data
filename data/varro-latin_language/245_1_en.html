<p>69. So also, the hot springs, on account of the locality and the water which gushed out there, came to be frequented for our use, since some of the springs were beneficial to one disease and others to another; and because those which they used were several in number, as at Puteoli and in Etruria,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL334_493_a-1" id="target_note_LCL334_493_a-1"><sup>a</sup></a> they called them by a plural word rather than by a singular. So also with the <span class="italic">scalae</span> ‘stairs’; because they are named from <span class="italic">scandere</span> ‘to mount’ and there were separate steps to be mounted, it would be a more difficult problem to answer if they had called them <span class="italic">scala</span>, in the singular, inasmuch as the origin of the name shows their plural nature.</p>

<p>71. But they should not look for complete Regularity even in these names which are derived by passage from one nominative form to another.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL334_493_a-3a" id="target_note_LCL334_493_a-3a"><sup>a</sup></a> Still, such words do not in general depart from the path of logic without valid reason, such as there is for those gladiators who are called <span class="italic">Faustini</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL334_493_b-3" id="target_note_LCL334_493_b-3"><sup>b</sup></a>; for though most gladiators are spoken of in such a way that they
