Therefore it is not to be demanded that from <span class="italic">terra</span> ‘earth’ there should be also a <span class="italic">terrus</span>, because there is no natural basis that in this object there ought to be one word for the male and another for the female. Similarly, with respect to usage, while <span class="italic">Terentius</span> designates one person of the name and <span class="italic">Terentii</span> designates several, it is not to be demanded that in this way we should say <span class="italic">faba</span> ‘bean’ and <span class="italic">fabae</span> ‘beans,’ for the two are not subject to the same use.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL334_467_a" id="target_note_LCL334_467_a"><sup>a</sup></a> Nor is it to be demanded that as we say acc. <span class="italic">Terentium</span> from nom. <span class="italic">Terentius</span>, we should make case-forms from <span class="italic">A</span> and <span class="italic">B</span>,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL334_467_b" id="target_note_LCL334_467_b"><sup>b</sup></a> because not every utterance is naturally fitted for declensional forms.</p>

These matters, which have been touched upon hastily here, will become clearer in a later discussion.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL334_467_a" id="target_note_LCL334_467_a"><sup>a</sup></a> Now I shall start.</p>
