not unlike; but although there are the three, like, unlike, neutral, there can also be a division into two parts only, in such a way that whatever you compare with something else either is like or is not. They think that a thing is like and is unlike if it is seen to be of such a kind as I have described, and neutral, if it does not have greater weight on one side than on the other; as if the two things which are being compared have twenty parts each, and among these should have ten to be noted as identical and ten likewise to be noted as different, in respect to likeness and unlikeness. This nature most scholars include under the name of unlikeness.</p>
<p>6. Therefore since it happens that the question in dispute seems rather to be about the name than about the thing, attention must rather be directed, when something is said to be like, to the problem to what part it is said to be like; for it is in this that any mistake ordinarily rests. This must be noted, I say, because it can happen that a man may not be like another man even though he has many parts like the other’s, and can be said therefore to have like eyes, hands, feet, and other physical features in considerable number, separately and taken together, like the other man’s.</p>
<p>7. Therefore because careful watch must be kept in words to see what parts those words which are said to show likeness ought to have alike, and in what ways, the inquirer is on this topic especially likely to slip into error, as will appear below. For to the careless person what can seem more alike than the two words <span class="italic">suis</span> and <span class="italic">suis</span>? But they are not alike, because one is from <span class="italic">suere</span> ‘to sew’ and means ‘thou sewest,’ and the other is from <span class="italic">sus</span> and means ‘of a swine.’ Therefore
