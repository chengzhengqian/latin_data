Polymachaeroplagides is sending this written letter
to the pimp Ballio, sealed with the picture that was once<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1000</span><span class="br"></span>
agreed upon among the two of us.”</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">simi</span><p class="lineGroup">The token is on the letter.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">bal</span><p class="lineGroup">I can see the token and recognize it. But does he have
the habit of not sending any written wish for well-being
in his letters?</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">simi</span><p class="lineGroup">That’s the custom in the army, Ballio: with their hands<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1005</span><span class="br"></span>
they give well-being
to those who wish them well; with
the same hands they give a thrashing to those who wish
them ill. But as you’ve begun, continue to make an effort
to find out what that letter tells you.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">bal</span><p class="lineGroup">Just listen. “Harpax is my batman who has come to
you—” Are you that Harpax?<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1010</span><span class="br"></span></p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">simi</span><p class="lineGroup">I am, and a very harpy indeed.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">bal</span><p class="lineGroup">“—and who’s brought you that letter. Take the money
from him; I want the woman to be sent together with
him. It’s right to send good wishes in writing to those who
deserve them; if I thought you deserved them, I’d have
sent them to you.”</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">simi</span><p class="lineGroup">Well then?<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1015</span><span class="br"></span></p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">bal</span><p class="lineGroup">Give me the money and take the woman away.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">simi</span><p class="lineGroup">Which of us is delaying?</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">bal</span><p class="lineGroup">Then follow me in.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">simi</span><p class="lineGroup">Yes.</p><span class="stage"><span class="italic">Exeunt<span class="sc">ballio</span> and <span class="sc">simia</span> into the former’s house.</span></span></div>

to that chap, and that he might turn his horns against me
