in case anyone should ask me about the rest of the
entertainment: that’s how I and my young master spent
this day merrily after I completed my entire work the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1270</span><span class="br"></span>
way I liked, having put my enemies to flight. I left them
reclining, drinking, and making love together with their
prostitutes, and I left my prostitute in the same place, all
enjoying themselves and having a good time. But after I
got up, they asked me to dance. I struck a pose for them
like this (<span class="italic">demonstrates</span>), in good form and very much
in the correct style, since I learned the Ionian dance<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL260_381_60" id="target_note_LCL260_381_60"><sup>60</sup></a><span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1275</span><span class="br"></span>
well. But dressed in a mantle I merrily strutted these
steps like this. (<span class="italic">demonstrates again</span>) They clapped and
shouted “encore” at me so that I’d return. I began again,
in this way (<span class="italic">demonstrates again</span>), yet I didn’t
want to. I
was showing off to my girlfriend so that she’d love me;
when I was doing a pirouette, I fell: that was the unhappy
end of my performance. And so while I was struggling
up, whoops! I almost soiled my mantle. Then they were<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1280</span><span class="br"></span>
really delighted. In return for my fall they gave me the
tankard; I drank. I put my mantle on at once and took
the old one off. I went out here so as to get rid of my
headache. Now I’m coming from my master to my old
master to remind him of our treaty. (<span class="italic">knocking at Simo’s
door</span>) Open up, open up! Hey, someone announce to
Simo that I’m here!
