<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">simo</span><p class="lineGroup">(<span class="italic">to Pseudolus</span>) Why was this concealed from me as soon
as you got to know of it? Why didn’t
I find out?</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">pseu</span><p class="lineGroup">I’ll tell you. Because I didn’t
want to be the origin of the
evil custom of a slave accusing his own master in front of
his other master.</p></div>

The wrongdoings are mine. (<span class="italic">to Simo</span>) Now pay
attention to why I kept you in the dark about your son’s
love affair: I knew that the mill would be waiting for me
if I’d told you.</p></div>
