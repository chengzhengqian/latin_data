But what’s your name?</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">pseu</span><p class="lineGroup">(<span class="italic">aside</span>) The pimp has a slave called Syrus, I’ll say that I’m
him. (<span class="italic">aloud</span>) I’m Syrus.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">har</span><p class="lineGroup">Syrus?</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">pseu</span><p class="lineGroup">That’s my name.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">har</span><p class="lineGroup">We’re making a lot of words. If your master’s at home,
why don’t
you call him out so that I can do what I was
sent for?</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">pseu</span><p class="lineGroup">Whatever your name is, if he were inside, I’d call him<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">640</span><span class="br"></span>
out. But if you want to give it to me, it’ll be paid more
surely than if you’d given it to himself.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">har</span><p class="lineGroup">But you know what? My master sent me to pay this, not
to lose it. I know for sure that you have a fever because
you can’t dig your claws into it. I won’t entrust a single
coin to anyone other than Ballio himself.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">pseu</span><p class="lineGroup">But he’s busy now; he has a case on before the judge.<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">645</span><span class="br"></span></p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">har</span><p class="lineGroup">May the gods let it turn out well! But when I believe he’s
at home, I’ll return. You, take this letter from me and
give it to him: the token between my master and yours
about the woman is there. (<span class="italic">hands over a letter</span>)</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">pseu</span><p class="lineGroup">I know: he said he wanted the woman to be sent with the
man who brought the money and his stamped image<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">650</span><span class="br"></span>
here to us. He left a copy of it here too.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">har</span><p class="lineGroup">You’ve got the whole business.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">pseu</span><p class="lineGroup">Why shouldn’t
I have got it?</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">har</span><p class="lineGroup">Then give him that token.</p></div><notes></notes></section>
