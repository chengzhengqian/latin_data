What are you going to do now after being so generous
with promises to master’s son? Where are they? Not a
drop of certain counsel is ready for you, [or indeed of
money. And I don’t
know what I should do now.] You
have neither a starting point for beginning your web nor<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">400</span><span class="br"></span>
fixed limits for finishing
it. Yet just as a poet, when he
takes writing tablets, looks for something that doesn’t
exist anywhere, but finds it nonetheless and makes likely
what is a lie, I shall now become a poet: even though the
twenty minas don’t
exist anywhere, I’ll find them nonetheless.<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">405</span><span class="br"></span>
And I’d said to him long ago that I’d give it to
him and I wanted to harpoon our old man; yet somehow
he got wind of it before. But I need to keep my voice and
speech in check: look, I can see my master Simo coming<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">410</span><span class="br"></span>
here together with his neighbor Callipho. I’ll dig twenty
minas out of this old tomb today so that I can give it to
master’s son. Now I’ll walk over here, where I can listen
to their conversation. (<span class="italic">steps aside</span>)</p></div><notes></notes></section>
