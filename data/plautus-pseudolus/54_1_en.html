<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">simi</span><p class="lineGroup">Why shouldn’t
I despise you, I who am a famous military
man?</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">pseu</span><p class="lineGroup">Now I want what was begun to be done.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">simi</span><p class="lineGroup">Can you see me doing anything else?</p></div>

<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">simi</span><p class="lineGroup">No, I want to do so at a leisurely pace.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">pseu</span><p class="lineGroup">This is our chance: while that chap’s asleep, I want you

he’ll claim that I am the one he himself is.</p></div>
