Pseudolus really is a rascal! How cleverly
he came up
with this trick! He gave the same amount of money the
soldier owed me to this chap and fitted him out so that
he’d take the woman away: the real Harpax brought that
letter to me in person.</p></div>

Perhaps an <span class="italic">umbraticus</span> (<span class="italic">Curc.</span> 556) is meant,
a man living a sheltered life; or Harpax is referring to a man who does
not blush and hence has no shame; or Harpax wants to express that he
is not interested in who Ballio is and uses an alternative phrase to the
proverbial “not caring whether he is black or white” (Catull. 93.2, Cic.
