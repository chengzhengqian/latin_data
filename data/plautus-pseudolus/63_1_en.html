Yes, those who immediately consider themselves<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1105</span><span class="br"></span>
free if they’ve removed themselves from their master’s
eyes, and revel, go wenching, and eat up what they have,
those carry the name of slavery for long. They don’t
have
a fragment of honest disposition in them, unless it be the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1110</span><span class="br"></span>
disposition of supporting themselves by shameless devices.
I don’t
approve of consorting or conversing with
them and I’ve never been known to them. When I’m
given an order, I consider my master to be present, even
if he’s away. Now I’m afraid of him, while he’s not here,
