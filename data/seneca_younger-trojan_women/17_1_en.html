The young woman is to be sacrificed on the Thessalian leader’s tomb. Pyrrhus should deliver his father’s wife to him in the costume in which brides of Thessaly are customarily married, or those of Ionia or Mycenae: so she will be given with proper rites. It is not, however, this cause alone that detains our ships. More illustrious blood is owed than yours, Polyxena. The one whom fate requires, grandson of Priam through Hector, must fall from the tower’s height and meet his death. Then the fleet may fill the straits with its thousand sails.</p></div><div class="sp"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">chorus</span></span><p class="lineGroup"><span class="line indent2">Is it true, or a tale to deceive the fainthearted,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
