Never, not even if my breast were pierced with enemy weapons, or my hands were tight-bound with cutting bonds, or my body girt on each side with fierce flames, would I have cast off my loyalty as a mother. My son, what place, what destiny has you in its power? Are you roaming the countryside, lost in trackless wandering? Did the immense inferno of the city burn your body? Or did our cruel conqueror amuse himself with your bloody death? Perhaps you died in the jaws of some savage beast, and now feed the birds of Mt. Ida?</p></div><div class="sp"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">ulysses</span></span><p class="lineGroup noindent">No more feigned words.
