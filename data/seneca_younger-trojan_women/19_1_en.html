Our past sufferings were trivial, if these sufferings deserve tears. For you Ilium fell just now, but for me long ago, when the savage dragged <span class="italic">my</span> limbs behind his speeding chariot, and the Pelian axle groaned deeply, shuddering with Hector’s weight.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL062_179_31" id="target_note_LCL062_179_31"><sup>31</sup></a> <span class="italic">Then</span> I was overwhelmed and ruined: whatever happens now I endure without feeling, dazed and numbed by adversity. I would have escaped the Danaans and followed my husband by now, if this one (<span class="italic">indicating Astyanax</span>) did not hold me: he tames my spirit and prevents my death; he compels me still to ask something of the gods, and prolongs my ordeal. He has robbed me of the best fruit of suffering: having no fear. All space for wellbeing is stolen, but affliction has a means of approach. It is utterly wretched to fear, when you have no hope.</p></div><div class="sp"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">old man</span></span><p class="lineGroup noindent">What sudden fear has touched you amid your troubles?</p></div><div class="sp"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">andromache</span></span><p class="lineGroup noindent">From great adversity some greater is arising.
