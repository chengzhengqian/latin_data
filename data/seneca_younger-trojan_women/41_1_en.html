She welcomes being finely adorned in royal clothes, and allows a hand to touch her hair. That other prospect she saw as death, this she sees as marriage. But her unhappy mother is stunned to hear of this grief; her weakened mind has given way.

Just now a thriving family thronged around me; it was wearying just to share out my mother love among so many kisses, among my whole flock. Now she alone is left, my hope, companion, comfort in distress, and source of peace. She is Hecuba’s whole brood, her voice alone now calls me mother. Come, you stubborn, ill-starred spirit, slip away, and finally spare me this one death.</p></div><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL062_223_50"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL062_223_50" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">50</sup>Paris’ bowshot to Achilles’ heel was fatal—but too feeble (characteristically so, Hecuba implies) to lay his ghost too.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL062_223_50').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
