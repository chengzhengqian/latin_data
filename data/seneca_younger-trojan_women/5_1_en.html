<span class="line indent2">For what marriage do you cover your breasts,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">you modest prisoners?</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">Tie cloaks around your loosened tunics;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">to rain blows of mourning, free</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">your frenzied hands.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">Yes, this appearance</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">is right: I recognize this group as Trojan.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">Let your old griefs return once more,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">but outdo the usual style of mourning:</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">it is Hector we mourn for.</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></div><div class="sp"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">chorus</span></span><p class="lineGroup"><span class="line indent2">We have all unbound</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">our hair, torn at many a funeral;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">our locks are untied and free,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">and glowing ash has spattered our faces.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">Our garments drop from our bared shoulders</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">and are fastened to cover our hips;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">our naked breasts now draw our hands.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2"><span class="italic">Now</span> our anguish must unleash its strength.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">Let Rhoeteum’s beaches resound to our blows,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">and let Echo, dwelling in the hollowed hills,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">not briefly repeat the final words</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">as her custom is,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">but give back fully Troy’s groans of pain:</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">let sea and sky hear them all.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">Hands, be violent,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">strike my breasts with mighty blows!</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">I am not satisfied with the usual sound:</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">it is Hector we mourn for.</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></div><notes></notes></section>
