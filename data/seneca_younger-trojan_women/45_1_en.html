<span class="line indent2">Calmer in bearing disaster and storms</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">is one who sees a thousand vessels together</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">overwhelmed at sea, and the shore strewn</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">with planks from wrecks, as Corus piles up</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">waves and prevents the sea from ebbing.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent3">Phrixus lamented the fall of Helle,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">when the flock’s leader, shining-fleeced,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">lifted brother and sister together</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">on his golden back, and then jettisoned one</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">in the midst of the sea; but Pyrrha and her man</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">both checked their laments, though they saw waters</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">and saw nothing besides waters,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">the only humans left on earth.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent3">This group will be sundered, our tears scattered</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">as the fleet is driven far and wide,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">once the crews set sail at the trumpet’s bidding</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">and, sped by oars as well as winds,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">gain the open sea while the coast retreats.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">What shall we wretches feel, as all</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">the landscape dwindles and the seascape grows,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">and lofty Mt. Ida is hidden in the distance?</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">Then boy to mother and mother to son,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">showing the region where Troy lies,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">will point it out from afar, and say:</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">“Ilium is there, where smoke twists high</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">into the heavens in squalid clouds.”</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">By this sign Trojans will see their land.</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></div><notes></notes></section>
