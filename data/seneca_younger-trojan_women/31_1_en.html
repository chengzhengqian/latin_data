<p class="noindent">(<span class="italic">aside</span>) What are you doing? A mother destroying both son and husband in shared ruin? Perhaps you can soften the Danaans by an appeal. The one in hiding will be crushed this instant by the huge weight of the tomb: better that the poor child die anywhere else, than that father overwhelm son and son crush father.</p>
<p>I fall at your knees as a suppliant, Ulysses, and grasp your feet with this hand which has touched no man’s feet before. Pity a mother; receive kindly and patiently my prayers of motherly love. The higher the gods have exalted your lofty station, the more gently you should tread on the fallen; gifts to the wretched are gifts to Fortune. So may your chaste wife’s bed behold you once again, and Laertes lengthen his years until he receives you home; so may that young man of yours welcome you,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL062_203_40" id="target_note_LCL062_203_40"><sup>40</sup></a> and exceeding your hopes in his natural gifts may he surpass his grandfather’s years and his father’s intellect. Pity a mother: my sole comfort in distress is this boy.</p>
