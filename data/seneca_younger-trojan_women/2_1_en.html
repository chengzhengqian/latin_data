Assaracus’ house. Yet the flames do not curb the conqueror’s greedy hands: Troy is plundered while she burns. The sky is obscured by the billowing smoke; as though enveloped in thick cloud, the daylight is black and befouled with Ilium’s ash. The conqueror stands insatiable in his anger and measures long-lingering Ilium with his gaze, and savagely refuses as yet to forgive the ten long years. He shudders at her even in her ruins, and though he sees her defeated, he cannot convince himself that her defeat was possible.
