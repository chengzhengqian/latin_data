<span class="line indent2">bow low and do homage with suppliant hand;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">do not disdain</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">whatever Fortune demands of the wretched.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">Put out of mind your royal ancestors</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">and the great old man</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">famed as lawgiver throughout the world;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">forget Hector, play the captive,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">and on bended knee,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">if you do not yet sense your death,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">imitate your mother’s weeping.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent3">An earlier Troy</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">also saw the tears of a boy-king:</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">Priam when small</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">turned aside the threats of fierce Alcides.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">Even that fierce hero,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">to whose awesome strength all wild</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">beasts yielded,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">who broke through the doorway of Dis</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">and opened up the dark path back,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">was vanquished by the tears of his small foe.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">“Take up the reins of government,” he said,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">“and sit high on your father’s throne,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">but wield the scepter in better faith.”</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">Such was defeat by that conqueror.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">Learn from Hercules’ merciful anger.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">Or do you admire only Hercules’ weapons?</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">There lies at your feet</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">no less a suppliant than that suppliant,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">asking for life;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">for the kingship of Troy, Fortune may carry it</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">wherever she will.</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></div><notes></notes></section>
