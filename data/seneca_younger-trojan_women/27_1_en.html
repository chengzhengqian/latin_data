 Rejoice, you sons of Atreus! And you—report joyful news, as usual, to the Pelasgians: Hector’s child is dead.</p></div><div class="sp"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">ulysses</span></span><p class="lineGroup noindent">And how do you prove to the Danaans that this is true?</p></div><div class="sp"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">andromache</span></span><p class="lineGroup noindent">As I hope the worst the conqueror can threaten will come true; as I hope the Fates will release me by a timely and easy passing and hide me in my own soil, and that his native earth will press lightly on Hector: so truly has he lost the light; he lies among the dead, and entrusted to the tomb he has received the due of those departed.</p></div><div class="sp"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">ulysses</span></span><blockquote><p>
<p class="noindent">I shall gladly bring the Danaans news of Fate fulfilled by the removal of Hector’s child, and of stable peace. (<span class="italic">aside</span>) What are you doing, Ulysses? The Danaans will believe you, but whom will you believe? A parent! Yet would any parent invent this story, and not shudder at the ominous presage of death? They dread omens who have nothing worse to fear. Yet she bound her word with an oath. But if she is swearing falsely, what heavier blow could she be fearing? Now, my mind, summon up your cunning, your deceit, your trickery, everything that is Ulysses. The truth is never lost. Observe this mother. She is grieving, weeping, groaning; yet she paces nervously up and down, and strains her ears to catch each word spoken. She is more fearful than mournful. My skills are needed.</p>
<p>(<span class="italic">aloud</span>) Other parents should be consoled in their grief, but you are to be congratulated, poor woman, for losing your son, since a cruel death awaited him, hurled headlong from the only tower that remains among the ruined walls.</p>
