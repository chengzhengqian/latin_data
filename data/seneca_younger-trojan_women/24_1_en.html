as mine. This is the speech of the Greek host and their leaders, who are kept from their long-overdue homecoming by Hector’s child. The voice of the Fates demands him. Nervous trust in uncertain peace will always possess the Danaans, always fear at their back will force them to glance around and not allow them to disarm, as long as your son, Andromache, gives heart to the defeated Phrygians. The prophet Calchas proclaims this; and if the prophet Calchas were silent, yet Hector used to say so—and I fear even an offspring of his. Seeds of good stock grow up to match their ancestry. So the little calf accompanying great cattle, his budding horns not yet piercing the skin, suddenly with neck high and lofty brow leads his father’s herd and commands the drove. The tender shoot which survives from a felled trunk in a little time grows up equal to its mother, and restores shade to the earth and a leafy crown to heaven. In the same way embers carelessly left after a great fire regain strength. Admittedly pain is no impartial judge of things; but if you reflect, you will forgive the fact that after ten winters and as many harvests the soldiery, no longer young, fears wars and yet further slaughters and a Troy never truly lying at rest. It is a great matter that concerns the Danaans—a future Hector. Free the Greeks from fear. The ships are launched; this one cause delays them, for this the fleet is stayed. And do not think me cruel because the lot ordered me to demand Hector’s son: I would have demanded Orestes. Endure what the victor bore.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL062_189_35" id="target_note_LCL062_189_35"><sup>35</sup></a></p></div><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL062_189_35"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL062_189_35" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">35</sup>I.e., loss of a child (Iphigenia) by Agamemnon, to allow the fleet to sail.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL062_189_35').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
