prisoner. Is Ilium overthrown, your guardian gods fallen? It is hard to lose one’s country, but harder to be afraid of it. You are solaced by so large a companionship in suffering; I suffer the rage of both conqueror and conquered. Which woman each Greek would seize as slave has long hung in uncertainty; my master seized me immediately, without drawing lots. Was I the cause of the war, and of such disaster for Trojans? Believe this true, if a <span class="italic">Spartan</span> ship cut through <span class="italic">your</span> seas. But if I was plunder stolen by Phrygian sailors, a victorious goddess’ gift to her judge,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL062_221_49" id="target_note_LCL062_221_49"><sup>49</sup></a> Paris needs your forgiveness. My case certainly will have an angry judge: this decision awaits Menelaus. Now set your own grief aside a little, Andromache, and prevail on her (<span class="italic">indicating Polyxena</span>)—I can scarcely hold back my tears.</p></div><div class="sp"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">andromache</span></span><p class="lineGroup noindent">How great the trouble that makes Helen weep! Yet why is she weeping? Tell us what tricks, what crimes the Ithacan is weaving. Is the maiden to be hurled from Mt. Ida’s ridge, or thrown from a jutting rock on the towering citadel? Not flung into the desolate sea, tumbling down these cliffs which sheer-sided Sigeon raises, a lofty peak looking down on shallow bays? Speak, tell us what you are hiding beneath your deceitful looks. Any hurt is easier to bear than Pyrrhus as son-in-law to Priam and Hecuba. Tell us, reveal what torment you are preparing, and spare our sufferings one thing: being tricked. You see us prepared to endure death.</p></div><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL062_221_49"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL062_221_49" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">49</sup>I.e., Venus’ reward to Paris for his famous judgment.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL062_221_49').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
