Jupiter forbid you to persist in that course or to allow such madness to enter your mind. But if you do persist, I fear that through your own fault you may bring such trouble upon your whole life that you can never make peace with yourself.</p>
<p><span class="bold">2.</span> Eulogy of Cicero from the book of Cornelius Nepos on the Latin Historians.</p>
<p>1. You ought not to be unaware that this<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL467_331_1" id="target_note_LCL467_331_1"><sup>1</sup></a> is the only branch of Latin literature that even in my own time cannot be compared with what the Greeks accomplished, and that it was left wholly rude and unfinished by the death of Cicero. For he was the only man who could, or even sought to, give history a worthy utterance, since he highly polished the rude eloquence handed down from our forefathers, and gave Latin philosophy, which before his time was uncouth, the finish of his style. Which leads me to doubt whether his loss brought greater grief to our country or to history.</p>
<p>2. Another extract from the same:</p>
<p>Bountiful and divine mother Nature, in order to win greater admiration and make a better distribution of her gifts, has chosen neither to give everything to one man, nor, on the contrary, to refuse everything to anyone.</p>
<p><span class="bold">3.</span> Cornelius Nepos wrote as follows to Cicero:</p>
<p>So far am I from thinking that philosophy can teach
how to live and is the perfecter of a happy life, that I believe that none have more need of learning how to live than the greater number of those who are engaged in teaching philosophy. In fact, I observe that a great part of those same men who in the schools argue most subtly about moderation and self-restraint pass their lives a prey to all the passions.</p>
