<p>And they say that Diodorus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL254_147_a" id="target_note_LCL254_147_a"><sup>a</sup></a> the Epicurean philosopher, who within the last few days put an end to his life with his own hand, was not following the teaching of Epicurus when he slashed his own throat.
