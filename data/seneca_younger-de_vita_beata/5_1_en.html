for it would be tedious to enumerate and refute them all. Do you listen to ours. But when I say “ours,” I do not bind myself to some particular one of the Stoic masters; I, too, have the right to form an opinion. Accordingly, I shall follow so-and-so, I shall request so-and-so to divide the question;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL254_107_a" id="target_note_LCL254_107_a"><sup>a</sup></a> perhaps, too, when called upon after all the rest, I shall impugn none of my predecessors’ opinions, and shall say: “I simply have this much to add.” Meantime, I follow the guidance of Nature—a doctrine upon which all Stoics are agreed. Not to stray from Nature and to mould ourselves according to her law and pattern—this is true wisdom.</p>
<p>The happy life, therefore, is a life that is in harmony with its own nature, and it can be attained in only one way. First of all, we must have a sound mind and one that is in constant possession of its sanity; second, it must be courageous and energetic, and, too, capable of the noblest fortitude, ready for every emergency, careful of the body and of all that concerns it, but without anxiety; lastly, it must be attentive to all the advantages that adorn life, but with over-much love for none<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL254_107_b" id="target_note_LCL254_107_b"><sup>b</sup></a>—the user, but not the slave, of the gifts of Fortune.
