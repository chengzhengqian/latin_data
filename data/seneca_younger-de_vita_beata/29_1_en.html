the least concern. Where, indeed, will Fortune deposit riches more securely than with one who will return them without protest when she recalls them?</p>
<p>Marcus Cato,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL254_155_a" id="target_note_LCL254_155_a"><sup>a</sup></a> when he was vaunting Curius and Coruncanius and that age in which it was a censorial offence to have a few small silver coins, himself possessed four million sesterces, fewer without doubt than Crassus, but more than Cato the Censor. If comparison be made, the distance by which he had outstripped his great-grandfather was greater than that by which Crassus outstripped him, and, if greater wealth had fallen to his lot, he would not have scorned it. For indeed the wise man does not deem himself undeserving of any of the gifts of Fortune. He does not love riches, but he would rather have them; he does not admit them to his heart, but to his house, and he does not reject the riches he has, but he keeps them and wishes them to supply ampler material for exercising his virtue.</p>
<p>Who, however, can doubt that the wise man<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL254_155_b" id="target_note_LCL254_155_b"><sup>b</sup></a> finds in riches, rather than in poverty, this ampler material for displaying his powers, since in poverty there is room for only one kind of virtue—not to be bowed down and crushed by it—while in riches moderation and liberality and diligence and orderliness and grandeur all have a wide field? The wise man will not despise himself even if he has the stature of a dwarf, but nevertheless he will wish to be tall. And if he is feeble in body, or deprived of one eye, he will still be strong,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL254_155_ca" id="target_note_LCL254_155_ca"><sup>c</sup></a> but nevertheless he will prefer to have strength of body, and this too, though he knows that there is something else in him that is stronger
