And thus they lose the sole good that remained to them in their wickedness—shame for wrongdoing. For they now praise the things that used to make them blush, and they glory in vice; and therefore they cannot even recover their youth,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL254_131_a" id="target_note_LCL254_131_a"><sup>a</sup></a> when once an honourable name has given warrant to their shameful laxity.
