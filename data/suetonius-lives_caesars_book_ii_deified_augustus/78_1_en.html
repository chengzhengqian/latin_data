<p>His body was carried by the senators of the municipalities and colonies from Nola all the way to Bovillae, in the night time because of the season of the year, being placed by day in the basilica of the town at which they arrived or in its principal temple. At Bovillae the members of the equestrian order<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL031_305_194" id="target_note_LCL031_305_194"><sup>194</sup></a> met it and bore it to the city, where they placed it in the vestibule of his house.</p>
<p>In their desire to give him a splendid funeral and honour his memory the senators so vied with one another that among many other suggestions some proposed that his cortege pass through the triumphal gate, preceded by the statue of Victory which stands in the House, while a dirge was sung by children of both sexes belonging to the leading families; others, that on the day of the obsequies golden rings be laid aside and iron ones worn; and some, that his ashes be collected by the priests of the highest colleges. One man proposed that the name of the month of August be transferred to September, because Augustus was born in the latter, but died in the former; another, that all the period from the day of his birth until his demise be called the Augustan Age, and so entered in the Calendar. But though a limit was set to the honours paid him, his eulogy was twice delivered: before the temple of the Deified Julius by Tiberius, and from the old rostra by Drusus, son of Tiberius; and he was carried on the shoulders of senators to the Campus Martius and there cremated. There was even an ex-praetor who took oath that he had seen the form of the Emperor, after he had been reduced to ashes, on its way to heaven. His remains were gathered up by the leading men of the equestrian order, bare-footed and in ungirt tunics, and placed in the Mausoleum. This structure he had built in his sixth consulship<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL031_305_195" id="target_note_LCL031_305_195"><sup>195</sup></a> between the Via FlamÂ­inia </p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL031_305_194"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL031_305_194" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">194</sup>See <span class="italic">Claud.</span> vi. 1.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL031_305_194').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL031_305_195"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL031_305_195" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">195</sup>In 28 <span class="sc">b.c.</span></a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL031_305_195').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
