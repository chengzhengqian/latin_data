<p>He called an island near Capreae Apragopolis<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL031_301_188" id="target_note_LCL031_301_188"><sup>188</sup></a> from the laziness of some of his company who sojourned there. Besides he used to call one of his favourites, Masgaba by name, Ktistes,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL031_301_189" id="target_note_LCL031_301_189"><sup>189</sup></a> as if he were the founder of the island. Noticing from his dining-room that the tomb of this Masgaba, who had died the year before, was visited by a large crowd with many torches, he uttered aloud this verse, composed offhand:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line indent2">I see the founder’s tomb alight with fire;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">and turning to Thrasyllus, one of the suite of Tiberius who was reclining opposite him and knew nothing about the matter, he asked of what poet he thought it was the work. When Thrasyllus hesitated, he added another verse:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line indent2">See you with lights Masgaba honoured now?</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">and asked his opinion of this one also. When Thrasyllus could say nothing except that they were very good, whoever made them, he burst into a laugh and fell a joking about it.</p>
<p>Presently he crossed over to Naples, although his bowels were still weak from intermittent attacks. In spite of this he witnessed a quinquennial gymnastic contest which had been established in his honour, and then started with Tiberius for his destination.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL031_301_190" id="target_note_LCL031_301_190"><sup>190</sup></a> But as he was returning his illness increased and he at last took to his bed at Nola, calling back Tiberius, who was on his way to Illyricum, and keeping him for a long time in private conversation, after which he gave attention to no business of importance.</p>
