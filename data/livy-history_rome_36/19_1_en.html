He held a meeting of the Aetolian chieftains and then met his men, who were coming along the Malian Gulf, on the road that leads to Stratus by way of Calydon and Lysimachia.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL301_189_56" id="target_note_LCL301_189_56"><sup>56</sup></a> There, a leading Acarnanian, Mnasilochus, who had been bought with numerous bribes, was not only using his own influence to gain the support of the people for the king but had also won over to his point of view the praetor Clitus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL301_189_57" id="target_note_LCL301_189_57"><sup>57</sup></a> who held the highest office at the time.

Livy’s geography is again haywire. If the army starts at Chaeronea (D4) and meets Antiochus between these towns, it goes nowhere near the Malian Gulf (D3). Manuelian ad loc. suggests (perhaps giving Livy too much credit) that these troops were reinforcements brought over to Greece by Polyxenides (cf. 8.1, 15.1), who may have landed in the Malian Gulf and were now en route to link up with the main force.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL301_189_56').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL301_189_57"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL301_189_57" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">57</sup>As usual in Greek contexts, “praetor” here represents <span class="italic">strategos</span>.
