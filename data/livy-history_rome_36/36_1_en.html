 and the praetor was instructed to sacrifice 40 full-grown victims<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL301_223_104" id="target_note_LCL301_223_104"><sup>104</sup></a> to gods of his own choosing.</p>
<p>It was also at about this time that Marcus Fulvius Nobilior, who had set out for Spain two years earlier as praetor, entered the city in ovation.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL301_223_105" id="target_note_LCL301_223_105"><sup>105</sup></a> He had 130,000 coins stamped with the <span class="italic">biga</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL301_223_106" id="target_note_LCL301_223_106"><sup>106</sup></a> carried before him and, in addition to the coin, 12,000 pounds of silver and 127 pounds of gold.</p>
<p>22. From Thermopylae the consul Acilius sent a message to the Aetolians in Heraclea that now that they had experienced the king’s incompetence they should finally come to their senses, deliver Heraclea and consider asking the senate to pardon what had been either an act of folly or an error of judgment on their part. The other states of Greece had, in that war, also broken faith with the Romans, who had deserved well of them,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL301_223_107" id="target_note_LCL301_223_107"><sup>107</sup></a> said Acilius. They too had reneged on their duty from confidence in the king, but after his flight they had not added obstinacy to their guilt and had been taken back under Roman protection. As for the Aetolians, they had not <span class="italic">followed</span> the king but had actually invited him to Greece and been leaders and not just allies in the war; but even they could be out of harm’s way if they could bring themselves to show remorse.</p>
<p>As there was no conciliatory response to these overtures, it was evident that military action was necessary and that, though the king was defeated, the Aetolian war was still to be fought. Acilius accordingly moved his camp from Thermopylae to Heraclea and on that very same day rode around the walls to examine the layout of the city on every side.</p>
