assumed that the reason for their not continuing the assault was the fatigue that had afflicted them, too, and when the signal was given for the Romans to retire, they would all leave their posts themselves as if they had also been recalled by it, and would not reappear in arms on the walls until the third hour of the day.</p>
<p>24. After discontinuing the assault at midnight, the consul once more at the fourth watch<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL301_229_113" id="target_note_LCL301_229_113"><sup>113</sup></a> mounted an all-out attack on three of the sides but ordered Tiberius Sempronius to hold his men at the ready on the one remaining side and await his signal. He was sure that in the confusion of the night the enemy would swiftly converge on the points from which shouting would be heard. Some of the Aetolians had been asleep and were now trying to rouse themselves from their slumber, physically drained as they were by their efforts and sleep deprivation; the others who were still awake ran in the dark toward the noise of the fighting. Some of their enemy were trying to clamber over the debris where the wall had collapsed while others were attempting to climb up with ladders, and the Aetolians rushed from all over the town to help repel them. Only one side, that where the buildings outside the city proper were situated, was neither being defended nor attacked; but men ready to attack were eagerly awaiting the signal and here there was no defender in place.</p>
<p>Dawn was already breaking when the consul gave the signal. Meeting no resistance, some of his men climbed over the half-demolished walls and others scaled with ladders those that were intact. At the same time, a shout was heard signaling the capture of the city and the Aetolians everywhere abandoned their posts and fled to the citadel.
