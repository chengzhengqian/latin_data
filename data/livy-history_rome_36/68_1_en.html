<p class="noindent">The consul Acilius Glabrio defeated Antiochus at Thermopylae with the assistance of King Philip and drove him from Greece; and he also brought the Aetolians into submission. The consul Publius Cornelius Scipio Nasica dedicated the temple of the mother of the gods, whom he had himself brought to the Palatine, having been judged by the senate the best person to do this. He also defeated the Gallic Boii, accepted their surrender, and celebrated a triumph over them. In addition, there is an account of successful naval battles fought against the officers of King Antiochus.</p>
