senate, then consulted the college of <span class="italic">fetiales,</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL301_163_23" id="target_note_LCL301_163_23"><sup>23</sup></a> asking whether the declaration of war should be delivered to Antiochus in person or whether it sufficed for an announcement to be made at one of his military outposts. He also asked if the <span class="italic">fetiales</span> enjoined a separate declaration of war for the Aetolians and whether the alliance and friendship with them should be formally renounced before that declaration was made. The <span class="italic">fetiales</span> replied that they had already given their decision (when they were consulted about Philip)<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL301_163_24" id="target_note_LCL301_163_24"><sup>24</sup></a> that it was immaterial whether the declaration was made directly to the person or to a military outpost.

<p>All the preparations now satisfactorily completed, the consul Manius Acilius issued a proclamation for a general mobilization at Brundisium on May 15th of those troops that Lucius Quinctius had enlisted or requisitioned from the allies and holders of Latin rights<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL301_163_27" id="target_note_LCL301_163_27"><sup>27</sup></a>—that is, the troops that were to go with him to his province—as well as the military tribunes of the first and third legions. Acilius himself set out from the city wearing his general’s cloak<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL301_163_28" id="target_note_LCL301_163_28"><sup>28</sup></a> on May 3rd, and the praetors also left for their provinces at about the same date.</p>
