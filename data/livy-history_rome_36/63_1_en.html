In this way, he said, they would be roughly equal numerically but in all other respects superior, in the speed of their ships as well as the range of auxiliary forces at their disposal. For, he continued, the maneuverability of the Roman vessels was poor because of their inferior construction, but in addition they were coming laden with supplies since they were entering enemy territory. Their own ships, on the other hand, leaving peaceful surroundings all around them, would be carrying only fighting men and weaponry. Their knowledge of the sea, the coastline and the winds would also be of great help, said Polyxenidas, while these things would all pose problems for the enemy, who lacked such knowledge.</p>
