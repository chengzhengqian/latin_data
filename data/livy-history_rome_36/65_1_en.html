shore. Eumenes was bringing up the rear but as soon as the scramble to stow the tackle began he also had his ships advance with all possible speed.</p>
<p>They were now visible to all the enemy ships. Two Punic vessels were at the forefront of the Roman fleet, and these were met by three of the king’s. Because of the disparity in numbers, two of the king’s ships closed in on one of the Carthaginians’. First they sheared off her oars on both sides, and then armed men climbed aboard, threw off or killed the defenders, and captured the vessel. The other ship, which had been fighting on equal terms, saw that her partner had been captured and beat a retreat back to the fleet before she could be surrounded by the three at the same time. Livius, roused to indignation, headed into the enemy with the flagship. The two that had beset the single Carthaginian craft now bore down on him, hoping to repeat their success, whereupon Livius ordered the rowers to lower their oars into the water on both sides to stabilize the ship and to hurl grappling irons onto the oncoming enemy vessels. Then, when they had thus made the battle similar to one on land, he told them to remember Roman courage and not consider the king’s serfs as men. On this occasion, the single ship defeated and captured the two with much greater ease than the two had previously taken the one.</p>
<p>By now the fleets had engaged in all sectors and the battle raged everywhere as the ships became entangled with each other. Eumenes had arrived last, after the battle had started, and when he saw the enemy left wing reduced to confusion by Livius he himself attacked the right where the struggle was evenly matched.</p>
