This is the only road suitable for an army, a point where forces could be led though if there is no opposition.

He protected the entire position with a double rampart, a ditch and, where required, even a wall made of the numerous stones lying around the area. Then, confident that the Roman army would never force its way through there, he sent off the 4,000 Aetolians who had congregated there, some to garrison Heraclea, which lay right before the pass, and others to Hypata.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL301_203_78" id="target_note_LCL301_203_78"><sup>78</sup></a> He was convinced that the consul
