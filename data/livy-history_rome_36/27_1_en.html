would attack Heraclea, and in addition many reports were already coming in that all the lands around Hypata were being laid waste.</p>
<p>The consul first razed the fields of Hypata and then those of Heraclea, the Aetolians providing no effective assistance to either, and he encamped within the pass itself, close to the hot springs and facing the king. The two Aetolian forces barricaded themselves in at Heraclea.</p>
<p>Before he set eyes on his enemy, Antiochus had thought the entire position well enough fortified and secured by his guard posts. Now, however, the fear gripped him that the Romans would discover some paths over the hills dominating the pass that would let them through; for it was said that this was how the Spartans had once been encircled by the Persians and, more recently, Philip by these same Romans.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL301_205_79" id="target_note_LCL301_205_79"><sup>79</sup></a> He therefore sent a message to the Aetolians at Heraclea asking them at least to do him this one service in this war, namely to seize and occupy the mountain tops in the vicinity to prevent the Romans from crossing them. When the message was received, an argument arose among the Aetolians. Some thought they should accede to the king’s request and go, others that they should remain at Heraclea ready to respond to either outcome: should the king be defeated by the consul, they would have fresh troops at their disposal to bring aid to their own cities nearby; and, if he were victorious, they could chase the Romans when they scattered in flight.
