Athamanians withdrew to their respective territories. Although Appius could see that the siege had been raised—the purpose of his mission—he nevertheless went down to Larisa to give the allies reassurance for the future. These had two reasons to feel happy: the enemy had left their lands and they could also see a Roman garrison within their walls.</p>
<p>11. The king left Demetrias for Chalcis and there fell in love with a young Chalcidian woman, the daughter of Cleoptolemus.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL301_187_53" id="target_note_LCL301_187_53"><sup>53</sup></a> He kept badgering the father, first sending intermediaries and then presenting his suit in person. Cleoptolemus was averse to involvement in a marriage at a level too uncomfortable for him but Antiochus finally had his way and celebrated a wedding, as though peace were established all around. Forgetting the importance of the two causes that he had taken up together, namely the war with Rome and the liberation of Greece, he abandoned responsibility for everything and spent the rest of the winter in dinner parties and the pleasures that accompany drinking, and then in sleeping, exhausted by these activities rather than sated with them. All the king’s officers put in charge of winter quarters everywhere, but especially Boeotia, fell victim to the same excesses. Even the rank and file abandoned themselves to the same ways; none put on armor, did guard duty, kept the night watch, or performed any of the regular military duties or responsibilities.

Walbank 3.75). Cleoptolemus, otherwise unknown, is described by Polybius as a leading man of Chalcis (20.8.3). Whether there was a reason for Antiochus’ marriage other than infatuation (he was fifty and had perhaps already repudiated Laodice, daughter of Mithridates II of Pontus) is unclear. The winter of debauchery described here appears at least exaggerated, if not “clearly false” (Walbank 3.76).</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL301_187_53').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL301_187_54a"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL301_187_54a" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">54</sup>Livy’s geography is strange here, as the  king goes westward from Chalcis (<span class="italic">Barr.</span> 55 F4) to Chaeronea (D4) via Phocis (C4), which is west of Chaeronea.
