some games in a vow at the crucial stage of a battle during his praetorship in Spain.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL301_259_140" id="target_note_LCL301_259_140"><sup>140</sup></a> Now, before departing for the war that he was to fight against the Boii, he requested of the senate that funds for these games be voted to him. The request was deemed irregular and unreasonable; and the senators decreed that, since he had made a vow to hold the games on his own initiative and without senatorial authorization, he should finance them from any moneys he had kept back for that purpose from his spoils or else from his own resources.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL301_259_141" id="target_note_LCL301_259_141"><sup>141</sup></a> These games were held by Publius Cornelius over a ten-day period.</p>
<p>At about the same time the temple of the Magna Mater Idaea was dedicated.
