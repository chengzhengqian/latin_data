The victors pillaged the town with the consul’s leave, given not from anger or animosity, but rather so that the soldiers, who had been held back in so many cities wrested from the enemy, might somewhere finally taste the fruits of victory.</p>
<p>It was some time after midday that Acilius recalled his soldiers and split them into two groups. One he ordered to be taken around the foot of the mountain to a rocky outcrop that was the same height as the citadel but more or less cut off from it by a ravine that lay between them. The tops of both eminences were, however, so close to each other that weapons could be hurled at the citadel from the other height. The consul was going to ascend the citadel from the city with the second party of soldiers, and he was waiting for a signal from the men who were to appear on the rocky outcrop to his rear. The Aetolians in the citadel could not, in the first place, endure the cheers of the men who had taken the outcrop nor, after that, the Roman attack from the city. Their spirit was now broken and no preparations had been made there for further resistance to the siege; for women, children and a host of other noncombatants had been herded into the citadel, which could barely contain (and much less protect) such a crowd. Thus, at the first onset, they threw down their arms and surrendered. Among those delivered to the Romans was Damocritus, the leading Aetolian who, at the start of the war, when Titus Quinctius asked for the decree of the Aetolians by which they had voted to bring Antiochus to Greece, had replied that he would give it to him in Italy when the Aetolians had established their camp there.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL301_231_114" id="target_note_LCL301_231_114"><sup>114</sup></a> Damocritus’ surrender was all the more pleasing to the victors because of that insolent remark.</p>
