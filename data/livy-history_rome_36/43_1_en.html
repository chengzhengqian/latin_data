On reaching Hypata, the leading Aetolians held a meeting in Flaccus’ presence at which they discussed how they should handle matters with the consul. They were preparing to lead off with old treaty rights and the services they had rendered the Roman people, but Flaccus told them to steer clear of compacts that they themselves had violated and broken. An admission of culpability and an address turning entirely on appeals for mercy would benefit them more, he said, for their hopes for safety lay not in the strength of their case but in the clemency of the Roman people; if they adopted a supplicatory demeanor, he would help them both before the consul and in the senate at Rome (for they would have to send a delegation there, too).

When he heard this, the consul said: “Men of Aetolia, consider very, very carefully your surrender on such terms.” Phaeneas thereupon showed him the decree in which the Aetolian decision was clearly worded.</p>
