stones or stakes when set up, according to his chart. Facing
west, not east, had been an old and approved method; facing
even north or south was sometimes adopted, but was not
approved by the ancient experts in the theory of land-surveying; moreover, the ‘orientation’ was sometimes made
according to the visible sunrise at a place, or the greatest
length of the available area, or parallel to the sea-shore if
this was adjacent. However, facing east was in historical
times the normal method of orientation; and all that follows
in this excursus assumes that the surveying obeys this rule.
The surveyor proceeded as follows, confirming or altering his
chart as he completed each part. He drew a line on the ground
running due east and west, and a second line running due north
and south and crossing the first line at the centre of the area
to be surveyed. Along the line east-west was then made a
broad <span class="italic">limes</span> ‘balk,’ ‘rough road,’ ‘cross-path,’ called the
<span class="italic">decumanus</span> (<span class="italic">sc. limes</span>) <span class="italic">maximus</span>, ‘main balk of the tenth,’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL359_160_1a" id="target_note_LCL359_160_1a">

which was, on all relevant boundary-stones, and on the chart
(as a line) referred to as DM; and on the line north-south a
less broad <span class="italic">limes</span> called the <span class="italic">kardo maximus</span>, ‘main hinge-<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL359_160_2" id="target_note_LCL359_160_2">

balk,’ which was referred to as KM. These were later
made into public military roads. The region in front of the
surveyor as he faced east (his position being taken as fixed)
was called <span class="italic">regio antica</span> ‘frontal region’ or r. <span class="italic">ultrata</span> ‘region
