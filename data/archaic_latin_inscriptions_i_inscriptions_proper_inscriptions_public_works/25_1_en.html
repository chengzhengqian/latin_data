Neither <span class="italic">mercatio</span> nor <span class="italic">altercatio</span> would suit the subject-matter of the inscription, which refers to repairs, or the like, of an aqueduct. <span class="italic">furcatio</span> or <span class="italic">bifurcatio</span> are unlikely; <span class="italic">demarcatio</span> would not be Latin.
It might well refer to preliminary measurements for the laying down of, or replacement of new pipes or repairs to old ones; or to cleaning of pipes (<span class="italic">fistulae</span>). If the C should be G (but it seems clear that it is C), or is used as an affected archaism for G, then I suggest Purgatio, ‘Cleaning.’ Another possibility which occurs to me is ‘<span class="italic">Arcatio</span>,’ ‘Placing of land-marks’ (<span class="italic">arca</span>, properly a box, chest, coffin, can mean also a quadrangular land-mark). It would have relevance here, because, at any rate in the imperial period, a strip of land 15 feet wide, marked with boundary-stones at intervals, was left on either side of aqueducts and no trespassing on it was allowed; but we need a longer word here, nor does this word <span class="italic">arcatio</span> occur anywhere. Note that in Vitruvius, VI, 3, we have <span class="italic">arcatura</span> in the sense of a reservoir or cistern.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL359_193_2').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL359_193_3"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL359_193_3" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">3</sup>
<span class="italic">Castellus</span> is elsewhere usually a neuter <span class="italic">castellum.</span> The <span class="italic">castelli</span> = <span class="italic">castella</span> of this inscription designate intermediate reservoirs between the <span class="italic">piscina</span> (the reservoir built at the source of the aqueduct) and the main <span class="italic">castellum aquarium</span> built at the walls of a town supplied and forming the ‘head of water.’ They would hardly be the <span class="italic">castella</span> built between the ‘head’ and the buildings supplied. Perhaps the masculine <span class="italic">castellus</span> was a normal variant used to designate any intermediate reservoir as distinct from the <span class="italic">castellum aquarium.</span>
