</a> All such balks were numbered
according to their distance from one or other of the main
balks—see below. But the system of placing boundary-stones
at corners of centuries and plots caused pairs of these
expressions to refer not to the <span class="italic">limites</span> themselves but to intersections
of the <span class="italic">limites</span>, so as to mark not a line or a rough
cart-road, but a point and an angle; and it seems that
carelessness of syntax further caused these expressions to
denote something different from their proper meaning. The
matter is dealt with below.</p>
<p>By means of these criss-cross balks the surveyor had now
marked out the centuries according to the criss-cross lines on
the chart. The balks themselves were often, perhaps normally
(as in the plan given after p. 487) excluded from the area
of a century; but they could be shared between centuries.
These were normally square, so that all <span class="italic">limites</span> as borders
to centuries were normally equidistant, <span class="italic">decumani</span> from
<span class="italic">decumani</span>, <span class="italic">kardines</span> from <span class="italic">kardines.</span> Natural objects were
included in the centuries, unless they were large, for instance
big stretches of water; in such cases they were excepted from
<span class="italic">limitatio.</span> Holy places, drains and so on, and estates of
