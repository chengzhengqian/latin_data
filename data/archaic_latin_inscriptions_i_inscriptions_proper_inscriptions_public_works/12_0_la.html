</a> Thus, in
the above example, the words <span class="italic">dextra</span> and <span class="italic">ultra</span>, taken together,
give the quarter (quadrant) or region, of the whole surveyed
area, in which the stone lies, while the numbered <span class="italic">decumanus</span>
and <span class="italic">kardo</span> taken together indicate the outer angle and therefore
the two outer sides (with reference to the centre-point of the
whole area) of a century. I suggest that we cannot resist an
inference that, like the expression used in dating, the expression
for marking points on surveyed land could be treated as one
word—for example <span class="italic">ex</span> (‘from’) <span class="italic">dextra decumanum septimum
ultra kardinem nonum in</span> (‘as far as’) <span class="italic">dextra decumanum
octavum ultra kardinem decumum.</span> Whatever the exact
linguistic meaning of such abbreviations may be in Roman
surveying, there can be no doubt about what they intended
to convey. Except stones or stakes used to mark boundaries
of plots inside the centuries, every stone or stake placed on
the surveyed area marked the junction of a <span class="italic">kardo</span> and a
<span class="italic">decumanus</span>; and of these stones or stakes each one placed
at an <span class="italic">angulus clusaris</span> indicated the position of that century
which looked inwards from the stone towards the centre of
the surveyed area.</p>
<p>Having marked out the centuries the surveyor according to
his chart then marked out, within these centuries, each man’s
plot. We have no inscriptions showing how these plots, which
had their own rough roads or balks, were indicated on stones
or stakes, so that my plan deals with and shows centuries
only. For we know that Augustus laid down that plots
should be marked with stakes made of oak while those marking
centuries should be of stone; this material was doubtless
the rule with the centuries, and it is assumed that extant
boundary stones (at least those containing the inscriptions
given below from <span class="italic">C.I.L.</span>, I, 2, 639–40) marked centuries not
plots. The final duty of the surveyor was to alter his chart
