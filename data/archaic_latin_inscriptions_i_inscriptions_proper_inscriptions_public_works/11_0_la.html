giving in brief, as will be shown below, the location of the
century looking inwards from the closing angle towards the
centre (<span class="italic">i.e.</span> the intersecting-place of the <span class="italic">decumanus maximus</span>
and the <span class="italic">kardo maximus</span>) of the whole area surveyed.</p>
<p>As we know from Hyginus, and from boundary-stones which
have survived, the expressions used on written records and
charts and on boundary-stones relating to an official land-survey
were analogous to those stated above as often denoting
the various <span class="italic">kardines</span> and <span class="italic">decumani</span>
<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL359_164_1" id="target_note_LCL359_164_1">

</a>; and the following
abbreviations were used: D = <span class="italic">decumanus</span>; also <span class="italic">dextra</span>;
K = <span class="italic">kardo</span>; also <span class="italic">kitra</span> (<span class="italic">citra</span>); M = <span class="italic">maximus</span>; V = <span class="italic">ultra</span>;
S = <span class="italic">sinistra.</span> Numbers I, II, III . . . were added when
required to denote <span class="italic">prorsi</span> and <span class="italic">transversi limites</span> = <span class="italic">kardines</span> or
<span class="italic">decumani</span>, with special reference, as will be seen, to points of
intersection of these <span class="italic">limites</span> with each other or with the
<span class="italic">dec. max.</span> or the <span class="italic">kardo maximus</span> from which two latter the
numbering of all other <span class="italic">limites</span> was counted. Thus each of the
4 stones (and the position of them on the chart) that might be
placed at the inner corner of each of the four centuries at the
centre of the whole area were marked KMDM = <span class="italic">kardo maximus
decumanus maximus</span> because they stood at the point of intersection
of the <span class="italic">kardo maximus</span> and the <span class="italic">decumanus maximus.</span>
</p>
<p>Next, any stone, for example, placed where the first <span class="italic">limes
prorsus</span> (= <span class="italic">decumanus primus</span>) north of the <span class="italic">dec. max.</span> (and
therefore in the <span class="italic">regio sinistrata</span>) met the <span class="italic">kardo maximus</span> was
marked SDIKM, which when spelt out represents, as we know
from Hyginus, <span class="italic">sinistra decumanum primum kardo maximus</span>; and
any stone placed where the third <span class="italic">limes transversus</span> (= <span class="italic">kardo
tertius</span>) west of the <span class="italic">kardo maximus</span> (and therefore in the <span class="italic">regio
citrata</span>) met the <span class="italic">decumanus maximus</span> was marked DMKKIII
which represents <span class="italic">decumanus maximus kitra kardinem tertium.</span>
And again, any stone in an angle not connected with the <span class="italic">dec.
max.</span> or the <span class="italic">kardo max.</span>—that is, any stone in an <span class="italic">angulus clusaris</span>
—was similarly marked. Suppose that a stone is marked
DDVIIVKIX. We know from Hyginus that the symbols in
