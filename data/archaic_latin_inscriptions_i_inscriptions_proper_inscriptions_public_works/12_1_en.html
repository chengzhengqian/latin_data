<p>For Roman surveying, see Fabricius, in Paulys <span class="italic">Real-Encyclopädie</span>,
<span class="sc">s.v.</span> ‘Limitatio’; A. Déléage, <span class="italic">Études de Papyrologie</span>, II, 1934, 147 ff., especially bibliographical list, p. 151. Mommsen’s work (<span class="italic">Hermes</span>, XXVII, 90 ff.) fails to satisfy because he reverses the positions of the <span class="italic">regio citrata</span> and the <span class="italic">regio ultrata</span>, and takes <span class="italic">dec. max.</span> and <span class="italic">kardo max</span>. as <span class="italic">dec.</span> I and <span class="italic">kardo</span> I respectively; the article ‘Agrimetatio’ by H. Roby in Smith’s <span class="italic">Diet, of Greek and Roman Antiquities</span> has the same defect. The original literary sources are the writings of the Roman <span class="italic">agrimensores</span>, which can be found in <span class="italic">Gromatici Veteres</span> (<span class="italic">Schriften der röm. Feldmesser</span>, I, 1848, Blume and Lachmann; II, 1852, Blume, Lachmann, Mommsen and Rudorff), and in the uncompleted <span class="italic">Corpus Agrimensorum Romanorum</span>, I, 1, 1913, ed. Thulin.</p>
<p>On the lands assigned by Tiberius Gracchus in 133 <span class="sc">b.c.</span> such <span class="italic">limites</span> as were roads were probably the same width as those in the colonies founded by his brother Gaius ten years afterwards. In them the <span class="italic">decumanus max.</span> was a road 40 feet wide, the <span class="italic">kardo max.</span> a road 20 feet wide, the other <span class="italic">actuarii</span> (‘drives,’
‘cart roads,’ in this case the <span class="italic">quintarii</span>—see above) being 12 feet wide, and the <span class="italic">subruncivi</span> (see above—probably bounding plots assigned) 8 feet wide. The size of each plot probably varied, though it has been thought (see pp. 382–3) that Tiberius laid down a fixed area of 30 <span class="italic">iugera</span>; but the size and shape of the century was the normal one of 20 <span class="italic">actus</span> each side = 200 <span class="italic">iugera.</span> A whole plot of 30 <span class="italic">iugera</span> was an oblong rectangle (12 × 5 <span class="italic">actus</span>, or 20 × 3 <span class="italic">actus</span>; the <span class="italic">iugerum</span> itself was an oblong rectangle of 2 square <span class="italic">actus</span>); and within each century could be placed six such plots<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL359_167_2a" id="target_note_LCL359_167_2a">

Note that plots of greater length (north-south) than breadth (east-west)
were said to be laid down ‘<span class="italic">per strigas</span>’ (strips); those of greater breadth than length were ‘<span class="italic">per scamna</span>’ (unbroken grounds?). This form of planning, which deals with plots, not centuries, could be applied within or separate from an area planned in centuries. Plots forming irregular patches seem to have been called <span class="italic">laciniae</span>, plots with straight but not rectangular boundaries, <span class="italic">praecisurae.</span>
