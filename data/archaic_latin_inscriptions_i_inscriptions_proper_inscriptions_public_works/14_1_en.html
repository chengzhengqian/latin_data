<p>(B) <span class="italic">Three pillars, each marking apparently an angle which bounded the estate of an established occupier, who is to be left in possession, and possibly indicating the boundary of assignable land and public state-land. All were found on the same ‘ager.’ It is not certain what some of the signs actually are, or what their meaning is. Brunn, Dressel, and Santoli have given different readings.</span>

Two other stones (<span class="italic">C.I.L.</span>, I, 2, 641–2) have the same Board of Three inscribed, but there are no symbols. I suggest that they are examples of the <span class="italic">muti lapides</span> ‘mute stones’ that we read of in the gromatic writers, and that if four stones were placed at intersection of, for example, a <span class="italic">decumanus</span> with the <span class="italic">kardo maximus</span>, perhaps sometimes only one had the symbols giving the position.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL359_171_1a').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL359_171_3b"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL359_171_3b" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">3</sup>CI.

Only the letters FF can be distinguished, and I suggest that this means <span class="italic">fundorum fines</span> ‘limit of estates’ <span class="italic">sc.</span> of established occupier’s
and of those to be assigned under Gracchus’ law; land beyond the diameter-line (shown as a blank on the stone) is to be public state-land, or at least outside the assignable area. That FVP = <span class="italic">fundus veteris possessoris</span> is usually accepted. Other signs in this quadrant are uncertain; they seem to be The signs which were written near the signs FF look rather like ANIC which are on the next stone given. But I have not shown them here.
