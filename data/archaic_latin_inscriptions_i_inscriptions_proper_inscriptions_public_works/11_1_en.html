</a> to take the word <span class="italic">dextra</span> in the latter example as standing alone adverbially to which the word <span class="italic">decumanus</span> following has been attracted into the accusative <span class="italic">decumanum</span> as though <span class="italic">dextra</span> were ‘prepositional’; and to take the word <span class="italic">ultra</span> as a true adverb standing alone, to which the word <span class="italic">kardo</span> following has been attracted into the accusative <span class="italic">kardinem</span> as though <span class="italic">ultra</span> were a preposition. (Similarly with <span class="italic">sinistra</span> in the example SDIKM above, and any examples having <span class="italic">kitra.</span>) But in view of the separation of SD from I- and <span class="sc">k</span>K from XI- on n. 25 (extant stone), p. 170 below, I see <span class="italic">dextra</span> and <span class="italic">ultra</span> (taking the example DDVIIVKIX again) as prepositions, with fusion of two clauses into one which ought to be <span class="italic">dextra decumanum</span> [<span class="italic">maximum decumanus</span>] <span class="italic">Septimus ultra kardinem</span> [<span class="italic">maximum kardo</span>] <span class="italic">nonus</span>, whereas <span class="italic">septimus</span> and <span class="italic">nonus</span> have been attracted into the accusatives <span class="italic">septimum</span> and <span class="italic">nonum.</span> Or again, since the stone stands at a certain place, the full phrase perhaps ought to be <span class="italic">dextra decumanum</span> [<span class="italic">maximum ad decumanum</span>] <span class="italic">septimum, ultra kardinem</span> [<span class="italic">maximum ad kardinem</span>] <span class="italic">nonum,</span> where <span class="italic">ad</span> would mean ‘next to,’ ‘lying against,’ ‘at.’ We may compare perhaps, though the parallel is not exact, the method of dating by the expression for example <span class="italic">ante diem quintum Kalendas</span> which really means <span class="italic">die quinto ante Kalendas</span> ‘on the fifth day before the Kalends.’ Originally the expression was probably <span class="italic">ante</span> (preposition) <span class="italic">kalendas quinto die</span>; then <span class="italic">quinto die</span> was thrust in parenthetically before <span class="italic">kalendas</span>, and attracted, because of <span class="italic">ante</span>, into the accusative case. Anyhow, in land surveying, in this expression DDVIIVKIX the full meaning intended is: intersection of’ seventh [balk-of-the-tenth in the region] on the right of [main] balk-of-the-tenth’ with ‘ninth
