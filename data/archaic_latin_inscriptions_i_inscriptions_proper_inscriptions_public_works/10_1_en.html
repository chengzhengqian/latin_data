existing proprietors were left unaffected (or, in the case of estates, were modified). Useless ground was likewise included in the centuries but not in allotted plots within the centuries. Any part of a century left over as an oddment after plots were marked out was called <span class="italic">subsecivum</span> ‘under-cut,’ ‘cut away,’ ‘spare.’</p>
<p>The surveyor next superintended the marking of each century by boundary-stones (<span class="italic">termini</span>) on each of which was written signs giving the position of the stone in relation to the whole area surveyed. One stone might<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL359_163_3" id="target_note_LCL359_163_3">

though in the case of intersections of any <span class="italic">limites</span> with the <span class="italic">dec. max.</span> or <span class="italic">kardo max.</span> this may actually, though again unnecessarily, have been done by surveyors, or was at least recommended by theorists.
