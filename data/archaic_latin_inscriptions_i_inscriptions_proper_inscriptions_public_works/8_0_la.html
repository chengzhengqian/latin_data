<span class="sc">Land-surveying: ‘Agrimetatio,’ or ‘Limitatio, or ‘Centuriatio.’</span>
</p>
<p>When land was distributed by the Roman government to citizens, it was normally marked off into large blocks (<span class="italic">centuriae</span>) by a regular survey according to a fixed method called <span class="italic">centuriatio</span> or <span class="italic">limitatio</span> (‘balking,’ from <span class="italic">limes</span> ‘balk,’ ‘rough road,’ ‘cross-path,’ for which see below, p. 160) or ‘<span class="italic">agrimetatio</span>’ land measuring; wherein straight lines only, and, with the exception of <span class="italic">subseciva</span> or ‘oddments’ (for which, see p. 163), right angles only were employed, so that the blocks were square, less often oblong.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL359_158_4a" id="target_note_LCL359_158_4a">

</a> Such land was usually called
<span class="italic">ager limitatus</span> ‘balked land.’ This proper survey was quite different from rough-and-ready fixing or alteration of boundary-lines on areas of land which, not being subject to any regular survey by the state, was held by owners in irregularly shaped, unmeasured plots bounded where possible by natural features such as streams. Such land was called <span class="italic">ager arcifinius</span> ‘bow-bounded land,’ ‘land with wavy boundaries.’

For <span class="italic">centuria</span>, see below, Note that the block is not a man’s plot, but an area, containing, when divided, several plots, as will be seen.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL359_158_4a').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
