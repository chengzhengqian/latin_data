I personally feel, since you think that some danger lurks which should be guarded against, we all promise you not merely sentinels and bodyguards, but the shelter that our own breasts and bodies can afford.</p>

it began, we all express to you, Gaius Caesar, our deepest gratitude, and feel it even more deeply; all our hearts beat as one, as you have been enabled to realize by the prayers and tears of all.

Moreover, as regards the duties of the deepest<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">34</span><span class="br"></span>
affection (and how deep my affection is towards my friend has always been a matter of public knowledge; indeed I would scarce yield place in this respect to his excellent and devoted brother Gaius, and certainly to none save him), since I have ever fulfilled these by my anxiety, my interest, and my efforts, so long as his restoration was still an open question, at this time assuredly, released as I am from grave solicitude, distress, and grief, I am bound to fulfil them. Accordingly, Gaius Caesar, while I thank you, I yet remember that, after I had been in all respects not only preserved but even distinguished by you, the countless services you have conferred upon myself individually have, though I thought it impossible, been gloriously crowned by your present action.</p>
