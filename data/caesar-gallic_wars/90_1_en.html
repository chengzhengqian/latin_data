<h2><span class="ac">Book IV</span></h2>
<p class="noindent"><span class="sc">In</span> the following winter—the year in which Gnaeus Pompeius and Marcus Crassus were consuls<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL072_181_1" id="target_note_LCL072_181_1"><sup>1</sup></a>—the Usipetes from Germany, and likewise the Tencteri, crossed the Rhine with a large host of men, not far from the sea into which it flows. The reason for their crossing was that for several years they had been much harassed by the Suebi, who pressed on them by force of arms and prevented them from husbandry. The Suebi are by far the largest and the most warlike nation among the Germans. It is said that they have a hundred cantons, from each of which they draw one thousand armed men yearly for the purpose of war outside their borders. The remainder, who have stayed at home, support themselves and the absent warriors; and again, in turn, are under arms the following year, while the others remain at home. By this means neither husbandry nor the theory and practice of war is interrupted. They have no private or separate holding of land, nor are they allowed to abide longer than a year in one place for their habitation. They make not much use of corn for food, but chiefly of milk and of cattle, and are much engaged in hunting; and this, owing to the nature of the food, the regular exercise, and the freedom of
life—for from boyhood up they are not schooled in
a sense of duty or discipline, and do nothing whatever
