disembark and entrust himself to the rough natives, and on the fifth day returned to Caesar, and reported his observations in Britain.</p>
<p>While Caesar tarried where he was to fit out his ships, deputies came to him from a great part of the Morini to make excuse for their policy of the previous season, when in their barbarism and ignorance of our usage they had made war against Rome, and to promise that they would carry out his commands. Caesar thought this overture exceedingly opportune. He did not wish to leave an enemy in his rear, nor had he a chance of carrying out a campaign because of the lateness of the season; nor did he think the settlement of such trivialities should take precedence of Britain. He therefore ordered them to furnish a large number of hostages; and when they brought these he received them under his protection. When about eighty transports—enough, in his opinion, to carry two legions across—had been collected and concentrated, he distributed all the ships of war he had over between his quartermaster-general,
lieutenant-generals, and commandants.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL072_209_1" id="target_note_LCL072_209_1"><sup>1</sup></a> To the total stated eighteen transports should be added, which were detained eight miles off by the wind, and prevented from entering the port of concentration;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL072_209_2" id="target_note_LCL072_209_2"><sup>2</sup></a> these he allotted to the cavalry. The rest of the army he handed over to Quintus Titurius Sabinus and Lucius Aurunculeius Cotta, lieutenant-generals, to be led against the Menapii and against those cantons of the Morini from which no deputies had come to him. He commanded Publius Sulpicius Rufus, lieutenant-general, with a garrison he considered sufficient, to hold the port.</p>
