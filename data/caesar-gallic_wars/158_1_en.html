<p class="noindent"><span class="sc">For</span> many reasons Caesar anticipated a more serious rising in Gaul; and he decided to raise a levy through the agency of Marcus Silanus, Gains Antistius Reginus, and Titus Sextius, lieutenant-generals. At the same time he made request of Gnaeus Pompeius, now<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL072_317_1" id="target_note_LCL072_317_1"><sup>1</sup></a> proconsul, that, as he was remaining near Rome for the service of the state while retaining his military authority,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL072_317_2a" id="target_note_LCL072_317_2a"><sup>2</sup></a> he would order the recruits from Cisalpine Gaul sworn in by him as consul to join the colours and start for Caesar’s headquarters. He conceived it to be of great importance, for the future as well as for the present, to create an impression in Gaul that the resources of Italy were extensive enough not only to repair in a short time any damage incurred in the war, but even to increase the establishment. Pompey made the concession to public service and private friendship, and as Caesar speedily completed the levy through his staff officers, before the winter was over three legions had been formed and brought to headquarters. Having thereby doubled the number of the cohorts lost with Quintus Titurius, he showed the Gauls, at once by his rapidity and by the strength of his reinforcements, what the system and resources of the Roman people could accomplish.</p>
