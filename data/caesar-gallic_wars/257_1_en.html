<p class="noindent"><span class="sc">By</span> your continual reproaches, Balbus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL072_515_1" id="target_note_LCL072_515_1"><sup>1</sup></a> which seemed to regard my daily refusal not as a plea caused by difficulty, but as an evasion due to indolence, I have been constrained to undertake a most difficult task. I have tacked a supplement to the Commentaries of our great Caesar on the operations in Gaul, as his previous and his subsequent writings did not otherwise fit together; and his last work,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL072_515_2" id="target_note_LCL072_515_2"><sup>2</sup></a> which was left unfinished from the operations at Alexandria<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL072_515_3" id="target_note_LCL072_515_3"><sup>3</sup></a> onwards, I have completed as far as the conclusion, not indeed of civil discord, of which we see no end, but of Caesar’s life. And I trust that those who will read it may understand how unwillingly I have undertaken the task of writing this Commentary; for so shall I the easier free myself from the charge of folly and of presumption for having intruded myself in the middle of Caesar’s writings. For it is universally agreed that nothing was ever so elaborately finished by others that is not surpassed by the refinement of these Commentaries. They have been published that historians may not lack knowledge of those great achievements; and so strong is the unanimous verdict
