the ramp by mines, the more scientifically because they have large iron-workings in their country, and every kind of mine is known and employed. Further, they had furnished the whole wall on every side with a superstructure of wooden turrets, and covered these over with hides. Then in frequent sallies by day and night they tried to set fire to the ramp or to attack the troops engaged in the works; and whatever increase was made in the height of our turrets by daily additions to the ramp,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL072_413_1" id="target_note_LCL072_413_1"><sup>1</sup></a> they equalised by joining fresh scaffolding<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL072_413_2" id="target_note_LCL072_413_2"><sup>2</sup></a> to their own turrets, and tried to check the progress of our own mines where they opened up,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL072_413_3" id="target_note_LCL072_413_3"><sup>3</sup></a> and to prevent their approach to the walls by means of timbers<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL072_413_4" id="target_note_LCL072_413_4"><sup>4</sup></a> hardened in the fire and sharpened, boiling pitch, and stones of very great weight.</p>
<p>All Gallic walls are, as a rule, of the following pattern. Balks are laid on the ground at equal intervals of two feet throughout the length of the wall and at right angles thereto. These are made fast on the inside and banked up with a quantity of earth, while the intervals above mentioned are stopped up on the front side with big stones. When these balks have been laid and clamped together a second course<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL072_413_5" id="target_note_LCL072_413_5"><sup>5</sup></a> is added above, in such fashion that the same interval as before is kept, and the balks<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL072_413_6" id="target_note_LCL072_413_6"><sup>6</sup></a> do not touch one another, but each is tightly held at a like space apart by the interposition of single stones. So the whole structure is knit together stage by stage until the proper height of wall is completed. This work is not unsightly in
