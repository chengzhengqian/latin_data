Even if it be admitted that nothing can happen without an antecedent cause, what good would that be unless it be maintained that the cause in question is a link in an eternal chain of causation? But a cause is that which makes the thing of which it is the cause come about—as a wound is the cause of death, failure to digest one’s food of illness, fire of heat.
