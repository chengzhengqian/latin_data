For it is not necessary for Epicurus to fear lest, when he admits that every proposition is either true or false, all events must necessarily be caused by fate; for the truth of a proposition of the form ‘Carneades will go down to the Academy’ is not due to an eternal stream of natural and necessary causation, and yet nevertheless it is not uncaused, but there is a difference between causes accidentally precedent and causes intrinsically containing a natural efficiency.

Such a swerve taking place among the atoms of a man’s mind is what is known to his consciousness as an act of arbitrary volition: this was Epicurus’s method of proving the freedom of the will.
