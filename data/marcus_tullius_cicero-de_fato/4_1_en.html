For consider: suppose it was Daphitas’s destiny to fall off his horse and meet his end in that way, was it off this horse, which as it was not a real horse had a name that did not belong to it?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL349_199_b" id="target_note_LCL349_199_b"><sup>b</sup></a> or was it against these little four-in-hands on the sword-hilt that Philip used to be warned to be on his guard?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL349_199_ca" id="target_note_LCL349_199_ca"><sup>c</sup></a> just as if it was the hilt of a sword that killed him! Again, what is there remarkable about that nameless shipwrecked sailor’s having fallen into a brook? although in his case indeed our authority does write that he had been warned that he was to meet his end in the water. Even in the case of the brigand Icadius I swear I can’t see any trace of destiny; for the story <span class="innerMarginNote left">6</span> does notsay that he had any warning, so that if a rock from the roof of a cave did fall on his legs, what is there surprising about it? for I suppose that even if Icadius had not been in the cave at the time, that rock would have fallen all the same, since either nothing at all is fortuitous or it was possible for this particular event to have happened by fortune. What I want to know therefore is (and this is a matter that will have a wide bearing), if there were no such word at all as fate, no such thing, no such force, and if either most things or all things took place by mere casual accident, would the course of events be different from what it is now? What is the point then of harping on fate, when everything can be explained by reference to nature and fortune without bringing fate in?</p>
