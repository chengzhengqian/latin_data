<p>XII. That ends the business, inasmuch as you are bound to admit either that everything takes place by fate or that <span class="innerMarginNote left">27</span> something can take place without a cause. Consider the statement ‘Scipio will take Numantia’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL349_223_a" id="target_note_LCL349_223_a"><sup>a</sup></a>: if an external chain of interlinked causes is not going to bring this about, can it be true<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL349_223_b" id="target_note_LCL349_223_b"><sup>b</sup></a> in any other manner? could it have been false if it had been said innumerable ages ago? And if the statement ‘Scipio will take Numantia’ had not been true then, even after Numantia has fallen the statement ‘Scipio has taken Numantia’ is not true either. Therefore is it possible for anything to have happened that was not previously going to be true? For just as we speak of past things as true that possessed true actuality at some former time, so we speak of future things as true that will possess true actuality at some following <span class="innerMarginNote left">28</span> time. Yet it does not immediately follow from the fact that every statement is either true or false that there are immutable causes, eternally existing, that forbid anything to fall out otherwise than it will fall out. The causes which bring it about that statements of the form ‘Cato will come into the Senate’ are true statements, are fortuitous, they are not inherent in the nature of things and the order of the universe; and nevertheless ‘he will come,’ when true, is as immutable as ‘he has come’ (though we need not on that account be haunted by fear of fate or necessity), for it will necessarily be admitted that if the statement’ Hortensius will come to his place</p>
