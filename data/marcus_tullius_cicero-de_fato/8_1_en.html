<p>following connexion is also true,‘If Fabius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL349_207_a" id="target_note_LCL349_207_a"><sup>a</sup></a> was born at the rising of the dogstar, Fabius will not die at sea.’ Consequently the propositions ‘Fabius was born at the rising of the dogstar’ and ‘Fabius will die at sea’ are incompatible, and since that he was born at the rising of the dogstar is predicated with certainty in the case of Fabius, the propositions ‘Fabius exists’ and ‘Fabius will die at sea’ are also incompatible. Therefore also ‘Fabius exists and Fabius will die at sea’ is a conjunction of incompatibles, which as propounded is an impossibility. Therefore the proposition ‘Fabius will die at sea’ belongs to the class of impossibilities. Therefore every false proposition about the future is an impossibility.</p>

will not allow at all, and this is the very point about which you are specially at issue with Diodorus. He says that only what either is true or will be true is a possibility, and whatever will be, he says, must necessarily happen, and whatever will not be, according to him cannot possibly happen. You say that things which will not be are also ‘possible’—for instance it is possible for this jewel to be broken even if it never will be—, and that the reign of Cypselus at Corinth was not necessary although it had been announced by the oracle of Apollo a thousand years before. But if you are going to sanction divine prophecies of that sort, you will reckon false statements as to future events (for instance a prophecy that Africanus was not going to take Carthage <a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL349_207_ba" id="target_note_LCL349_207_ba"><sup>b</sup></a>) as being in the class of things impossible, and also, if a thing is truly stated about the future and it will be
