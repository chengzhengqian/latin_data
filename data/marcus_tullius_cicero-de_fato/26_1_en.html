this question,—one should not seek assistance from atoms that roam and swerve out of their path. ‘The atom does swerve,’ he says. In the first place what causes the swerve? for the motive force that they will get from Democritus is a different one, a driving force termed by him a ‘blow’ from you, Epicurus, they will get the force of gravity or weight. What fresh cause therefore exists in nature to make the atom swerve (or do the atoms cast lots among them which is to swerve and which not?) or to serve as the reason for their making a very small swerve and not a large one, or for their making one very small swerve and not two or three swerves? This is wishful thinking, <span class="innerMarginNote left">47</span> not investigation. For you do not say that the atom moves its position and swerves owing to being driven by an external force, nor that there has been
