a tribune to forbid the consecration without popular mandate of any building, land, or altar; and at that time Quintus Papirius, who proposed this law,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL158_285_a" id="target_note_LCL158_285_a"><sup>a</sup></a> never dreamed or suspected that a situation would arise involving danger of consecration to the dwellings or properties of uncondemned citizens. As a matter of fact, such a situation was inconceivable; no one had ever done such a thing; and he had no reason to include a prohibition which would seem to be not <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">128</span><span class="br"></span> so much a deterrent as a suggestion. But since the buildings which it was customary to consecrate were not private dwellings, but those to which the name sacred is applied, and since the consecration of land, which the law envisaged, was not the consecration of our estates by anyone who wished, but that performed by a general upon lands conquered from an enemy, and since the altars commonly set up were such as lent a sanctity to the place wherein they had been consecrated, Papirius forbade such consecrations, unless the people had first given a mandate for them.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL158_285_b" id="target_note_LCL158_285_b"><sup>b</sup></a> If you interpret the terms of the law to refer to our houses and lands, I do not join issue with you; I merely ask what legislation permitted you to consecrate my house, whence you derived the necessary authority, and on what ground of right you acted. And I am not now dealing with religion, but with the property of us all; not with the rights of the pontiffs, but with the rights of the people.</p>

<p>L. The law of Papirius forbids the consecration of a building without a mandate from the people. Let it by all means be conceded that this refers to our private houses and not to the public temples. Still, show us one single reference to consecration in your actual law, if law it can be called,
