Gaius Antonius,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL158_185_a" id="target_note_LCL158_185_a"><sup>a</sup></a> I complained of certain political abuses, which I thought affected my unhappy client’s case. These complaints were reported by scoundrels to certain worthy gentlemen<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL158_185_b" id="target_note_LCL158_185_b"><sup>b</sup></a> in terms very far removed from those which I had used.
