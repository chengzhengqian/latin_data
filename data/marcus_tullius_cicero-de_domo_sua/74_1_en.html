depredations in common with the two reprobate consuls, and in having employed some pontiff to dedicate the house of one who had refused to allow the country which he had preserved to perish on his <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">123</span><span class="br"></span> account? Do but throw open the door to this kind of consecration, gentlemen, and you will never find an issue from our universal plight.
