The reason was that Clodius wished to extend his own promenade, and raise his own shrine with the lady of Tanagra doing duty for Liberty— liberty, incidentally, having been crushed. He had set his heart upon building upon the Palatine a paved portico three hundred feet long with apartments opening from it and commanding a magnificent view, possessing a spacious colonnade and other such accessories, with the intent to surpass all other men’s houses in roominess and imposing appearance. And though our scrupulous friend was at once the purchaser and the seller of my house, yet he did not dare, in the deep gloom that reigned, to attach his own name to the purchase. He put forward the notorious Scato, whose virtues, no doubt, had brought him into destitution, with the result that a man who, in his birthplace among the Marsi, had no longer a roof to retire to that he might shelter from the rain, now alleged that he had bought the noblest house upon the Palatine. The more low-lying part of the house he made over, not to his own family of Fonteius, but to that of Clodius, which he had relinquished; but of the many who bore the name of Clodius none applied for a place on the list of assignees who was not over his ears in poverty or crime.</p>
