concerning me proposed by the tribunes of the plebs; from the Kalends of January until your aim had been successfully achieved, you introduced, promulgated, and carried motions dealing with me; none of which could you legally have done, were Clodius’ enactment valid. Furthermore, the measure which was pronounced to be valid by Piso and Gabinius, who had no connexion at all with Publius Clodius, was pronounced to be null and void by your colleague, the distinguished Quintus Metellus, Publius Clodius’ cousin, when in conjunction with you he brought a motion in my case before <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">71</span><span class="br"></span> the senate. But what respect for laws in general was displayed by those who were so meticulous in dealing with the laws of Clodius? The senate, indeed, whose decision on a question of legal validity outweighs every other, was never consulted in my case without pronouncing against the validity of Clodius’ law, a fact which you too, Lentulus, must have observed in the deliberation upon the law dealing with me which you introduced. For your law enacted not that I should be permitted to come to Rome, but that I should come; for you did not wish to enact that it should be lawful for me to do that which was already lawful, but that my position in the state should suggest that I had been ordered back by the Roman people rather than restored to active political life.</p>

For what is an exile? In itself the name implies misfortune, not disgrace.
