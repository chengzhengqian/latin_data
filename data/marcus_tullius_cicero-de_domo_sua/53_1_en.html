the whole senate as not merely a citizen, but even <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">86</span><span class="br"></span> a citizen of distinction? And yet, as the records of the Roman people and their ancient annals tell us, Kaeso Quinctius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL158_237_a" id="target_note_LCL158_237_a"><sup>a</sup></a> and Marcus Furius Camillus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL158_237_b" id="target_note_LCL158_237_b"><sup>b</sup></a> and Gaius Servilius Ahala,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL158_237_c" id="target_note_LCL158_237_c"><sup>c</sup></a> though they had deserved highly of the republic, bowed before the animosity and violence of a populace that had been roused against them; condemned by the assembly of the Centuries, they fled into exile, but once again the same populace, with its wrath appeased, recalled them to their previous dignity. But if the fall of these men, condemned though they were, so far from impairing the glory of their famous names, even gave them added lustre,—for though we should rather pray to finish life’s course free from sorrow and injustice, it is still a greater title to an immortality of renown that one’s absence should be felt by one’s fellow-citizens than that one should have been altogether immune from outrage,—shall I, who went forth at the bidding of no people’s verdict, but amid the enthusiastic opinions of all, find that my restoration is to be occupied as a vantage-ground for malicious and accusatory tongues? <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">87</span><span class="br"></span> In pursuing his lofty policy Publius Popilius showed himself invariably courageous and steadfast; but nothing in all his career so illumines his merits as his actual downfall. For who at this time would remember the services he conferred upon the state, had he not been banished by traitors and restored by the efforts of patriots? As a military commander Quintus Metellus was brilliant, as a censor he was exemplary, earnestness was the note of his whole career; yet what has perpetuated this hero’s renown to eternal recollection has been his fall.</p>
