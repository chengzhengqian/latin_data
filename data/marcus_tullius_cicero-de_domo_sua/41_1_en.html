conferring of a distinction which was a deep insult, the other<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL158_213_a" id="target_note_LCL158_213_a"><sup>a</sup></a> by the infliction upon him of a disaster <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">66</span><span class="br"></span> which was to his eternal credit. And that you<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL158_213_b" id="target_note_LCL158_213_b"><sup>b</sup></a> may realize that it is not persons but high qualities that inspire his consistent hatred, I would remind you that, as soon as I had been expelled and Cato removed, he turned round upon the very man<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL158_213_c" id="target_note_LCL158_213_c"><sup>c</sup></a> whose agency and assistance in mass meetings had enabled him, as he himself admitted, to carry out all his projects in the past, and still continued to enable him; on the other hand, he did not think it likely that Gnaeus Pompeius, whom every one judged, as he saw, to be far the most powerful man in the state, would long continue to condone his reckless proceedings.
