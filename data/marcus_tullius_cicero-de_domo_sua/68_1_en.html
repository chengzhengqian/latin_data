returned praetor by Lucius Piso the consul, if only it might turn out that there was a rival candidate with the same initial letter as himself,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL158_267_a" id="target_note_LCL158_267_a"><sup>a</sup></a> he invested the funds set aside for his aedileship partly by storing them in his coffers, and partly by spending them on his park; he took the statue of the courtesan from its pedestal and presented it to Clodius, that it might symbolize the “liberty” of Clodius and his like rather than that of the state. Would anyone dare to desecrate this goddess, a courtesan’s likeness, which had decked a tomb, been removed by a thief, and set up by a sacrilegious hand?
