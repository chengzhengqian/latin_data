<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">It is pure speculation that S. is the author, based on the mention of Metrophanes (cf. fr. 4.2), a general of Mithridates who played a role in the fighting around Cyzicus in 73 (Oros. 6.2.16). Maurenbr. assigned this fragment to the first mention of Metrophanes, at the time of Mithridatesâ€™ invasion of Bithynia in early 74 BC.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Metrophanes gained the favor of Mithridates by being subservient.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Maurenbr., following Kritz, classified this fragment as spurious on the grounds that it is not found in the best sources for scholia on Lucan (one manuscript only preserves it). It looks suspiciously like a dim reflection of </span>ut omne ius in viribus esset <span class="italic">(fr. 1.16). Cf. fr. dub. 3.</span></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">The work </span>De orthographia,<span class="italic"> said to be by one L. Caecilius Minutianus Apuleius, is most probably a forgery of the fifteenth century, although, in that case, it is difficult to imagine where the author drew his information concerning S., since the </span>Historiae<span class="italic"> had long vanished by the fifteenth century. Pliny does mention this detail at </span>HN<span class="italic"> 7.199.</span></p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">Staphylus was the first to teach the mixing of wine with water</span></span><span class="italic">, according to Pliny and Sallust.</span></p>
