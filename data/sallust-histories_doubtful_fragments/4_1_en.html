<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">The absence of a numeral in the text of Charisius after the words </span>Sallustius libro,<span class="italic"> which immediately precede the opening words of this fragment, has led editors of Charisius to postulate a lacuna of indeterminate length between </span>libro<span class="italic"> and </span>fessit.<span class="italic"> Furthermore, since the fragment is directly followed by an annotation credited to the second-century AD commentator Statilius Maximus, Maurenbr. argued that the quotation itself is not from S. but from either Cic. or Cato, since they are the only two authors on whom Statilius is known to have commented. Consequently </span>confestim <span class="italic">(without delay), the word Charisius is treating in his discussion, is the sole word that can be restored with certainty to the presumed lacuna and credited to S. (fr. inc. 61). On the other hand, nothing precludes the assumption that the only thing missing from Charisiusâ€™ text is the book number and that the quotation is indeed from S., having been treated by Statilius perhaps in his commentary on Cato, an author S. is known to have imitated.</span></p>
