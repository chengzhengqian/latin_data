<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">On the suspect nature of the source preserving this fragment, see fr. 23. If, in fact, the content of fr. 24 goes back to S. (Serv. does attest that S. had occasion to mention Pyrrhus), S. may have alluded to the death of King Pyrrhus in his account of past fighting in southern Italy, where the devastation caused by Spartacus’ bands took place (so Gerlach). However, according to Plutarch </span>(Pyrrh.<span class="italic"> 34.2–3; cf. Justin. 25.5.1), Pyrrhus died after being struck by a roof tile hurled from above by an Argive woman.</span></p>
