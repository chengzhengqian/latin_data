<span class="italic"> Conceivably, however, </span>adversus illi<span class="italic"> of the paradosis was not part of the quotation but instead the heading (to introduce an example of </span>adversus<span class="italic"> + dat.), since the preceding heading is </span>adversus illius.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">The form of citation (“Crispus III”—as opposed to Charisius’ practice elsewhere of writing always “Sallustius,” frequently accompanied by a title, never with a bare numeral) casts suspicion on this quotation. If the word </span>historiarum<span class="italic"> has dropped out in front of “III” and the quotation is from Book 3 of S.’s </span>Historiae,<span class="italic"> the context, as suggested by Kritz, may be shortly after the storm that destroyed Mithridates’ fleet on his retreat from Cyzicus in the spring of 72 (cf. frr. 3.76–77). At that time Mithridates sent letters of appeal to Tigranes of Armenia and other neighboring kings (App. </span>Mithr.<span class="italic"> 78; Memnon, </span>FGrH<span class="italic"> 434F29.6). He conceivably argued that the war being waged by the Romans against him in Pontus was likely to spread to bordering kingdoms after the fashion of a raging fire.</span></p>
<p><span class="italic">Keil (</span>GL <span class="italic">1.609, Addenda), on the other hand, adopted the view of Lang, who postulated a lacuna after “Crispus III,” speculating that there dropped out of Charisius’ text a quotation from S., which was followed by the name of a poet who was the author of the fragment given here. Keil altered the text to produce two trochaic septenarii </span>(Nonne . . . acriter / haud . . . proxumae)<span class="italic"> and assigned them to some unknown comic poet (Com. Inc. 46–47 Ri.<sup>3</sup>). But none of this is certain.</span></p>
