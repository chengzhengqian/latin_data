<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Most editors of S. accept the conjecture </span>volnere<span class="italic"> for the obviously corrupt </span>ulipie h.<span class="italic"> and connect this fragment with the wounding of Metellus in the Sertorian War (see fr. 2.55). If, however, we restore with Wessner </span>in ulteriorem H.,<span class="italic"> the scholiast may have had in mind either a garbled version of fr. 3.10.1 (so McGushin) or fr. dub. 5, if indeed the latter is separate from fr. 3.10.1 (see immediately below).</span></p>

<h2><span class="bold">5</span>* 3.45M, inc. 20Mc, 2.24D, 2.30K</h2>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">This fragment so closely resembles the opening words of fr. 3.10.1 </span>(at Metellus in ulteriorem Hispaniam)<span class="italic"> that it may simply be a paraphrase, and yet the scholiast presents it specifically to illustrate </span>sed meaning “so.”</p>
<blockquote><p>so Metellus . . . to the farther province</p></blockquote>

<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">If Donatus did not misquote fr. 1.49.4 by substituting these words for </span>Philippoque et Antiocho,<span class="italic"> it is possible that they were taken from another passage in S.’s </span>Historiae.<span class="italic"> If that is the case, they provide the only example of the poetic </span>aequor<span class="italic"> = </span>mare<span class="italic"> in S.</span></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">It is by no means certain that Arusianus attributed these words to S. They come after a quotation from </span>Jug.<span class="italic"> 43.1 and are introduced by </span>id est, <span class="italic">which Lindemann emended to</span> idem,<span class="italic"> thereby identifying S. as the author. (For Arusianus’ use of </span>idem<span class="italic"> to introduce a second quotation from the same author, cf. the next fragment.)</span>
