<p class="noindent"><span class="sc">The</span> intercalary month regularly began after Feb. 23, and consisted of 22 or 23 days, to which were added the last five days of February.</p>
<p>The usual arrangement of the year, established according to legend under Numa (Livy I. xix. 6) and actually perhaps at the establishment of the republic (cf. the “restoration” mentioned by Dionysius, <span class="italic">Roman Antiquities</span> III. 36. 4), called for a regular moon-year of 355 days, with intercalation of 22 and 23 days, alternately, every second year. (The number of days in the year thus ran 355, 377, 355, 378, etc.) A cycle of 24 years was observed, in the twentieth year of which the intercalary month had only 22 days, not 23, while in the twenty-fourth year, the intercalary month was omitted. Thus the average error of one day a year in the ordinary succession of regular and intercalary years was corrected at the end of the 24–year cycle (cf. Macrobius I. 13. 13–21).</p>
<p>This calendar appears to have been in order in 211–10 <span class="sc">b.c.</span> (cf. Livy XXVII. iv. 1). In 190 <span class="sc">b.c.</span> , on the other hand, there was an error of 125 days (cf. XXXVII. iv. 4 and the note, Vol. X, pp. 300–1). An explanation suggested by Unger, I wan Müller’s Handbuch, Vol. I, 1886, pp 634–42, who has been followed in this note as a whole, is as follows: In 207 <span class="sc">b.c.</span> , owing to the terror inspired by Hasdrubal’s invasion of Italy, a change to a sun-year of 365 days
