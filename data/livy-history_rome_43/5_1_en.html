Tibur.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL396_11_1" id="target_note_LCL396_11_1"><sup>1</sup></a> There was a rumour that the advocates <span class="marginNote right"><span class="sc">b.c.</span> 171</span>would not allow accusations against men of rank and influence; this suspicion was increased by Canuleius the praetor, who gave up this investigation, began to hold a levy, and then suddenly left for his province, so that no more men should be assailed by the Spaniards. Though bygones were thus shrouded in silence, the senate voted for the future what the Spaniards had requested—that a Roman official should not set the price for grain, nor compel the Spaniards to sell their five-per-cent quotas<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL396_11_2a" id="target_note_LCL396_11_2a"><sup>2</sup></a> at the price he wished, and that no officers should be placed over their towns to collect money.</p>

Whereas in Sicily tithes of grain constituted a tax traditional in the region and continued by the Romans, in Spain the tax (<span class="italic">stipendium</span>) paid to the Romans as overlords seems to have been in money, or perhaps in precious metals; the twentieths here mentioned were not a tax, but a compulsory sale, like the <span class="italic">second</span> tithe which might on occasion be required of Sicily. The size of the quota perhaps reflects the lesser fertility of Spain. Special levies of money and grain from Spain are mentioned in XXIX. iii. 5 (a punitive levy), XXX. iii. 2 (a war-levy for the army in Africa) and XXX. xxvi. 6 (perhaps the regular tax).</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL396_11_2a').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL396_11_3"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL396_11_3" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">3</sup>Children of such unrecognized marriages were not illegitimate in the modern sense, but had the mother’s status, so that these people were legally Spaniards.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL396_11_3').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
