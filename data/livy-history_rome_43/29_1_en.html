Gracchus had, by not obeying the tribune’s interposition, <span class="marginNote right"><span class="sc">b.c.</span> 169</span>deprived him of his authority; he set a day for the trial of Gaius Claudius on the charge of taking the meeting away from him; and he announced that he judged each censor guilty of treason, and asked of Gaius Sulpicius the city praetor a day for an assembly.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL396_59_1a" id="target_note_LCL396_59_1a"><sup>1</sup></a> Since the censors did not object to having the people pass judgment on them at the first possible moment, the day for the assembly-trial for treason was set for the twenty-third and twenty-fourth of September.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL396_59_2" id="target_note_LCL396_59_2"><sup>2</sup></a> The censors immediately mounted to the Hall of Liberty<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL396_59_3" id="target_note_LCL396_59_3"><sup>3</sup></a> and, having there sealed the public accounts and closed the account-room and sent away the public slaves, declared that they would transact no public business until the judgment of the people upon them had been passed.

Cicero, <span class="italic">De Domo Sua</span> 47 (123–5), but apparently had to be confirmed by action of the people. Livy’s phrasing seems to make Rutilius arrange for two trials for Claudius, but we hear of only one (below, 14–16) and it seems probable that the trial for treason, based on the charges mentioned, was the one action which was to confirm the sentence already pronounced by the tribune; also this sentence was probably directed equally against both, though Gracchus is named alone. For a trial of treason, the <span class="italic">comitia centuriata</span> was called, since a death-sentence was involved, not the <span class="italic">comitia tributa</span>, as above, viii. 9, cf. the note, nor the <span class="italic">concilium plebis.</span></a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL396_59_1a').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL396_59_2"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL396_59_2" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">2</sup>A day for each defendant, see XXV. iv. 10.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL396_59_2').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL396_59_3"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL396_59_3" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">3</sup>This appears to have been next to the Senate-house, and perhaps a sort of annex to it.
