was planned in honour of Apollo, cf. the procession in his honour described in XXVII. xxxvii, end, which also propitiated Juno the Queen (as moon-goddess?—cf. C.I.L. 5, i, 3233 (Verona): IUN(oni) LUN(ae) REG(inae) SACR.—a dedication of a freedman, of imperial date). Intercalations were accordingly omitted till 192 <span class="sc">b.c.</span> (cf. Macrobius I. 14, “there was a time when all intercalations were omitted for a religious reason—propter superstitionem”), but the novelty of adding ten days to the standard year was also omitted after its first occurrence. We must assume that a cycle-end fell within the period of fourteen years, so that one intercalation would normally have been omitted, leaving six which were dropped because of the new arrangement. Six intercalations = 135 days, less ten extra days in 207 <span class="sc">b.c.</span> = 125 days lost from account. In 191 <span class="sc">b.c.</span> the consul Acilius Glabrio sponsored a law which gave the pontiffs a free hand to regulate intercalation (Macrobius I. 13. 21), probably to secure the gradual correction of the error. The intercalation of the year 169 may well have been an extraordinary one, as well as that of 167 <span class="sc">b.c.</span> (XLV. xliv. 3), thus arousing the special interest reflected by Livy’s mention of these events, for he does not mention all the intercalations which must have occurred. The calendar could have been corrected by about 163 <span class="sc">b.c.</span> </p>
