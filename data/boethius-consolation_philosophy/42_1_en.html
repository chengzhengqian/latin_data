since they allow themselves to be joined with evil in this way. The same may
be very rightly held true of all the gifts of fortune which evil men all

hesitates to call that man brave in whom he sees bravery present, and
clearly he is swift who possesses swiftness; so too art makes a man an
artist, medicine makes him a medical man, and rhetoric makes him an orator.
The nature of each produces what is proper to it, and is not mixed with
contrary effects, but naturally rejects what is opposed to it. Yet riches
cannot get rid of avarice, for it is insatiable, nor can power give a man
self-control if he is too firmly in the grip of sinful lusts; and a high
office given to dishonest men not only does not make them worthy of it, but
rather betrays and publishes their unworthiness. Why is this so? Because you
delight to give to things which are really otherwise names they should not
bear and which are easily shown to be false by the effects of the things

power, nor the other truly an honour. Lastly, we may draw the same
conclusion in the matter of a man’s fortune as a whole, in which
