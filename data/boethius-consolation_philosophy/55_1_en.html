<span class="line">Though lions from Carthage wear fine-fashioned chains</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">And eat out of a man’s hand,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">And fear—being used to beatings—their harsh
master,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">If blood once touch their bristling jaws</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Their long inactive spirits straight revive,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">With rumbling growls they are themselves again,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Shake their necks free from broken knots,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">And the first to slake their rage, torn by their bloodstained teeth,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Is their trainer.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">The tree-top loving, chirruping bird</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Is shut in a coop like a cavern.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Men treat her as a toy and care for her</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">With kindliness putting in honeyed drink</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">And food in plenty:</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Yet if she sees, hopping in her narrow cage,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">The beloved shade of trees,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">She scatters her food beneath her feet</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">And all she wants is her woods,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Sings sadly, softly, sweetly of her woods.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Bend now, with all your strength,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">A sapling’s top to the ground:</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">But if the right hand bowing it let go</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Its top again points straight up to the sky.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Phoebus sinks under western waves</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">But by a secret path again</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">He turns his car</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">To his accustomed rising.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Each thing seeks its own way back</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">And coming back is glad;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">None is consigned to any ordered course</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Save that which links the end to the beginning</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">And makes its cycle firm.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
