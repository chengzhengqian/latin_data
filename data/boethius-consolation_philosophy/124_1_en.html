<p>taught me just now, or fate, I should see that it was an opinion strongly and
firmly founded. But if you agree, let us count it among those things you

<p>“How so?” she asked.</p>
<p>“Because the common talk of men usually says, and indeed often,
that some men have ill fortune.”</p>
<p>“Then do you want us,” she asked, “to have
recourse for a while to terms like those of the common people, in case we
seem to have withdrawn too far, as it were, from the practice of
men?”</p>
<p>“As you think best,” I said.</p>
<p>“Then do you not judge that which is profitable to be
good?”</p>
<p>“That is so,” I said.</p>
<p>“But that which either exercises or corrects is
profitable?”</p>
<p>“I agree,” I said.</p>
<p>“And therefore good?”</p>
<p>“How could it not be?”</p>
<p>“But this is the case with those who, either being established in
virtue wage war against adversity, or turning aside from their vices take
the path of virtue.”</p>
<p>“I cannot deny it,” I said.</p>
<p>“Now what about the pleasant fortune which is granted as a reward
to the good: do the common people judge that to be bad?”</p>
<p>“By no means, but as indeed it is, so also they judge it to be,
very good.”</p>
<p>“What of the other, which although it is hard, constrains the
wicked with just punishment; the people do not think that good, do
they?”</p>
<p>“Indeed not,” I said, “they judge it to be
the most wretched of all conceivable things.”</p>
