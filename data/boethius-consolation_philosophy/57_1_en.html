<p>“But whoever lacks anything, is not completely
self-sufficient?”</p>
<p>“No, he is certainly not,” I said.</p>
<p>“So, did <span class="italic">you</span>, loaded with wealth as you
were,” she said, “feel this
insufficiency?”</p>
<p>“Why not?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Then wealth cannot make a man self-sufficient, lacking nothing,
though this was what it seemed to promise. And I think that this also is
specially worth considering, that there is nothing in the nature of money
which prevents its being taken away from those who possess it, against their
will.”</p>
<p>“I grant that,” I said.</p>
<p>“Why shouldn’t you grant it, since every day someone
who is stronger takes it from another against his will? What else causes all
the lawsuits, if not that someone is trying to get back money that has been
taken against their will by force or by fraud?”</p>
<p>“That is so,” said I.</p>
<p>“So,” said she, “a man will need some help
sought from outside himself by which to keep his money safe?”</p>
<p>“Who would deny it? “I asked.</p>
<p>“But he would not need it, did he not possess money, which he
could lose.”</p>
<p>“There is no doubt of that,” said I.</p>
<p>“So the very opposite is true to what was expected. Wealth, which
was thought to make a man self-sufficient, actually makes him need
another’s help. And by what means does wealth get rid of need?
Can rich men not get hungry, can they not be thirsty, do the bodies of the
moneyed men not feel the winter’s cold? But, you will argue, the
wealthy have the means to satisfy their hunger, and to be rid of thirst
