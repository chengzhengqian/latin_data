<p>“Lady,” I answered, “you who nurture all the
virtues, what you say is true; nor can I deny that I did enjoy, however
briefly, great prosperity. But it is just that which most torments me, for
in all the adversities of fortune, the most unhappy kind of misfortune is to
have known happiness.”</p>
<p>“But you cannot rightly blame anything else for the fact that you
are punished for your own wrong ideas. For if you really take this empty
notion of fortuitous happiness seriously, you should consider with me how

your possessions which in the whole reckoning of your fortune was most
precious is still preserved unharmed and inviolate, can you, keeping all
that is best, rightly talk of your misfortune? First, your father-in-law,
Symmachus, that most precious ornament of mankind, lives safely, and being a
man wholly formed in wisdom and virtue (a state you would not be slow to
purchase even at the cost of your life) and therefore without concern for
his own troubles, he laments over yours. Then again, your wife lives, a good
woman excelling in modesty
