willing it, and makes those she flees from miserable, what is this
fleeting goddess but a sure sign of misery to come? It is never enough for a
man to contemplate what is before his eyes: prudence must measure up how
things will work out in future, and the very changeableness and ambiguity of
the future render impotent the threats of fortune to inspire fear and her
flattery to awaken desire for it. Lastly, once you have submitted your neck
to her yoke, you must calmly bear whatever happens to you on
fortune’s own ground. And if you wanted to lay down rules for her
whom you have freely chosen as your mistress, how long to stay and when to
go, would you not be wrong and would you not make your own lot, which you
could not change, much worse because of your impatience? If you spread your
sails for the wind, you must go where the wind takes you, not where you wish
to go; when you cast your seed on the ground, you must weigh the barren
years against the good. You have given yourself over to fortune’s
rule: you must accommodate yourself to your mistress’s ways. Will
you really try to stop the whirl of her turning wheel? Why, you are the
biggest fool alive —if it once stop, it ceases to be the wheel of
fortune.</p>
