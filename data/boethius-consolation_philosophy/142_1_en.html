the
reason’s universal, and the imagination’s shape, and
what is materially sensible, but without using reason, imagination or the
senses, but by the one stroke of the mind, Formally, so to speak, looking
forth on all these things together. Reason, too, when it regards some
universal, without using imagination or the senses grasps the imaginable and
sensible aspects. For reason it is which defines the universal it has
conceived thus: man is a rational, bipedal animal. And although this is a
universal idea, at the same time no-one is ignorant that it is an imaginable
and sensible thing which the reason is considering, not by means of
imagination or sense, but in its rational conceiving. Imagination also,
although it has taken its beginning of seeing and forming shapes from the
senses, yet with sense removed surveys all sensible things not by a sensible
manner of examining them but by an imaginative one. Do you therefore see
that in knowing, all these use their own capability rather than that of
those things which are known? Nor is this wrong: for since every judgement
is the act of one judging, it must be that each performs his task not from
some other’s power but from his own.</p>
