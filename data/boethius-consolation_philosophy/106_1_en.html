wanting to do evil, able to do evil, and actually doing
evil.”</p>
<p>“That I grant,” I said, “but I very strongly
wish they might swiftly lose that misfortune by being deprived of the
ability to commit evil.”</p>
<p>“They will lose it,” she said, “more swiftly
than you desire, perhaps, or than they think that they will. For there is
nothing within the brief limits of this life so late that man’s
mind, considering especially that it is immortal, should think it long to
wait for. Their great expectation and the heights of their evil machinations
are suddenly destroyed and brought to an end, often unexpectedly; and that
indeed sets a limit to their wretchedness. For if wickedness makes them
wretched, your long-time miscreant is bound to be more wretched. And I
should judge them the most unfortunate of men but that death at least, in
the end, sets a term on their wickedness; for indeed if we have come to a
true conclusion about the misfortune attendant upon evil-doing, clearly that
wretchedness is infinite which it is agreed is eternal.”</p>
<p>“A wonderful conclusion,” I then said, “and
one hard to concede: but I acknowledge that it accords very well with what
was granted earlier.”</p>
<p>“Your thoughts are right,” she said, “but it
is proper for one who thinks it hard to accede to a conclusion either to
demonstrate that something false has been premised or to show that the
conjunction of the premises does not give a necessary conclusion. Otherwise,
if the premises are granted, there is absolutely no reason why he should
dispute the conclusion. For this also, which I am going to tell you, may
seem no less wonderful, but it follows equally necessarily from those things
already taken as true.”</p>
