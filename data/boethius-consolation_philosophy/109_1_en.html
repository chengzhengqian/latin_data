<p>Then I said: “When I consider your arguments, I think nothing is
more truly stated, but if I were to turn again to the judgements of men, is
there anyone to whom they would not seem unworthy not merely of belief but
even of a hearing?”</p>
<p>“That is so,” she said. “For they cannot
raise eyes accustomed to darkness to the light of manifest truth, and they
are like birds whose sight night enlightens but day makes blind. For while
they have regard not to the order of the world but their own desires, they
think the freedom to commit evil and go unpunished for the evil done is a
happy thing.</p>
<p>But see what eternal law ordains. Suppose you have conformed your mind to
better things: there is no need of a judge to confer rewards, you have
yourself joined yourself to the more excellent things. Suppose you turn
aside to worse things: look not without for one to punish you, you have
yourself thrust yourself down among the baser things; just as, if you were
to look by turns now at the squalid ground, now at the sky, leaving aside
all other outward signs, on the evidence of your sight itself you would seem
now to be in the dirt, now among the stars. But the common herd does not
look up at the stars: well then, shall we join them, who we have shown are
like the beasts? Suppose a man having completely lost his sight forgot even
that he ever possessed sight at all, and thought he lacked nothing needed to
make him perfectly a man, surely we who see would not have the same opinions
as that blind man? For not even this will they assent to, which rests on
equally strong foundations, that those are more unhappy who commit injustice
than those who suffer it.”</p>
