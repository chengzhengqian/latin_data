way, but by fate accomplishes those same things he has disposed in a manifold
and temporal way. Now whether fate works by certain divine spirits acting as
servants of providence, or whether the course of fate is woven by the
service of the soul or of the whole of nature, or by the celestial motions
of the stars, or by angelic power or demons’ ingenuity, or by any
or all of these, this surely is clear, that the unmoving and simple form of
the way things are done is providence, and fate is the movable interlacing
and temporal ordering of those things which the divine simplicity has
disposed to be done.</p>
<p>So it is that all things that are under fate are also subject to providence,
to which even fate itself is subordinate; but that some things, which are
placed under providence, are above the course of fate. These are the things
which are immovably fixed close to the principal divinity and so are beyond
the ordering of fate’s moving nature. For just as, of a number of
spheres turning about the same centre, the innermost one approaches the
simplicity of middleness and is a sort of pivot for the rest, which are
placed outside it, about which they turn; but the outermost one, turning
with a greater circumference, the further it is separated from the
indivisibility of the central point, the wider the spaces it spreads over;
and if anything is joined or associated with that centre, it is gathered
into its simplicity and ceases to spread and diffuse itself: in a similar
manner, that which is furthest separated from the principal mind is
entangled in the tighter meshes of fate, and a thing is the more free from
fate the more closely it moves towards that centre of all things. And if it
should cling fast to the firmness of the supernal mind, then
