thinks that all that he knows is
known simply by the power and nature of those things that are known. Which
is altogether otherwise: for everything which is known is grasped not
according to its own power but rather according to the capability of those
who know it.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL074_411_a" id="target_note_LCL074_411_a"><sup>a</sup></a> For—that this may become clear by
a brief example—the same roundness of a body sight recognizes in
one way and touch in another; the former sense remaining at a distance looks
at the whole at once by the light of its emitted rays, while the latter,
being united and conjoined to the round body, going right round its circuit,
grasps the roundness by parts.</p>
<p>Man himself also, sense, imagination, reason and intelligence look at in
different ways. For sense examines the shape set in the underlying matter,
imagination the shape alone without the matter; while reason surpasses this
too, and examines with a universal consideration the specific form itself,
which is present in single individuals. But the eye of intelligence is set
higher still; for passing beyond the process of going round the one whole,
it looks with the pure sight of the mind at the simple Form itself. And
herein the greatest consideration is to be given to this: for the higher
power of comprehension embraces the lower, while the lower in no way rises
to the higher. For neither can sense attain to anything outside matter, nor
does imagination look at universal specific forms, nor reason grasp the
simple Form: but the intelligence, as it were looking down from above, by
conceiving the Form distinguishes all the things subject to that Form, but
only because of the way it comprehends the Form itself, which could not be
known to anything else. For it knows
