my bed, and seeing my face worn with
weeping and cast down with sorrow, she bewailed my mind’s
confusion bitterly in these verses:</p>

<span class="line">Ah! How steep the seas that drown him!</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">His mind, all dulled, its own light fled,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Moves into outer dark, while noxious care</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Swollen by earthbound winds</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Grows beyond measure.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent14">This man</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Used once to wander free under open skies</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">The paths of the heavens; used to gaze</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">On rosy sunlight, and on the constellations</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Of the cold new moon,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">And on each star that on its wandering ways</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Turns through its changing circles—all such things</span><span class="linebreak"></span>

<span class="line">Why the winds howl and stir up the waves of the sea,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">What breath turns the fixed stars’ sphere,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Why the sun rises in the red east</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">And sinks beneath the Western waves,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">What warms the spring’s calm hours</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">So that the earth is lovely with flowers of roses,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">And who makes fruitful autumn heavy, as the year</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">fills,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">With the full grapes. He sought and told</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">All Nature’s secret causes.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>

from Plato’s pupil Eudoxus onwards, Greek astronomers were
concerned to make mathematical “models” (in the
modern philosophical sense) of the movements of the sun, moon and planets—the “wandering
stars”—which would enable their positions and
motions to be accurately computed. Boethius studied astronomy, and wrote
a Latin textbook of the subject, based on Ptolemy, which has not
survived.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL074_137_aa').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
