a man rejoice in what he received from someone else, some other man or even
he who gave it would be able to take it away. But since his goodness confers
on each man his reward, he will only lack it when he has ceased to be good.
Lastly, since every reward is sought after because it is believed to be
good, who will judge one who possesses the good to be without his reward?
