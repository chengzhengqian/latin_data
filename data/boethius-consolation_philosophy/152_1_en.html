my intention, I shall make nonsense of
providence, since what providence foreknows, I shall perhaps have changed. I
shall reply that you can indeed alter your intention, but since the truth of
providence sees in its present both that you can do so, and whether you will
do so and in what direction you will change, you cannot avoid the divine
prescience, just as you could not escape the sight of an eye that was
present, even though of your own free will you changed to different courses
of action. What then will you say? Will the divine knowledge be changed by
my disposition, so that, since I want to do this at one time and that at
another, it too alternates from this kind of knowledge to that? Not at all.
For the divine perception runs ahead over every future event and turns it
back and recalls it to the present of its own knowledge, and does not
alternate, as you suggest, foreknowing now this, now that, but itself
remaining still anticipates and embraces your changes at one stroke. And God
possesses this present instant of comprehension and sight of all things not
from the issuing of future events but from his own simplicity. In this way
that too is resolved which you suggested a little while ago, that it is not
right that our future actions should be said to provide the cause of the
knowledge of God. For the nature of his knowledge as we have described it,
embracing all things in a present act of knowing, establishes a measure for
everything, but owes nothing to later events. These things being so, the
freedom of the will remains to mortals, inviolate, nor are laws proposing
rewards and punishments for wills free from all necessity unjust. There
remains also as an observer from on high fore-knowing all things, God, and
the always present
