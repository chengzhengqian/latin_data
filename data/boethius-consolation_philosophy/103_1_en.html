wicked. For you
learned a little time ago that everything that is, is one, and that oneness
itself is good; and from this it follows that everything, since it is, is
seen also to be good. In this way, then, whatever falls from goodness,
ceases to be; wherefore evil men cease to be what they were—but
that they were men till now their still surviving form of the human body
shows—and therefore by turning to wickedness they have by the
same act lost their human nature. But since only goodness can raise anyone
above mankind, it follows necessarily that wickedness thrusts down beneath
deserving the name of men those whom it has cast down from the human
condition. So it follows that you cannot adjudge him a man whom you see
transformed by vices. The violent plunderer of others’ wealth
burns with avarice: you would say he was like a wolf. The wild and restless
man exercises his tongue in disputes: you will compare him to a dog. The
secret trickster rejoices that he succeeds in his frauds: let him be on a
level with the little foxes. He that cannot govern his anger roars: let him
be thought to have the spirit of a lion. The timorous and fugitive is afraid
of things not fearful: let him be reckoned like a deer. The stupid sluggard
is numb: he lives an ass’s life. The fickle and inconstant
changes his pursuits: he is no different from the birds. A man is drowned in
foul and unclean lusts: he is gripped by the pleasure of a filthy sow. So he
who having left goodness aside has ceased to be a man, since he cannot pass
over into the divine state, turns into a beast.</p>
