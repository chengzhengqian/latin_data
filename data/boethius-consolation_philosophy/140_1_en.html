charioteers are watched doing in guiding and turning their teams, and other
things of a similar kind. Now surely no necessity compels any of these
things to happen as it does?”</p>
<p>“Not at all; for the exercise of skill would be useless if all
things moved under compulsion.”</p>
<p>“Therefore things which, while they are happening, lack any
necessity of being so, these same things, before they happen, are future
without any necessity. And therefore there are some things going to happen
the occurrence of which is free from all necessity. For I do not think that
any man would say this, that those things which are happening now were not
“going to happen” before they happened; therefore of
these, even foreknown, the occurrence is free. For just as knowledge of
present things introduces no necessity into those things which are
happening, so the foreknowledge of future things introduces none into those
things which are to come. But this, you say, is exactly what is in doubt,
whether there can be any foreknowledge of those things which do not have
necessary outcomes. For these two (foreknowledge and not-necessary outcomes)
seem to be incompatible, and you think that if things are foreseen,
necessity is a consequence, and if there is no necessity, they cannot be
foreknown at all, and nothing can be grasped by knowledge except what is
certain. But if those things which are of uncertain outcome are foreseen as
if they were certain, that is really the obscurity of opinion, not the truth
of knowledge; for you believe thinking things to be other than as they are
to be alien to the integrity of knowledge. The cause of this mistake is that
