<span class="line">The west wind brings again in gentleness,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">And what Arcturus saw as sleeping seed</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">As tall crops under Sirius burn dry.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Nothing escapes your ancient ordering</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Or fails its proper office to fulfil.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">With a sure purpose ruling and guiding all,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Man’s acts alone</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">You will not, though you rightly could, constrain.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Why else does slippery fortune change so much?</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">The innocent endure the pains</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">That are the proper penalties of crime,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">And evil ways sit in the thrones of kings,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">And wicked men in unjust recompense</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Trample beneath their heels the necks of the good.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>

<span class="line">Their perjuries hurt them not, nor their deceit,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Decked in false colours;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">And when they please to use their power,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Then they delight to overcome great kings</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Whom countless peoples fear.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Look on this wretched earth,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Whoever you are who bind the world with law!</span><span class="linebreak"></span>

<span class="line">We men are buffeted by fortune’s seas.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Ruler, restrain their rushing waves and make the earth</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Steady with that stability of law</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">By which you rule the vastness of the heavens.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
