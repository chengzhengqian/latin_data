<h3>III</h3>
<p>And you also, earthly creatures that you are, have some image, though hazy,
in your dreams of your beginning; you see, though with a far from clear
imagination yet with some idea, that true end of your happiness. Your
natural inclinations draw you towards that end, to the true good, though
mistaken notions of many kinds lead you away from it. For consider, can men
come to the end they set themselves through those things by which they think
they will obtain happiness? For if money or honours or the rest do produce
any such thing, from which no good seems to be lacking, even we should admit
that some men are made happy by getting them. But if they cannot perform
what they promise, but lack many goods, is not the appearance of happiness
that they produce clearly false? First then, I ask you yourself, you who
were not so long ago very wealthy, were you never, among all your vast
riches, troubled in mind by some anxiety, arising from some wrong or
other?”</p>
<p>“I certainly cannot remember,” I answered,
“that my mind was so free that it was not always in some way
tormented.”</p>
<p>“Was it not either because something was missing that you wanted,
or because something you did not want was present?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” I said.</p>
<p>“So you desired the presence of the one, and the absence of the
other?”</p>
<p>“That is so,” I said.</p>
<p>“Now any man must lack that thing which he
desires?”</p>
<p>“Yes, he must,” said I.</p>
