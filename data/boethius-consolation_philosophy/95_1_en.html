<p>Then I exclaimed, “Wonderful! What great things you promise me!
Nor do I doubt that you can do them, but do not hold me back, whom you have
now so aroused.”</p>
<p>“First then,” she said, “that good men
always possess power, and that the wicked are deprived of all their
strength, you may learn, since indeed the one is proved from the other. For
since good and evil are contraries, if it is established that good is
powerful, the weakness of evil is clear; and if the frailty of evil is
evident, the strength of good is known. But that the trustworthiness of our
opinion may be the greater, I shall proceed by either path, confirming my
propositions now from this side, now from that.</p>
<p>There are two things, by which the effect of all human actions is achieved,
will and ability. If either of these be lacking, there is nothing which can
be completed. For the will being lacking, no man can even begin anything,
because he does not will it; but if the ability were to be wanting, the will
would be frustrated. That is why, if you were to see any man wanting to
obtain something which he was not in fact obtaining, you could not doubt
that he lacked the ability to get what he wanted.”</p>
<p>“That is obvious,” I said, “nor can it by
any means be denied.”</p>
<p>“And the man you see has achieved what he desired, will you doubt
that he was also able to do it?”</p>
<p>“Not in the least.”</p>
<p>“And every man should be reckoned strong in that point in which he
is able, and weak in that in which he is not able.”</p>
