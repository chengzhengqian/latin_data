<span class="line">In what diversity of shapes do living things traverse</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent3">the lands!</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">For some are long in body and sweep the dust</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">And draw a continuous furrow, moved by their bellyâ€™s</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent3">power;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">There are those the lightness of whose wandering</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent3">wings beats on the winds</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">And floats in the spaces of the ether far with flight</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent3">so smooth;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">These others delight to press their footprints in the</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent3">ground, and with their steps</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">To cross green fields, or pass beneath the woods.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">And all these, though you see they differ in their</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent3">various forms,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Yet their downturned faces make their senses heavy</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent3">grow and dull.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Only the race of men lift high their lofty heads</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">And lightly stand with upright bodies, looking down</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent3">so on the earth.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">And (unless, being earthly, you are stupidly wrong)</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent3">this shape tells you,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">You who with upright face do seek the sky, and</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent3">thrust your forehead out,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">You should also bear your mind aloft, lest weighted</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent3">down</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">The mind sink lower than the body raised above.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
