discover which is the cause of which,
foreknowledge of future things’ necessity, or future
things’ necessity of providence, and as if we were not striving
to show this, that whatever the state of the ordering of causes, the outcome
of things foreknown is necessary, even if that foreknowledge were not to
seem to confer on future things the necessity of occurring.</p>
<p>For indeed, if anyone sit, then the opinion that thinks that he sits must be
true; and conversely also, if the opinion about any man be true, that he
sits, then he must be sitting. There is thus a necessity in both cases: in
the latter, he must be sitting, but in the former, the opinion must be true.
But a man does not sit because the opinion about him is true, but rather
that opinion is true because that someone is sitting happened first. So that
although the cause of truth proceeds from the one part, yet there is in both
a common necessity.</p>
<p>Obviously the same reasoning holds with regard to providence and future
events: for even if the reason they are foreseen is that they <span class="italic">are</span> future events, yet they do not happen simply
because they are foreseen; and yet nevertheless things either must be
foreseen by God because they are coming or happen because they are

freedom of the will. But now how upside-down it is that it should be said
that the cause of eternal foreknowledge is the occurrence of temporal
things! But what else is it, to think that God foresees future things
because they are going to happen, than to think that those things, once they
have happened, are the cause of his highest providence? Furthermore, just as
when I know that something is, then that necessarily is so, so when I
