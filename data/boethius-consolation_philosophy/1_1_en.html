<span class="line">Verses I made once glowing with content;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Tearful, alas, sad songs must I begin.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">See how the Muses grieftorn bid me write,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">And with unfeigned tears these elegies drench my face.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">But them at least my fear that friends might tread</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">my path</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Companions still</span><span class="linebreak"></span>

<span class="line">But often called to those who want to end their</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">misery</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Is welcome. My cries he does not hear;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
