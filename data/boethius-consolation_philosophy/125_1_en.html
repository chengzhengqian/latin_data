<p>“See then whether we have not reached a most surprising conclusion
by following the opinion of common folk.”</p>
<p>“What?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Because from those things that have been granted,” she
said, “it has followed that the fortune of those who indeed are
either in possession of virtue, or making progress in it, or attaining to
it, whatever that fortune may be, is all good, but for those who persevere
in wickedness every kind of fortune is very bad.”</p>
<p>“That,” I said, “is true, though no-one
would dare to admit it.”</p>
<p>“And therefore,” she said, “a wise man ought
not to take it ill, every time he is brought into conflict with fortune,
just as it would not be fitting for a brave man to be vexed every time the
sound of war crashed out. Since for each of these the difficulty is itself
the occasion, for the latter of increasing his glory, for the former of
further fashioning his wisdom. And this is indeed why virtue is so called,
because relying on its own powers it is not overcome by adversity.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL074_379_a" id="target_note_LCL074_379_a"><sup>a</sup></a>
For neither have you, who are set on the road to virtue, come here to wallow
in luxury or swoon with pleasure. You are engaged in bitter mental strife
with every kind of fortune, lest ill fortune oppress you or pleasant fortune
corrupt. Hold to the mean with firm strength; whatever either remains below
the mean or passes beyond it has contempt for good fortune, but not the
reward for labour. For it is placed in your own hands, what kind of fortune
you prefer to shape for yourselves; for all fortune that seems adverse, if
it does not exercise or correct, punishes.</p>
