punished. In this way, the work of
defence-counsel would either languish altogether or, if they preferred to do
men good, their role would be changed to that of prosecutors. And the wicked
themselves, if it were allowable to glimpse through some small chink the
virtue they had abandoned, and see that they would lay aside, through the
torments of their punishment, the filth of their vices, they would not think
them torments, weighing against them the benefit of acquiring goodness, and
they would reject the efforts of defence lawyers and give themselves wholly
over to their prosecutors and judges. Wherefore in wise men there would be
left no place at all for hatred: for who except an utter fool would hate
good men? Yet to hate the wicked lacks all reason. For if, just as faintness
is a disease of the body, so is any vice a sort of disease of the mind,
since we should think those sick in body not at all deserving of hatred, but
rather of pity, much more are those to be pitied, not persecuted, whose
minds are oppressed by what is crueller than any bodily weakness,
wickedness.‚Äù</p>
