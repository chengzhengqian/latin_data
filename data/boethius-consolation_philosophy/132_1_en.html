penetrating judgement, an uncorrupted will, and the ability to achieve
what they desire. But human souls must indeed be more free when they
preserve themselves in the contemplation of the divine mind; less free,
however, when they slip down to the corporeal, and still less free when they
are bound into earthly limbs. But their ultimate servitude is when, given
over to vice, they have lapsed from the possession of the reason proper to
them. For when from the light of the highest truth they have lowered their
eyes to inferior, darkling things, at once they are befogged by the cloud of
unknowing, they are disturbed by destructive affections, by giving in and by
consenting to which they strengthen that servitude which they have brought
upon themselves, and are in a way made captive by their freedom. Yet that
regard of providence which looks forth on all things from eternity, sees
this and disposes all that is predestined to each according to his
deserts.”</p>
