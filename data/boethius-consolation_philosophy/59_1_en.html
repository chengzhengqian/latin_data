yourself ever have been induced by any number of
dangers to think of taking office with Decoratus, since you perceived that
he had the disposition of a wicked clown and informer?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL074_247_a" id="target_note_LCL074_247_a"><sup>a</sup></a> For we cannot
judge those worthy of respect because of their offices whom we judge
unworthy of the offices themselves. But if you saw someone endowed with
wisdom, could you think him unworthy of respect or of that wisdom with which
he is endowed? Of course not. So there is some worth proper to virtue which
is immediately transferred to those to whom virtue is joined. Now since
honours acclaimed by the mob cannot do this, it is clear that they do not
possess the beauty proper to real worth. And in this matter you should
further consider this: if a man is the more abject the more he is despised
by the more people, high office, since it cannot make dishonest men worthy
of respect, for it exposes them to the gaze of more people, makes them
rather the more despised. But the offices themselves do not escape without
harm, for those dishonest men do an equally bad turn to them by defiling
them with their own infection.</p>
<p>Now that you may recognize that that true respect cannot be derived from
these shadowy dignities, suppose a man who has been consul many times should
happen to visit some barbarian nations outside the Roman world, will his
high rank make him respected by the barbarians? If such dignities did
possess this ability naturally, they would not lose their power among any
peoples at all, just as fire never ceases to be hot anywhere in the world.
But since it is not a power proper to them, but only attributed to them by
the delusory opinion of men, they at once became empty as soon as they come
among
