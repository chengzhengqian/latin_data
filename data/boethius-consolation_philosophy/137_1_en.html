<span class="line">What cause discordant breaks the world’s compact?</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">What god sets strife so great</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Between two truths,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">That those same things which stand, alone and</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">separate,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Together mixed, refuse to be so yoked?</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Or is there no such discord between truths,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">And do they ever each to other firmly cleave,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">But is it the mind, eclipsed by the body’s unseeing</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">parts,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">That cannot recognize, by its suppressed light’s fire,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">The world’s fine fastenings?</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">But why does it blaze with so great love</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">To find the hidden characters of truth?</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Does it know what it anxiously seeks to know?</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">But who is there labours to know known things?</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Yet if it does not know, why then in blindness seek?</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">For who would long for anything he knows not of,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Or who could follow after things unknown,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Or how discover them? Who could in ignorance</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">recognize</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">The form of what he found?</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Or, when it perceived the highest mind,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Did it know at once the whole and the separate parts?</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Now, clouded and hidden by the body’s parts,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">It is not totally forgetful of itself,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">And the whole it keeps, losing the separate parts.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Therefore whoever seeks the truth</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
