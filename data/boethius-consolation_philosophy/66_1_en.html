and reject the service of so very base and frail a thing as the body? Now
indeed those indeed who boast of the good qualities of their
bodies—how mean and how frail the possession on which they rely!
Could you exceed elephants in size, or bulls in strength, could you outstrip
tigers in speed? Look on the space and steadfastness and speed of the
heavens and cease hereafter to wonder at base things; though the heavens are
rather to be wondered at not for these things but for the order by which
they are governed. But how brief is the brightness of beauty, how swiftly
passing, more quickly fleeting than the changing loveliness of spring
flowers. And if, as Aristotle says,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL074_261_a" id="target_note_LCL074_261_a"><sup>a</sup></a> men enjoyed the
use of Lynceus’ eyes so that their sight penetrated obstacles,
would not the superficially very beautiful body of Alcibiades seem most vile
when his inwards could be seen? So it is not your nature that makes you
appear fair, but the weakness of the eyes of those who look at you. But you
may over-esteem the body’s good qualities as much as you like,
provided you realize that what you admire can be destroyed by the burning of
a three-days fever. Out of all which we may gather this in sum, that these
things which can neither provide those goods they promise nor are perfect by
amassing all goods, neither lead to happiness like so many roads, nor
themselves make men happy.</p>
