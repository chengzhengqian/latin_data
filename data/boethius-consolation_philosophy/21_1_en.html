know the goal and end of all things, you think
that evil and wicked men are fortunate and powerful; since indeed you have
forgotten what sort of governance the world is guided by, you think these
fluctuations of fortune uncontrolled. All these are quite enough to cause
not merely sickness but even death. But I thank the author of all health
that you have not yet wholly lost your true nature. The best kindler of your
health we have is your true opinion of the governance of the world, that you
believe it to be subject not to the randomness of chance events but to
divine reason; do not be afraid, then, for presently out of this tiny spark
your vital warmth will glow again. But it is not yet time for strong
medicines. Men’s minds are obviously such that when they lose
true opinions they have to take up false ones, and then a fog arises from
these false ideas, which obscures that true vision. So I shall try for a
while with gentle and moderate applications to lessen that fog, so that when
the darkness of those deceptive ideas is removed, you may be able to
recognize the glory of the light of truth.</p>
