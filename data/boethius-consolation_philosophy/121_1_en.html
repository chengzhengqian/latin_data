<p>And often that highest providence produces from all this a remarkable wonder,
that evil men make evil men good. For some of them, while they think they
are suffering injustices at the hands of men much worse than they, being
inflamed with hatred of those injuring them, have come back to
virtue’s harvest, striving to be unlike those whom they hated.
For only the divine nature is such that to it even evils are good, since by
suitable use of them God draws out as a result some good. For a certain
order embraces all things, so that that which has departed from the rule of
this order appointed to it, although it slips into another condition yet
that too is order, so that nothing in the realm of providence may be left to
chance.</p>
<p>“But it is grievous that I should talk of all this as if I were a
god.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL074_371_a" id="target_note_LCL074_371_a"><sup>a</sup></a> For it is not allowed to a man either to
comprehend with his natural powers or to express in words all the devices of
the work of God. Let it suffice to have perceived only this, that God the
author of all natures himself directing them towards the good disposes all
things, and while he is swift to retain those things he has made in his own
likeness, he removes all evil from within the bounds of his commonwealth by
the course of the necessity of fate. Thus it happens that if you were to
have regard to providence’s disposing, looking at those things
which are thought so widespread on earth, you would judge that there was no
evil anywhere in them. But I see that you are long since burdened with the
weight of this enquiry and tired by the length of the argument, and are
waiting for some sweetness in verse; therefore take a draught, that you may
be refreshed by it and go more firmly further on.</p>
