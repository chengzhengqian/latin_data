though it is necessary that he is going at the time when he is walking.
Now in the same way, if providence sees anything as present, that must
necessarily be, even if it possesses no necessity of its nature. But God
beholds those future events which happen because of the freedom of the will,
as present; they therefore, related to the divine perception, become
necessary through the condition of the divine knowledge, but considered in
themselves do not lose the absolute freedom of their nature. Therefore all
those things which God foreknows will come to be, will without doubt come to
be, but certain of them proceed from free will, and although they do come to
be, yet in happening they do not lose their proper nature, according to
which, before they happened, they might also not have happened. What then
does it matter that they are not necessary, since on account of the
condition of the divine knowledge it will turn out in all respects like
necessity? Surely as much as those things I put before you a moment ago, the
rising sun and the walking man: while these things are happening, they
cannot not happen, but of the two one, even before it happened, was bound to
happen, while the other was not. So also, those things God possesses as
present, beyond doubt will happen, but of them the one kind is consequent
upon the necessity of things, the other upon the power of those doing them.
So therefore we were not wrong in saying that these, if related to the
divine knowledge, are necessary, if considered in themselves, are free from
the bonds of necessity, just as everything which lies open to the senses, if
you relate it to the reason, is universal, if you look at it by itself, is
singular.</p>
