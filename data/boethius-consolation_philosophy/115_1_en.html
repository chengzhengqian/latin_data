the stability of the divine mind. That mind, firmly placed in the citadel of
its own simplicity of nature, established the manifold manner in which all
things behave. And this manner, when it is contemplated in the utter purity
of the divine intelligence, is called providence; but when related to those
things it moves and disposes, it was by the ancients called fate. And that
these are different will easily be seen, if one mentally examine the nature
of each: for providence is the divine reason itself, established in the
highest ruler of all things, the reason which disposes all things that
exist; but fate is a disposition inherent in movable things, through which
providence binds all things together, each in its own proper ordering. For
providence embraces all things together, though they are different, though
they are infinite; but fate arranges as to their motion separate things,
distributed in place, form and time; so that this unfolding of temporal
order being united in the foresight of the divine mind is providence, and
the same unity when distributed and unfolded in time is called fate.</p>
<p>Now although these are different, yet the one depends on the other; for the
order of fate proceeds from the simplicity of providence. For in the same
way as a craftsman first conceives in his mind the form of the thing he is
to make and then puts the work into effect, and produces by stages in
temporal order what he had previously envisaged in a simple and
instantaneous manner, just so God by providence disposes what is to be done
in a single and unchanging
