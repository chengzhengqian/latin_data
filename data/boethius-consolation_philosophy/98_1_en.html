ready to learn, I shall heap up many arguments together. For see how
plainly great is the weakness of corrupt men, who cannot attain even to that
towards which their natural inclination draws and almost compels them. And
what would it be like if they were deprived of this great and almost
invincible aid, of nature leading the way? And consider also how great is
the impotence that grips wicked men. For those things they seek as rewards,
which they cannot acquire and possess, are not trifles or playthings<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL074_325_a" id="target_note_LCL074_325_a"><sup>a</sup></a>; they fail in what concerns the very sum and summit of things, nor
do the wretches achieve the performance of that for which alone they spend
days and nights striving; and it is in this matter that the strength of good
men is outstandingly clear. For just as you would judge him most powerful in
walking who, proceeding on foot, was able to reach a place so distant that
no further passable place lay before his step, so you are bound to judge him
most powerful who attains the end of all things desirable, beyond which is
nothing. And hence we have also the opposite to this, that those same men
who are wicked are those who appear destitute of all power. For why do they
abandon virtue and pursue vices? Is it because they do not know what things
are goodâ€”but what is more weakly than the blindness of ignorance?
Or do they know what should be pursued, but does inordinate desire lead them
headlong astray? Then this way too they are frail because of their lack of
control, those who are unable to struggle against vice. Or do they forsake
the good and turn aside to vice knowingly and willingly? But in this case
they cease not merely to be powerful, but simply to be: for those who leave
aside
