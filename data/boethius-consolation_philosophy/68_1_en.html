<p>“The explanation is indeed very ready to hand, for that which is
simple and undivided by nature, human error divides and perverts from the
true and perfect to the false and imperfect. Do you think that that which
needs nothing is in want of power?”</p>
<p>“Certainly not,” I said.</p>
<p>“You are quite right,” she said, “for if
there is something the power of which is in any respect too weak, there must
be in that respect a need for others’ help.”</p>
<p>“That is so,” I said.</p>
<p>“Therefore the nature of sufficiency and that of power are one and
the same.”</p>
<p>“So it seems.”</p>
<p>“Now do you think that what is of this kind is to be despised or,
on the contrary, to be of all things the most worthy of
respect?”</p>
<p>“The latter,” I said; “it cannot even be
doubted.”</p>
<p>“So let us add respect to sufficiency and power, so that we judge
these three to be one.”</p>
<p>“Let us so add it, since we wish indeed to acknowledge the
truth.”</p>
<p>“Well then,” she said, “do you think it is
obscure and undistinguished, or is it most famous, with all renown? Now
consider whether that which it is granted lacks nothing, which is most
powerful and most worthy of honour, is in want of fame, and cannot provide
it for itself, and for that reason seems in some respect to be
lower.”</p>
<p>“I cannot but acknowledge,” I said, “that
being what it is, it is also most renowned.”</p>
<p>“Consequently, then, let us admit that fame differs not at all
from the previous three.”</p>
<p>“It follows,” I said.</p>
