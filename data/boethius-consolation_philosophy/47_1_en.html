<span class="line">The man who rushes after glory</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">And nothing else, thinking it highest of all,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Let him compare the vastness of the heavens</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">With the narrowness of earth:</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">He’ll blush for his proud name that cannot satisfy</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Even his brief ambition.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Why do men in their pride—and yet in vain!—</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Long to shake from their necks the yoke</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Of their mortality?</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Though fame may spread abroad</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Loosing the tongues of many different peoples,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">And though a great house blaze with many a famous</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">title,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Death despises the heights of glory,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Enfolds alike the humble and the proud,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Making the lowest equal to the highest.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Where now are the bones of good Fabricius?</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">What is Brutus now, or stern old Cato?</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">What little fame is left them—just their names</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">In a few old stories!</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">And if we read and learn their glorious names</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Do we then know the dead?</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">And so you too will all be quite forgotten,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Nor can fame make you known by any man.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">And if you think you may live longer yet</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">At least as a name alive on the lips of men,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">When your last day takes even <span class="italic">this</span> from you,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">There’s still to come</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">That second death.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
