<p>Now for the sake of argument, that you may see what follows, let us suppose
that there is no foreknowledge. In such a case, those things that depend
upon the will would not be forced into any necessity, would
they?”</p>
<p>“Not at all.”</p>
<p>“Again, let us suppose that there is foreknowledge, but that it
enjoins no necessity on things; there will remain, I think, that same
freedom of the will, whole and absolute. But foreknowledge, you will say,
although it does not constitute a necessity for future things, of their
happening, yet it is a sign that they will necessarily come to be. In this
way, then, even had there been no foreknowledge, it would be agreed that the
outcome of future things is necessary; for every sign only points to what
is, but does not cause to be what it signifies. Wherefore it must first be
demonstrated that nothing happens except of necessity, that foreknowledge
may be seen to be the sign of that necessity; otherwise, if there is no
necessity, nor then will foreknowledge be able to be a sign for that which
does not exist. But it is agreed that a proof supported by firm reasoning
must be drawn not from signs nor from arguments fetched from outside the
subject, but from relevant and necessary causes.</p>
<p>But how could it be that those things should not happen which are foreseen to
be future? Just as if we were to believe that those things which providence
foreknows will happen were not going to happen, and did not rather think
that although they do happen, yet they have of their nature no necessity
that they must happen. Which you may easily gather from this: for many
things, while they are happening, we
