possessing itself in the present, and hold as present the infinity of moving
time.</p>
<p>And therefore those are not right who, when they hear that Plato thought this
world neither had a beginning in time nor would have an end, think that in
this way the created world is made co-eternal with the Creator. For it is
one thing to be drawn out through a life without bounds, which is what Plato

of the divine mind. Nor should God seem to be more ancient than created
things by some amount of time, but rather by his own simplicity of nature.
For this present nature of unmoving life that infinite movement of temporal
things imitates, and since it cannot fully represent and equal it, it fails
from immobility into motion, it shrinks from the simplicity of that present
into the infinite quantity of the future and the past and, since it cannot
possess at once the whole fullness of its life, in this very respect, that
it in some way never ceases to be, it seems to emulate to some degree which
it cannot fully express, by binding itself to the sort of present of this
brief and fleeting moment, a present which since it wears a kind of likeness
of that permanent present, grants to whatsoever things it touches that they
should seem to be. But since it could not be permanent, it seized on the
