<p>“Now is there anyone,” she asked, “who
thinks that men can do all things?”</p>
<p>“No one, unless he is mad.”</p>
<p>“Yet men can do evil.”</p>
<p>“Would indeed,” I exclaimed, “that they
could not!”</p>
<p>“Since then he who can only do good things can do all things, and
they cannot do all things who <span class="italic">can</span> do evil, it is
plain that those same men, who can do evil, can do less. And what is more,
we have shown that all power is to be counted among desirable things, and
all desirable things are related to the good as to the very summit of their
nature. But it is impossible for the ability to commit evil to be related to
the good, and therefore it is not to be desired. Yet all power is to be
desired; clearly therefore the ability to do evil is not a power. From all
of which the power of good men and the quite undoubted weakness of evil men
is plain, and clearly the opinion of Plato is true that only wise men can do
what they desire and that wicked men can perform what pleases them but not
achieve what they desire.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL074_329_a" id="target_note_LCL074_329_a"><sup>a</sup></a> For they do anything you like thinking they
will obtain through those things in which they take pleasure, that good
which they desire; but they do not obtain it, since shameful deeds are not
conducive to happiness.</p>
