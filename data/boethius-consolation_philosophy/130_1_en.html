to find he had dug up a quantity of
gold. Now this is indeed believed to have happened by chance, but it does
not come from nothing; for it has its proper causes, and their unforeseen
and unexpected coming together appears to have produced a chance event. For
if the man tilling his field were not digging the ground, and if the man who
put it there had not hidden his money in that particular spot, the gold
would not have been found. These are therefore the causes of that fortuitous
profit, which is produced by causes meeting one another and coming together,
not by the intention of the doer of the action. For neither he who hid the
gold, nor he who worked the field, intended that money to be found, but as I
said, where the one buried it the other happens and chances to have dug. We
may therefore define chance as the unexpected event of concurring causes
among things done for some purpose. Now causes are made to concur and flow
together by that order which, proceeding with inevitable connexion, and
coming down from its source in providence, disposes all things in their
proper places and times.”</p>
