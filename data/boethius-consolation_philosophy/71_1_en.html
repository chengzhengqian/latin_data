mortal and impermanent things which could
produce a condition of this kind?”</p>
<p>“I most certainly think not,” I replied,
“and that has been so demonstrated by you that no further
argument is desired.”</p>
<p>“These things, therefore, seem to give mortals images of the true
good, or certain imperfect goods, but they cannot confer the true and
perfect good.”</p>
<p>“I agree,” I said.</p>
<p>“Then since you have recognized what is the true happiness, and
what things counterfeit it, it now remains for you to recognize whence you
can seek this true happiness.”</p>
<p>“That indeed,” I said, is what I have long been eagerly
hoping for.”</p>
<p>“But since,” said she, “as is my
Plato’s opinion in the <span class="italic">Timaeus</span>,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL074_271_a" id="target_note_LCL074_271_a"><sup>a</sup></a>
we ought to implore God’s help in even the least of matters, what
do you think we should do now, that we may be worthy to discover the abode
of that highest good?”</p>
<p>“We must call upon the Father of all things,” I said,
“for if this is omitted no beginning can be rightly and properly
based.”</p>
<p>“You are right,” she said, and at once began singing in
this way:</p>

of the Neo-platonist commentary of Proclus (ed. Ernest Diehl, Teubner (3
vols.), 1903–1906). It has been described by Courcelle as
“substantiel et concis, obscur et presque
intraduisable”, and its difficulty, because of the
compression of so much thought in so few lines, has called forth
commentaries throughout medieval and modern times. For a full account of
