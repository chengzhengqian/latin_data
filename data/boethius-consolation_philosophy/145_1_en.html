she does indeed see both the object of sense and the object of imagination
under the aspect of their universality, but that they cannot aspire to the

then, should we not, we who have in us the power of reasoning as well as
those of imagination and sense, should we not rather judge in favour of
reason’s case? It is similar when human reason thinks that the
divine intelligence does not see future things except in the same manner as
she herself knows them. For this is how you argue: if any things seem not to
have certain and necessary occurrences, those things cannot be certainly
foreknown as going to occur. Therefore of these things there is no
foreknowledge, and if we think there is foreknowledge in these matters,
there will be nothing which does not happen from necessity. Now if just as
we have a share in reason, so we could possess the judgement belonging to
the divine mind, then just as we have judged that imagination and sense
ought to give way to reason, so we should think it most just that human
reason should submit to the divine mind. Wherefore let us be raised up, if
we can, to the height of that highest intelligence; for there reason will
