there is no doubting how rightly and in what
good order these things are done, and how much in accord with the good of
those to whom they come. For this too, that the wicked are sometimes harshly
treated and sometimes gain their desires, proceeds from the same causes.
Their harsh treatment no-one wonders at, since all think they deserve
ill—and their torments indeed both deter the rest from crime and
correct those they fall upon—but their joyful fortune speaks a
great argument for the good to hear, how they ought to judge this kind of
prosperity, which they see often attendant upon the wicked. And in this
matter I think it is also arranged, that there is some man whose nature is
so headstrong and rude, that the want of property could very likely provoke
him to crime; and his sickness providence cures with this remedy, the
provision of money. One man, regarding his own conscience soiled by his
misdeeds, and comparing his own character with his fortune, is afraid
perhaps lest it should be hard for him to lose that the enjoyment of which
he finds pleasant; therefore he will change his behaviour and, while he is
afraid of losing his fortune, he leaves his wickedness. Others prosperity
unworthily used has hurled to well-deserved disaster. To some the right to
punish others is granted, that it may be the cause of the employment of the
good and the chastisement of the bad. For just as there is no compact
between honest and dishonest men, so too the dishonest cannot agree among
themselves. How can they, when each differs even with himself, their vices
tearing their consciences apart, and when they often do things which, once
they have done them, they see ought not to have been done?</p>
