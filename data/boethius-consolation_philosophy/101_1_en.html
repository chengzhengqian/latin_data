<p>Do you see, then, in what deep mire wickedness wallows, with what brightness
goodness shines? From which it is obvious that good deeds never lack their
rewards, nor wicked deeds their punishments. For in all actions performed,
that for which each action is performed can rightly be seen as the reward of
that action, as for example, for running on the racetrack, the crown, for
which the race is run, is clearly the reward. But we have shown that
happiness is the good itself, that good for which all things are done;
therefore the good itself is proposed as the common reward for all human
actions. But this cannot be separated from good men—for he will
no longer rightly be called good who lacks goodness—and therefore
good behaviour is not left without its rewards. However much, therefore,
evil men may rage, yet the wise man’s laurels will not fall, nor
wither; for neither does another’s wickedness pluck
