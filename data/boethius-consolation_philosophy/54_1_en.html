happiness as a condition possessing
plenty of all goods, needing no other’s help, but being
self-sufficient. Are they indeed mistaken, who think that whatever is best
is also most worthy of reverence and respect? Of course not: for that cannot
be base and contemptible which the efforts and labour of almost all men
strive to obtain. Is power not to be accounted a good? Why, surely we are
not to think that to be feeble and lacking in vigour which it is agreed is
more excellent than all else? Is fame to be rated as nothing? Yet it cannot
be set aside that all that is most excellent also seems to be most famous.
Is there any point in saying that happiness is not worried or depressed, not
subject to pain or vexation? Since even in the least things men seek that
which they delight to have and to enjoy. These surely are the things men
want to gain, and for that reason they desire riches, high office, the rule
of men, glory and pleasure, because they believe that through them they will
achieve sufficiency, respect, power, celebrity and joy. The good is
therefore that which men pursue in so many different endeavours; and we can
easily see how great is nature’s power in this, since although
opinions vary and differ so much, yet they agree in loving the same end, the
good.</p>
