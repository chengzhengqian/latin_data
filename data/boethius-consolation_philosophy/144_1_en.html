<p>Now if in perceiving corporeal things, although qualities presented from
without affect the apparatus of the senses, and the emotive movement of the
body precedes the activity of the active mind, a movement which calls forth
upon itself the action of the mind and stirs up the forms previously lying
at rest within; if, I say, in perceiving corporeal things, the mind is not
marked by that movement, but of its own power judges that movement, which is
a quality of the body, then how much the more do those things which are
quite separate from all bodily affections, in the act of judgement not
follow things presented from without, but set in motion the action of the
mind to which they belong! And so on this principle many kinds of knowledge
belong to different and diverse substances. For sense alone without any
other kind of knowledge belongs to living things that do not move, such as
are sea shells and such other things as feed clinging to rocks; but
imagination belongs to beasts that move, which seem already to have in them
some disposition to flee or to seek out things. But reason belongs only to
human kind, as intelligence only to the divine. So it is that that kind of
knowledge is better than the rest which of its own nature knows not only its
own object but the subjects of other kinds of knowledge also.</p>
<p>What, then, if sense and imagination gainsay reasoning, saying that that
universal which reason thinks she perceives, is nothing at all? For that
which is the object of sense and imagination cannot, they say, be universal;
therefore either the judgement of reason is true, and there is nothing
sensible,
