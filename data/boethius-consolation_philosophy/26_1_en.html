<h3>II</h3>
<p>But I should like to deal with you for a moment in fortune’s own
words; and do you think whether she is not right. “Why, man, do
you daily complain against me,” she says,” what hurt
have I done you? What goods of yours have I taken from you? Contest with me
the possession of wealth and office before any judge, and if you can show
that any such thing is the property of any mortal, I shall immediately and
perfectly readily grant that those things you want back were indeed yours.
When nature brought you out of your mother’s womb, I accepted
you, naked and poor in all respects; I supported you, and, ready to be kind
to you, even pampered you with my wealth, and over-indulgently spoiled
you—which is precisely why you are now so angry with me. I
surrounded you with every kind of affluence and splendour within my power.
Now I am pleased to draw back my hand. You should thank me, as having
enjoyed the use of what was not yours, not complain as if you had lost
something of your own. Now why lament? I have done no violence to you.
Wealth and honours and other such are under my control, they are my
handmaids; knowing their mistress, they come, and they go, with me. I may
say quite firmly that if those things the loss of which you complain of were
really yours, you would never have lost
