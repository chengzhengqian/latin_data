the common end of all things that
are, at the same time also leave off being.</p>
<p>And this indeed may seem strange to some, that we should say of evil men, who
are the majority of mankind, that they do not exist; but that is how things
are. For of those who are evil I do not deny that they are evil; but that
they are, purely and simply, I do deny. For as you would say that a corpse
was a dead man, but you could not call it simply a man, so I concede of the
vicious that they are indeed evil, but I cannot admit that they are,
absolutely. For that <span class="italic">is</span>, which keeps its order and
preserves its nature; and whatever falls from this, also abandons being,
which is dependent on its nature. But evil men, you will say, are able to do
things. Not even I would deny that, but this ability of theirs is derived
not from their strength but from their weakness. For they can do evil
things, which they would not be able to do, had they been able to persevere
in the performance of good things. And that ability they do have shows more
clearly that they can really do nothing; for if, as we concluded just now,
evil is nothing, since they can only do evil, it is obvious that the wicked
can do nothing.”</p>
<p>“That is very clear.”</p>
<p>“And that you may understand what the nature of this power of
theirs is, remember we laid it down a little while ago that nothing was more
powerful than the highest good.”</p>
<p>“That is so,” I said.</p>
<p>“But that, the highest good,” she said,
“cannot do evil.”</p>
<p>“Not at all.”</p>
