well of men,
not deceiving them at all: when she shows herself clearly, uncovering her
face and declaring her ways. Perhaps you do not yet understand what I am
saying. What I want to tell you is something wonderful, which makes it very
difficult for me to put it into words. For I think that ill fortune is
better for men than good. Fortune always cheats when she seems to smile,
with the appearance of happiness, but is always truthful when she shows
herself to be inconstant by changing. The first kind of fortune deceives,
the second instructs; the one binds the minds of those who enjoy goods that
cheatingly only seem to be good, the other frees them with the knowledge of
the fragility of mortal happiness. So you can see that the one is
inconstant, always running hither and thither, uncertain of herself; and the
other is steady, well prepared and—with the practice of adversity
itself—wise. Lastly fortune when apparently happy leads men
astray by her blandishments, wandering from the true good; when she is
adverse, she commonly draws them back, as it were with a hook, towards it.
Surely you do not think it wholly unimportant that this rough and unpleasant
fortune has discovered those friends who are truly loyal to you, and has
divided the honest from the dishonest among your companions, by taking her
own kind with her when she left you, leaving your sort with you? How dearly
would you have bought such knowledge in your unaffected and—as
you thought—fortunate state! As it is, you are even complaining
of your lost wealth: but you have found the most precious of all kinds of
riches—true friends.</p>
