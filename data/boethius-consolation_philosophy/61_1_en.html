their happiness lasts for
ever? Yet ancient times are full—and the present times are full,
too—of examples of kings whose happiness changed to misfortune. O
a fine power indeed, that is discovered to be insufficient even for its own
preservation! If this power over kingdoms does produce happiness, would it
not lessen that happiness and introduce misery if it were lacking in any
respect? But however widely any human empires may extend, there must always
be many nations left which any particular king does not rule. Now wherever
the power that makes kings happy ends, there their lack of power creeps in
and makes them miserable; in this way, then, kings must have a larger share
of misery than happiness. Knowing by experience the dangers of his own

afraid of others than they of him? Or him whose show of power depends on a
crowd of courtiers? Well, need I say anything about the companions of kings,
when I have shown that kingship itself is full of such weakness? For
courtiers are cast down often both when kingly power is secure and when it
is overthrown. Nero forced Seneca, his old companion and teacher, to choose
