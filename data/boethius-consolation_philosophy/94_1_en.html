<span class="line">When your quick mind has put them on,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">It looks down on the hated earth,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Passes beyond the sphere of measureless air,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">And looks back at the clouds</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">And climbs beyond the highest point of fire</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">That burns with the rapid motion of the upper air,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL074_317_a" id="target_note_LCL074_317_a"><sup>a</sup></a></span><span class="linebreak"></span>

<span class="line">And join its path to Phoebus’,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Or go along the road with the cold old god,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Squire to his shining star,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Or where the glittering night is painted forth</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Turn with the circling stars;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Then when it is satisfied with all so far achieved,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">It leaves the furthest pole,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">And stands on the outside of the swift upper air,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Mastering its awful light.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Here the lord of kings his sceptre holds,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Controls the reins of the world,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">And guides its swift chariot, though himself unmoved,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">The shining master of the universe.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">If the road bring you back, returning to this place,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Which you now seek, forgetful,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">“This,” you will say, “I remember, is my
native land,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Here I was born, here shall I halt my step.”</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">But if you like to look upon</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Earth’s night that you have left,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Those tyrants wretched peoples fear as fierce</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">You will see as exiles.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>

and beyond which is the empyrean, the abode of God. The
“star-bearing houses” are the twelve mansions of
the zodiac, the twelve sections of the ecliptic through which the sun
moves in the year; the “cold old god” is Saturn,
