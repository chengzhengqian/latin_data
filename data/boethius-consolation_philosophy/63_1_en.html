<p>For too many men have often acquired a great reputation because of the
mistaken notions of the mob—and what can be imagined baser that
that? For those who are much talked about, but mistakenly, must surely blush
to hear their own praises. Even if such praises are won by deserts, what
will they have added to the self-knowledge of a wise man who measures his
own good not by gossip of the populace but by the truth of that
self-knowledge? But if to have had even one’s reputation spread
abroad seems fair, then it follows that for it not to have been so widely
spread must be adjudged foul. But since, as I showed just now, there must be
many nations which the reputation of one man cannot reach, it happens that
the man you think glorious may seem inglorious in the very next-door region
of the earth.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL074_255_a" id="target_note_LCL074_255_a"><sup>a</sup></a> But here I may say that I do not think
popular favour even worth mentioning; it neither proceeds from judgement nor
ever firmly endures. But now who does not see how empty and vain a thing is
a reputation for nobility? If it is related to fame, it belongs to another:
for nobility seems to be a kind of praise deriving from the deserts of
one’s parents. Now if being talked about produces fame, then
those must be famous who are talked about; wherefore the fame of others, if
you have none of your own, does not make you renowned. But if there is
anything good in nobility, I think it is this only, that there seems to be
an obligation imposed on the noble not to let it degenerate from the virtue
of their ancestors.</p>
