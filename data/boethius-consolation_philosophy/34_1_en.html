on what the greatest happiness
really turns. Is anything more precious to you than yourself? Nothing, you
will agree. If therefore you are in possession of yourself, you will possess
that which you will never wish to lose, and which fortune cannot take away
from you. Now to see that happiness cannot consist in the fortuitous things
of this mortal life, look at it in this way. If happiness is the highest
good of a rational nature, and that cannot be the highest good which can in
any way be taken away—because clearly that which cannot be taken
away is higher—then surely the instability of fortune cannot
aspire to the attainment of happiness. Again, he who is borne up on this
fallible happiness must either know or not know that it is changeable. If he
does not know, can his state truly be a happy one in such blind ignorance?
If he does know, he must fear that he may lose that which he knows can be
lost, and his continual fear will prevent him being happy. Or does he think
that when he does lose it, it does not matter? Then it must be an
insignificant little good the loss of which he can bear so calmly! Now since
you are still the same man who was deeply convinced by many proofs, as I
know, that the minds of men are by no means mortal, and since it is obvious
that the fortuitous happiness of the body is ended by death, you cannot now
doubt that if such bodily pleasure can bring happiness, yet every kind of
mortal thing falls into misery in the end, at death. But if we know that
many have sought the enjoyment of happiness not simply through death but
even through pain and suffering, how can this present life make them happy,
when its being past does not make them miserable?</p>
