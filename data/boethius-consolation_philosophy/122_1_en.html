<span class="line">If you would see, with pure discerning mind,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">The lofty Thunderer’s laws,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Look up to the heights of the topmost heaven;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">There the stars keep their ancient peace</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">In the just compact of the universe.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">The sun with his red fire roused does not detain</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Phoebe’s cold chariot,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Nor does the Bear, who turns his rapid course</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">About the highest pole of the universe,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Ever in western deeps submerged—</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Although he sees the other stars sink down—</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Desire to plunge his flames in Ocean’s waves.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Always with fair exchange of time</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Vesper announces late the shades of night</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">And Lucifer brings back the kindly day.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">So mutual love renews eternal møtions,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">So from those star-strewn regions</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Discordant war is banished.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Concord these elements regulates</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">In equal measures, that the warring wet</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">In turn yield place to dry,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">And cold joins faith with flames.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">The hanging fire rises on high</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">And heavy earth sinks down beneath its weight.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">These are the causes why in the warmth of spring</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">The year in flower breathes out its lovely scents,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Hot summer dries the corn,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Autumn heavy with fruits returns,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">And falling rain waters the winter earth.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">This due proportion nourishes and brings forth</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">All things that breathe their life on earth,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
