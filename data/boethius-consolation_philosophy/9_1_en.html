you must lay bare the
wound.” So I gathered my strength of mind and said:
“Do you really still need to ask? Is my harsh treatment at
fortune’s hands not obvious enough? Are you not affected by the
very appearance of this room? Do you not recognize the library, which you
once chose for yourself as a secure dwelling-place in my
house—the very room in which you used often to sit with me
discoursing on the knowledge of all things human and divine? Was this how I
looked, was this my expression, when I used to seek out with you the secrets
of Nature? When with your rod you drew for me the paths of the stars? When
you shaped my character and the whole manner of my life according to
celestial models? Are these our rewards for obedient service to you? It was
you who established through the words of Plato the principle that those
states would be happy where philosophers were kings or their governors were
philosophers.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL074_147_a" id="target_note_LCL074_147_a"><sup>a</sup></a> You, through that same Plato, told us that
this was why philosophers must involve themselves in political affairs, lest
the rule of nations be left to the base and wicked, bringing ruin and
destruction on the good. It was in accordance with that teaching that I
chose to apply in the practice of public administration what I learned from
you in the seclusion of my private leisure. You, and God, who has set you in
the minds of philosophers, know me well, and that I undertook office with no
other motives than the common purposes of all good men. That is why there
arose serious and irreconcilable disagreements with wicked men, and, as a
consequence of keeping my conscience free, I have always maintained what is
right and lawful in spite of the fact that I offended those more powerful
than myself.</p>
