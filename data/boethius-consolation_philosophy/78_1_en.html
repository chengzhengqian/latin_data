itself either in reality or by some
resemblance cannot by any means be sought after. And on the other hand,
those things which are not good by nature, provided they seem so, are sought
as though they were really good. That is why it is rightly held that the
chief or cardinal cause of all things sought after is goodness. Now the
cause for which a thing is sought is seen to be most greatly desired, as for
example if a man wanted to ride for the sake of his health, he does not so
much desire the motion of riding, but the effect, health. Therefore, since
all things are sought after for the sake of good, they are not so much
desired by all as the good itself. But we have granted that that for which
the rest are desired is happiness; so in the same way, only happiness is
sought after. From this it clearly appears that the substance of goodness
and of happiness is one and the same.”</p>
<p>“I see no reason why anyone could disagree,” I
said.</p>
<p>“But we have shown that God and true happiness are one and the
same.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” I said.</p>
<p>“We may therefore safely conclude that the substance of God too is
established in goodness itself and nowhere else.</p>
