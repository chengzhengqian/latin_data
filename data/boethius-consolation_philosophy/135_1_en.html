know something will be, then that
necessarily will be so; and so it happens that the occurrence of a thing
foreknown cannot be avoided. Lastly, if a man think a thing to be otherwise
than it is, that is not only not knowledge, but it is a mistaken opinion
very different indeed from the truth of knowledge. And therefore if
something is future in such a way that its occurrence is not certain or
necessary, how will it be possible for it to be foreknown that it will
occur? For just as real knowledge is unmixed with falsity, so that which is
grasped by knowledge cannot be otherwise than as it is grasped. For the real
reason why knowledge lacks any falsehood is that every single thing must
necessarily be just as knowledge comprehends it to be.</p>
<p>Well then, how does God foreknow that these uncertain things shall be? For if
he thinks those things will inevitably occur which it is yet possible may
not occur, he is mistaken, which it is not only impious to think but still
more impious to say aloud. But if he sees that those future things are just
as indeed they are, so that he knows that they can equally either happen or
not happen, what sort of foreknowledge is this, that grasps nothing certain,
nothing stable? Or how does it compare with that ridiculous prophecy of
Tiresias?—’’ Whatever I say will either
happen or not?”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL074_399_a" id="target_note_LCL074_399_a"><sup>a</sup></a> And in what will divine providence be better
than the opinions of men, if it judges in the way men do those things to be
uncertain the occurrence of which is uncertain? But if in him, the most
certain fount of all things, there can be nothing uncertain, then the
occurrence is certain of those things which he firmly foreknows will be.</p>
<p>And therefore there is no freedom in human intentions
