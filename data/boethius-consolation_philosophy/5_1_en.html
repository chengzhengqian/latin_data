rather than complaint.” Then, gazing keenly and directly on me,
she said: “Are you the same man who was once nourished with my

think that you were ashamed, but I can see that you are quite
stupefied.” Seeing that I was not merely silent, but altogether
speechless and dumb, she gently laid her hand on my breast and said:

sickness common to deluded minds. He has for a little forgotten his real
self. He will soon recover—he did, after all, know me
before—and to make this possible for him, let me for a little
clear his eyes of the mist of mortal affairs that clouds them.”
And so saying she gathered her dress into a fold and dried my eyes, flowing
as they were with tears.</p>
