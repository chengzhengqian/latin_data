right order in fact, though in your opinion it is perverse confusion. Yet
suppose there be someone so well constituted that about him the judgement of
God and man agree together, yet he is weak in strength of mind; if anything
adverse happen to him he will perhaps cease to preserve his innocence,
because he has not been able to keep his good fortune by its means. So a
wise dispensation spares him whom adversity could make worse, lest it allow
him to be afflicted for whom it is not fitting. There is another perfect in
all virtues, a holy man and near to God; that he should be affected by any

probably from some late “Orphic” source, and
undoubtedly culled by Boethius from a Neo-platonist commentary, possibly
