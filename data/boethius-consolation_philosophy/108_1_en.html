<p>I replied that that was clear.</p>
<p>“The wicked, therefore, at the time when they are punished, have
some good added to them, that is, the penalty itself, which by reason of its
justice is good; and in the same way, when they go without punishment, they
have something further in them, the very impunity of their evil,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL074_345_a" id="target_note_LCL074_345_a"><sup>a</sup></a>
which you have admitted is evil because of its injustice.”</p>
<p>“I cannot deny it.”</p>
<p>“Therefore the wicked granted unjust impunity are much less happy
than those punished with just retribution.”</p>
<p>Then I said: “These things do indeed follow from those which were
just now concluded. But I now ask you, do you keep no punishments for souls
after the end of the body in death?”</p>
<p>“Great punishments, indeed,” she said; “some
of them I think are executed with penal harshness, but others with a
purifying clemency. But it is not my design to discuss these now.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL074_345_b" id="target_note_LCL074_345_b"><sup>b</sup></a></p>
<p>But so far we have aimed to make you recognize that the power of the wicked,
which appeared to you most intolerable, is really nothing, and to make you
see that those who you complained were unpunished never lack the punishments
due for their wickedness; and to make you learn that the licence which you
prayed might swiftly be ended is not long-lasting, but would be more unhappy
if it lasted longer, and most unhappy if it were eternal; and lastly, that
the wicked are more wretched if they are allowed to escape in unjust
impunity than if they are punished with just retribution. And it follows
from this conclusion that they are oppressed by heavier punishments
precisely when they are thought to be unpunished.”</p>
