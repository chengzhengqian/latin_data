“just as geometricians are used to draw from the theorems they
have proved what they call <span class="italic">porismata</span> (corollaries),
so I shall give you too a kind of corollary. For since men are made happy by
the acquisition of happiness, but happiness is itself divinity, it is
obvious that they are made happy by the acquisition of divinity. But as by
the acquisition of justice they become just, or by the acquisition of
wisdom, wise, so by the same argument they must, when they have acquired
divinity, become gods. Therefore every happy man is a god, though by nature
God is one only: but nothing prevents there being as many as you like by
participation.”</p>
<p>“That is both a beautiful and a precious thing,” I
said, “whether you prefer it to be called a <span class="italic">porisma</span> or a corollary.”</p>
<p>“And yet there is nothing more beautiful than this, which reason
persuades us should be added to what we have said.”</p>
