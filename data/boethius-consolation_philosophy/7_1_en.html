the prize of a martyr’s death? And after him the crowd of
Epicureans and Stoics and the rest strove as far as they could to seize his
legacy, carrying me off protesting and struggling, as if I were part of the
booty, tearing my dress, which I wove with my own hands, and then went off
with their torn-off shreds, thinking they possessed all of me. And because
they seemed to be wearing certain bits of my dress, some were ignorantly
accepted as my servants, and were abused by the delusions of the uneducated
mob. But even if you knew nothing of Anaxagoras’ flight from
Athens, or Socrates’ draught of hemlock, or Zeno’s
sufferings, all these being foreign events, surely you could have thought of
Canius and Seneca and Soranus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL074_143_aa" id="target_note_LCL074_143_aa"><sup>a</sup></a> whose stories
are neither ancient nor obscure? The only cause of their deaths was that
they were brought up in my ways, so that their behaviour and pursuits were
seen to be utterly different from those of wicked men. So it is no wonder if
we are buffeted by storms blustering round us on the sea of this life, since
we are especially bound to anger the wicked. Though their forces are large,
yet we should hold them in contempt, for they are leaderless and are simply
carried hither and thither at random in their crazed ignorance. If ever they
range against us and press about us too strongly, Wisdom our captain
withdraws her forces into her citadel, while our enemies busy themselves
ransacking useless baggage. But we are safe from all their mad tumult and
from our heights we can laugh at
