place of exile, is home to those who live here. So nothing is miserable
unless you think so, and on the other hand a man who bears all with
contentment, finds every state a happy one. Who is so happy that once he
gives in to discontent he would not choose to change his condition? How many
bitter troubles spoil with their spattering the sweetness of a
man’s happiness! A happiness which even if it seem pleasant to a
