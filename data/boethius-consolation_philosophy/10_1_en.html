<p>How often did I stand in the way of Conigastus when he was trying to rob some
weaker man of his wealth! How often did I frustrate Trigguilla, the Provost
of the Royal Household, in committing some injustice—or even when
he had actually committed it!<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL074_149_a" id="target_note_LCL074_149_a"><sup>a</sup></a> How often did I
protect poor wretches harassed with countless malicious charges by the
constant and unchecked avarice of barbarians, though the exercise of my
authority involved me in great dangers. No-one has ever turned me aside from
the right, to commit injustice. That the fortunes of provincial families
were ruined both by robbery by individuals and by taxation by the state
grieved me no less than it did those who suffered so. When in a time of
grievous famine it seemed there was to be by order a terrible and quite
indefensible compulsory purchase of supplies which would have reduced the
province of Campania to destitution, I took up the fight with the Praetorian
Prefect for the sake of the common good, I fought against the enforcement of
the purchase before the king, and I won.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL074_149_ba" id="target_note_LCL074_149_ba"><sup>b</sup></a> The wealth of
Paulinus, a man of consular rank, which had already in their ambitious hope
been all but devoured by those dogs of the court, I snatched even from their
gaping jaws. To prevent Albinus, another man of consular rank, being
punished for a crime of which he was found guilty before being tried, I made
an enemy of his accuser Cyprian. Ought I not to have been satisfied with the
amount of strong feeling I stirred up against myself? But surely I ought to
have been that much the more safe with the others, since in my regard for
justice I kept no favours

obtained by compulsory purchase; under later emperors it was strictly
limited by law except in the province of Thrace, where taxation yielded
insufficient revenue. It was clearly open to abuse in the hands of
