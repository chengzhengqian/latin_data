charged with some crime, he is
thought to deserve all that he suffers. So I now, deprived of all my goods,
stripped of my honours, and the object of evil gossip, am punished for my
good service. And I seem to see the wicked in their factories of crime
wallowing in their evil delight, all the corrupt now plotting new false
accusations, while good men cower in fear, terrified by what has happened to

impunity, to greater crimes by their rewards; and the innocent are deprived
not only of safety but even of the chance to defend themselves. So I am

<span class="line">O Maker of the circle of the stars,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Seated on your eternal throne,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Spinner of the whirling heavens,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Binding the constellations by your law—</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">As at one time the shining moon with crescent full,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Reflecting all the sun her brother’s fire.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Hides all the lesser stars,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">And at another closer to Phoebus pales</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">And loses all her light, her crescent dark;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Or when, at fall of night,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Venus, as evening star, arises cold,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">And then, as morning star, paling at sunrise,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Changes again her long-accustomed role;—</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">You with the winter’s cold when leaves pour down</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Draw in the short day’s light;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">You when the summer comes aflame</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Hasten the passing of the night’s swift hours.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">The changing year is ordered by your power,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">So that the leaves the north wind strips away</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
