<span class="line">You do not spread your hidden nets on mountains high</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">To enrich your feast with fish,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Nor if it please you hunt roe-deer</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Do you search Tyrrhenian seas.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Rather indeed men know the deep retreats</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Hidden by the waves of the sea,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">What waters more abound in snowy pearls,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Which in red murices,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">As too which shores provide the tender fish</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Or the prickly sea-urchin.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">But where the good that they desire may hide,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">They blindly ignorant remain,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">And that which passes far beyond the starry pole</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Sunk in the earth they seek.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">What curse can I invoke on such stupid minds?</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Let them strive for wealth and honours, and then</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">When they have gained false goods with labour great,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Let them recognize true goods.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>

<h3>IX</h3>
<p>Now let what I have so far shown you of the shape of false happiness suffice:
if you look at that properly and thoroughly, the right order now is to show
you what true happiness is.”</p>
<p>“Indeed I see,” I said, “that sufficiency
cannot be obtained through wealth, nor power through kingship, nor respect
through office, nor fame through glory, nor joy through
pleasures.”</p>
<p>“And have you also grasped the reasons why this is
so?”</p>
<p>“I think I glimpse them as it were through a narrow crack, but I
should prefer to learn of them more plainly from you.”</p>
