them. Or will I alone be not allowed to exercise my rights? The sky may
bring forth clear days, and then hide them in the darkness of night; the
year may weave a crown of flowers and fruits for the face of the earth, and
then confuse and obscure her features with rain and frost; the sea has a
right to smile with a smooth stillness, and then shudder and rise with
storms and great waves. But I, shall I be bound by the insatiable desire of
men to a constancy quite foreign to my nature? For this is my nature, this
is my continual game: turning my wheel swiftly I delight to bring low what
is on high, to raise high what is down. Go up, if you will, but on this
condition, that you do not really think it a wrong to have to go down again
whenever the course of my sport demands. You were hardly unaware in my ways!
Did you not know the story of Croesus, the king of the Lydians; how he, not
long before such a terror to Cyrus, was soon wretchedly given over to be
burnt, but saved by a shower from heaven?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL074_183_a" id="target_note_LCL074_183_a"><sup>a</sup></a> Have you
forgotten how Aemilius Paulus, good man that he was, shed tears over the
fate of King Perses, whom he had captured?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL074_183_b" id="target_note_LCL074_183_b"><sup>b</sup></a> What else is the
cry of tragedy but a lament that happy states are overthrown by the
indiscriminate blows of fortune? Did you not learn as a youth that on
Jupiter’s threshold there stand “two jars, the evils
in one, the blessings in the other”?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL074_183_c" id="target_note_LCL074_183_c"><sup>c</sup></a> Suppose you have
had more than your share of the goods; suppose I have not altogether
deserted you; and suppose that this very changeableness of mine is a fair
cause for you to hope for better things to come: still you must neither pine
away, nor, set as you are in a kingdom which embraces all men, desire to
live under a law peculiar to yourself.</p>
