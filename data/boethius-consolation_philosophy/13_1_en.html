good men and of the whole Senate should want to destroy me also, whom they
saw fighting for good men and the Senate. But surely I deserved differently
from the Senators themselves? You remember, I expect, since you yourself
were with me directing all my words and actions, how when the king<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL074_155_a" id="target_note_LCL074_155_a"><sup>a</sup></a>
at Verona tried to shift on to the whole Senatorial order the charge of
treason laid against Albinus, since he was eager to do away with them all, I
defended the innocence of the whole Senate with complete disregard for my
own peril. You know that I mention this simply as the truth, not because I
ever wished to sing my own praises; for the secret, mental satisfaction of
self approval is in some way lessened if a man by revealing the deed reaps
the reward of its being talked about by others. But you see what the result
of my innocence has been: instead of being rewarded for the good I did, I am
punished for the evil I did not do. Was there ever any crime the clear
admission of which made the judges so unanimously severe that none was moved
to moderation either by the fallibility of man’s mind or by that
uncertainty of fortune common to all mortals? If I were accused of trying to
burn down a temple or of sacrilegiously murdering priests, or of contriving
the deaths of all good men, I should be punished, and rightly—but
only having been present and tried, and either having confessed or been
found guilty. But now I am condemned to death, my goods confiscate, for too
zealously supporting the Senate, although I am nearly five hundred miles
away and unable to speak in my own defence. Ah me! Surely I deserved that no
one could possibly be convicted on a charge like this!</p>
