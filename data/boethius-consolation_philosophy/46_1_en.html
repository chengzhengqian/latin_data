there can never be any proportion between the finite and the infinite.
That is why however long a time fame last, if it is thought of in the
context of boundless eternity, it is clearly seen to be, not small, but
nothing at all. Yet <span class="italic">you</span> do not know how to act
rightly unless you are favoured by the changing winds of popularity and
empty rumour, and ignoring the excellence of the knowledge of your own
virtue, you ask for the rewards of the common chatter of other men. Hear now
how one man joked about the triviality of this kind of arrogance. He had
insultingly attacked a man who had falsely assumed the title of philosopher,
not for the practice of true virtue but simply from vanity, to increase his
own glory; and he added that he would know he was really a philosopher if he
bore all the injuries heaped upon him calmly and patiently. The other
adopted a patient manner for a time and bore the insults, and then said
tauntingly: “Now do you recognize that I am a
philosopher?” To which the first very cuttingly replied:
“I should have, had you kept silent.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL074_221_aa" id="target_note_LCL074_221_aa"><sup>a</sup></a> But what
has fame to offer men of the best sort—for these are the ones we
are talking about, whose means to glory has been their
virtue—what indeed, I ask, after death has finally destroyed the
body? If men wholly perish (which our arguments in fact forbid us to
believe), glory is really nothing at all, since he to whom it is said to
belong will no longer exist. If however a mind fully aware of its own
nature, loosed from its earthly prison, is free to seek its heavenly home,
will it not despise all earthly affairs, and in the joy of heaven rejoice to
be freed from earthly things?</p>
