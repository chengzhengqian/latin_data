<p>“What is that?” I asked.</p>
<p>“That the wicked,” she answered, “are
happier being punished than if the penalty required by justice did not
constrain them. And I am not now labouring a point that might occur to
anyone’s mind, that wicked behaviour is corrected by retribution
and brought back to the right way by fear of punishment, and that it is also
an example to others that they should avoid anything blameworthy; but that
it is in another way, I think, that the wicked are more unhappy if
unpunished, even if no account were to be taken of correction, no regard
paid to example.”</p>
<p>“And what will be that other way,” I asked,
“besides these?”</p>
<p>And she answered: “Have we not granted that the good are happy,
the wicked wretched?”</p>
<p>“We have,” I said.</p>
<p>“Now if,” she said, “to the wretchedness of
any man some good were added, is he not happier than the man whose
wretchedness is uniquely pure with no admixture of good?”</p>
<p>“So it seems,” I said.</p>
<p>“Suppose to that same wretched man, who lacks every good, there
should have been added another evil besides those because of which he is
wretched, is he not to be considered far less happy than he whose misfortune
is relieved by some share in the good?”</p>
<p>“Surely,” I said.</p>
<p>“But it is obviously just for the wicked to be punished, and
unjust for them to escape unpunished.”</p>
<p>“Who would deny it?”</p>
<p>“But neither will anyone deny <span class="italic">this</span>,” she said, “that everything that is just
is good, and on the other hand whatever is unjust is evil.”</p>
