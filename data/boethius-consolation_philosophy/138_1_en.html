<p>Then she said: “That is the old complaint about providence, one
powerfully dealt with by Cicero when he was classifying kinds of
divination,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL074_405_a" id="target_note_LCL074_405_a"><sup>a</sup></a> and a matter for a very long time and deeply
investigated by yourself; but it has so far been by no means sufficiently
carefully or steadfastly developed by any of you. The cause of this
obscurity is that the movement of human reasoning cannot approach the
simplicity of divine foreknowledge; if that could by any means be conceived,
no doubt whatever will remain. And I shall try to make clear and explain
this only when I have first considered those things by which you are now
troubled. For I ask, why do you think that explanation of those solving the
problem less than effectual which, since it considers that foreknowledge is
not the cause of any necessity for future events, thinks the freedom of the
will not at all restricted by foreknowledge? For you, surely, do not produce
proof of the necessity of future things other than from the fact that those
things that are foreknown cannot not happen? Then if foreknowledge imposes
no necessity on future things, which you did indeed admit a little while
ago, what is the reason why the outcome of those things dependent on the
will should be forced to end in a certain result?</p>
