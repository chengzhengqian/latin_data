passing away; the only reason for God’s creation is the
outpouring of good, since the Form of the Good is in him, a Good lacking
all grudging spirit (the “envy of the gods,”
ϕθόνος
θεῶν, their grudging nature,
was a commonplace among the Greeks). God creates on the pattern of the
eternal Forms, which for the Neo-platonists and their Christian
followers were in the mind of God.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL074_273_a').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL074_273_b"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL074_273_b" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">b</sup>Soul’s nature is threefold: God took the eternal Same, and the
changing Other, and forced the two into union to produce their harmony,
Being; and then of these three fashioned Soul. All movement is caused by
Soul, the only self-mover, or by its parts, which are harmonious since
they too are formed of the same three elements, Same, Other and
Being.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL074_273_b').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL074_273_c"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL074_273_c" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">c</sup>The two circles into which the divided Soul is bent are the celestial
