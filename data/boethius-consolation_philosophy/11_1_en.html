safety. Who are the accusers, then, by whom I have been brought down? One of
them, Basil, once in the king’s service but dismissed, was forced
to denounce me because of his burden of debts.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL074_151_a" id="target_note_LCL074_151_a"><sup>a</sup></a> Two others were
Opilio and Gaudentius: on account of their many different frauds they were
condemned to exile by the king’s judgement, but they refused to
obey and took sanctuary in a temple. When the king learned of this he
ordered that unless they left Ravenna by a certain date they should be
branded on the forehead and driven out. Could they possibly have been more
severely treated? And yet on that very date the accusation against me was
lodged, with their names on it! I ask you! Was that the reward my exercise
of office had earned? Did their previous conviction make them just accusers?
Was fortune not the least bit ashamed, if not that innocence was thus
accused, at least that the accusers were so base?</p>
<p>Do you want to know what, in a word, was the charge against me? That I wanted
to preserve the Senate. And how did I do that? I am charged with preventing
those accusers from bringing forward proofs whereby the Senate might have
been convicted of treason. What then do you think, Lady? Shall I deny the
charge, so as not to cause you to be ashamed of me? But I did want the
Senate to be preserved, nor shall I ever cease to want it so. Shall I then
confess to the charge? But the chance of hindering their accuser has now
passed. Shall I call it wrong to have wanted the preservation of the
Senatorial order? That order had itself made it wrong, by its decrees
against me. But self-deceiving ignorance cannot change the true worth of
anything,
