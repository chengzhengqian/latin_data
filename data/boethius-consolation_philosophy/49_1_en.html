<span class="line indent2">In regular harmony</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">The world moves through its changes;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">Seeds in competition with each other</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">Are held in balance by eternal law;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">Phoebus brings rosy dawns</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">In his golden chariot</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">That his sister Phoebe may rule the nights</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">That Hesperus brings;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">The waves of the greedy sea</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">Are kept within fixed bounds,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">Nor may the land move out</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">And extend its limits.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">What binds all things to order,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">Governing earth and sea and sky,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">Is love.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">If love’s rein slackened</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">All things now held by mutual love</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">At once would fall to warring with each other</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">Striving to wreck that engine of the world</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">Which now they drive</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">In mutual trust with motion beautiful.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">And love joins peoples too</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">By a sacred bond,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">And ties the knot of holy matrimony</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">That binds chaste lovers,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">Joins too with its law</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">All faithful comrades.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">O happy race of men,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">If the love that rules the stars</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">May also rule your hearts!”</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
