the truth or admit to falsehood. But what the truth of the matter is, I
leave to your judgement and to that of philosophers; though so that the true
details of this affair cannot lie concealed from later generations, I have
written it down to be remembered. For what is the point of talking about
those forgeries in which I am accused of having striven for Roman liberty?
Their falsity would have been evident for all to see, had I been allowed to
use the confessions of my accusers themselves, for this always has most
influence in all such matters as these. What freedom can now be hoped for?
Would there were any! Then I should have replied with the words of Canius:
when he was said by Caligula to have been aware of a conspiracy against his
person, he replied: ‘Had I known of it, you would
not.’ In this affair, grief has not so far blunted my sense that
I complain that wicked men have tried to do evil to virtue, but rather I am
amazed that they have succeeded in their hopes. For although it is perhaps a
