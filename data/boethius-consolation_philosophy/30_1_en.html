hopes and expectations of the mob crowding round
you? I suppose you made fine phrases for fortune then, when she caressed and
cuddled you as her darling! You received such a gift as she had never before
bestowed on a private citizen. Do you want to reckon up your account with
her? Now is the first time she has glanced grudgingly on you. If you weighed
up the number and the kinds of joyful and sad things that have happened to
you, you could not deny that up to now you have been fortunate. And if you
now think yourself unfortunate, because the things that then seemed joyful
to you are passed away, that is really no reason why you should think
yourself wretched, for those things that you now think so miserable also
pass away. Do you now enter on the stage of this life for the first time, a
newcomer and a stranger? Do you think there is some constancy in human
affairs, when man himself is so swiftly removed from the scene by flying
time? Even if a man can, very rarely, rely on the gifts of fortune remaining
with him, yet the last day of his life is a death also for what fortune does
remain. Do you think it matters, then, whether you leave fortune behind by
dying, or she leaves you?</p>
