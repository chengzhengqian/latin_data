<span class="line">With impressed letters.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">But if the mind, with the strength of its proper</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">motions,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Nothing unfolds,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">But merely passive lies</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Subject to other bodies’ marks,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">And like a mirror but reflects</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">The empty images of things,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Whence then this all-discerning common concept’s</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">strength</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">In the minds of men?</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">What power singulars perceives,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Or what power all things known divides?</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Things thus divided what collects again,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">And taking either way in turn</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Now lifts its head to highest things</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">And now to lowest things descends,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Then to itself returning</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Falsehood refutes with truth?</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">This is an efficient cause</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">More powerful by far</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Than that which passively receives</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Only the impressed marks on things material.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Yet there precedes,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">To stir and move the powers of the mind,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Emotive movement in the living body,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">As when light strikes the eyes,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Or a cry in the ears resounds.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Then the mind’s wakened power,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Calling upon these forms it holds within</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">To similar motions,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Applies them to the marks received from without</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">And joins those images</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">To the forms hidden within.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
