those things necessarily coming to be and those not necessarily coming to
be, just as you, when you see at one and the same time that a man is walking
on the ground and that the sun is rising in the sky, although the two things
are seen simultaneously, yet you distinguish them, and judge the first to be
voluntary, the second necessary. So then the divine perception looking down
on all things does not disturb at all the quality of things that are present
indeed to him but future with reference to imposed conditions of time. So it
is that it is not opinion but a knowledge grounded rather upon truth, when
he knows that something is going to happen, something which he is also aware
lacks all necessity of happening.</p>
<p>If at this point you were to say that what God sees is going to occur cannot
not occur, and that what cannot not occur happens from necessity, and so
bind me to this word “necessity,” I will admit that
this is a matter indeed of the firmest truth, but one which scarcely anyone
except a theologian could tackle. For I shall say in answer that the same
future event, when it is related to divine knowledge, is necessary, but when
it is considered in its own nature it seems to be utterly and absolutely
free. For there are really two necessities, the one simple, as that it is
necessary that all men are mortal; the other conditional, as for example, if
you know that someone is walking, it is necessary that he is walking.
Whatever anyone knows cannot be otherwise than as it is known, but this
conditional necessity by no means carries with it that other simple kind.
For this sort of necessity is not caused by a thing’s proper
nature but by the addition of the condition; for no necessity forces him to
go who walks of his own will, even
