is even thrown down and trodden under the feet
of wicked men and pays the penalty in place of vice. That this should happen

more dreadful than any evil omens if, as you think, as it were in the most
well arranged house of so great a master the worthless vessels were
cherished while the precious ones were allowed to get filthy. But it is not
so; for if those conclusions we have just now reached are preserved and not
overthrown, by the help of that same God of whose kingdom we are now
speaking you will learn that the good are always powerful, while the bad are
always abject and weak, nor are vices ever without punishment, nor virtues
without reward; that success attends the good and misfortune the wicked, and
many things of this kind, which will settle your complaints and strengthen
you firmly and solidly. And since I have just shown you and you have seen
the form of true blessedness, and also recognized wherein it is placed, when
we have run through all those things I think it necessary to set out first,
I shall show you the way which will bring you back home. And I shall affix
to your mind wings, whereby it may raise itself aloft, so that with all
disturbance dispelled, you may return safely to your homeland, under my
guidance, on my path, and in my carriage.</p>
