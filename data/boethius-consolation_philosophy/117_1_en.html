start from beginnings in immovable providence must also be themselves
immutable. For things are governed in the best way if the simplicity which
rests in the divine mind produces an inflexible order of causes, and this
order constrains with its own immutability things which are mutable and
would otherwise be in random flux.</p>
<p>So it is that although all things may seem confused and disordered to you,
unable as you are to contemplate this order, nevertheless their own measure
directing them towards the good disposes them all. For there is nothing
which is done for the sake of evil, even by the wicked themselves; they, as
has been very fully demonstrated, are turned aside by perverse error as they
seek the good, far from it being that order, proceeding from the centre of
the highest good, which turns them aside in any direction from the
beginning. But, you will say, what confusion could possibly be more unfair
