naturally outstanding, but not yet brought to the perfecting of their
virtues to their finished condition: namely the desire for glory and the
reputation of having deserved well of the state. How unsubstantial that
glory is, how totally without weight, you may learn in this way. You have
learned from astronomical proofs<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL074_217_a" id="target_note_LCL074_217_a"><sup>a</sup></a> that the whole

inhabited by living things known to us. If in your imagination you subtract
