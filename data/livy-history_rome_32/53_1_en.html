<p>The Achaeans requested the return of Corinth and Argos. The Achaean praetor,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL295_265_145" id="target_note_LCL295_265_145"><sup>145</sup></a> Phaeneas, made much the same demands as had the Romans, namely Philip’s withdrawal from Greece and the restoration to the Aetolians of the cities formerly under their jurisdiction and control.
