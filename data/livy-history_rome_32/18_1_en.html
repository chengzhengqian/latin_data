<p>13. The following day the consul tracked his enemy through the gorge through which the river winds down the valley. As for the king, he reached the Camp of Pyrrhus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL295_195_46" id="target_note_LCL295_195_46"><sup>46</sup></a> on the first day (the area bearing this name is in Triphylia, in the territory of Molossis), and on the next he made it as far as the Lyncus mountains<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL295_195_47" id="target_note_LCL295_195_47"><sup>47</sup></a>—an enormous march for an army, but fear was driving them on.

Homeowners were granted the right to take with them from their houses all the possessions they could, and what remained became the booty of the common soldier. These people suffered everything—no cruel treatment inflicted by an enemy could have surpassed what they endured at the hands of their allies. Philip found these steps repugnant even as he was taking them, but he wanted at least to rescue his allies as living beings from a land that was soon to be his enemies.’ As a result the towns of Phacium, Piresiae, Euhydrium, Eretria, and Palaepharsalus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL295_195_49" id="target_note_LCL295_195_49"><sup>49</sup></a> were destroyed.
