instructed to establish a board of three to investigate the case. Elected to the board were Publius and Sextus Aelius, both bearing the <span class="italic">cognomen</span> Paetus, and Gnaeus Cornelius Lentulus. When the people of Cosa<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL295_167_16" id="target_note_LCL295_167_16"><sup>16</sup></a> requested the same concession that had been granted to the people of Narnia, namely an increase in the number of colonists, they were not successful.</p>
<p>3. All essential business finished at Rome, the consuls set off for their provinces. Arriving in Macedonia, Publius Villius faced a horrendous mutiny of the troops that had been fomented some time before but not suppressed with sufficient firmness at the start. It involved 2,000 men who had been transported from Africa after Hannibalâ€™s defeat, first to Sicily and from there as volunteers to Macedon about a year later. The men claimed that this had been done against their will and that they had been press-ganged aboard the ships by the tribunes. But whatever the case, they said, whether their service there had been under duress or voluntary, it was now over, and it was only fair that some limit be set to their military service. They had not seen Italy in many a year; they had grown old under arms in Sicily, Africa, and Macedonia; and they were now exhausted from toil and exertion, and drained of blood from all the wounds they had received. The consul admitted that they appeared to have acceptable grounds for seeking demobilization, if these were presented in a reasonable way, but added that neither this nor any other case was sufficiently strong as to warrant mutiny. So if they were prepared to remain at their posts and obey orders, he would write to the senate about their demobilization, and they would more easily gain their end by moderate behavior than by pigheadedness.</p>
