who has deserved well of us all. He would not demand of us what could not be done, would he? The Peloponnese is a peninsula, joined to the mainland by the narrow strip of the Isthmus, and it is above all exposed and vulnerable to naval attack. Suppose a hundred decked ships, fifty lighter open-decked vessels, and thirty Issaean cutters begin to conduct raids on our seacoast and attack the cities that are exposed to them, practically right on the shoreline. We shall retreat into our inland cities, shall we—as though we were not burning with an internal war, one clinging to our vitals? When Nabis and the Spartans put pressure on us by land, and the Roman fleet by sea, what will be the point of calling upon the king’s treaty and Macedonian protection?<span class="bold"> </span>Are we ourselves going to use our own arms against the Roman enemy to protect the cities that will be attacked? A fine job we did of protecting Dymae in the last war!<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL295_227_91" id="target_note_LCL295_227_91"><sup>91</sup></a> The misfortunes of others offer enough in the way of object lessons for us; let us not search for a way for us to be a lesson to others!</p>

Of course it is because they are compelled by fear and because they are pinned down in a foreign land that they come running to you for the protection of your alliance, since they want to lurk in the shade of your assistance, have shelter in your harbors, and access to supplies. No! They have the sea in their power, and whatever lands they reach they immediately bring under their control. What they are asking of you they can take by force. Because they wish to spare you, they are not allowing you to commit a self-destructive act.
