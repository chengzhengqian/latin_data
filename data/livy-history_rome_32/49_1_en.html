<p>At the start of the battle the consul made a vow of a temple to Juno Sospita should the enemy be defeated and routed on that day. A shout went up from his men, who declared that they would oblige him to discharge the vow, and the assault was then launched on the enemy. The Insubres failed to withstand the first onslaught. Some authorities claim that they were also suddenly attacked in the rear by the Cenomani when the battle was under way and were thrown into chaos on two fronts; that 35,000 of them were killed between the two lines, and 5,200 taken alive (including Hamilcar, the general of the Carthaginians,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL295_257_130" id="target_note_LCL295_257_130"><sup>130</sup></a> who had been responsible for the war); and that 130 military standards and more than &lt;. . .&gt; wagons captured. . . . &lt;towns&gt;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL295_257_131" id="target_note_LCL295_257_131"><sup>131</sup></a> of the Gauls, which had joined the uprising of the Insubrians, surrendered to the Romans.</p>

With that they abandoned their leader and their camp and dispersed through the towns, aiming to defend their own property; and thus they obliged their enemy to alter his plan of campaign. Minucius now abandoned hope of deciding the issue with a single confrontation and began once more to ravage farmlands, burn buildings, and storm towns. During this period Clastidium was put to the torch.</p>
