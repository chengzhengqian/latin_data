<p>Quinctius then set off for Corinth and came up to the gate with his Cretan cohort to make it clear to Philocles, who was in command of the city, that the tyrant had abandoned Philip. Philocles also came to confer with the Roman commander. When the Roman urged him to desert Philip immediately and deliver the city to him, Philocles so worded his reply as to appear to have postponed a decision rather than refused outright. Quinctius crossed from Corinth to Anticyra; from there he sent his brother to sound out the people of Acarnania.</p>
<p>Attalus left Sicyon for Argos. There the city augmented the former honors they had bestowed on the king with new ones; and the king, who had in the past paid an enormous sum of money to redeem the holy precinct of Apollo for the people of Sicyon, did not wish to lose a second occasion to show his generosity to a city-state that was an ally and friend. He made the city a gift of 10 talents of silver and 10,000 measures of grain. After this he returned to his fleet at Cenchreae.</p>
<p>As for Nabis, he strengthened the garrison at Argos and returned to Sparta. He had himself already despoiled the men of Argos, and he now sent his wife back to the city to despoil the women. She summoned the ladies of note, either individually or in family groups, and by a combination of flattery and menaces deprived them not only of their gold but eventually even of their clothing and all their female finery.</p>
