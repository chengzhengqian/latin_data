Sulpicius defeated him and put him to flight, and pillaged the richest part of his kingdom. Now Quinctius has driven him from his camp, although Philip held the key passes of Epirus and was confident in his geographical position, his fortifications and his army. He has pursued him in his flight into Thessaly and has stormed the royal garrisons and the cities allied to Philip virtually before the eyes of the king himself.</p>
<p>“Just suppose there is no truth in what the Athenian delegate said a moment ago about the king’s brutality, greed, and lechery. Suppose that we are indifferent to crimes he has committed in Attic territory against the gods of the upper and lower worlds, and much less concerned about the sufferings of the people of Cios and Abydus, who are far removed from us. If you like, let us forget our own wounds and forget the murders and robberies he committed in Messene in the heart of the Peloponnese; the killing of his host Chariteles at Cyparissia,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL295_225_87" id="target_note_LCL295_225_87"><sup>87</sup></a> virtually at the dinner table, in contravention of all law human and divine; the assassination of the Sicyonian father and son, both called Aratus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL295_225_88" id="target_note_LCL295_225_88"><sup>88</sup></a> (although it had even been his custom to call the hapless old man ‘father’); and his carting off to Macedonia the son’s wife<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL295_225_89" id="target_note_LCL295_225_89"><sup>89</sup></a> to satisfy his lust. And let all the other instances of rape of young girls and matrons be consigned to oblivion. Let us pretend we are not dealing with Philip, through fear of whose brutality you have all been left speechless—for what other reason can there be for your silence after you have been summoned to this meeting? Let us suppose instead our debate is with Antigonus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL295_225_90" id="target_note_LCL295_225_90"><sup>90</sup></a> a most compassionate and fair-minded king
