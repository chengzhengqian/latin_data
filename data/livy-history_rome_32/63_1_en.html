<h3><span class="ac">SUMMARY OF BOOK XXXII</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Many prodigies are recorded that were reported from various regions, including a laurel growing on the stern of a man o’ war in Macedonia. The consul Titus Quinctius Flamininus fought with success against Philip in the gorges of Epirus, put him to flight and forced him to fall back to his kingdom. Flamininus himself, with the Aetolians and Athamanians as his allies, conducted raids on Thessaly, which abuts Macedonia, and the consul’s brother, Lucius Quinctius Flamininus, aided by King Attalus and the Rhodians, did so on Euboea and the coast with naval operations. The Achaeans were accepted in an alliance. The number of praetors was increased, so that six were elected. A slave revolt, the aim of which was the release of the Carthaginian hostages, was put down and 2,500 were put to death. The consul Cornelius Cethegus put the Insubrian Gauls to flight in pitched battle. A treaty was made with the Lacedaemonians and Nabis their tyrant. In addition, there is an account of the storming of cities in Macedonia.</p>
