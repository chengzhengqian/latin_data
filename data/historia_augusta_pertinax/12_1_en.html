<p>and in possession of his property, and at his death his son succeeded to the inheritance. Many men, however, claimed that Falco was unaware that men were planning to make him emperor, and others said that slaves who had falsified his accounts assailed him with trumped-up charges.</p>
<p>However, a conspiracy<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_337_1" id="target_note_LCL139_337_1"><sup>1</sup></a> was organized against Pertinax by Laetus, the prefect of the guard, and sundry others who were displeased by his integrity. Laetus regretted that he had made Pertinax emperor, because Pertinax used to rebuke him as a stupid babbler of various secrets.

But just at that moment the band of troops mentioned above arrived at the palace, and neither could they be prevented from entering nor could their entrance be announced to the Emperor.
