And while in this position, Pertinax did not avoid complicity in the murder of Commodus, when a share in this plot was offered him by the other conspirators.</p>
<p>After Commodus was slain,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_323_2" id="target_note_LCL139_323_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Laetus, the prefect of the guard, and Eclectus, the chamberlain, came to Pertinax and reassured him, and then led him to the camp. There he harangued the soldiers, promised a donative,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_323_3" id="target_note_LCL139_323_3"><sup>3</sup></a> and said that the imperial power had been thrust upon him by Laetus and Eclectus. It was pretended, moreover, that Commodus had died a natural death, chiefly because the soldiers feared that their loyalty was merely being tested. Finally, and at first by only a few, Pertinax was hailed as emperor.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_323_4" id="target_note_LCL139_323_4"><sup>4</sup></a> He was made emperor on the day before the Kalends<span class="marginNote right">31 Dec., 192</span>

Without further delay, therefore, all the magistrates, in company with the consul, came to the senate-house, and Pertinax, who had come in by night, was saluted as emperor.</p>
