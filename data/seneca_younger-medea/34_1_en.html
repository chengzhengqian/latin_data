<span class="line">I have summoned water out of rainless clouds,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">and forced the sea to its depths: Ocean withdrew</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">his heavy waves, as his tides were overpowered.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">With the laws of heaven confounded, the world has seen</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">both sun and stars together, and the Bears have touched</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">the forbidden sea. I have changed the pattern of the seasons:</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">the summer earth has frozen under my spells,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">and Ceres was compelled to see a winter harvest.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">The Phasis turned his violent stream to its source,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">and the Hister, with so many separate mouths, constrained</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">its savage waters in every branch to stillness.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Waves have crashed, the maddened seas have swelled</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">with the wind silent; the shelter of the ancient woods</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">has lost its shade at the bidding of my voice.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL062_383_39" id="target_note_LCL062_383_39"><sup>39</sup></a></span><span class="linebreak"></span>

<span class="line">For you this wreath is woven with bloodstained hand</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">and tied with serpents nine;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>

<span class="line">This holds the blood of the treacherous ferryman,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>

<span class="line">Into this ash the Oetaean pyre collapsed,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
