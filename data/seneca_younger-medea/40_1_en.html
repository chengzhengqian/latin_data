love, mad spirit, if you are satisfied with Jason wifeless. Search out some exceptional kind of punishment, and prepare yourself in this fashion now: let all right be gone, let any sense of shame be expelled; the vengeance is trivial that is gained by pure hands. Bear down on your anger, awaken your sluggish spirits, and fiercely draw out the old aggression from deep in your heart’s core. Let any deed committed so far be called love of family. I shall set to work, and make them understand how trivial, of what common stamp were the crimes I did to oblige others. Through them my pain was just practicing. What great deed could be dared by untrained hands, by the fury of a girl? Now I am Medea: my genius has grown through evils.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL062_395_43" id="target_note_LCL062_395_43"><sup>43</sup></a> I am glad, yes glad, to have torn away my brother’s head, glad to have cut up his limbs and plundered my father of his sacred hoard, glad to have armed the daughters to destroy the old man.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL062_395_44" id="target_note_LCL062_395_44"><sup>44</sup></a> Just find the means, my pain: to any crime you will bring a well-trained hand.</p>
<p>So where are you driving, my anger, what weapons are you aiming at your faithless enemy? The spirit within me has determined on some brutality, but dare not yet acknowledge it to itself. Fool, I have been too hasty! If only my enemy had some children by his mistress! No: all that is yours by him has Creusa for a mother. This path of punishment is decided on, rightly decided on. My spirit must prepare, I recognize, for its ultimate crime. Children once mine, you must pay the penalty for your father’s crimes.</p>
