turn one way and another. Where could I find revenge?

Is this sufficient for my wrongs? If Pelasgian or barbarian cities have discovered some deed that your hands do <span class="italic">not</span> know, you must prepare to do it now. Your own crimes must urge you on, every one of them must return: the famous ornament of my kingdom stolen, the criminal girl’s little companion cut apart with the sword,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL062_327_13" id="target_note_LCL062_327_13"><sup>13</sup></a> his death thrust in his father’s face, his body scattered on the sea, and the limbs of old Pelias boiled in a cauldron.

He alone must be my target, <span class="italic">he</span> must pay the penalty, as he deserves. I shall bury his home in deep ash; the black plume raised by the flames will be seen at Malea, the turning point in ships’ long detours.</p>
