<p>My heart is struck with horror, my limbs freeze, my breast trembles. Anger retreats, and the mother returns, with the wife utterly banished. Could I shed the blood of my children, my own youngsters? Do not say so, mad rage! Let that unheard-of deed, that abomination, be left untouched by me as well. What crime will the poor things pay for? The crime is having Jason as their father, and the worse crime is having Medea as their mother. Let them fall, since they are not mine; let them perish, since they are mine. They are free of guilt and blame, they are innocent, I admit: my brother was, too. Why waver, my spirit? Why are tears wetting my face, and anger pulling in one direction, love in the other? Conflicting currents whirl me from side to side. Just as, when the whirling winds wage savage warfare, the contending waves drive the seas both ways, and the waters seethe in confusion: so my heart wavers; anger puts mother love to flight, then mother love, anger. Give way to love, my pain.</p>
<p>Here, my dear young ones, sole comfort of a troubled house, bring yourselves here, hug me and press your bodies against mine. Let your father have you safe and sound, as long as your mother can have you too. But exile and flight are close. At any moment they will be snatched and torn from my embrace, in tears, in distress. Let them be lost to their father’s kisses, they are lost to their mother’s. Once more my pain grows and my hatred burns, the Erinys of old demands my reluctant hand again. Anger, where you lead, I follow. If only the throng of the proud Tantalid had issued from my womb, and I had born and mothered twice seven children! I was barren for revenge. Yet I gave birth to two, enough for my brother and my father.</p>
