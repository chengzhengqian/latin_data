<p class="noindent">Medea, that noxious child of Colchian Aeetes—is she not yet withdrawing from my realm? She is contriving something: her cunning is well known, so is her handiwork. Whom will she spare, whom will she leave untroubled? For my part I was planning to eliminate this evil infection quickly with the sword, but my son-in-law’s prayers prevailed. She has been granted life: let her free the land of fear and depart in safety.</p>
<p>She advances fiercely against me, and with a threatening air seeks closer speech. Keep her away, servants, well away from contact or access; bid her be silent. She must finally learn to endure a king’s authority. (<span class="italic">to</span> <span class="italic">Medea</span>) Depart with haste, and remove at long last a savage and fearful horror!</p>
