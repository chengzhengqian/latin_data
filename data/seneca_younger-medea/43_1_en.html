day! Depart, you have brought crime to fulfillment—but not yet so revenge: finish it, while your hands are accomplishing things. Why delay now, my spirit? Why hesitate? Has your powerful anger already flagged? I regret what I have done, I feel ashamed. What have I done, poor woman? Poor woman? Whatever my regrets, I have done it. A great sense of pleasure steals over me unbidden, and it is still growing. This was the one thing I lacked, this spectator. I think nothing has been done as yet: such crime as I did without him was wasted.</p></div><div class="sp"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">jason</span></span><p class="lineGroup noindent">Look, there she is, leaning over us from the edge of the roof.
