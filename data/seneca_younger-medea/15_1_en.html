<span class="line indent3">Not yet were the constellations known;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">there was no use</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">of the stars that embellish the heavens;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>

<span class="line indent2">avoid the rainy Hyades,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
