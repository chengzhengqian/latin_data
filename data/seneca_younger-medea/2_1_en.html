in exile, in fear, hated and homeless; may he seek out other men’s doors, by this time a notorious guest; may he long for me as his wife, and—I can make no worse prayer—for children resembling their father and resembling their mother. My revenge is born, already born: I have given birth.</p>
<p>Am I stringing together futile words and complaints? Shall I not attack my enemies? I shall dash the bridal torches from their hands, and the light from heaven. Does the Sun, the sower of my family’s seed, behold this? And is he beheld? Does he sit in his chariot and race along his usual course through an unclouded sky? Not return to the East and retraverse the day? Grant me to ride through the air in my ancestral chariot, entrust me with the reins, father, and allow me to guide the fiery steeds with blazing traces: Corinth, which blocks a pair of gulfs, must be consumed by flames and let the two seas converge.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL062_319_5a" id="target_note_LCL062_319_5a"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
