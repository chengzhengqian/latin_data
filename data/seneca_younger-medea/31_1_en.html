For after going out with frenzied steps and reaching her inner sanctum of death, she pours out her entire resources, brings forth everything that even she has long feared, and deploys all her host of evils, occult, mysterious, hidden things. Making prayers at the sinister shrine with her left hand,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL062_377_35" id="target_note_LCL062_377_35"><sup>35</sup></a> she summons all plagues produced by the sand of burning Libya, and all those locked in the everlasting snow of the Taurus, frozen by Arctic cold, and all that is monstrous. Hauled out by her magic spells, the scaly throng desert their lairs and approach. Here a fierce serpent hauls its vast body, flicks out its three-forked tongue and seeks out those it can target for death; at the sound of her spell it is mesmerized, twines its swollen body into folds upon folds, forces it into coils.</p>
<p>“Too small,” she says, “are the evils, too ordinary the weapons that earth below produces: I must seek my poisons from heaven. Now is the time to embark on something loftier than ordinary criminality. That snake must descend here who lies like a vast torrent, whose gigantic coils are felt by the two beasts,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL062_377_36" id="target_note_LCL062_377_36"><sup>36</sup></a> the greater and the less (the greater useful to Pelasgians, the less to Sidonians); Ophiuchus must finally release his gripping hands and let the venom pour out. My chants must summon Python, who dared provoke the twin deities;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL062_377_37" id="target_note_LCL062_377_37"><sup>37</sup></a> the Hydra must return, with each snake that was cut away by Hercules’ hand, renewing itself through its own laceration. You too must leave Colchis and come, unsleeping serpent, lulled for the first time by my chants.”</p>
