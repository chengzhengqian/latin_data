<h3><span class="sc">LVII.—On two Brothers</span></h3>
<p><span class="sc">Chrestus</span> and Acindynus, own brothers but hapless children, bear names which belie their unhappy qualities: neither this one is “Gracious,” nor this “Riskless.” One letter can correct them both. If Chrestus should borrow <span class="italic">alpha</span> (“ -less“), from his brother Acindynus, one will become “Risk” and his brother will be “Graceless.”</p>
<h3><span class="sc">LVIII.—On Chrestus and Acindynus who had been inappropriately named</span></h3>
<p><span class="sc">These</span> are two own brothers, Chrestus and Acindynus. Both have been wrongly named: but that both may be set right, let Acindynus give his <span class="italic">alpha</span> to Chrestus, himself remaining without <span class="italic">alpha</span>; each will be an appropriate name.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">LIX.—A Kind of Riddle on three lewd Fellows<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL115_191_1" id="target_note_LCL115_191_1"><sup>1</sup></a></span></h3>
<p>“<span class="sc">Three</span> lewd fellows in a single bed: two are practising depravity and two are suffering it.” “Why, that makes four.” “Not at all: give a role each to those on the outside and count the middle one twice: he is both active and passive.”</p>
<h3><span class="sc">LX.—On those who say “Reminisco,” which is not Latin</span></h3>
<p><span class="sc">He</span> who thinks he can say <span class="italic">reminisco</span> and speak Latin, would put <span class="italic">cor</span> where <span class="italic">co</span> is written, if he had any sense.</p>
