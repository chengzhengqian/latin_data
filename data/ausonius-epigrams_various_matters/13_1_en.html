<h3><span class="sc">XXXVI.—On Pergamus, a Runaway Scribe, who had been caught</span></h3>
<p>As lazy a scribe as a sluggish runner, thou, Pergamus, didst run away and wert caught at the first lap. Therefore thou hast felt letters<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL115_179_1" id="target_note_LCL115_179_1"><sup>1</sup></a> branded, Pergamus, upon thy face, and those which thy right hand neglected thy brow endures.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">XXXVII.—On the same Pergamus</span></h3>
<p><span class="sc">Pergamus</span>, when thou wast punished ’twas not just thy brow should bear the penalty which thy slow hands earned. Nay, do thou, their master, control thy errant limbs: it is unfair to torment those not really guilty. Either mark that right-hand which will not make a mark, or shackle those errant feet with an iron weight.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">XXXVIII.—On Myron who asked Laïs for an Assignation<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL115_179_2" id="target_note_LCL115_179_2"><sup>2</sup></a></span></h3>
<p><span class="sc">Hoar</span>-<span class="sc">headed</span> Myron asked Laïs for an assignation, and was refused outright: he understood the cause, and dyed his white poll with black soot. In face—though not in hair—the selfsame Myron, he begged what he had begged before. But she, contrasting his features with his hair, and thinking him like, though not the same (perchance even thinking him the same, but wishing to enjoy the jest), thus addressed the artful gallant: “Fool, why askest thou what I have refused? I have already rejected thy father.”</p>
