puts his tongue to it, that is <span class="italic">lambda</span> (Λ = λείχειν, to lick); but he realises that the proper symbol there is <span class="italic">phi</span> (Φ = ϕαλλός, penis). What makes you think <span class="italic">rho</span> (P = penis and scrotum) is meant, you imbecile, where nothing but a tall <span class="italic">iota</span> (I = simply the letter) has been written?

<p><span class="sc">Some</span> say that thou art deformed, Crispa: that I know not: for me thou art fair,’tis enough since I am judge. Nay more, I long—for jealousy is yoked with love—that thou mayest seem to others ugly, comely to me alone.</p>
