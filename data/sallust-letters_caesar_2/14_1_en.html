<p>12. Perhaps, commander,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL522_523_63" id="target_note_LCL522_523_63"><sup>63</sup></a> after reading this letter you may want to know what number of senators I recommend to be adopted and in what way they are to be assigned their many varied duties; also, since I think that jury duty should be entrusted to all the members of the first census class, you may wonder what apportionment and what number there should be in each category. It would not have been at all difficult for me to go into all these details, but it has seemed to me that I ought first to work out the general plan and convince you that it is a valid one. If you decide to adopt this course, the rest will be easy. For my own part, I desire my advice to be wise and above all practicable; for wherever your measures result in success, there I shall gain a good name. But I am stirred even more by a desire for our country to be helped somehow or other, as soon as possible. I hold freedom dearer than glory, and I pray and urge you, our most illustrious general thanks to the reduction of the Gallic nation, not to allow the great and unconquered dominion of the Roman people to waste away through decay and to fall apart through an excess of negligence. If that should happen, assuredly neither day nor night would alleviate your mental distress to keep you from being distraught and frantic, carried away by madness, in a state of torment from dreams. As for me, I am firmly convinced that a divine power watches over the life of all mortals; that no one’s good or evil action fails to be taken into account, but that by a law of nature different rewards await the good and the wicked. Meanwhile, if by chance those due desserts are rather slow in materializing, the prospect of them is held up to each man’s mind as a result of his own conscience.</p>
