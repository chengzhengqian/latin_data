<p>9. But why should I say more on this subject, as if it were unknown. Marcus Bibulus’ courage and force of intellect came to the fore in his consulship:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL522_515_52" id="target_note_LCL522_515_52"><sup>52</sup></a> dull of speech, more wicked than clever by disposition. What would that fellow dare for whom the consulship, the highest power, served as the highest disgrace? Does Lucius Domitius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL522_515_53" id="target_note_LCL522_515_53"><sup>53</sup></a> possess great strength, whose every limb is stained with disgrace or crime: his lying tongue, his bloodstained hands, his fleeing feet, his most dishonorable privates?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL522_515_54" id="target_note_LCL522_515_54"><sup>54</sup></a></p>

Qualities such as these are the products of Greek training. Yet among the Greeks, valor, vigilance and toil are wholly lacking. Seeing that they lost through inactivity their freedom at home, do you think that power can be maintained by their precepts?</p>
<p>The remaining members of the faction are nobles of utter ineffectiveness, in whom there is nothing except a famous name, as on a commemorative tablet.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL522_515_56" id="target_note_LCL522_515_56"><sup>56</sup></a> Men like Lucius Postumius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL522_515_57" id="target_note_LCL522_515_57"><sup>57</sup></a> and Marcus Favonius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL522_515_58" id="target_note_LCL522_515_58"><sup>58</sup></a> seem to me
