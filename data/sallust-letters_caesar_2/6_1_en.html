Thus gradually the people, which used to be the master and exercise authority over all nations, became degenerate, and in place of a sovereignty shared in common, each man brought into being his own personal slavery. Therefore, this throng first having been tainted with evil habits, next having strayed into varied practices and modes of life—not at all sharing the same views—seems to me quite unfitted to govern. But if new citizens<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL522_507_42" id="target_note_LCL522_507_42"><sup>42</sup></a> are added to their number, I have high hope that all will be stirred to a sense of freedom; for in the new citizens will arise zeal for retaining their liberty, in the others, zeal for shedding their slavery.
