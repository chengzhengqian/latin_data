prowess of their ancestors has left the nobles a heritage of glory, prestige and patronage, while most of the remaining throng in the senate has been grafted onâ€”free the votes of the latter from fear; thus each man, in a secret ballot, will value himself<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL522_521_60" id="target_note_LCL522_521_60"><sup>60</sup></a> more highly than the political influence of another. Independence is desirable alike to good men and bad, to the resolute as well as cowards. But most men give up independence out of fear. Through a lack of striving, utterly foolish mortals bring upon themselves, just as though defeated, that which in a contest could have turned out either way.</p>
<p>Therefore, I think that the senate can be strengthened by means of two reforms: if it is increased in size<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL522_521_61" id="target_note_LCL522_521_61"><sup>61</sup></a> and voting is by ballot. The ballot will serve as a screen so that the body will dare to act with a more independent spirit; the increase in numbers amounts to both more protection and enhanced usefulness. For as a rule, in the present circumstances, some senators being occupied with the criminal courts, others with their own business affairs and those of their friends, do not truly participate in deliberations on matters of public moment; but they are kept from being effective not so much by their engagement in other activities as by arrogant demands.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL522_521_62" id="target_note_LCL522_521_62"><sup>62</sup></a> The nobles, together with a few men of senatorial rank whom they treat as an appendage of their clique, do, according to their pleasure, whatever they feel like approving, censuring or decreeing. But when the number of the senators has been increased and the voting is done by ballot, those men will surely lay aside their insolence when they are forced to obey those over whom they formerly exercised merciless control.</p>
