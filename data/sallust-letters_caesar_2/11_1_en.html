<p>10. Inasmuch as I have now, as it seems to me, said enough about the regeneration and reformation of the commons, let me tell you what I think you ought to do about the senate. Ever since my years and talent reached maturity, I have hardly ever exercised my body with arms and horses, but I have busied my mind with reading; I occupied with toil that part of my being which was by nature the stronger. And in the course of such a life, I have learned by abundant reading and listening that all kingdoms, as well as city states and nations, have maintained their power in a prosperous condition for as long as sound counsels prevailed; whenever favoritism, fear and pleasure have undermined such counsels, shortly thereafter the strength of those nations waned; then their power was wrested from them, and finally slavery was imposed.</p>
<p>Personally, this is the conclusion to which I have come in my own mind: that it is incumbent on whoever has a higher and more distinguished position in his state than others, to feel great concern for the welfare of the nation. For to the rest, the safety of the City merely assures their personal liberty; but those who have won riches, respect and honor through their prowess are filled with manifold anxiety and trouble when the nation has begun to decline and totter ever so little. He stands up for his renown, or his freedom, or his property; he is present everywhere and makes haste; the more prosperous he was in favorable times, the more severely is he troubled and worried in adversity.</p>
