 the mind from submitting more or less quickly, but inevitably. Often before now I have heard about kings, about city states and nations which have lost, through opulence, great empires that they had won through valor when poor.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL522_511_47" id="target_note_LCL522_511_47"><sup>47</sup></a> Such a loss is not at all surprising.
