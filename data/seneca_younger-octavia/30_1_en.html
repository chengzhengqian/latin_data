armed squadrons guard their commander’s door, though the depleted world sends him its immense resources, though Parthians seek to kiss his bloody hand in supplication, though kingdoms bring him their riches, there will come a day and time when he will pay for his crimes with his guilty spirit and pay his enemies with his throat, deserted and thrown down and utterly destitute.</p>
<p>Oh, how far my labors and prayers have fallen! How far your wild madness and your destiny have brought you, son—to a point where your mother’s anger fades before such disasters, though she died by your crime. I wish that before I brought you into the light as a tiny baby and suckled you, wild beasts had ripped apart my womb! You would have died my innocent child, free of crime and consciousness; clinging close to me in a peaceful corner of the underworld, you would have gazed forever on your father and forefathers, men of great name—but now doomed to everlasting shame and grief by you (so evil!) and by me who bore such a son.</p>
<p>Why am I slow to hide my face in Tartarus, I who blight my kin as stepmother, wife, and mother?</p>
