We have seen a comet’s menacing flames spread their blazing radiance through the heavens, where each successive night the Wain is driven by slow Bootes, stiff with arctic cold. Look, how the very sky is tainted with the menace breathed by this savage leader: the stars threaten new disasters for the nations ruled by his unrighteousness.
