<span class="line indent2">and feast them on my punishment, husband!</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">I, the cause of your pitiful murder</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">and source of death for your son—behold,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">as I deserve,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">shall fare unburied to face your shade,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>

<span class="line indent2">and flails the surface with her arms, impelled</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">by fear—but the effort tires and defeats her.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>

<span class="line indent2">they rally her with cries, support her with their hands.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
