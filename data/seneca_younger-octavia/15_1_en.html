<span class="line indent3">This epoch has likewise seen an enormous</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">outrage by a son,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">when the emperor deceived his mother</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">and sent her out on the Tyrrhene Sea</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">in a death-bound ship.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">On command, the sailors</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">hasten to leave the calm of the harbor.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">The sea resounds to the slap of oars,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">the vessel stands out into the deep.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">Then the ship’s timbers open, it collapses,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">splits under pressure and drinks the sea in.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">A deafening outcry mounts to heaven,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">mingled with women’s lamentation.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">Before their eyes prowls fearsome death,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">everyone for himself looks to escape:</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">some, stripped of everything, cling to planks</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">from the broken ship and face the waves;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">others try to swim back to shore;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">many are fated to drown in the deep.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent3">The lady Augusta<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL078_555_21" id="target_note_LCL078_555_21"><sup>21</sup></a> rends her clothes,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">tears her hair</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">and drenches her face with tears of anguish.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">After all hope of safety is gone,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">burning with anger, undone by disaster,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">she cries, “Is this </span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">the reward you pay me for my great service </span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">to you, my son?</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">I admit I have earned such a vessel as this,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">I who bore you, who gave you the light,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">and, in my folly,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
