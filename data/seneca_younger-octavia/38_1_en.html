<p class="noindent">Oh, my soldiers’ hands are too slow, my own anger too tolerant after such an outrage as this! Witness the fact that the torches the citizens lit against me are not being quenched in their own blood, and that Rome, which bore such men, has not been left desolate and soaked by a massacre of the people. But now death is too slight a penalty for their offenses; the rabble’s sacrilegious crimes have deserved something weightier. And that woman to whom the citizen’s fury would subject me, that wife and sister whom I have always suspected, must finally forfeit her life to my wrath and quench my anger with her blood. Next the city’s buildings must fall to flames set by me.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL078_601_47" id="target_note_LCL078_601_47"><sup>47</sup></a> Fire, ruined homes, sordid poverty, cruel starvation along with grief must crush this criminal populace.</p>
<p>The masses have grown unruly, spoiled by the blessings of my reign. They cannot appreciate my policy of mercy or feel grateful or endure peace. No, they are seized with a restless daring, and in addition carried to extremes by their own recklessness. They must be tamed by suffering and crushed continuously with a heavy yoke, so they will not dare to try anything similar or to raise their eyes to meet my wife’s sacrosanct gaze. Broken by fear through punishment, they will learn to obey when their emperor nods his head.</p>
<p>But here I see the man whose rare duty and signal loyalty have set him in command of my garrison.</p></p></blockquote></div><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL078_601_47"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL078_601_47" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">47</sup>The author alludes to the Great Fire of AD 64, which Nero was widely thought to have set.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL078_601_47').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
