A powerful impulse in the mind, a seductive warmth in the heart—that is what Love is. It is generated by youth, and fostered by leisure and high living amid Fortune’s genial bounty. If you stop cherishing and nurturing it, it fades, and is soon quenched and loses its strength.</p></div><div class="sp"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">nero</span></span><p class="lineGroup noindent">I think it the chief source of life, the fount of pleasure. The human race is preserved from extinction by being constantly engendered through enchanting Love, who charms even wild beasts.
