Crispinus was eagerly trying to embrace me and kiss my lips as before, when Nero burst into my house in fright and buried the cruel sword in his throat.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL078_593_42" id="target_note_LCL078_593_42"><sup>42</sup></a> Then finally terror roused me from sleep. My face and body shook with violent tremors, my heart pounded; fear stopped my words, but now your faithful love has drawn them from me. Oh! What threatening meaning do the underworld shades have for me? What is this vision of my husband’s blood?</p></div><div class="sp"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">nurse</span></span><p class="lineGroup noindent">There is a sacred faculty, swift and mysterious, that brings back to the mind in sleep those matters that busied it when active and engaged. You wonder that you saw your husband, bedroom, and bed? You were deep in the embrace of your new husband! But you are troubled that women beat their breasts on a day of joy, and untied their hair? It was Octavia’s divorce they mourned, there in her brother’s house, her father’s home. That torch you followed, held aloft in the Augusta’s hand, is an omen of bright fame born for you out of ill will; the underworld abode promises a stable marriage in an abiding home. Since your emperor buried his sword in a throat, he will not embark on wars, but hide the sword in peace. Take heart again, regain your joyfulness, I beg you; banish your fears and take your place again in the marriage chamber.</p></div><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL078_593_42"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL078_593_42" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">42</sup>The Latin does not specify <span class="italic">whose</span> throat here or at 752, nor <span class="italic">which</span> husband is meant at 739.
