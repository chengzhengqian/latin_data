she began to plead with me: “Oh my dear Pamphilus, you
see the reason why she’s left you. She was raped a while
ago before her marriage<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL023_187_16" id="target_note_LCL023_187_16">
<sup>16</sup>
</a> by some reprobate. Now she’s
taken refuge here to conceal the birth from you and
everyone else.” When I recall her pleas, I can’t help
weeping, I’m so distressed.</p><p class="lineGroup">“Whatever stroke of luck has brought you to us today,”
she continued, “by that<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL023_187_17" id="target_note_LCL023_187_17">
<sup>17</sup>
</a> we both implore you, if the laws
of men and gods permit, to hide her misfortunes and
keep them secret from everybody. If ever you have
recognised the love towards you in her heart, my dear
Pamphilus, she begs you in return to grant her this
favour, which will cost you nothing. As for taking her
back, you must do what you think fit. You’re the only person
who knows that she’s having a baby and that it is not
yours. I’m told that she slept with you only after two
months, and this is now the seventh month since she
came to live with you.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL023_187_18" id="target_note_LCL023_187_18">
<sup>18</sup>
</a> You know all this perfectly well,
as the events show. Now, if it’s possible, Pamphilus, what
I want above all and am trying to achieve is that the birth
should be kept secret from her father and indeed from
everybody. But if its discovery can’t be prevented, I’ll say
that there’s been a miscarriage. I’m sure that nobody will
suspect anything; they’ll come to the natural conclusion
