situation, without my uttering a word, it must be obvious
to anyone how miserable I was. I’d hardly torn myself
away, disentangled my affections, and transferred them
to my wife here, when, lo and behold, some new development
has arisen to tear me away from her as well. What’s
more, I suppose that at the end of all this I’ll find either
my mother or my wife to be at fault; and, when I do find
this out, what’s left for me but still more misery? Filial
duty bids me bear with any wrongs done by my mother,
Parmeno; on the other hand, I amin debt to my wife, who
good-naturedly put up with me at the time and has never
breathed a word of my many wrongdoings to anyone. But
something terrible must have happened, Parmeno, to
cause a quarrel between them which has lasted so long.</p></div>

true explanation, sometimes the greatest quarrel doesn’t
imply the greatest wrongdoing. It often happens that in a

enemy for life. Look at children, who quarrel among
themselves over trivial complaints, and why? Because
they are unable to control their impulses. It’s the same
with these women: they change their minds, just like
children. It’s likely it was a single word which stirred up
this quarrel between them.</p></div>
