</span><p class="lineGroup">(<span class="italic">to himself</span>) There’s nothing I’d rather see happen than
what I see happening to her: she’s earning herself gratitude
at no cost and doing me me a good turn. If it’s true
that she’s now broken off with Pamphilus, she knows that
fame and fortune and glory all await her as a result. She’ll
be repaying his kindness and at the same time winning
our friendship. (<span class="italic">he exits into his house, leaving the stage empty</span>)</p></div>

</span><p class="lineGroup">(<span class="italic">to himself</span>) Believe me, my master doesn’t put much
value on my services. For no reason at all he sent me on a
pointless errand: I’ve been sitting around the whole day
on the acropolis waiting for Callidemides, this visitor
from Myconos. I sat there like a fool, and, whenever anyone
came past, I went up to him and said: “Excuse me,
young man, are you from Myconos?” “Not me.” “Are you
Callidemides?” “No.” “Do you have a friend here called
Pamphilus?” They all said no. I don’t think any such person
exists. In the end, for god’s sake, I got embarrassed
and left. (<span class="italic">seeing Bacchis emerging from Phidippus’

house? What’s she up to there?</p></div>
