was toil. But I set myself to revive these same plays in order to
obtain other new ones from the same author; I was very eager
that he should not be discouraged from his profession. I managed
to get the plays performed, and, once they were known,
they were a success. In this way I restored the playwright to his
place, when the the attacks of his opponents had practically
driven him from his profession and from his craft and from the
dramatic art. But if I had rejected his works at the time and had
chosen to spend my time discouraging him, thus consigning
him to idleness rather than to industry, I could easily have discouraged
him from writing any further plays.</p>
<p>Now for my sake listen to my request with open minds. I am
presenting “The Mother-in-Law” to you again, which I have
never been allowed to play in silence; it has been so dogged by
disaster. But your good sense, allied to my efforts, can mitigate
the disaster. The first time I tried to perform the play, I was
forced off the stage early; there was talk of boxers—and added
to that a promise of a tightrope walker—crowds of supporters,
general uproar, and women screaming. I decided to use my old
practice on this new play and continue the experiment: I put it
on a second time. The first act<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL023_151_9" id="target_note_LCL023_151_9">

</a> went well. But then a rumour
arose that there was going to be a gladiatorial show: crowds
rushed in, with much confusion, shouting, and fighting for
places, and in these circumstances I couldn’t preserve my place.</p>
<p>Now there is no disturbance; all is peace and quiet. I have
the chance to perform the play, and you the opportunity to add
lustre to the dramatic festivals. Do not allow the dramatic art to
fall into the hands of a few through your negligence. Make sure
