<p class="noindent">The title of this play is The Mother-in-Law. When it was performed
as a new play, it suffered a novel form of misfortune, a
disaster which prevented it from being watched or given a hearing:

my ground in others. I realised that a theatrical career was a
precarious one; success was uncertain and the only certainty
