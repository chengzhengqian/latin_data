In turn I want you to believe this of me, that I am eager

some complaint against her husband?</p></div>

her forcibly to return, she swore on oath that she
couldn’t endure living in your house in Pamphilus’ absence.
I suppose everyone has his own failing: in my case
I was born with an easygoing nature, and I can’t oppose
my family.</p></div>

equally hated by our husbands because of a few who
make it seem that we all deserve such treatment. As
heaven is my witness, I am not guilty of what my husband
now accuses me. But it’s not easy to clear myself, when
they’re so convinced that all mothers-in-law are unreasonable.
But not me, for heaven’s sake. I’ve never treated
her otherwise than as if she were my own daughter, and
I don’t know why this is happening to me. Heaven knows,
I’m really looking forward to my son’s return. (<span class="italic">she exits
