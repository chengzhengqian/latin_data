</span><p class="lineGroup">Are you capable of looking ahead or judging what is to
our advantage? Maybe you heard someone claiming to
have seen him coming away from his mistress or going in
to see her. What of it? If his visits were discreet and not
too frequent, surely it is more human for us to turn a
blind eye than to make it our business to find them out
and make him hate us? If he was able to tear himself away
at a moment’s notice from an affair that had lasted for so
many years, I would see him as lacking in human feeling
and not a very stable husband for our daughter.</p></div>

misdeeds which you say I have committed. Go and speak
to him in private, and ask him whether he wants his wife
or not. If it turns out that he says yes, give her back to
him. If he says no, then I’ve done the right thing by my
daughter.</p></div>

his side, Myrrina, I was here and the decision should
have been taken on my advice. So I’m incensed that
you’ve ventured to act without my permission. I forbid
you to take the baby anywhere outside the house. (<span class="italic">aside</span>)
But I’d be a fool to expect her to do what I tell her! I’ll go
inside and give instructions to the slaves not to let it
be taken out anywhere. (<span class="italic">he exits into his house, leaving
