our wives wrongly; let’s now give Bacchis a hearing in her
turn. If your wife finds out that she has believed a mere
accusation, she’ll put aside her anger. And if my son resents
the fact that his wife has had a child without telling
anybody, it’s no great matter; he’ll soon get over it. It’s
quite clear there’s nothing here that justifies a separation.</p></div>
