I saw that, my suspicions increased and I insisted on an
answer. The fellow admitted he’d raped some girl in the
street, and said he’d snatched the ring off her in the
struggle. Well, just now Myrrina here recognised the
ring, which I was wearing on my finger. She asked where
I had got it, and I told her the whole story. That’s how it
came out that it was Philumena who had been raped by
him and it is his son who has now been born. I am delighted
to have been the cause of so much joy for him,
though this is not how other women of my sort feel. It’s
not in our interest for any lover to be happily married.
But I swear I’ll never bring myself to behave meanly for
the sake of my profession. While circumstances allowed
us to be together, I found him kind, charming, and generous.
His marriage was a blow to me, I have to admit. But,
heavens, I don’t think I did anything to deserve it. When
you’ve had so many good times from a man, it’s only right
to put up with the bad ones.</p></div>
