Philumena’s father. What passed between them I haven’t
yet discovered, though naturally I’m concerned how this
is going to turn out. There you have the whole story. I’ll

in the same school, and I’m quite sure that, if there is
such a school, (<span class="italic">pointing to Sostrata</span>) she’s the headmistress.</p></div>
