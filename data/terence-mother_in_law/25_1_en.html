</span><p class="lineGroup">(<span class="italic">slowly and deliberately</span>) I’m conscious of having taken
every care not to give your family any just grounds for
complaint. If I cared to recall here and now how loyal and
kind and understanding I’ve been to her, I could do it
quite truthfully, except that I should prefer you to hear it
from her own lips. That will be the best way to give you
confidence in my character, when she who now does me
wrong speaks out and does me justice. I call the gods to
witness that this separation has not come about through
any fault of mine. Since she thinks it beneath her dignity
to defer to my mother and to tolerate her ways with some
proper restraint on her own part, and since there is no
other way in which they can be reconciled, I must give up
either my mother, Phidippus, or Philumena. In this situation
my duty as a son bids me give preference to my
mother’s interests.</p></div>

</span><p class="lineGroup">Pamphilus, I was not displeased to hear what you had to
say. I appreciate that you have put your mother before
everything else. But mind that resentment doesn’t lead
you to pursue the wrong course, Pamphilus.</p></div>

</span><p class="lineGroup">(<span class="italic">with passion</span>) What resentment could make me treat her
unjustly now, father, when she has never done anything
against my wishes and I know she has often done things
just to please me? I have nothing but love and praise for
her and I miss her desperately, knowing from experience
how wonderfully well disposed she was towards me. And
I pray that she may pass the rest of her life with a husband
more fortunate than I am, since she’s torn away from me
by fate.</p></div>
