now. I can see that none of us is welcome there: yesterday
nobody would let Sostrata in. If for some reason the illness
gets more serious, which I certainly hope it doesn’t,
especially for my master’s sake, they’ll immediately say
that a slave of Sostrata’s was inside the house and claim
that he brought in something harmful to their health and
well-being which made the illness worse. My mistress
will be blamed, and I’ll be in for a thrashing.</p></div>

To love someone who’s taken a dislike to you is stupid
twice over, if you ask me: you’re wasting your own time
and you’re causing annoyance to the other person. Besides,
your son went inside as soon as he arrived to see
how she’s doing.</p></div>
