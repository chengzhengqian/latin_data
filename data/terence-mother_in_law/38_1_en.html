</span><p class="lineGroup">(<span class="italic">to herself</span>) It’s not for nothing that Laches wants to get in
touch with me now. And, unless I’m much mistaken, I’ve
a good idea of what he’s after.</p></div>

</span><p class="lineGroup">(<span class="italic">to himself</span>) I must be careful not to lose my temper and
so achieve less than I might have, or overdo things and
then regret it afterwards. I’ll approach her. (<span class="italic">to Bacchis</span>)
Good day, Bacchis.</p></div>

I sent my slave to call you out here.</p></div>

</span><p class="lineGroup">I’m also rather apprehensive, heaven knows, when I remember
what I am. I hope the reputation of my profession

</span><p class="lineGroup">(<span class="italic">awkwardly polite</span>) If you tell the truth, you’re in no danger
from me, my good woman. I’m now at an age where I
can’t expect any indiscretion to be excused, so I’m all the
more careful in all situations not to act too hastily. If you
are behaving as an honest woman should and intend to go
on doing so, it would be wrong of me to offer you a
clumsy insult when you don’t deserve it.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">bac</span>
</span><p class="lineGroup">(<span class="italic">amused</span>) Lord knows, I should be very grateful to you
for that remark. An apology <span class="italic">after</span> an insult wouldn’t do
much for me. But what is this about?</p></div>
