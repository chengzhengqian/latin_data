</span><p class="lineGroup">It’s good news that you’re back, Pamphilus, and safe and
well too, which is the important thing.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">pam</span>
</span><p class="lineGroup">Quite so.</p></div>

<span class="sc">lac</span>
</span><p class="lineGroup">Have you just arrived?</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">pam</span>

</span><p class="lineGroup">(<span class="italic">eagerly</span>) Tell me, how much did our cousin Phania
leave?</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">pam</span>
</span><p class="lineGroup">Well actually, he was a great pursuer of pleasure while he
lived, and men of that type don’t do much for their heirs.
What they do leave is an epitaph for themselves: “He
lived, while he lived, well.”</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">lac</span>
</span><p class="lineGroup">You mean you’ve brought back nothing except one single
well turned phrase?</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">pam</span>
</span><p class="lineGroup">However little he did leave, it’s a profit.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">lac</span>
</span><p class="lineGroup">(<span class="italic">self-righteously</span>) No, it’s a loss. I’d rather he was safe alive.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">phi</span>
</span><p class="lineGroup">It’s easy enough for you to express that wish. He’s never
going to return from the dead. (<span class="italic">aside</span>) And I know which
you’d prefer.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">lac</span>
</span><p class="lineGroup">(<span class="italic">to Pamphilus</span>) Yesterday Phidippus here ordered Philumena
to be brought over to him. (<span class="italic">aside to Phidippus</span>). Say
you ordered her.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">phi</span>
</span><p class="lineGroup">(<span class="italic">aside to Laches</span>) Don’t nudge me. (<span class="italic">aloud</span>) Yes I did.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">lac</span>
</span><p class="lineGroup">Now he’ll send her back straightaway.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">phi</span>
</span><p class="lineGroup">Of course.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">pam</span>
</span><p class="lineGroup">I know the whole story. I heard it just now when I arrived.</p></div>

spreading gossip!</p></div>
