undertaking. As for taking her back, I don’t believe that
would be at all honourable, and I won’t do it, in spite of
the love and intimacy which bind me so strongly to her. I
weep when I think of the life ahead of me and the loneliness.
Oh fortune, how impermanent a gift you are! But
my previous love affair has given me good practice in this
sort of thing. I managed to get over that one through reason.
I’ll see if I can do the same with this one.</p><p class="lineGroup">(<span class="italic">looking down the street</span>) Here comes Parmeno with
the slaves. He’s the last person we want involved in the
situation. He’s the only person I let know at the time that
I didn’t touch the girl when we were first married. I’m
afraid that, if he hears these repeated cries, he’ll realise
that Philumena’s in labour. I must send him away somewhere
until the baby is born. (<span class="italic">he stands aside</span>)</p></div>

Illegitimate babies were particularly at risk. If the father was unwilling to raise the child, the mother might, as here and often elsewhere in drama (compare <span class="italic">The Self-Tormentor</span> lines 626–643), give the baby to someone else to expose,
in the hope that it might in fact be spared.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL023_189_19a').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
