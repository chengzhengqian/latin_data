you going to give me a definite answer? (<span class="italic">to Phidippus</span>)
Do you think he’s all right? But never mind him. Give me
the child, Phidippus. I’ll bring it up.</p></div>

Women are prickly creatures: they don’t take these
things easily. This <span class="italic">is</span> what’s caused all the ill-feeling: she

</a> I didn’t want to say it in your son’s presence,
and I didn’t believe her at first. But now the truth is
out. I can see that he’s temperamentally quite unsuited to
married life.</p></div>

Laches. I want this marriage alliance between us to last,
