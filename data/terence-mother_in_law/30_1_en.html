miserable woman alive than me. If he finds out the true
state of affairs, it’s only too clear to me how he’s going to
react, when he’s lost his temper at a less serious thing like
this. And I don’t know how I can make him change his
mind. After all my countless miseries, it will be the last
straw if he forces me to raise a child whose father’s identity
we don’t know. When my daughter was raped, she
couldn’t recognise her assailant in the darkness, and she
didn’t snatch any possession of his at the time by which
he could be identified later; in fact he himself as he left
stole a ring from her, which she was wearing on her
finger. At the same time I’m afraid that Pamphilus won’t
be able to keep the secret I asked of him any longer, when
he finds out that someone else’s child is being raised as
his. (<span class="italic">she exits into her house, leaving the stage empty</span>)</p></div>

of my behaviour that your wife has left us, even though
you’re doing your best to disguise the fact. But I swear by
the favour of heaven and every hope I have of you that
I’ve never consciously done anything to deserve her dislike.
As for yourself, I always imagined that you loved me
and now you’ve confirmed my belief. Your father told me
inside just now how you’ve put consideration for me
above your love. Now I’ve decided to repay your kindness,
