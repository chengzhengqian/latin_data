<p>I have never priced my art on the basis of greed; I have
adopted the principle that the greatest reward for me is to serve
your interests the best. So let me prevail on you not to allow an
author who has entrusted his career to my keeping and himself
to your protection to be cheated and unfairly derided by unfair
critics. For my sake listen to my plea and grant me silence, so
that other authors may be encouraged to write and it may be
worth my while in the future to put on new plays bought at my
own expense.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL023_153_10a" id="target_note_LCL023_153_10a">

they had paid to the author. That the aediles ultimately bought the play
is implied in the prologue to <span class="italic">The Eunuch</span> (line 20); it may be that the
