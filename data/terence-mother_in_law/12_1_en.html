from him what this is all about. (<span class="italic">addressing him</span>) Phidippus,
I know that I’m extremely indulgent to all my family,
but not to the extent that my generosity corrupts their
characters. If you acted in the same way, it would be to
your advantage and to ours. But, as it is, I see that you are
under the thumb of your womenfolk.</p></div>

</span><p class="lineGroup">I approached you yesterday about your daughter, and
you sent me away just as uncertain as when I came. If you
want this marriage relationship to be lasting, you mustn’t
conceal the reasons for your anger in this way. If we have
done anything wrong, bring it out into the open. We’ll either
disprove the allegation or apologise, and we’ll make
amends to your satisfaction. But if the reason for keeping
your daughter at home is that she’s sick, I reckon you are
doing me an injustice, Phidippus, if you’re worried she
may not be looked after well enough in my house. But,
heaven knows, I don’t accept—even if you are her father—that you are more concerned for her welfare than I
am. I’m concerned for my son’s sake, knowing as I do that
he values her no less highly than himself. And I’m very
well aware how upset he’ll be if he finds out about this;
that’s why I’m keen that she return home before he does.</p></div>
