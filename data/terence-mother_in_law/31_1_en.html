my dear, this is what I consider best for the pair of
you and for my reputation. I’ve made up my mind to go

me to withdraw. As I see it, this is the best way to put an
end to all these problems: I’ll clear myself of suspicion
and I’ll let them (<span class="italic">pointing to Phidippus’ house</span>) have their
way. I implore you, let me escape the common reproach
of womankind.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL023_209_27" id="target_note_LCL023_209_27">
