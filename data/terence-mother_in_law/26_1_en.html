my mother’s happiness. (<span class="italic">he turns to go</span>)</p></div>

going? (<span class="italic">Pamphilus rushes into his house</span>)</p></div>

</span><p class="lineGroup">(<span class="italic">to Laches</span>) Why is he so stubborn?</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">lac</span>
</span><p class="lineGroup">Didn’t I tell you, Phidippus, that he would take this
badly? That’s why I begged you to send your daughter back.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">phi</span>
</span><p class="lineGroup">I didn’t believe, for god’s sake, he would be so lacking in
human feeling. Does he really suppose I’ll now go down
on my knees to him? If in fact he wants to take his wife
back, he can. But if he intends otherwise, he must return
the dowry to me and go his way.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">lac</span>
</span><p class="lineGroup">Listen to that! You’re another person being perverse and
bad-tempered!</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">phi</span>
</span><p class="lineGroup">(<span class="italic">shouting offstage</span>) You’ve returned to us in a very defiant
mood, Pamphilus.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">lac</span>
</span><p class="lineGroup">He’ll soon get over his resentment, even if it is justified.</p></div>

<span class="sc">phi</span>
</span><p class="lineGroup">(<span class="italic">stung by this last remark</span>) You people are getting above
yourselves, just because you’ve come into a bit of money.</p></div>

</span><p class="lineGroup">Are you picking a quarrel with me as well?</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">phi</span>
</span><p class="lineGroup">(<span class="italic">formally</span>) He must consider his position and let me
know today whether he wants her or not, so that someone
else can have her if he doesn’t. (<span class="italic">he makes to leave</span>)</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">lac</span>
</span><p class="lineGroup">Phidippus, come here, listen a moment. (<span class="italic">Phidippus
stalks off into his house</span>) (<span class="italic">to himself</span>) He’s gone. What do I
care? In the end they can sort it out for themselves to
their own liking; neither he nor my son takes any notice
of me or attaches any importance to what I say. I’ll report
this dispute to my wife, since all of this is due to her
scheming, and vent all my annoyance on her. (<span class="italic">he exits
into his house</span>)</p></div>
