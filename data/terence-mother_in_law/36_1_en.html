your knowledge. If you think I don’t know what’s in your
mind, you’re mistaken. How long I allowed you to carry
on an affair with a mistress, so that you might some day in
the end turn your mind in the direction of marriage! How
patiently I bore the expense of that affair! I begged and
implored you to take a wife. I said it was time. You took
one in response to my prompting. You did the proper
thing then in complying with my wishes. But now you’ve
turned your attention to your mistress again; you’re complying
with <span class="italic">her</span> wishes and committing a wrong against
your wife. I see you’ve relapsed once more into your old
way of life.</p></div>

</span><p class="lineGroup">Yes, you. And you’re doing her a wrong. You’re inventing
false excuses for a quarrel, so that you can live with your
mistress without your wife looking over your shoulder.
And in fact your wife has realised this. What other reason
could she have for leaving you?</p></div>

about the mother later.</p></div>

</span><p class="lineGroup">(<span class="italic">aside</span>) I’m thoroughly miserable, and I don’t know what
to do. Oh dear, my father has me cornered with all these
arguments. I’ll be off, since I’m not achieving anything
by staying here. They won’t raise the child without my
permission, I’m sure, especially since my mother-in-law
is on my side in this. (<span class="italic">he rushes off left</span>)</p></div>
