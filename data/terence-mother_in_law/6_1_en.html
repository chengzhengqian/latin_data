</span><p class="lineGroup">Pamphilus was as much in love with Bacchis as ever,
when his father began to beg him to get himself a wife,
using the standard arguments that all fathers use. He was
an old man, he said; he had only one son; and he needed
some security for his old age. Pamphilus at first refused;
but, when his father pressed him harder, he became
quite uncertain whether to obey his sense of duty or his
love. In the end his father was so insistent and tiresome
that he prevailed, and he arranged for Pamphilus to
marry the daughter of our next-door neighbour here
(<span class="italic">pointing to Phidippus’ house</span>). This didn’t seem particularly
serious to Pamphilus right up to the actual time of
the wedding. But when he saw everything was ready and
that there was no reason now to postpone the marriage,
then finally he was so upset that I believe even Bacchis
herself would have pitied him, had she been present.
Whenever he found a moment to himself in which he
could confide in me, he’d say, “Parmeno, damn it! What
have I done! What have I let myself in for? I won’t be able
to bear it, Parmeno. Poor me, I’m ruined!”</p></div>

night, the same.</p></div>

after plenty to drink and was able to keep his hands off
her? It’s an unlikely story. I don’t believe it.</p></div>
