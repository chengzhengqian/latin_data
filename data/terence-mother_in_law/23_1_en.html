can’t, so he doesn’t waste his time waiting for me there.
Off you go.</p></div>

tall, ruddy, curly-haired, fat, grey-eyed, and with a face
like a corpse.</p></div>

I’ve no idea how to keep the secret Myrrina begged me to
keep, the fact that her daughter’s having a baby. I’m sorry
for the woman, so I’ll do what I can, so long as I maintain
my duty as a son. I must put my mother first before my
love. (<span class="italic">looking down the street to the right</span>) Oh no! There
are Phidippus and my father. They’re coming this way. I
just don’t know what to say to them.</p></div>
