away from the soldier, and see all of you here, and freely
enjoy your company just as in the old days. There I wasn’t
allowed to say anything except what would please him,
and that was strictly defined.</p></div>

inside! It’s something I never believed could happen,
that he could bring himself to take a wife while she was alive.</p></div>

benefit Bacchis! But tell me, Parmeno, why I should
believe what you’re telling me.</p></div>

As heaven is my witness, I’m not asking you so I can make
it public; I just want to enjoy it quietly by myself.</p></div>

my back on your word.</p></div>

</span><p class="lineGroup">Oh, don’t, Parmeno! As if you weren’t much more eager
to tell me the story than I am to have my questions answered!</p></div>
