Latins received a check, and their battle-line was <span class="marginNote right"><span class="sc">b.c.</span> 500–499</span>forced to yield. The knights had their horses brought up that they might be able to pursue the enemy, and they were followed by the infantry. Then the dictator, neglecting no help, divine or human, is said to have vowed a temple to Castor, and to have promised rewards to the soldiers who should be first and second to enter the camp of the enemy; and so great was the ardour of the Romans, that with a single rush they routed their opponents and took their camp. Such was the battle at Lake Regillus. The dictator and his master of the horse returned to the City and triumphed.</p>
<p>XXI. For the next three years there was neither <span class="marginNote right"><span class="sc">b.c.</span> 498–495</span>
a stable peace nor war. The consuls Quintus Cloelius and Titus Larcius were followed by Aulus Sempronius
and Marcus Minucius. In the latter year a temple to Saturn was dedicated and the Saturnalia was established as a festal day.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL114_285_1a" id="target_note_LCL114_285_1a"><sup>1</sup></a> Next Aulus Postumius
and Titus Verginius were made consuls. It was not until this year, according to some authorities I have consulted, that the battle of Lake Regillus was fought. They say that Aulus Postumius, because his colleague was of doubtful loyalty, resigned the consulship, and was then made dictator. One is involved in so many uncertainties regarding dates by the varying order of the magistrates in different lists that it is impossible to make out which consuls followed which, or what was done in each particular year, when not only events but even authorities are so shrouded in antiquity.</p>
