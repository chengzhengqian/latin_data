who admits defeat in this kind of quarrel is always the winner. And you, too, when you were a young cockerel cried Cock-a-doodle-doo! and hadn’t any sense in your head. So let us do better, and start the fun over again, and have a look at these reciters of Homer.” A troop came in at once and clashed spear on shield. Trimalchio sat up on his cushion, and when the reciters talked to each other in Greek verse, as their conceited way is, he intoned Latin from a book. Soon there was silence, and then he said,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL015_129_1a" id="target_note_LCL015_129_1a"><sup>1</sup></a>“You know the story they are doing? Diomede and Ganymede were two brothers. Helen was their sister. Agamemnon carried her off and took in Diana by sacrificing a deer to her instead. So Homer is now telling the tale of the war between Troy and Parentium. Of course he won and married his daughter Iphigenia to Achilles. That drove Ajax mad, and he will show you the story in a minute.” As he spoke the reciters raised a shout, and the slaves

The “true” mythology is: Ganymedes was not a Greek but a Trojan boy carried away to “heaven” by Zeus to be his favourite and his (and the other gods’) cup-bearer, Diomedes was a great Greek captain and hero in the traditional war against Troy in north-western Asia Minor. Ganymedes and Diomedes were not related in any way to each other or to Helen (wife of Menelaus, King of Sparta) whose brothers were Castor and Pollux. Paris, the Trojan, carried Helen off to Troy and so caused the war. Agamemnon (King of Mycenae city, brother of Menelaus, and commander-in-chief of the Greeks in the war) lured his daughter Iphigenia to Aulis on the pretext of marrying her to prince Achilles; and, to gain favourable winds, and relief from plague in his army, would have sacrificed her, but Artemis (Diana) substituted a hart and translated her elsewhere before the ten years’ war began, part of which is related by Homer. During the war Achilles died. [This is not in the <span class="italic">Iliad</span>.] After Achilles’ arms had been awarded to Odysseus (Ulysses), Ajax went mad because he had wanted them. Trimalchio’s mythology is: Ganymedes and Diomedes were brothers of Helen. She was carried off by King Agamemnon who deceived Diana by sacrificing a deer instead. Homer tells the story of fighting between the Trojans and the Parentini (connecting these with Paris?) of a town in the Italian country of Istria at the north end of the Adriatic, unless indeed for <span class="italic">parentini</span> in cod. <span class="italic">H</span> Scheffer was right in conjecturing Tarentini the people of Taranto in south Italy. After his victory Agamemnon gave Iphigenia in marriage to Achilles so that Ajax went mad through jealousy of Achilles.
