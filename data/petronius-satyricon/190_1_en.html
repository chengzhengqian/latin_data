and Caesar, <span class="sc">b.c.</span> 49–45. Lucan at his death left unfinished an incomparably larger epic in ten books of hexameters on the same struggle.</p>
<p>Petronius’s poem has no title, but we may conclude from chapter 118 that it can be called <span class="italic">Bellum Civile.</span> Lucan’s poem has the title <span class="italic">Bellum Civile</span> in the best MSS, the title <span class="italic">Pharsalia</span> (from Pharsalus, scene of the final defeat of Pompeius by Caesar) in others.</p>
<p>Petronius’s novel must have been finished, or left unfinished, before <span class="sc">a.d.</span> 66 or early in that year. Lucan had completed (and perhaps published) three books in <span class="sc">a.d.</span> 61, five years before Petronius’s death, covering thus far the same events as Petronius does in his poem as a whole. Lucan’s poem, so far as it goes in the ten books, has more than 8000 lines, the war as far as the evacuation of Italy by Pompeius being contained in the first two books (695 + 736 = 1431 lines)): Book I: Evils of War. Causes of the Civil War. Roman luxury (lines 158–182 only, on the latter). Characters of Caesar and Pompeius. Caesar invades Italy. Fear at Rome. Pompeius flees. Book II: Alarm at Rome. Earlier turmoil of Marius and Sulla. Brutus and Cato. Caesar occupies all Italy which Pompeius successfully leaves. Book III: Caesar enters Rome. Goes to Massilia. Pompeius collects men from Greece and Asia (762 lines). Book IV: Caesar in Spain. Curio’s fate in Africa. Book V: Caesar returns to Rome. His dictatorship. Caesar and the country Epirus. Pompeius’s wife Cornelia. Book VI: Operations at Dyrrachium, etc. Both armies go to Thessaly. Book VII: Battle of Pharsalus. Victory of Caesar. Book VIII: Flight of Pompeius by way of W. Asia
