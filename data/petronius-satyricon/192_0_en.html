epic on the last days of the free Roman republic—“<span class="italic">Ecce belli civilis ingens opus</span>” says Eumolpus, the word <span class="italic">ecce</span>, “look now”, suggesting a definite example; Petronius may well have read Lucan’s first three books completed in <span class="sc">a.d.</span> 61, or heard recitations from them, and may have disapproved in part; for Lucan’s epic is (i) a record of events (and of people’s feelings) in verse and (ii) lacks the divine activities of deities; and both (i) (the method) and (ii) (the lack) are criticised in chapter 118 of Petronius, and their contraries are illustrated in Petronius’s poem itself. We might conclude that Petronius not only thought that Lucan would turn out to be ‘prosy’ but also disapproves of Eumolpus’s kind of poetry here as he does elsewhere in the <span class="italic">Satyricon.</span> I feel that Petronius criticises Lucan at work but parodies what is largely others’ poetry. He probably did not know all that Lucan had written by the year 65. Certain it is that Petronius’s poem is not a comment on a completed work of Lucan.</p>
