have thought that the geese had come back into the room again. I was astonished and shocked to find so strange a crime at my door, and I asked her why she had flared up, and why she should be more sorry for the goose than for me. But she beat her hands together and said, “You villain, you dare to speak? Do you not know what a dreadful sin you have committed? You have killed the darling of Priapus, the goose beloved of all married women. And do not suppose that it is not serious: if any magistrate finds out, on the cross you go. My house was spotless until to-day, and you have defiled it with blood, and you have given any enemy of mine who likes the power to turn me out of my priesthood.” …</p>
<p>“Not such a noise, please,” I said; “I will give you an ostrich to replace the goose.” …</p>
<p>I was amazed, and the woman sat on the bed and wept over the death of the goose, until Proselenos came in with materials for the sacrifice, and seeing that the goose was dead, inquired why this was so. When she found out she began to weep loudly, too, and to compassionate me as if I had killed my own father instead of a common goose. So I grew tired and disgusted, and said,” Please let me cleanse my hands by paying; … it would be another thing if J had insulted you or even done a murder. Look, I will put down two gold pieces. You can buy both gods and geese for that.” When Oenothea saw the money, she said, “Forgive me, young man, I am troubled on your account. I am showing my love and not my ill-will. So we will do our best to keep this secret. But pray the gods to pardon what you have done.”</p>
