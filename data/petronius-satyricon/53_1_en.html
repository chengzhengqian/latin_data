jugs which a patron †<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL015_107_1" id="target_note_LCL015_107_1"><sup>1</sup></a> bequeathed, where you see Daedalus shutting Niobe into the Trojan horse.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL015_107_2a" id="target_note_LCL015_107_2a"><sup>2</sup></a> And I have got the fights between Hermeros and Petraites<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL015_107_3" id="target_note_LCL015_107_3"><sup>3</sup></a> on my cups, and every cup is a heavy one; for I do not sell my connoisseurship for any money.”</p>
<p>As he was speaking, a boy dropped a cup. Trimalchio looked at him and said, “Quick, off with your own head, since you are so stupid.” The boy’s lip fell and he began to petition. “Why do you ask me?” said Trimalchio, “as if I should be hard on you! I advise you to prevail upon yourself not to be stupid.” In the end we induced him to let the boy off. As soon as he was forgiven the boy ran round the table….</p>
<p>Then Trimalchio shouted, “Out with water! In with wine!” We took up the jokes, especially Agamemnon, who knew how to earn a second invitation to dinner. Trimalchio warmed to his drinking under our flattery, and was almost drunk when he said: “None of you ask dear Fortunata to dance. I tell you no one can dance the cancan<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL015_107_4" id="target_note_LCL015_107_4"><sup>4</sup></a> better.” He then lifted his hands above his brow and gave us the actor Syrus, while all the slaves sang in chorus:</p>

He did, however, make a wooden cow for Pasiphaë (wife of King Minos for whom that labyrinth was built) who loved a fine white bull and hid inside the cow so as to be covered by it.
