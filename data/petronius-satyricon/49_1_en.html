Trimalchio at once retorted: “If the thing really happened, there is no problem; if it never happened, it is all nonsense.” We followed up this and other sallies with the most extravagant admiration. “Tell me, dear Agamemnon,” said Trimalchio, “do you know anything of the twelve labours of Hercules, or the story of Ulysses and how the Cyclops † twisted his thumb with the tongs? †<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL015_99_3a" id="target_note_LCL015_99_3a"><sup>3</sup></a>
