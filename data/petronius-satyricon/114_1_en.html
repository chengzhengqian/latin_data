Ascyltos stood close by the crier in clothes of many colours, holding out the reward on a silver dish to prove his honesty. I told Giton to get under the bed at once, and hook his feet and hands into the girths which held up the mattress on the frame, and (as Ulysses of old clung tightly), stretched out under the bed instead of a ram,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL015_229_1" id="target_note_LCL015_229_1"><sup>1</sup></a> evade the grasp of searchers. Giton obeyed orders at once, and in a second had slipped his hands into the webbing, and surpassed even Ulysses at his own tricks. I did not want to leave any room for suspicion, so I stuffed the bed with clothes, and arranged them in the shape of a man about my own height sleeping by himself.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Ascyltos went round all the rooms with a constable, and when he came to mine, his hopes swelled within him at finding the door bolted with especial care. The municipal slave put an axe into the joints, and loosened the bolts from their place. I fell at Ascyltos’s feet, and besought him, by the memory of our friendship and the miseries we had shared, at least to show me my brother. Further to win belief in my sham prayers, I said, “I know you have come to kill me, Ascyltos. Else why have you brought an axe with you? Well, satisfy your rage.
