<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">The poem on the civil war in Petronius 119–124</span></p>
<p class="noindent">The question of a connection between this poem and the extant poem of Lucan may be set out as follows.</p>
<p>Both Petronius and Lucan died through the enmity of Nero, and both by the same cause and in effect at the same time. Petronius was accused of friendship with Flavius Scaevinus a member of Piso’s ill-fated plot against Nero in <span class="sc">a.d</span>. 65, and because of this took his own life in 66. Marcus Annaeus Lucanus, born in <span class="sc"><span class="sc">a.d.</span></span> 39, was involved in the same conspiracy and because of this had killed himself in <span class="sc">a.d</span>. 65.</p>
<p>Petronius in the <span class="italic">Satyricon,</span> chapter 118, makes the. old poet Eumolpus utter in prose a severe warning to would-be poets, especially if they feel an urge to compose such an <span class="italic">ingens opus</span> (‘a huge work’) as a <span class="italic">bellum civile.</span> Such a subject in epic poetry, says Eumolpus, demands a rich knowledge of literature; mere recording of events should not be attempted in verse because historians do that better (in prose); in an historical epic poem such as one on civil war there should be mythology and interpositions by the gods, and the poet should sound like an inspired prophet rather than an utterer of facts as if on oath. Then Petronius makes Eumolpus recite a miniature epic (lacking, says E., the final touches) in hexameters on the civil strife between Pompeius (and his sur­vivors)
