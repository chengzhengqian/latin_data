Why, his wool was not growing of fine enough quality. He bought rams from Tarentum and bummed them into his flock. He had bees brought from Athens to give him Attic honey on the premises; the Roman-born bees incidentally will be improved by the Greeklings. Within the last few days, I may say, he has written for a cargo of mushroom spawn from India. And he has not got a single mule which is not the child of a wild ass. You see all the cushions here: every one has purple or scarlet stuffing. So high is his felicity. But do not look down on the other freedmen who are his friends. They are very juicy people. That one you see lying at the bottom of the end sofa has his eight hundred thousand. He grew from nothing. A little time ago he was carrying loads of wood on his back. People do say—I know nothing, but I have heard—that he pulled off a goblin’s cap and found a fairy hoard.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL015_69_1" id="target_note_LCL015_69_1"><sup>1</sup></a> If God makes presents I am jealous of nobody. Still, he shows the marks of his master’s fingers,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL015_69_2" id="target_note_LCL015_69_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and has a fine opinion of himself. So he has just put up a notice next to his hovel: ‘This attic, the property of Gaius Pompeius Diogenes, to let from the 1st of July, the owner having purchased a house.’ That person there too who is lying in the freedman’s place<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL015_69_3" id="target_note_LCL015_69_3"><sup>3</sup></a> is well pleased with himself. I do not blame him. He had his million in his hands, but he has had a bad shaking. I believe he cannot say his hair is free from mortgage.
