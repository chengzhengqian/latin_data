But <span class="italic">we</span> are besotted with wine and whores and cannot rise to understand even the arts that are developed; we slander the past, and learn and teach nothing but vices. Where is dialectic now, or astronomy? Where is the exquisite way of wisdom? Who has ever been to a temple and promised an offering should he attain to eloquence, or drink of the waters of philosophy? Men do not even ask for good sense or good health, but before they even touch the threshold of the Capitol, one promises an offering if he may bury his rich kinsman, another if he may dig up a hid treasure, another if he may make thirty millions in safety. Even the Senate, the teachers of what is right and good, often promise a thousand pounds in gold to the Capitol, and decorate even Jupiter with pelf, that no one need be ashamed of lusting for money. So there is nothing surprising in the decadence of painting, when all the gods and men think an ingot of gold more beautiful than anything those poor crazy Greeks, Apelles and Phidias,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL015_205_4" id="target_note_LCL015_205_4"><sup>4</sup></a> ever did.</p>
