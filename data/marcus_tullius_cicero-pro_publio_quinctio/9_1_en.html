settlement had been arranged in regard to all the affairs and accounts of the partnership, and lie felt assured that no cause of dispute would arise between them. “Let us see about that later,” said Quinctius; “for the present, if you will be so kind, I should be glad if you would see about getting the money, as you promised.” Naevius declared that he would only do so on his own terms, saying that his promise had no more to do with him than any other promise that he had made when selling goods by auction, by the owner’s orders. Quinctius, thoroughly upset by such<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">20</span><span class="br"></span> a disappointment, obtains a few days’ grace from the Scapulae and sends to Gaul to have the goods sold as he had previously advertised; the auction takes place during his absence at an unfavourable time, and he pays off the Scapulae on less favourable terms than he had previously arranged. He then of his own accord appeals to Naevius, asking him, since he suspected there might be a dispute about something or other, to see about getting the whole affair settled as soon as possible and with the least trouble. Naevius<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">21</span><span class="br"></span> appoints his friend Marcus Trebellius to represent him; we appoint a man connected by common ties with both parties, a man who had been brought up in Naevius’s house and was an intimate friend of his, a relative of ours, Sextus Alfenus. No arrangement was possible, because my client wished to suffer only a moderate loss, while Naevius was not content with a moderate booty. And so from that time the matter<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">22</span><span class="br"></span> had to be settled in the courts.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL240_27_a" id="target_note_LCL240_27_a"><sup>a</sup></a> After several appointments had been made and adjourned, involving considerable loss of time without any result, Naevius appeared in court.</p>
