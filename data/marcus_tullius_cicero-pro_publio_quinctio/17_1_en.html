<p>XI There were no grounds for your application.<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">37</span><span class="br"></span> How can this be proved? Because Quinctius never owed anything to Naevius, neither on account of the partnership nor as a private debt. Who is a witness to this? The very man who is our bitterest opponent. On this point I will call you, you, I say, Naevius, as a witness. Quinctius lived with you in Gaul for a year and more after the death of his brother. Prove that you ever asked him to pay that enormous sum, prove that you ever mentioned or said that it was owing, and I will admit that he owed it. My client’s brother<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">38</span><span class="br"></span> dies, and, according to your statement, owed you a large sum of money on certain specific heads.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL240_43_a" id="target_note_LCL240_43_a"><sup>a</sup></a> My client, his heir, comes to you in Gaul, to your joint estate—in fact, to the very place where not only the property was, but where all the accounts and letters were kept. Who would have been so careless in his private affairs, so heedless, so unlike you, Sextus, after the property had passed out of the hands of the man with whom he had made the contract into those of his heir, as not to notify this heir as soon as he saw him, claim the money, present the account, and if any dispute arose, settle the matter privately or by the rigour of the law? Is it really so? What every good man does, every man who wishes his kinsfolk and friends to be and to be accounted worthy of affection and of honour, was this not what Sextus Naevius would do—this man who is so inflamed and carried away by greed that he would be unwilling<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL240_43_b" id="target_note_LCL240_43_b"><sup>b</sup></a> to give up any of his advantages for fear of leaving his relative, my client, a share of anything
