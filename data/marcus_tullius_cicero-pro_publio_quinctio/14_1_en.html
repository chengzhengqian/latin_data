Further, Quinctius himself emphatically declared that<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">31</span><span class="br"></span> his reason for being unwilling to give security was to avoid the appearance of himself thereby giving a verdict that his goods had been possessed in accordance with the edict; moreover, if he made an “engagement” of the kind asked for, he would be obliged to plead first in a matter affecting his civil rights, as has happened to-day. Following the practice of members of the nobility, who, when once they have begun to carry out some plan, whether right or wrong, show such superiority in its execution that is beyond the reach of one in our humble position, Dolabella most manfully persevered in acting wrongfully; he ordered that either security must be given or an engagement entered into, and in the meantime caused our advocates who protested to be forcibly removed from court.</p>

<p>IX. Quinctius withdrew quite distracted; and no<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">32</span><span class="br"></span> wonder, since a wretched and unfair alternative was offered him—either to condemn himself to lose his civil rights if he gave security, or to plead first in an action in which they were at stake, if he entered into an “engagement.” Since in the one case there was nothing to prevent his being obliged to pass sentence on himself, which is the severest form of judgement, while in the other he had the hope after all of coming before a judge of such a character that the less influence he brought to bear, the greater the assistance he might obtain from him, Quinctius preferred to enter into the “engagement.” He did so; he proposed<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL240_37_a" id="target_note_LCL240_37_a"><sup>a</sup></a> you as judge, Aquilius; and then sued Naevius on the “engagement.” This is the essential point of the trial, this is the gist of the whole cause.</p>
