with a pecuniary matter, but with the fame and fortunes of Quinctius. Although our ancestors established the rule that a man pleading on a matter affecting his civil rights should speak after the accuser, you see that we have to plead our cause first, without having heard the charge.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL240_39_a" id="target_note_LCL240_39_a"><sup>a</sup></a> And moreover, you see those who have been in the habit of speaking for the defence<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL240_39_b" id="target_note_LCL240_39_b"><sup>b</sup></a> playing the part of accusers to-day, and directing those abilities, which were formerly employed in saving and assisting, towards the work of destruction.
