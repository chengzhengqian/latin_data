<p>VIII. Quinctius returns to Rome, and appears to<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">30</span><span class="br"></span> his bail. This Naevius, a most violent fellow, who had taken possession of the property, had driven Quinctius out and robbed him of it, for eighteen months made no claim, kept quiet, amused Quinctius as long as he could with proposals for coming to terms, and finally applied to the praetor Gnaeus Dolabella<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL240_35_a" id="target_note_LCL240_35_a"><sup>a</sup></a> that Quinctius should give him security for payment of the judgement according to the formula: <span class="sc">in that he is claiming from one whose goods have been possessed for thirty days according to the praetor’s edict.</span>
Quinctius did not object to an order being made that he should give security, if his goods had really been “possessed” in accordance with the edict. The praetor gave a decision—how far equitable, I say nothing about that; I only say this, that it was an innovation, and I should have preferred to remain silent upon this point, since anyone could understand it, regarded from either point of view—and ordered Quinctius to enter into an engagement<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL240_35_b" id="target_note_LCL240_35_b"><sup>b</sup></a> with Naevius on the question:
<span class="sc">whether his goods had not been possessed for thirty days</span> according to the edict of Publius Burrienus the praetor.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL240_35_c" id="target_note_LCL240_35_c"><sup>c</sup></a> Quinctius’s supporters demurred; they pointed out that the trial ought to deal with the real question,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL240_35_d" id="target_note_LCL240_35_d"><sup>d</sup></a> so that either both parties or neither of them should give security; that there was no need for the reputation of either being put on trial.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL240_35_e" id="target_note_LCL240_35_e"><sup>e</sup></a>
