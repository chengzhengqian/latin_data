<p>V. All this took place at the suggestion and on the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">18</span><span class="br"></span> urgent advice of Naevius. Nor was it surprising that Quinctius took the advice of a man of whose assistance he felt assured; for Naevius had promised him not only in Gaul, but every day in Rome, that he would pay down the money as soon as Quinctius had given him a hint. Moreover, Quinctius knew that he was able to pay and felt that he ought to; he had no idea that he was telling him a lie, because there was no reason why he should do so. Accordingly, as if he had the money at home, he entered into a formal engagement to pay the Scapulae<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL240_25_d" id="target_note_LCL240_25_d"><sup>d</sup></a> informed Naevius, and asked him to see about getting the money, as he had promised.

phrase (<span class="italic">propter aerariam rationem</span>): (1) that the difference between Gallic and Roman money is meant, the debt having been incurred in Gaul and being payable in Rome, where the rate of exchange was different; (2) that it alludes to the state of the currency. M. Drusus (in 91) authorized the mint to issue one plated <span class="italic">denarius</span> in every seven, the result being that no one knew whether his money was good or bad; later (in 84) the praetors and tribunes decided to replace the plated <span class="italic">denarii</span> by silver. (3) To this Niebuhr objected that <span class="italic">argentaria</span> (not <span class="italic">aeraria</span>) would be the proper word, and explains the passage as referring to the <span class="italic">lex Valeria</span> brought forward by the consul L. Valerius Flaccus (86). By this law all debts were cancelled and creditors only received a quarter of their debt (like our composition of 5s. in the £). Mommsen agrees and explains the process as the substitution in calculation of the reduced <span class="italic">as</span> (1/16 of a <span class="italic">denarius</span>) for the libral as represented by the silver <span class="italic">sestertius.</span> According to Niebuhr, the law only applied to debts owing at the time, whence the difficulty of settling the amount of the debt to the Scapulae (see Roby, <span class="italic">Roman Private Law,</span> ii. p. 456).</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL240_25_aa').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL240_25_b"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL240_25_b" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">b</sup>The bankers’ counting-houses were near the temple of Castor in the Forum.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL240_25_b').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL240_25_c"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL240_25_c" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">c</sup>Or, how much should be deducted from the debt for each <span class="italic">denarius</span> paid.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL240_25_c').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL240_25_d"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL240_25_d" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">d</sup><span class="italic">Constituere</span> is a technical term, meaning to make a definite arrangement to pay a definite sum on a definite day.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL240_25_d').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
