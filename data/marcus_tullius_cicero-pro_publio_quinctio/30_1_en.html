At the time when you made application to the praetor to take possession of the property? There was certainly no one there then, for no one could foresee that you would make such a request, nor was it anyone’s business to object to what the praetor ordered, not to be done, but to be done in accordance with his edict.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL240_69_ba" id="target_note_LCL240_69_ba"><sup>b</sup></a> What<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">61</span><span class="br"></span> then was the first opportunity the agent had of defending the absent man?
