and also because brevity, which is most agreeable to myself, is required of me, who am incapable of thinking out or of delivering a long speech. I will do what<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">35</span><span class="br"></span> I have often observed you doing, Hortensius; I will divide my entire pleading under three distinct heads. You always do this, because you always can; I will do it in this case, because I think that in it I can; what your natural talent gives you the power of always doing, the nature of the cause permits me to do to-day. I will lay down for myself well-defined boundaries and limits which I must not overstep, however much I may desire to do so. Thus I shall have before me the subject of which I have to treat, and Hortensius will have a statement to which he has to reply, and you, Aquilius, will be able to understand in advance what are the matters which you are to hear discussed.</p>
<p>We deny, Sextus Naevius, that you have taken<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">36</span><span class="br"></span> possession of the goods of Publius Quinctius in accordance with the praetor’s edict. That is the question in regard to which the “engagement” was made. I will first prove that you had no grounds for applying to the praetor to authorize you to take possession of the goods; next, that you could not have taken possession of them in accordance with the edict; lastly, that you did not possess them at all. I beg you, Aquilius, and you his assessors, carefully to commit to memory the promise I have made; for, if you bear these points in mind, you will find it easier to understand the whole matter, and, as to myself, you will, by your influence, easily call me back, if I endeavour to pass beyond these barriers by which I have voluntarily confined myself. I deny that Naevius had any grounds for his application; I deny that he could have taken possession of the goods
