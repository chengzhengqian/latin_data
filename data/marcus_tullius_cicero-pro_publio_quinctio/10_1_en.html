<p>VI. I beg you. Aquilius, and you his assessors, to give me your earnest attention, that you may be able to understand a remarkable kind of fraud and an entirely new method of trickery. Naevius next<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">23</span><span class="br"></span> declared that he had sold by auction in Gaul whatever he thought fit; that he had taken care that the partnership should not be indebted to him; that he no longer claimed that Quinctius should produce bail nor was he ready to promise bail to him; but if Quinctius wished to bring any action against him, he had no objection to make. Since Quinctius desired to pay another visit to his property in Gaul, for the present he did not bind Naevius over to appear; and they separated without any appointment for appearance in court having been made. Next, Quinctius remains in Rome about thirty days; he adjourned any suits<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL240_29_a" id="target_note_LCL240_29_a"><sup>a</sup></a> that he had with others, so that he might be able to set out for Gaul free from anxiety. He set out and<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">24</span><span class="br"></span> left Rome on January 27,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL240_29_b" id="target_note_LCL240_29_b"><sup>b</sup></a> during the consulship of Scipio and Norbanus. I beg you to bear this date in mind. Lucius Albius, the son of Sextus, of the tribe of Quirinus, a worthy and especially honourable man, set out with him. After they had reached the fords of Volaterrae,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL240_29_c" id="target_note_LCL240_29_c"><sup>c</sup></a> as they are called, they saw an intimate friend of Naevius, one Lucius Publicius, who was bringing him some slaves from Gaul for sale, and on his arrival at Rome told Naevius where he had seen Quinctius. Had not Naevius received this information from Publicius, the matter would not have been so soon a subject of dispute in court.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL240_29_d" id="target_note_LCL240_29_d"><sup>d</sup></a> Then Naevius<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">25</span><span class="br"></span> sent his slaves round to all his friends, got together his acquaintances from the Licinian halls and the entrance to the market by his own efforts, and invited them to meet him at the counting-house of Sextius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL240_29_e" id="target_note_LCL240_29_e"><sup>e</sup></a>
