is there who can say that Quinctius kept out of the way with fraudulent intent, or can deny that he was defended during his absence? No one can be found to make such statements. On the contrary, all those<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">75</span><span class="br"></span> who have or have had dealings with him are here to support and defend him, and are doing their utmost to prevent my client’s good faith, well known in many places, from being disparaged by the perfidious slanders of Naevius.
