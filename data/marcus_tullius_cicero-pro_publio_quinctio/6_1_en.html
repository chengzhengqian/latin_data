<p>IV. After the partnership had lasted for several<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">14</span><span class="br"></span> years, Naevius had more than once been suspected by Gaius Quinctius, since he was unable to render a satisfactory account of certain transactions which he had carried on as he thought fit and not in accordance with the rules of business.
