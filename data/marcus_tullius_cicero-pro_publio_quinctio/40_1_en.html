Quinctius was turned out of his pasture on February 23; two days later, or, if we suppose that someone started running from the court immediately,
in less than three days, a journey of seven hundred miles was accomplished. Incredible! reckless<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">80</span><span class="br"></span> covetousness! A winged messenger! The agents and hangers-on of Sextus Naevius reached the territory of the Segusiavi<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL240_89_a" id="target_note_LCL240_89_a"><sup>a</sup></a> across the Alps from Rome in two days!
