Yet, if, in a cause in which the rights on both sides were equal, he were to be seen coming off defeated, even then there would be cause for complaint; but now, in a cause in which his rights are superior, he does not even demand to be considered on an equality; he is willing that he come off defeated, but only so far as not to be handed over with all his goods, fame, and fortunes to the greed and cruelty of Sextus Naevius.</p>
