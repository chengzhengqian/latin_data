troubles us? In the first place, his great peril<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">6</span><span class="br"></span> inspires my client with the greatest alarm, since he is staking all his fortunes on the issue of a single judgement; and when he reflects upon that, the idea of your power comes into his mind as often as that of your sense of justice; for, as a rule, all those whose life is in the hands of another think more often of what the man in whose absolute power they are is able to do than of what he ought to do. In the next place,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">7</span><span class="br"></span> Quinctius has for his opponent nominally Naevius, but in reality the most accomplished men of our time, the bravest and most prosperous of our citizens, who with united efforts and vast resources are defending Naevius, if to subserve the cupidity of one of the parties in order that he may be able the more easily to overwhelm anyone he chooses by an iniquitous trial—if that can be called defending. For can anything<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">8</span><span class="br"></span> more iniquitous or more scandalous be spoken of or mentioned, Gaius Aquilius, than the fact that I, who am defending the civil rights,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL240_15_a" id="target_note_LCL240_15_a"><sup>a</sup></a> the good name and fortunes of the other party, should have to plead my cause first,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL240_15_b" id="target_note_LCL240_15_b"><sup>b</sup></a> above all, when Hortensius, who in this trial fills the part of an accuser,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL240_15_c" id="target_note_LCL240_15_c"><sup>c</sup></a> upon whom nature has lavishly bestowed a wealth of language and the greatest eloquence, is going to speak against me? Thus it comes to pass that I, whose duty it is to repel the darts of the enemy and to heal the wounds inflicted by them, am compelled to perform this task, even before my adversaries have launched a single dart, while they have the time granted them for making an attack when we shall have been deprived of the power of avoiding their assault, and when, if they launch some false charge, as they are ready to do, we shall have no opportunity of applying an antidote.
