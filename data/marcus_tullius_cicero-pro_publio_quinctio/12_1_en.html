<p>VII. If what Naevius did in Gaul by written instructions appears to you to have been correct and regular, then you must think that all that he did in Rome was moderate and reasonable. Quinctius, expelled and driven out of his estate, having been subjected to such flagrant injustice, had recourse to Gaius Flaccus the governor, who was at that time in the province, and whom, as his rank demands, I mention with the respect due to his office.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL240_33_a" id="target_note_LCL240_33_a"><sup>a</sup></a> How severely he thought such a course of action ought to be punished, you will be able to learn from his decrees. In the meantime at Rome Alfenus was fighting daily<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">29</span><span class="br"></span> with this veteran gladiator; the people, no doubt, he had on his side, because his opponent continued to aim at the head.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL240_33_b" id="target_note_LCL240_33_b"><sup>b</sup></a> Naevius makes a formal application that the agent should give security for payment of the award if Quinctius lost his case. Alfenus says it was not fair that an agent should give security, which the defendant would not have to give if he were present in person.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL240_33_ca" id="target_note_LCL240_33_ca"><sup>c</sup></a> Thereupon Alfenus appeals to the tribunes<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL240_33_d" id="target_note_LCL240_33_d"><sup>d</sup></a>; and, after definite assistance had been asked from them, they separated on this occasion, on Alfenus promising that Quinctius should appear in court on September 13.</p>

Such an order was called <span class="italic">Interdictum de Vi.</span> Flaccus expressed his strong disapproval of Naevius’s action and issued some orders, but it is not known what they were or what was the result. C. Valerius Flaccus (consul 93) gained victories over the Gauls and the Celtiberi in Spain.

It would seem that in Cicero’s time the necessity for security in the representation
by a <span class="italic">procurator</span> admitted of exceptions, and at this time was not absolute. Perhaps Alfenus may have contended that there was no need for security, since Naevius claimed to be already in possession of all Quinctius’s estate (Roby). Or he may have been afraid of doing harm to Quinctius by giving a security which might be taken to mean not such as was required from a <span class="italic">procurator</span> but demanded from a defendant, in the <span class="italic">actio iudicati</span> (in the proceedings on the judgement).</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL240_33_ca').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL240_33_d"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL240_33_d" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">d</sup>The appeal was against the writ of possession. The praetor seems to have let it be known that, as Alfenus had refused to give the security required, he would make an order in favour of Naevius keeping possession of Quinctius’s property and authorize him to proceed to a sale.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL240_33_d').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
