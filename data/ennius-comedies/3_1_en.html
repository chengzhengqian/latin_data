<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">2002, 129; 2003, 223). The similarity of language probably reflects the uniform diction of the</span> palliata<span class="italic"> tradition (cf. Plaut. </span>Asin<span class="italic">. 774–86), while the parallel with Naevius further supports identification of the line with comedy, not satire (both considered by von Albrecht 1975, 237). On the fragment, and its implications for the comedies of Naevius and Ennius, see von Albrecht 1975, 235–39.</span></p>

<p class="noindent">There are also some signs of the fingers, and there are some of the eyes, by which they converse with each other silently and at a great distance. Such is the military custom, so that, whenever the army agrees, it makes assurances by hand because it cannot do so by voice. Others, since they cannot do so by voice, make a greeting with a movement of swords. [2] Ennius &lt;says&gt; about some unchaste girl:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line indent5">As if playing with a ball in a group</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">she offers herself from hand to hand and makes herself common.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">She holds one, nods to another, elsewhere a hand</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">is busy, one she pinches at the foot,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">to another she gives a ring to look at, from her lips</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">she summons one, and she sings with yet another; still</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">she makes letters with her finger for others.</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
