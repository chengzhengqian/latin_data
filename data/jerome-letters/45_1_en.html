weep and groan when the serpent again invites me to take forbidden fruit, and when, after driving us from the Paradise of virginity, he tries to clothe us in tunics of skin, such as Elijah on his return to Paradise threw upon the ground? What have I to do with the short-lived pleasures of sense? What have I to do with the sirens’ sweet and deadly songs? You must not be subject to the sentence whereby condemnation was passed upon mankind: ‘In pain and in sorrow shalt thou bring forth children.’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL262_91_1" id="target_note_LCL262_91_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Say to yourself: ‘That is a Law for a married woman, but not for me.’ ‘And thy desire shall be to thy husband.’ Say to yourself: ‘Let her desire be to her husband who has not a Husband in Christ;’ and at the last ‘Thou shalt surely die.’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL262_91_2" id="target_note_LCL262_91_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Say once more:
‘Death is the end of marriage. But my vows are independent of sex. Let married women keep to their own place and title: for me virginity is consecrated in the persons of Mary and of Christ.’</p>
<p>Some one may say: ‘Do you dare to disparage wedlock, a state which God has blessed?’ It is not disparaging wedlock to prefer virginity. No one can make a comparison between two things, if one is good and the other evil. Let married women take their pride in coming next after virgins. ‘Be fruitful,’ God said, ‘and multiply and replenish the earth.’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL262_91_3" id="target_note_LCL262_91_3"><sup>3</sup></a> Let him then be fruitful and multiply who intends to replenish the earth: but your company is in heaven. The command to increase and multiply is fulfilled after the expulsion from Paradise, after the recognition of nakedness, after the putting on of the fig leaves which augured the approach of marital desire. Let them marry and be given in marriage who eat their bread in the sweat of their brow, whose land brings forth thorns
