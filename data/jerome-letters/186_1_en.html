try to avoid present temptations. It is inconsistent surely to hide one’s body, and to allow one’s tongue to roam the world.’ Thereupon he answered: ‘You are too fearful; where now is the hardihood wherewith, like Lucilius of old,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL262_373_1" id="target_note_LCL262_373_1"><sup>1</sup></a> you scoured the city with abundant salt?’ It is just that,’ said I, ‘which deters me and forbids me now to open my lips. Because I tried to convict crime I have myself been made out a criminal. It is like the popular proverb:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL262_373_2" id="target_note_LCL262_373_2"><sup>2</sup></a> as all the world declares on oath that I have no ears, I believe it too and do not touch them. The very walls resounded with curses against me and “I was the song of drunkards.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL262_373_3" id="target_note_LCL262_373_3"><sup>3</sup></a> I have been taught by painful experience to hold my tongue, and now I think it better to set a guard to my mouth, and keep the door of my lips close fastened, rather than to incline my heart to malicious words, and while censuring the faults of others myself to fall into that of detraction.’ To that he said: ‘Speaking the truth is not detraction, and a special rebuke is not a general lecture. There are few persons or none who are guilty of this particular fault. I beg you therefore not to let me have made this long and painful journey<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL262_373_4" id="target_note_LCL262_373_4"><sup>4</sup></a> in vain. The Lord knows that after the sight of the holy places my chief motive for coming was to get you to restore me by a letter to my mother and sister.’ ‘Well, well,’ I answered, ‘I will do as you wish. My letters will pass across the sea, and a discourse specially composed can seldom offend others. I warn you, however, to keep what I say private. Take it as part of your luggage, and if it is listened to, let us rejoice together. But if it is rejected, as I rather think it will be, I shall have wasted my words and you your long journey.’</p>
