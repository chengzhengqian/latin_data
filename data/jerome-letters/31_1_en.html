the flesh and the allurements of sin, keeps his body down and subjects it to slavery, lest in preaching to others he himself be found a reprobate. But still he sees that there is another law in his members fighting against the law of his will, and that he is still led captive to the law of sin. After nakedness, fasting, hunger, prison, scourging and torture, he turns back upon himself and cries: ‘Oh, wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me from the body of this death?’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL262_63_1" id="target_note_LCL262_63_1"><sup>1</sup></a> If that is so with him, do you think that you ought to lay aside all fear?
