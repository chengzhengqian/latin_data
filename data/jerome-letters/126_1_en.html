speaking confess the secrets of the heart. I have lately seen a scandalous object flitting this way and that through the East. Her age, her style, her dress, her mien, the indiscriminate company she kept, and the regal pomp of her elaborate dinners, all proclaimed her a fitting bride for Nero or Sardanapallus.
