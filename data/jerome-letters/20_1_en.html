it. There is danger in its depths, the foe is lurking there. Stow your tackle, reef your sails, and let the cross which the yard-arm makes be fastened on your front. That stillness means a tempest.</p>
<p>Well, you may say, are not all my fellow-townsmen Christians? Your case is not the same as that of other men. Listen to the Lord speaking; ‘If thou wilt be perfect go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and come and follow me.’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL262_41_1" id="target_note_LCL262_41_1"><sup>1</sup></a> You promised to be perfect. When you gave up the army and made yourself an eunuch for the kingdom of heaven’s sake, what other purpose had you in view save the perfect life?
