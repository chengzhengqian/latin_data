the older a man is, the heavier is the load of sin he takes with him on his journey.</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">‘Ο hapless men! the brightest years are first</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">To fly: disease and age come on us soon</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">And trouble and the ruthlessness of death.’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL262_297_1" id="target_note_LCL262_297_1"><sup>1</sup></a></span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">So the poet Naevius says: ‘Mortals perforce must many ills endure.’ Therefore antiquity feigned that Niobe, because of her long weeping, was turned into stone, and that other women were changed into various kinds of animals, Hecuba, for example, into a dog. Hesiod too bewails men’s birthdays and rejoices at their death, and Ennius wisely says:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">‘The mob in this outvies the kingly state,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">For they may weep; tears to a king are shame.’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL262_297_2" id="target_note_LCL262_297_2"><sup>2</sup></a></span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">As with a king, so with a bishop: or rather a bishop has less licence than a king. The king rules over the unwilling, the bishop over the willing. The king subdues by inspiring fear, the bishop is master because he is servant. The king guards bodies for future death, the bishop saves souls for eternal life. The eyes of all men are turned upon you, your house is set as it were upon a watch-tower, and your life gives to all a lesson of public discipline. Whatever you do, everyone thinks that he may do also. Take care not to commit any act which those who wish to blame you may seem right in censuring, or which would force those who wish to imitate you to do wrong. Use all your strength, and even more, to overcome the softness of your heart, and check the copious flood of your tears lest your great love for your nephew be taken by unbelievers as showing despair of God. You must regret him not as one
