<p>I write this in haste, dear lady Asella, as I go on board ship, grieving and in tears; and I thank my God that I am held worthy of the world’s hate. Pray for me that from Babylon I may return to Jerusalem, and that Joshua, son of Josedech, may have dominion over me rather than Nebuchadnezzar,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL262_187_1" id="target_note_LCL262_187_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and that Ezra, whose name means ‘helper,’ may come and bring me back to my own country. Foolish was I, who wished to sing the Lord’s song in a strange land,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL262_187_2" id="target_note_LCL262_187_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and left Mount Sion to seek the help of Egypt.

The Jews called my master a magician, and the great apostle was spoken of as a deceiver. ‘There hath no temptation taken me but such as is common to man.’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL262_187_4" id="target_note_LCL262_187_4"><sup>4</sup></a> How few troubles have I endured, I who am a soldier of the cross? Men have laid upon me the disgrace of a false charge, but I know that the road to the kingdom of heaven leads alike through good report and through evil.</p>
<p>Greet Paula and Eustochium for me—whether the world wills it or no, they are mine in Christ—also your mother Albina and your sisters the two Marcellas,
