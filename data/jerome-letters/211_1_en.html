enough merely to seek peace; when we have found it and it flies from us, we must pursue with all our might. ‘Peace passeth all understanding,’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL262_423_1" id="target_note_LCL262_423_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and in it is God’s dwelling. As the prophet says:’ In peace also is His habitation.’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL262_423_2" id="target_note_LCL262_423_2"><sup>2</sup></a> The pursuing of peace is a fine metaphor, and is like the saying of the apostle,’ pursuing hospitality.’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL262_423_3" id="target_note_LCL262_423_3"><sup>3</sup></a> Our invitation to guests should not be a mere light form of words, spoken, if I may use the phrase, with the surface of the lips; we should be as eager to detain them as if they were robbers carrying off our savings.</p>

There is one pilot in a ship, one master in a house; and however large an army may be, the soldiers await one man’s signal. I will not weary my reader with further repetition, for the purpose of all these examples is simply this. I want to show you that you had better not be left to your own discretion, but should rather live in a monastery under the control of one father and with many companions.
