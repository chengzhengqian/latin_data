Just lately I saw the greatest lady in Rome—I will not give her name, for this is not a satire—standing in the church of the blessed Peter with her band of eunuchs in front. She was giving money to the poor with her own hand to increase her reputation for sanctity; and she gave them each a penny! At that moment—as
