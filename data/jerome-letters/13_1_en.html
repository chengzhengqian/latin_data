mother to us all, with the deep respect which you know I feel. She is your close associate in holy life; but she has one advantage over you in that she is the mother of such sons as yourselves. Truly her womb may be called golden. I salute your sisters also, for they are worthy of universal respect. They have triumphed over sex and the world, and now await the Bridegroomâ€™s coming, their lamps well filled with oil.

My words pour out in eager haste; my language is confused and disjointed; but love knows nothing of order.</p>
