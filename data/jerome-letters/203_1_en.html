abandon their sisters who are virgins, and unite themselves to widows who are no relations. There are women who hate their own kin and feel no affection for their family. Their restlessness reveals their state of mind, for it disdains excuses and rends asunder like cobwebs any veils that might conceal their licentiousness. You may see some men also with girded loins, sombre tunics and long beards, who yet can never leave women’s society. They live with them under one roof, they go out to dinner with them, they have young girls to wait upon them, and, save that they are not called husbands, they enjoy all the privileges of marriage. But it is no fault of Christianity if a hypocrite falls into sin: rather it is the confusion of the Gentiles when they see that the churches condemn what is condemned by all honest folk.</p>
<p>If you wish to be, and not merely seem, a monk, have regard not for your property—you began your vows by renouncing it—but for your soul. Let a squalid garb be the evidence of a clean heart: let a coarse tunic prove that you despise the world; provided only that you do not pride yourself on such things nor let your dress and language be at variance. Avoid hot baths: your aim is to quench the heat of the body by the help of chilling fasts. But let your fasts be moderate, since if they are carried to excess they weaken the stomach, and by making more food necessary to make up for it lead to indigestion, which is the parent of lust. A frugal, temperate diet is good both for body and soul.</p>
<p>See your mother often, but do not be forced to see other women when you visit her. Their faces may dwell in your heart and so</p>
