to have passed over this subject completely, I will say now that the apostle bids us pray without ceasing, and that the man who in the married state renders his wife her due cannot so pray. Either we pray always and are virgins; or we cease to pray that we may perform our marital service. The apostle says also: ‘If a virgin marry she hath not sinned. Nevertheless such shall have trouble in the flesh.’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL262_103_1" id="target_note_LCL262_103_1"><sup>1</sup></a> At the outset of my book I promised that I should say little or nothing of the troubles of wedlock, and now I give you the same warning again. But if you wish to know from how many vexations a virgin is free and by how many a wife is fettered, you should read Tertullian’s
‘To a philosophic friend,’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL262_103_2" id="target_note_LCL262_103_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and his other treatises on virginity; the blessed Cyprian’s notable book; the writings of Pope Damasus in prose and verse; and the essays recently written by our own Ambrose for his sister.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL262_103_3" id="target_note_LCL262_103_3"><sup>3</sup></a> In these he has poured forth his soul with such eloquence that he has sought out, set forth, and arranged all that bears on the praise of virgins.</p>

The first is a matter of judgment and we share it with many: the second calls for labour and for that few care. The Lord says: ‘He that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved,’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL262_103_4" id="target_note_LCL262_103_4"><sup>4</sup></a> and ‘Many are called but few are chosen.’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL262_103_5" id="target_note_LCL262_103_5"><sup>5</sup></a> Therefore before God and Jesus Christ and His chosen angels I adjure you to guard what you have, and not lightly to expose to the public gaze the vessels of the Lord’s temple which priests alone are allowed to see. No man that is profane may look upon God’s
