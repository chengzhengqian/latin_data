still refuse, if with wrinkled brow you reject my warning, then this letter will cry aloud to you with unchecked voice. ‘Why,’ it will say, ‘do you besiege another’s servant? Why do you make Christ’s minister your slave? Look at the people and regard each individual face. When he is reading in church the whole congregation fix their eyes on you: but you perhaps with almost a wife’s recklessness glory in your shame, and secret disgrace no longer satisfies you; you call boldness freedom. “You have a whore’s forehead and refuse to be ashamed.”’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL262_393_1" id="target_note_LCL262_393_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Again you cry out that I am a malignant, that I am suspicious, that I am a scandal-monger. Am I truly suspicious or malignant, I who, as I said at the beginning of this letter, only took up my pen because I felt no suspicions of you? Is it not you rather who are careless, loose and scornful, you who at the age of twenty-five have caught in the snare of your arms a youth whose beard has hardly grown? A fine instructor in truth he must be, able to advise, by stern looks to frighten, and even by his grey hair to defend you from open shame! Not but what lust is never safe at any time of life. The day will surely, surely come—for
time glides on while you notice it not—when your handsome youngster will find a richer or a more youthful mistress. Women soon grow old, especially when they live with a man at their side. You will be sorry for your decision and regret your obstinacy, on the day when you find property and reputation gone and this unhappy union happily broken—unless perhaps you feel quite at ease, and seeing that your affection has had so long a time to become established, you have no fear of a rupture.</p>
