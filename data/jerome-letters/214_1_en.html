your own accord what was at first a matter of compulsion; you will take pleasure in your labours, and forgetting what is behind you will reach out to that which is before; you will not think at all of the evil that others do, but only of the good which it is your duty to perform.</p>
<p>Do not be influenced by the number of those that sin, or disturbed by the host of the perishing, so as to have the unspoken thought: ‘What? Shall all then perish who live in cities? Behold, they enjoy their property, they serve in the churches, they frequent the baths, they do not disdain unguents, and yet they flourish and are universally respected.’ To such reasonings I have replied before, and will now do so briefly again, merely remarking that in this present short treatise I am not discussing the behaviour of the clergy, but laying down rules for a monk.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL262_429_1" id="target_note_LCL262_429_1"><sup>1</sup></a> The clergy are holy men, and in every case their life is worthy of praise. Go then and so live in your monastery that you may deserve to be a clergyman, that you may keep your youth free from all stain of defilement, and that you may come forth to Christ’s altar as a virgin steps from her bower; that you may be well spoken of abroad, and that women may know your reputation but not your looks. When you come to ripe years, that is, if life be granted you, and have been appointed as a clergyman either by the people or by the bishop of the city, then act as becomes a cleric, and among your colleagues choose the better men as your models. In every rank and condition of life the very bad is mingled with the very good.</p>
<p>Do not rashly leap into authorship, and be led by light-headed madness. Spend years in learning
