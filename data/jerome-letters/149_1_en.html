who is dead, but as one who has gone away. Let men see that you have not lost him, but are waiting to see him again.</p>
<p>But what am I doing in thus seeking to heal a pain which I imagine has already been assuaged by time and philosophy? Why do I not rather unfold to you the miseries of kings<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL262_299_1" id="target_note_LCL262_299_1"><sup>1</sup></a> in our near neighbourhood and the disasters that have come upon our age? He who has escaped from this world’s light is not so much to be lamented as he is to be congratulated on having been saved from such great evils. Constantius,
the patron of the Arian heresy, was making preparations against his enemy and advancing in haste to give him battle, when he died at the village of Mopsus, and to his great grief left the empire to the foe.

Constantius died in 361 while marching to Constantinople to resist Julian. Julian was killed fighting the Persians in 363, and was succeeded by Jovian who only reigned a few months. His place was taken in the West by Valentinian (364–375), and in the East by Valens (364–378), while Gratian, who came next, was murdered at Lyons in 383. Procopius, Maximus and Eugenius were usurpers of short duration, overthrown by Theodosius the Great (379–395).</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL262_299_1').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
