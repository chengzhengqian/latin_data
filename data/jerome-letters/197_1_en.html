<p>As for you, my friend’s mother, your age frees you from any fear of scandal; but do not think that it gives you liberty to do wrong. Your daughter should rather learn from you how to separate from a companion than you be taught by her how to break away from a paramour. You have a son and a daughter and a son-in-law, or rather a man who lives under your daughter’s roof. Why seek other consolations or try to wake sleeping fires? It would at least be more respectable for you to screen your daughter’s fault than to seek in it an occasion for wrongdoing on your own part. Let your son who is a monk live with you and strengthen you in your natural affection and in your vow of widowhood. Why do you have a stranger in the house that could not hold a son and a daughter? You are old enough now to have grandchildren by your daughter. Invite the pair to your home. Let her return with her man, she who went out alone. I say ‘man,’ not ‘husband’; so no one need cavil; I merely refer to his sex and not to any conjugal relationship. If she is ashamed and hangs back, and thinks the house where she was born is too small for her, then let all of you move to her lodging. However cramped it may be, it can more easily contain a mother and a brother than it could a strange man, for surely she could not have remained in the same bedroom with him. Let there be two females and two males in the one house. But if the third male too, that ‘nurturer of your old age,’ refuses to leave you and stirs up quarrels and confusion, be it a team of two, be it a team of three, he who is both brother and son will offer to the other men a sister and a mother.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL262_395_1" id="target_note_LCL262_395_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Others may speak of them as step-father and son-in-law: your son must call them foster-father and brother.</p>
