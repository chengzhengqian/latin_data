Jonah, and to the publican in the Gospel.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL262_321_1" id="target_note_LCL262_321_1"><sup>1</sup></a> The first not only earned God’s pardon but regained his kingdom; the second broke the force of God’s impending anger; the third smiting his breast with his fists would not lift his eyes to heaven, and yet by the humble confession of his faults he went away more justified than the Pharisee with his arrogant boasting of his virtues.
