is duly arranged; he takes short cuts, and importunately thrusts his old head almost into the bedchambers of ladies still asleep. If he sees a cushion, or an elegant table cover, or indeed any article of furniture that he fancies, he begins praising and admiring it and takes it in his hand, and so, lamenting that he has nothing like this, he begs or rather extorts it from the owner, as all the women are afraid to offend the town gossip. He hates chastity and he hates fasting: what he likes is a savoury lunch—say a plump young bird such as is commonly called a cheeper. He has a rough and saucy tongue always well equipped with abusive words. Wherever you betake yourself, he is the first man you see. Whatever news is noised abroad, he either originates the story or else exaggerates it. He changes horses every hour; and his nags are so sleek and spirited that you might take him to be own brother to Diomede of Thrace.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL262_121_1" id="target_note_LCL262_121_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

If you feel ignorant or have any doubt about some passage in Scripture, ask advice from some man whose life commends him, whose age puts him above suspicion, and whose reputation stands high with all; one who can say:
‘I have espoused you to one husband, a chaste virgin to present to Christ.’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL262_121_4" id="target_note_LCL262_121_4"><sup>4</sup></a> If there is no one at hand able to resolve your difficulty, remember that peaceful ignorance is better than dangerous
