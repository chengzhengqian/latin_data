lodges in a stone, but it sometimes recoils and wounds the shooter. Let detractors, seeing your reluctance to listen, learn not to be so ready to detract. Solomon says: ‘Meddle not with them that are given to detraction: for their calamity shall rise suddenly; and who knoweth the destruction of them both?’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL262_225_1" id="target_note_LCL262_225_1"><sup>1</sup></a>—the
destruction, that is, both of the detractor and of the person who lends ear to him.</p>
<p>It is part of your duty to visit the sick, to be acquainted with people’s households, with matrons, and with their children, and to be entrusted with the secrets of the great. Let it therefore be your duty to keep your tongue chaste as well as your eyes. Never discuss a woman’s looks, nor let one house know what is going on in another. Hippocrates,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL262_225_2a" id="target_note_LCL262_225_2a"><sup>2</sup></a> before he will instruct his pupils, makes them take an oath and compels them to swear obedience to him. That oath exacts from them silence, and prescribes for them their language, gait, dress, and manners. How much greater an obligation is laid on us who have been entrusted with the healing of souls! We ought to love every Christian household as though it were our own. Let them know us as comforters in their sorrows rather than as guests in their days of prosperity. A clergyman soon becomes an object of contempt, if, however often he is invited to dinner, he does not refuse.</p>
<p>We should never ask for gifts, and seldom accept them even when begged to do so. Somehow or other the very man who entreats leave to offer you a present holds you the cheaper for accepting it; if you refuse, it is strange how much more admiration
