should be rendered to our Creator. We should rise from our bed two or three times in the night, and go over those passages of Scripture which we know by heart. Let prayer arm us when we leave our lodging: when we return from the streets let us pray before we sit down, nor give our miserable body rest until our soul is fed. In everything we do, in every step we take let our hand trace the sign of the Lord’s cross. Speak against no one, and slander not thy mother’s son. ‘Who art thou that judgest the servant of another? To his own lord he standeth or falleth; yea, he shall be made to stand, for the Lord hath power to make him stand.’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL262_145_1" id="target_note_LCL262_145_1"><sup>1</sup></a> If you have fasted for the space of two days, do not think that you are better than those who have not fasted. You fast and are angry; another eats and wears a smiling face. You work off your irritation and hunger by quarrelling with others; your neighbour feeds in moderation and gives thanks to God. Therefore Isaiah proclaims to us every day: ‘Is it such a fast, that I have chosen, saith the Lord?’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL262_145_2" id="target_note_LCL262_145_2"><sup>2</sup></a> And again: ‘In the day of your fast ye find your own pleasure and oppress all your labourers. If ye fast for strife and contention and smite the lowly with your fist, the fist of wickedness, how fast ye unto me?’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL262_145_3" id="target_note_LCL262_145_3"><sup>3</sup></a> What sort of fast can that be when not only does the night fall upon a man’s wrath, but even the full moon leaves it unchanged? Look to yourself and glory not in the fall of others, but only in your own works.</p>
