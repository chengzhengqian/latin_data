single hour can change a man’s fashion of dress and outward appearance. All other sins are outside ourselves, and what is external can easily be cast away. Carnal desire alone, implanted in men by God for the procreation of children, if it oversteps its due limits, becomes a sin, and by a law of nature burns to force its way to carnal intercourse. It is a task for pre-eminent virtue and the most watchful care, seeing that you were born in the flesh, not to live the life of the flesh. You must fight against yourself every day and keep guard against the enemy within you with the hundred eyes of the fabled Argus.

On the other hand they say that for old people who suffer from humours and from chilliness, warm food and old wine are beneficial. Hence the Saviour says: ‘Take heed to yourselves lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting and drunkenness, and cares of this life.’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL262_245_2" id="target_note_LCL262_245_2"><sup>2</sup></a> So too the apostle: ‘Be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess.’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL262_245_3" id="target_note_LCL262_245_3"><sup>3</sup></a> No wonder that the potter felt thus about the frail vessel which He had made,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL262_245_4" id="target_note_LCL262_245_4"><sup>4</sup></a> seeing</p>
