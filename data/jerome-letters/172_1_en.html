conception. In our own days we have seen something such as we read of in the prophets: Hannah exchanged her barrenness for fruitful motherhood, you have exchanged a fertility bound up with sorrow for children who will live for ever. I tell you confidently that you who have given your first-born to the Lord will receive sons at His hand. The firstborn are the offerings due under the Law. Such was the case both with Samuel and with Samson, and so it was that John the Baptist leaped for joy when Mary came in.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL262_345_1" id="target_note_LCL262_345_1"><sup>1</sup></a> For he heard the thunder of the Lord’s voice on the Virgin’s lips, and was eager to break out from his mother’s womb to meet Him. Therefore let your child of promise have a training from her parents worthy of her birth. Samuel was nurtured in the Temple, John was trained in the Wilderness. The one inspired veneration with his long hair, took neither wine nor strong drink, and even in his childhood talked with God.

It must have no comprehension of foul words, no knowledge of worldly songs, and its childish tongue must be imbued with the sweet music of the psalms. Let boys with their wanton frolics be kept far from Paula: let even her maids and attendants hold aloof from association with the worldly, lest they render their evil knowledge worse by teaching it to her.
