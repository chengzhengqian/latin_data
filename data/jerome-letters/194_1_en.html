<p>You will reply:’ From what source do you know all this about me? How could you ever have set eyes upon me when you live so far away?’ Your brother’s tears told me this and his scarcely endurable outbursts of sobbing. Would that he may have spoken falsely, would that his words may have been the expression of fears, not of facts! But believe me, sister; no one ever weeps when he is lying. He is indignant that a young man is preferred to himself, not indeed a long-haired fop in silk clothes, but still a coxcomb dainty even in his squalor, a rogue who puts his own seal on your purse, manages the weaving, apportions the wool to be spun, directs the household, and buys all that is needed in the market. He is both steward and master, and anticipates the servants in all their duties, so that the whole household have their teeth in him and protest that he has filched all that their mistress does not give them. Servants are always full of complaints, and, however much you give them, it is always too little. They do not consider how much you have, but only how much they get, and they console their indignation in the only way they can, by finding fault. One calls him a parasite, another an incubus, another a legacy-hunter, another any fresh name he can invent. They put it about that he sits at your bedside, fetches nurses when you feel unwell, removes the slops, makes you warm bandages, and folds compresses. People are only too ready to believe evil, and tales invented within doors soon get noised abroad. Nor need you wonder that your maids and footmen invent such tales about you both, when even your mother and brother make similar complaints.</p>
