Lord. She kneels on the bare ground, and with frequent tears cleanses the face that was once denied with white lead. After prayer comes the singing of psalms; her neck grows weary, her knees totter, her eyes drop off to sleep; but her ardent spirit will hardly give them leave to rest. Her dress is of dark stuff; therefore it is scarcely soiled by lying on the ground. Her slippers are of a cheap sort; the price of gilded boots will be given as alms to the needy. Her girdle is not adorned with jewels or gold; it is made of wool, perfectly simple and clean, and it is intended to keep her dress close rather than to cut her figure into two halves. If the scorpion, jealous of her resolute purpose, with soft words persuades her to eat again of the forbidden tree, let a curse crush him instead of a boot, and let her say, as he lies dying in the dust that is his due: ‘Get thee behind me, Satan.’ The word Satan means ‘adversary,’ since Christ’s adversary is the Antichrist, who finds Christ’s precepts displeasing.</p>
<p>Pray, have we ever done anything such as the apostles did that men should have reason to be offended with us? The apostles left their boat and their net and their aged father. The publican got up from the receipt of custom and followed the Saviour. When a disciple wished to go back home and give a message first to his people, the Master’s voice forbade him. A father even was refused burial; for it is a form of duty to be undutiful for the Lord’s sake. We on the other hand are called monks merely because we do not dress in silk. We are dubbed ‘sour puritans,’ because we do not get drunk or burst into loud guffaws. If our tunic is not spotlessly white, the cry goes up from the street: ‘Greek charlatan.’
