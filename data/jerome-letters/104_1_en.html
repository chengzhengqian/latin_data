according to sound doctrine, so that you may be able thereby to exhort and refute the gainsayers. ‘Continue thou in the things that thou hast learned and hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned them’;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL262_209_1" id="target_note_LCL262_209_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and ‘Be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope and faith that are in you.’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL262_209_2" id="target_note_LCL262_209_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Your deeds must not belie your words, lest, when you are speaking in church, some one may say to himself: ‘Why do you not practise what you preach?’ A teacher fond of good living may fill his own stomach and then discourse on the benefits of fasting; even a robber can possibly accuse others of greed; but in a priest of Christ mind and mouth should be in harmony.</p>
