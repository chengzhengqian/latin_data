father, to whom in Christ’s cause I owe no rites of burial, although in Christ’s cause I owe them to all men? Peter with his craven counsel was an offence to Our Lord before His passion. Paul’s answer to his brothers, who would have stayed his journey to Jerusalem, was this: ‘What mean ye, to weep and to break my heart? For I am ready not to be bound only, but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL262_35_1" id="target_note_LCL262_35_1"><sup>1</sup></a> The battering-ram of affection which shakes faith must be beaten back by the wall of the Gospel: ‘My mother and my brethren are these, whosoever do the will of my father which is in heaven.’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL262_35_2" id="target_note_LCL262_35_2"><sup>2</sup></a> If men believe in Christ, they should cheer me on as I go to fight in His name.

He lieth in wait secretly as a lion in his den; he lieth in wait to catch the poor,’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL262_35_5" id="target_note_LCL262_35_5"><sup>5</sup></a> and do you, his destined prey, enjoy your soft slumbers under the shady covering of a leafy tree? On one side self-indulgence pursues me, on another avarice tries to break in, on another my belly
