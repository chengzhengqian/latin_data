in between mother and children? It is the glory of a bishop to provide means for the poor, but it is a disgrace for any priest to think of wealth for himself. Though I was born in a humble home beneath the roof of a country cottage and once could scarcely get enough millet and coarse bread to satisfy the howlings of my stomach, yet now I turn up my nose at wheaten flour and honey cakes, I know the various kinds of fish and their different names, I can tell for certain on what coast an oyster has been picked,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL262_207_1" id="target_note_LCL262_207_1"><sup>1</sup></a> I can distinguish by the taste from what province a bird comes, and it is the rarity of a dish and, in the last stage, the money that is wasted on it that gives me pleasure.</p>
<p>I have been told that in some cases disgraceful court is paid to old men and women who have no children.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL262_207_2" id="target_note_LCL262_207_2"><sup>2</sup></a> These servile flatterers fetch the basin, sit by the bed, and catch in their own hands ordure and spittle. They tremble at the doctor’s appearance, and with quivering lips inquire if his patient is better. If for a little while the old fellow plucks up some strength, they are at their wits’ end, and while they pretend to be glad their greedy soul suffers torments within. For they are afraid that they may have wasted their attentions, and they compare an old man with a good hold on life to Methuselah. How great would be their reward with the Lord, if they did not hope for immediate profit. With what labour do they seek an empty inheritance! At less trouble they could have bought for themselves the pearl of Christ.</p>
<p>Read God’s Book continually; nay, never let the sacred volume be out of your hand. Learn, so that you may teach. Hold fast to the words of faith
