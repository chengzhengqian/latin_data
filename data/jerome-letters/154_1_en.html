correction is something taken from my span. Every stroke of my secretary’s pen is so much loss of life for me. We write letters and send replies, our messages cross the seas, and as the ship cleaves a furrow through the waves the moments that we have to live grow less. We have but one profit: we are joined together by the love of Christ. ‘Charity suffereth long and is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up; beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things. Charity never faileth.’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL262_309_1" id="target_note_LCL262_309_1"><sup>1</sup></a> It lives ever in the heart, and by it our Nepotian is present though absent, and grasps us each by a hand, severed as we are in distant lands. We have in him a pledge of our mutual love. Let us join in spirit, let us bind ourselves together in affection’s chains, and let us who have lost a son take pattern by the courage that the blessed Pope Chromatius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL262_309_2" id="target_note_LCL262_309_2"><sup>2</sup></a> showed when his brother fell asleep. Let our pages chant his praise, let every letter echo his name. We cannot have him in the body, but let us hold him fast in remembrance. We cannot speak with him, but let u never cease to speak of him.</p>

She divorced her first husband and then married again, but did penance for this error and visited the Holy Land, where she was staying with Jerome when the Huns invaded Palestine. She then returned to Rome, and in conjunction with Pammachius, the widowed husband of the rich Paulina, established a hostel for travellers at Ostia just before her death. Cf. App., p. 486.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL262_309_3a').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
