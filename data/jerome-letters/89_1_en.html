sweeter life. These are the types and figures that virgins and matrons may find in your gifts. To myself also they have an application; although in my case they go by the rule of contrary. Sitting on chairs is suitable for those who have no work to do, lying on sackcloth for those who repent of the past, holding cups for those who drink deep.
