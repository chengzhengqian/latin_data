by a great distance, and his departure always causes me as much regret as his coming has brought delight.</p>
<p>Now I talk to your letter, I embrace it, it carries on a conversation with me, it is the only thing here that knows Latin. In this place an old man has either to learn a barbarous jargon, or else to hold his tongue. The handwriting I know so well brings your dear faces before my eyes; and then either I am no longer here or else you are here with me. Believe love when it tells you the truth: as I write this letter I see you before me. However, I have one complaint to make first. Why is it that with such stretches of sea and land between us you sent me so short a letter? Perhaps I deserved it; for as you say, I did not write first. Paper, I imagine, cannot have failed you now that Egypt supplies the market. Even if some Ptolemy had closed the seas, King Attalus was there to send you skins from Pergamum, and by parchment you could have made up for lack of paper. The very word parchment as it exists to-day, handed down from generation to generation, reveals its origin. Well, am I to suppose that your messenger was pressed for time? One night is sufficient to write a letter in, however long the letter be. Were you prevented by some urgent business? Nothing has a greater claim on you than affection. Two reasons are left; either you felt disinclined, or else I was not deserving. I prefer to accuse you of sloth rather than condemn myself as unworthy. The correction of carelessness is an easier matter than the birth of love.</p>
