<p><span class="sc">Your</span> own heart conscious of our mutual affection knows with what loving zeal I urged you to let us stay together in the desert. This letter even, blotted, as you see, with tears, bears witness to the grief, the sobs, and the lamentations wherewith I accompanied your departure. You, like some spoilt child, smoothed over your contemptuous refusal then with soft words and I in my folly did not know what to do. Ought I to have held my tongue? I could not conceal my ardent desires under a cloak of indifference. Ought I to have pleaded with more urgency? You would not have listened, for you did not love me as I loved you. The affection you scorned has done the one thing it could. It was not able to keep you when present, but it now comes to seek you when you are far away. At your departure you asked me to send you a letter of invitation when I took up my home in the desert, and I promised that I would do so. That letter of invitation I now send: come, and come quickly. Do not think of old ties—the desert loves the naked—do not be deterred by the hardships of our former travels. As you believe in Christ, believe also in his words: ‘Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and all these things shall be added unto you’!<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL262_29_1" id="target_note_LCL262_29_1"><sup>1</sup></a> You need not take scrip nor staff; he is abundantly rich who is poor with Christ.</p>
