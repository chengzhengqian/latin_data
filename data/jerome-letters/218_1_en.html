<p>I have spoken thus definitely because I wish to free a young friend of mine from an itching tongue and itching ears, so that I may present him born again in Christ without spot or roughness as a chaste virgin, holy both in body and in mind. I would not have him boast in name alone, or be shut out by the Bridegroom because his lamp has gone out for want of the oil of good works. You have in your town a saintly and most learned prelate, Proculus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL262_437_1" id="target_note_LCL262_437_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and he by the living sound of his voice can do more for you than any pages I can write. By daily homilies he will keep you in the straight path and not suffer you to turn right or left and leave the king’s highway, whereby Israel undertakes to pass on its hasty journey to the promised land. May the voice of the Church’s supplication be heard:’ Lord, ordain peace for us, for thou also hast wrought all our works for us.’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL262_437_2" id="target_note_LCL262_437_2"><sup>2</sup></a> May our renunciation of the world be a matter of free will and not of necessity! May we seek poverty as a glorious thing, not have it forced upon us as a punishment! However, in our present miseries, with swords raging fiercely all around us, he is rich enough who is not in actual want of bread, he is more powerful than he needs be who is not reduced to slavery.

Yet none is richer than he; for in his wicker basket he carries the body of the Lord and in his glass cup His blood. He has driven greed from the temple; without scourge of ropes or chiding words he has overthrown the tables
