delights of ostentation are nothing to this. Other vices we easily forgo: this is an enemy within our walls and wherever we go we carry our foe with us. Wine and Youth—behold a double source for pleasure’s fire. Why throw oil on the flame; why give fresh fuel to a wretched body that is already ablaze?</p>
