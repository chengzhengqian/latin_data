Satan’s art to deceive! Which shows the greater subtlety, I wonder, to believe these charges (perhaps even to invent them about an innocent man), or to say: ‘I do not wish to believe them even though he is guilty’? There were some who kissed my hands and maligned me with snakish tongue: their lips lamented, their hearts rejoiced. The Lord saw them and held them in derision, reserving them and His poor servant for common judgment in the future. One man cavilled at my manner of walking and laughing; another found in my expression something to dislike; a third lady would suspect something else in my simplicity. With such people I have been living for almost three years: frequently I was surrounded by a throng of virgins: to some of them I often discoursed on the Scriptures to the best of my ability: study brought about familiarity, familiarity friendship, friendship confidence. Let them say if they have ever noticed in my conduct anything unbefitting a Christian. Have I taken anyone’s money? Have I not disdained all gifts great or small? Has the chink of anyone’s coin ever been heard in my hand? Has my conversation ever been ambiguous, or my eye wanton? Nothing is laid to my charge except my sex, and that only when Paula is likely to set out for Jerusalem. Well, then; they believed him when he lied; why do they not believe him when he retracts? He is the very same man as before: he confesses I am innocent, though in the past he said I was guilty; and surely torture is more effective than laughter in forcing out the truth, except indeed that people are more ready to believe a tale which, though false, they hear with pleasure, and urge others to invent it if they have not done so already.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL262_181_1" id="target_note_LCL262_181_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
