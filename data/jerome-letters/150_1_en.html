from the city which had witnessed his brother’s death, and suffered the shame of having his corpse hung from a gibbet. Why speak of Procopius, Maximus, and Eugenius, who, while they ruled at any rate, were a terror to the nations? They all stood as prisoners in the presence of their conquerors, and—fate most wretched for those who had once been supreme!—felt their hearts stabbed by the shame of slavery before they perished by the enemy’s sword.</p>
<p>Some one may say: ‘Such is the lot of kings, “the lightnings strike the mountain tops.”’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL262_301_1" id="target_note_LCL262_301_1"><sup>1</sup></a> I will come, then, to persons of private rank, and even in their case I will not go back for more than two years. Omitting any others, it is sufficient for me to record the diverse ends of three men recently of consular position. Abundantius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL262_301_2" id="target_note_LCL262_301_2"><sup>2</sup></a> is now a beggar and lives in exile at Pityus. The head of Rufinus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL262_301_3" id="target_note_LCL262_301_3"><sup>3</sup></a> was carried on a pike to Constantinople, and to shame his insatiable greed his severed hand begged for pence from door to door. Timasius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL262_301_4" id="target_note_LCL262_301_4"><sup>4</sup></a> was hurled down suddenly from a post of the highest dignity, and thinks it an escape that he now lives in obscurity at Assa. I will say no more of the calamities of individuals; I come now to the frail fortunes of human life, and my soul shudders to recount the downfall of our age.</p>
<p>For twenty years and more the blood of Romans has every day been shed between Constantinople and the Julian Alps. Scythia, Thrace, Macedonia, Thessaly, Dardania, Dacia, Epirus, Dalmatia, and all the provinces of Pannonia, have been sacked, pillaged and plundered by Goths and Sarmatians, Quadians and Alans, Huns and Vandals and Marcomanni.
