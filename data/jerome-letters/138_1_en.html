We know that what here with us on earth he groped after at a distance and sought by guess-work, there he sees face to face and can say: ‘As we have heard so we have seen in the city of the Lord of hosts, in the city of our God.’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL262_277_1" id="target_note_LCL262_277_1"><sup>1</sup></a> But we cannot bear our regret at his absence, and we grieve not on his account but for ourselves.
