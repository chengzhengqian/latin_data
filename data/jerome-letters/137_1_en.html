<p>The first, after the loss of his two sons, put on a garland and addressed a public meeting. The second was offering sacrifice when news came that his son had been killed in battle; thereupon, we are told, he took off his sacrificial garland, but replaced it when he heard that he had fallen fighting bravely. Why should I speak of those Roman leaders whose virtues glitter like stars in the pages of Latin history? Pulvillus was dedicating the Capitol when he was told that his son had suddenly died. ‘Bury him,’ he said, ‘without me.’ Lucius Paulus in the week that intervened between the funerals of his two sons entered Rome in triumphal procession. I pass over the Maximi, the Catos, the Galli, the Pisos, the Bruti, the Scaevolas, the Metelli, the Scauri, the Marii, the Crassi, the Marcelli and the Aufidii, men whose courage was as conspicuous in their sorrows as in their wars. Cicero has dealt with their bereavements in his book <span class="italic">On Consolation</span>, and of them I will say no more, lest I should seem to seek examples from strangers rather than from our own community. Not but what even this brief reference might serve as a mortification to us, if faith were not to give us what unbelief afforded them.</p>
<p>Let us come then to our people. I will not weep with Jacob and David for sons who died under the Law, but with Christ I will welcome those who rise again under the Gospel dispensation. The Jew’s mourning is the Christian’s joy. ‘Weeping may endure for a night but joy cometh in the morning.’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL262_275_1" id="target_note_LCL262_275_1"><sup>1</sup></a> ‘The night is far spent, the day is at hand.’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL262_275_2" id="target_note_LCL262_275_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Wherefore even Moses is lamented when he dies; Joshua is buried on a mountain-top without funeral or tears. All that can be drawn from the Scriptures
