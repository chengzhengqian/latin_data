instruction. You walk in the midst of snares, and many veteran virgins, whose chastity never was doubted, on the very threshold of death have let the crown slip from their hands.</p>
<p>If any of your handmaids have taken the vow with you, do not lift yourself up against them or pride yourself as being the mistress. From now you all have one Bridegroom; you sing psalms together; together you receive the Body of Christ. Why then should you separate at meals? You must challenge other mistresses: let the respect paid to your virgins be an invitation for the rest to do the same. If you find one of your girls weak in faith, take her aside, comfort and caress her, make her chastity your treasure. But if one merely pretends to have a vocation in order to escape from service, read aloud to her the apostle’s words: ‘It is better to marry than to burn.’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL262_123_1" id="target_note_LCL262_123_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Cast from you like the plague those idle and inquisitive virgins and widows who go about to married women’s houses and surpass the very parasites in a play by their unblushing effrontery. ‘Evil communications corrupt good manners,’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL262_123_2" id="target_note_LCL262_123_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and these women care for nothing but their belly and its adjacent members. Creatures of this sort will give you wheedling advice: ‘My pretty pet, make the best of what you have and live your own life. What is the use of saving for your children?’ Flown with wine and wantonness, they instil all sorts of mischief into a girl’s mind, and tempt even the firmest soul with the soft delights of pleasure. ‘And when they have begun to wax wanton against Christ they will marry, having condemnation because they have rejected their first faith.’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL262_123_3" id="target_note_LCL262_123_3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
