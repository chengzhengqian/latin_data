<p>For the reasons then which I have given above, I wish you not to live with your mother. And there are some further considerations. If she offers you a dainty dish, you would grieve her by refusing it, while if you take it you would be throwing oil on fire. Moreover, in a house that is full of girls you would see things in the day-time that you would think about in the night. Always have a book in your hand and before your eyes; learn the psalms word by word, pray without ceasing, keep your senses on the alert and closed against vain imaginings. Let your mind and body both strain towards the Lord, overcome wrath by patience; love the knowledge of the Scriptures and you will not love the sins of the flesh. Do not let your mind offer a lodging to disturbing thoughts, for if they once find a home in your breast they will become your masters and lead you on into fatal sin. Engage in some occupation, so that the devil may always find you busy. If the apostles who had the power to make the Gospel their livelihood still worked with their hands that they might not be a burden on any man,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL262_417_1" id="target_note_LCL262_417_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and gave relief to others whose carnal possessions they had a right to enjoy in return for their spiritual benefits, why should you not provide for your own future wants? Make creels of reeds or weave baskets of pliant osiers. Hoe the ground and mark it out into equal plots, and when you have sown cabbage seed or set out plants in rows, bring water down in channels and stand by like the onlooker in the lovely lines:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">‘Lo, from the channelled slope he brings the stream,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Which falls hoarse murmuring o’er the polished</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">stones</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">And with its bubbling flood allays the heat</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Of sun-scorched fields.’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL262_417_2" id="target_note_LCL262_417_2"><sup>2</sup></a></span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
