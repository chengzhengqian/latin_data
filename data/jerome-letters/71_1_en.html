Philo, Plato’s imitator, and from Josephus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL262_143_1" id="target_note_LCL262_143_1"><sup>1</sup></a>the Greek Livy, in the second book of his <span class="italic">Jewish Captivity.</span></p>
<p>However, as I am writing now about virgins, all these details about monks may seem rather superfluous. I will proceed to the third class, who are called anchorites. They go out from a monastery and live in the desert, taking nothing with them but bread and salt. The founder of the system was Paul,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL262_143_2" id="target_note_LCL262_143_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and Antony<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL262_143_3" id="target_note_LCL262_143_3"><sup>3</sup></a> made it famous: going back, the first example was given by John the Baptist.

Let me now return to my subject, for I was speaking of love of money when I digressed to the monks. With them as examples before you, you will look down not only on gold and silver and worldly possessions, but even on earth itself and the sky. United to Christ, you will sing: ‘The Lord is my portion.’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL262_143_5" id="target_note_LCL262_143_5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>Moreover, although the apostle bids us to pray without ceasing and although to the saints their very sleep is an orison, yet we ought to have fixed hours for prayer, so that if perchance we are occupied with any business the time itself may remind us of our duty. Every one knows that the set times are the third, the sixth, and the ninth hours, at dawn and at evening. No food should be taken except after prayer, and before leaving the table thanks
