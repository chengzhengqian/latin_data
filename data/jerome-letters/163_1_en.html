sailed to Jerusalem, where she was welcomed by a great concourse of people, and for a short time was my guest. When I remember that meeting, I seem to see her still as I saw her then. Blessed Jesus, with what fervour and zeal did she study the sacred volumes! In her eagerness to satisfy her hunger, she ran through the prophets, the gospels and the psalms; she suggested questions and stored up my answers in her heart’s repository. Nor did her eagerness to hear ever bring with it satiety; increasing her knowledge she also increased her sorrow, and as though oil were cast upon fire she supplied fuel ever for a more burning zeal. One day we were occupied with Moses’ Numbers, and she modestly questioned me as to the meaning of its mass of names. Why was it, she asked, that individual tribes were grouped in so many different ways in different places, and how did it happen that the soothsayer Balaam in prophesying the future mysteries of Christ foretold His coming more plainly than almost any of the prophets.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL262_327_1" id="target_note_LCL262_327_1"><sup>1</sup></a> I replied as best I could, and I think I satisfied her inquiries. So she unrolled the book further, and came to the passage where the list is given of all the halting places by which the people on leaving Egypt made their way to the river Jordan. She asked me the meaning and the origin of each name, and in some cases I hesitated, in others I hurried through without stumbling, in very many I had frankly to confess ignorance. Thereupon she began to press me harder, expostulating with me as though it were not allowed me to be in ignorance of what I do not know, and declaring that she herself was unworthy of understanding such mysteries. Why say more?
