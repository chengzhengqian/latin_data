think that nothing so inflames the body and titillates the organs of generation as undigested food, and convulsive belching. With you, my daughter, I would rather risk offending your modesty than understate my case. Regard as poison anything that has within it the seeds of sensual pleasure. A frugal diet which leaves you always hungry is to be preferred to a three days’ fast, and it is much better to go short every day than occasionally to satisfy your appetite to the full. That rain is best which falls slowly to earth: a sudden and excessive shower which comes tumbling down washes away the soil.</p>
<p>When you are eating, remember that immediately afterwards you will have to pray and read. Take a fixed number of lines from the Holy Scripture and show them up as your task<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL262_249_1" id="target_note_LCL262_249_1"><sup>1</sup></a> to your Lord; and do not lie down to rest until you have filled your heart’s basket with this precious yarn. After the Holy Scriptures, read the treatises that have been written by learned men, provided, of course, that they are persons of known faith. You need not seek for gold amid the mire: with many pearls buy the one pearl of price. As Jeremiah<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL262_249_2" id="target_note_LCL262_249_2"><sup>2</sup></a> says, stand in more ways than one, so that you may come to the way that leads to the Father. Change your love of necklaces and jewels and silk dresses to a desire for scriptural knowledge. Enter the land of promise that flows with milk and honey. Eat wheaten flour and oil, dress like Joseph in coats of many colours, let your ears, like Jerusalem’s,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL262_249_3" id="target_note_LCL262_249_3"><sup>3</sup></a> be pierced by the word of God, so that the precious grains of new corn may hang from them. You have in the saintly Exuperius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL262_249_4" id="target_note_LCL262_249_4"><sup>4</sup></a> a man of tried years and faith, who can give you constant support with his advice.</p>
