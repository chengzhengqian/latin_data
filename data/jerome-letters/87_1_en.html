merry: a halfpenny makes us sad. Therefore, as the phases of one man’s mind are so conflicting, the prophet prays to the Lord, saying: ‘O Lord, in thy city scatter their image.’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL262_175_1" id="target_note_LCL262_175_1"><sup>1</sup></a> For while we were created in God’s image and likeness, by reason of our own perversity we hide ourselves behind changing masks, and as on the stage one and the same actor now figures as a brawny Hercules, and now relaxes into the softness of a Venus or the quivering tone of a Cybele, so we who, if we were not of the world, would be hated by the world, have a counterfeit mask for every sin to which we are inclined.</p>
