<p>But that I may not seem to quote only from heathen literature, listen to the sacred teaching of God’s Book. David once had been a man of war, but in his seventieth year old age had chilled him and he could never get warm. Accordingly they looked for a girl in all the land of Israel and brought in Abishag the Shunamite to sleep with the king and warm his aged limbs. If you were to follow the letter that killeth, does not this seem to you an incident invented for a farce or a broad jest from an Atellan play?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL262_191_3" id="target_note_LCL262_191_3"><sup>3</sup></a> The old man’s cold body is wrapped in blankets, but nothing save a young girl’s embrace can warm him. Bathsheba was still alive and Abigail was also at his service, together with all his other wives and concubines of whom Scripture tells us. But they are all rejected as lacking heat, and it is in the arms of one girl only that the ancient grows warm again. Abraham was far older than David, but while Sarah was still living he did not seek another wife. Isaac had twice David’s years, and yet never felt cold with Rebecca, even when she was an old woman. I say nothing of the men before the flood, who after nine hundred years must have found their limbs not merely aged but almost rotten with time and still never sought a young girl’s embraces. Certainly Moses, the leader of the people of Israel, lived to be a hundred and twenty without changing his Sephora.</p>
