of mammon of those that sell doves, that is, the gifts of the Holy Spirit; he has scattered the money of the money-changers, so that the house of God might be called a house of prayer and not a den of robbers. Follow closely in his steps and in those of others like him in virtue, men whom their holy office only makes more humble and more poor. Or else, if you desire perfection, go out like Abraham from your native city and your kin, and travel whither you know not. If you have substance, sell it and give it to the poor. If you have none, you are free from a great burden. Naked yourself follow a naked Christ. The task is hard and great and difficult; but great also are the rewards.</p>

The chief facts of her life are given here by Jerome, who concludes with an account of the sack of Rome in <span class="sc">a.d.</span> 410. In 408 the Goths, who had been settled in Dalmatia, by Theodosius (379–395), taking advantage of Stilicho’s death, marched into Italy under Alaric, and forced Rome to pay ransom. The process was repeated in the next year and in 410 the city was stormed and sacked, although the Goths, who were Christians, spared the churches. Soon afterwards Alaric died in South Italy, his sudden end being used as a warning to Attila in 452 by Leo the Great. For Marcella and her circle, cf. Appendix I.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL262_439_1a').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL262_439_2"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL262_439_2" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">2</sup>A proverb: Cic. <span class="italic">Att.</span>, xiii. 45. 1: <span class="italic">quod me hortaris . . ., currentem tu quidem.</span></a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL262_439_2').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
