his portion, must so bear himself as to possess the Lord and be possessed by Him. He who possesses the Lord and says with the prophet:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL262_201_1" id="target_note_LCL262_201_1"><sup>1</sup></a> ‘The Lord is my portion,’ can have nothing outside the Lord; for if he has anything except the Lord, the Lord will not be his portion. For example, if he has gold and silver, land and inlaid furniture, with portions such as these the Lord will not deign to be his portion. If I am the Lord’s portion and in the line of His inheritance, I receive no portion among the other tribes, but like the Priest and the Levite I live on tithes, and serving the altar am supported by the altar offerings. Having food and raiment I shall be satisfied with them, and naked shall follow the naked cross. So I beseech you and ‘again and yet again my words repeat,’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL262_201_2" id="target_note_LCL262_201_2"><sup>2</sup></a> do not think that clerical orders are but a variety of your old military service; that is, do not look for worldly gain when you are fighting in Christ’s army, lest, having more than when you first became a clergyman, you hear it said of you:
‘Their portions (κλῆροι) shall not profit them.’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL262_201_3" id="target_note_LCL262_201_3"><sup>3</sup></a> Let poor men and strangers be acquainted with your modest table, and with them Christ shall be your guest. Avoid, as you would the plague, a clergyman who is also a man of business, one who has risen from poverty to wealth, from obscurity to a high position. ‘Evil communications corrupt good manners.’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL262_201_4" id="target_note_LCL262_201_4"><sup>4</sup></a> You despise gold; the other loves it. You trample money underfoot; he pursues it. You delight in silence, peacefulness, solitude; he prefers talking and effrontery, the markets and the streets and the apothecaries’ shops. When your ways are so diverse, what unity of heart can there be between you?</p>
