it is for a thing difficult and almost impossible that the prophet hopes rather than thinks to win when he says:’ Blessed are the undefiled in the way who walk in the law of the Lord.’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL262_445_1" id="target_note_LCL262_445_1"><sup>1</sup></a> He means by the undefiled in this world’s way those whom no breath of scandal has sullied and who have incurred no reproach from their neighbours. So too the Saviour in the Gospel says:’ Agree with [or be kindly to] thine adversary whilst thou art in the way with him.’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL262_445_2" id="target_note_LCL262_445_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Whoever heard anything displeasing about Marcella that deserved belief? Who that believed such a tale did not rather convict himself of malice and backbiting? She put the Gentiles to confusion by showing to all what sort of thing that Christian widowhood is which she revealed in every thought and look.</p>
<p>Gentile widows are wont to paint their faces with rouge and white lead, to flaunt in silk dresses, to deck themselves in gleaming jewels, to wear gold necklaces, to hang from their pierced ears the costliest Red Sea pearls, and to reek of musk. Rejoicing that they have at length escaped from a husband’s dominion, they look about for a new mate, intending not to yield him obedience, as God ordained, but to be his lord and master. With this object they choose poor men, husbands only in name, who must patiently put up with rivals, and if they murmur can be kicked out on the spot. Our widow, on the other hand, wore clothes that were meant to keep out the cold, not to reveal her bare limbs. Even a gold signet ring she rejected, preferring to store her money in the stomachs of the needy rather than hide it in a purse. Nowhere would she go without her mother, never would she interview without
