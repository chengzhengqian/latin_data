of whom the Gospel says: ‘He is of age, let him speak for himself.’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL262_355_1" id="target_note_LCL262_355_1"><sup>1</sup></a> As for the little child with a child’s understanding, until he comes to years of wisdom and the letter of Pythagoras<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL262_355_2" id="target_note_LCL262_355_2"><sup>2</sup></a> confronts him with the two roads, his evil deeds as well as his good are laid to his parents’ account; unless indeed you imagine that the children of Christians, if they have not received baptism, are themselves alone responsible for their sins and no guilt attaches to those who refused it them at the time when the recipients could not have objected. The truth is that baptism means salvation for the child and advantage for the parents. It rested with you whether you should offer your daughter or not; although you scarcely had the option, since you offered her before she was conceived.

Let her take pattern by Mary whom Gabriel found alone in her chamber,

The lower part represents the period of childhood;
the branching ways the time when the choice has to be made between good and evil. The steep path to the right is the path of virtue.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL262_355_2').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
