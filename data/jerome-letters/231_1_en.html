<p>While these things were taking place in Jebus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL262_463_1" id="target_note_LCL262_463_1"><sup>1</sup></a> a dreadful rumour reached us from the West. We heard that Rome was besieged, that the citizens were buying their safety with gold, and that when they had been thus despoiled they were again beleaguered, so as to lose not only their substance but their lives. The speaker’s voice failed and sobs interrupted his utterance. The city which had taken the whole world was itself taken; nay, it fell by famine before it fell by the sword, and there were but a few found to be made prisoners. The rage of hunger had recourse to impious food; men tore one another’s limbs, and the mother did not spare the baby at her breast, taking again within her body that which her body had just brought forth.’ In the night was Moab taken, in the night did her wall fall down.’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL262_463_2" id="target_note_LCL262_463_2"><sup>2</sup></a> ‘O God, the heathen have come into thine inheritance; thy holy temple have they denied; they have made Jerusalem an orchard. The dead bodies of thy servants have they given to be meat unto the fowls of the heaven, the flesh of thy saints unto the beasts of the earth. Their blood have they shed like water round about Jerusalem; and there was none to bury them.’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL262_463_3" id="target_note_LCL262_463_3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p>Meanwhile, as you might expect in such a turmoil, the blood-stained conquerors burst their way into Marcella’s house.</p>
