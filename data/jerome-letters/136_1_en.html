the passion and the resurrection of Christ. I say nothing of the Hebrews, the Greeks, and the Latins, peoples whom the Lord dedicated to His faith by the inscription on His cross. That immortality of the soul, and its existence after the dissolution of the body, which Pythagoras dreamed, Democritus would not believe, and Socrates discussed in prison to console himself for his conviction, that is now the common philosophy of Indian and Persian, Egyptian and Goth. The savage Bessians<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL262_273_1" id="target_note_LCL262_273_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and their host of skin-clad tribes, who used to offer human sacrifice to the dead, have now dissolved their rough discord into the sweet music of the Cross, and the whole world with one voice cries out, ‘Christ.’</p>
<p>What shall we do, Ο my soul? Whither shall we turn? What theme shall we choose first? What shall we omit? Have you forgotten the precepts of the rhetoricians, and are you so preoccupied with grief, oppressed with tears, and hindered by sobs that you cannot keep to any ordered narrative? Where now is that love of literature which you have cherished from childhood? Where is the saying of Anaxagoras and Telamon which you always used to praise: ‘I knew that I was born a mortal’? I have read Crantor, whose treatise written to comfort his own grief Cicero imitated. I have perused those works of Plato, Diogenes, Clitomachus, Carneades, and Posidonius, in which by book or letter they have tried at different times to lessen the sorrow of various persons and to console their grief. Therefore, even if my own wits were dry, I could water them from these fountains. They set before us men without number as examples, and particularly Pericles and Socrates’ pupil Xenophon.</p>
