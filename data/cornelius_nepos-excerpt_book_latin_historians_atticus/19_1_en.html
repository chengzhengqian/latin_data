had a grand-daughter by Agrippa, to whom he had united his daughter in her first marriage. This grand-daughter, when she was barely a year old, Caesar betrothed to his stepson Tiberius Claudius Nero, son of Drusilla, a union which sealed the friendship of the ruler with Atticus and made their intercourse more frequent.</p>
<p><span class="bold">20.</span> Even before this betrothal, when Octavian was absent from the city, he never sent a letter to any one of his friends without letting Atticus know what he was doing, in particular what he was reading, where he was going, and how long he intended to stay; and even when he was in Rome, but because of his countless engagements could not enjoy Atticus’ society as often as he wished, hardly even a single day passed that he did not write to him, now asking some question about ancient history, now putting before him some difficult passage in the poets, sometimes in jesting fashion trying to induce him to write longer letters. It was owing to that intimacy that when the temple of Jupiter Feretrius, which had been built on the Capitol by Romulus, through lapse of time and neglect was without a roof, and was falling into ruin, Caesar was led by Atticus’ advice to have it restored. Mark Antony too, although far away, carried on a correspondence with Atticus, and even took pains to send him word from the ends of the earth of what he was doing. What this means will more easily be understood by one who can judge how great tact it requires to retain the intimacy and good-will of men who were not only rivals in affairs of the greatest importance, but also such enemies as Caesar and Antony inevitably
