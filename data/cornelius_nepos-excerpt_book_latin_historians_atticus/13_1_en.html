a Roman knight of the same age as Atticus, who because of his devotion to philosophy had lived for several years in Athens, had valuable possessions in Italy. When the triumvirs sold his property, after the manner in which things were done at that time, it was due to the efforts and energy of Atticus that the same messenger brought Saufeius news of the loss of his property and of its recovery. He was equally helpful to Lucius Julius Calidus, who since the death of Lucretius and Catullus is, I think I may truly say, by far the most graceful poet that our age has produced, in addition to being a good man and endowed with the highest culture. This Calidus, after the proscription of the knights was completed, because of his extensive possessions in Africa was added to the list by Publius Volumnius, Antony’s chief of engineers, although he was out of the country; but he was saved by Atticus. Whether this conduct caused Atticus more trouble at the moment or gave him greater glory, it is not easy to decide, since at the time of the perils of these men it became known that his friends, whether present or absent, were the object of his care.</p>

For although he had an abundance of money, no one was less inclined to excess in buying or in building. At the same time, he had as fine a dwelling as anyone, and he enjoyed the best of everything. He had his home on the Quirinal in the villa built by Tamphilus, which was left him in his uncle’s will, the charm of which consisted less in its construction than in its park; for the building itself was put up in early times and was rather tasteful than costly.
