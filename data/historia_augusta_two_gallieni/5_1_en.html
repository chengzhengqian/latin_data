Roman valour, called Postumus to the imperial power;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_25_1" id="target_note_LCL263_25_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and the armies, too, joined with them, for they complained of an emperor who was busied with his lusts. Thereupon Gallienus himself led his army against him, and when he began to besiege the city in which Postumus was, the Gauls defended it bravely, and Gallienus, as he went around the walls, was struck by an arrow. So for seven years<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_25_2" id="target_note_LCL263_25_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Postumus held his power and with the greatest vigour protected the regions of Gaul from all the barbarians surging about. Forced by this evil plight, Gallienus made peace with Aureolus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_25_3" id="target_note_LCL263_25_3"><sup>3</sup></a> in his desire to fight with Postumus, and, as the war dragged on to great length amid various sieges and battles, he conducted the campaign, now with good success and again with ill.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_25_4a" id="target_note_LCL263_25_4a"><sup>4</sup></a> These evils had been further increased by the fact that the Scythians<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_25_5" id="target_note_LCL263_25_5"><sup>5</sup></a> had invaded Bithynia and destroyed its cities. Finally they set fire to Astacus, later called Nicomedia, and plundered it cruelly. Last of all, when all parts of the Empire were thrown into commotion, as though by a conspiracy of the whole world, there arose in Sicily also a sort of slave-revolt,
for bandits roved about and were put down only with great difficulty.</p>
