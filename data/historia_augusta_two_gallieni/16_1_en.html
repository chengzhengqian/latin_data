He had had no part in their plan, but was held by all in such respect that he seemed worthy of the imperial power, and justly so, as was proved by later events. For he is that Claudius from whom Constantius, our most watchful Caesar, derives his descent.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_47_3" id="target_note_LCL263_47_3"><sup>3</sup></a> These men had also as their comrade in seeking the power a certain Ceronius, or rather Cecropius, commander of the Dalmatians, who aided them with the greatest shrewdness and wisdom.
