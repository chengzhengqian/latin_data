<p>X. In the consulship of Gallienus and Saturninus<span class="marginNote right">264</span>
Odaenathus, king of the Palmyrenes, held the rule over the entire East<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_37_1" id="target_note_LCL263_37_1"><sup>1</sup></a>—chiefly for the reason that by his brave deeds he had shown himself worthy of the insignia of such great majesty, whereas Gallienus was doing nothing at all or else only what was extravagant, or foolish and deserving of ridicule. Now at once he proclaimed a war on the Persians to exact for Valerian the vengeance neglected by Valerian’s son. He immediately occupied Nisibis and Carrhae, the people of which surrendered, reviling Gallienus. Nevertheless, Odaenathus showed no lack of respect toward Gallienus, for he sent him the satraps he captured—though,
as it seemed, merely for the purpose of insulting him and displaying his own prowess.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_37_2" id="target_note_LCL263_37_2"><sup>2</sup></a> After these had been brought to Rome, Gallienus held a triumph because of Odaenathus’ victory;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_37_3" id="target_note_LCL263_37_3"><sup>3</sup></a> but he still made no mention of his father and did not even place him among the gods, when he heard he was dead, until compelled to do so<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_37_4" id="target_note_LCL263_37_4"><sup>4</sup></a>—although in fact Valerian was still alive, for the news of his death was untrue. Odaenathus, besides, besieged an army of Parthians at Ctesiphon and devastated all the country round about, killing men without number. But when all the satraps from all the outlying regions flocked together to Ctesiphon for the purpose of common defence, there were long-lasting battles with varying results, but more long-lasting still was the success of the Romans. Moreover, since Odaenathus’ sole purpose was to set Valerian free, he daily pressed onward, but this best of commanders, now on a foreign soil, suffered greatly because of the difficult ground.</p>
