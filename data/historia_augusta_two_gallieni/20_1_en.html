<p>XVIII. But the soldiers he treated with excessive cruelty,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_55_1" id="target_note_LCL263_55_1"><sup>1</sup></a> killing as many as three or four thousand of them in a single day.</p>
<p>He gave orders to make a statue of himself arrayed as the Sun and greater than the Colossus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_55_2" id="target_note_LCL263_55_2"><sup>2</sup></a> but it was destroyed while still unfinished. It was, in fact, begun on so large a scale that it seemed to be double the size of the Colossus. His wish was that it should be placed on the summit of the Esquiline Hill, holding a spear, up the shaft of which a child could climb to the top. The plan, however, seemed foolish to Claudius and after him to Aurelian, especially as he had ordered a chariot and horses to be made in proportion to the size of the statue and set up on a very high base. He planned to construct a Flaminian portico<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_55_3" id="target_note_LCL263_55_3"><sup>3</sup></a> extending as far as the Mulvian Bridge, and having columns in rows of four or, as some say, in rows of five, so that the first row should contain pillars with columns bearing statues in front of them, while the second and third and the rest should have columns in lines of four.</p>
<p>It would be too long to set down in writing all that he did, and if anyone wishes to know these things, he may read Palfurius Sura,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_55_4" id="target_note_LCL263_55_4"><sup>4</sup></a> who composed a journal of his life. Let us now turn to Saloninus.</p>
