<h2><span class="ac">Saloninus Gallienus</span></h2>
<p>XIX. He was the son of Gallienus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_57_1a" id="target_note_LCL263_57_1a"><sup>1</sup></a> and the grandson of Valerian, and concerning him there is scarcely anything worth setting down in writing, save that he was nobly born, royally reared, and then killed, not on his own account but his father’s. With regard to his name there is great uncertainty, for many have recorded that it was Gallienus and many Saloninus. Those who call him Saloninus declare that he was so named because he was born at Salonae;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_57_2" id="target_note_LCL263_57_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and those who call him Gallienus say that he was named after his father and Gallienus’ grandfather, who once was a very great man in the state. As a matter of fact, a statue of him has remained to the present time at the foot of the Hill of Romulus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_57_3" id="target_note_LCL263_57_3"><sup>3</sup></a> in front of the Sacred Way, that is, between the Temple of Faustina and the Temple of Vesta near the Fabian Arch, which bears the inscription “To Gallienus the Younger” with the addition of “Saloninus,” and from this his name can be learned.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_57_4" id="target_note_LCL263_57_4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>It is well enough known that the rule of Gallienus exceeded ten years.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_57_5" id="target_note_LCL263_57_5"><sup>5</sup></a> This statement I have added for the reason that many have said that he was killed in the ninth year of his rule. There were, moreover, other rebels during his reign, as we shall relate in

Since the Alexandrian coins bearing hls name cease with the year 260–61, it is generally inferred that he died in this year; but he may be the son who, according to Zonaras, xii. 26, was killed by the senate after the death of Gallienus.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL263_57_1a').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL263_57_2"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL263_57_2" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">2</sup>On the Dalmatian coast.
