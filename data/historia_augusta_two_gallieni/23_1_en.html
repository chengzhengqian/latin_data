<p>With regard to the number of years through which the rule of Gallienus and Valerian extended, such varied statements are made that, whereas all agree that together they ruled for fifteen years,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_61_4" id="target_note_LCL263_61_4"><sup>4</sup></a> that is,
