<p>IX. By this procession the foolish man thought to delude the people of Rome; nevertheless—for such is the Romans’ love of a jest—one man kept supporting Postumus, another Regalianus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_35_1" id="target_note_LCL263_35_1"><sup>1</sup></a> another Aureolus or Aemilianus, and another Saturninus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_35_2" id="target_note_LCL263_35_2"><sup>2</sup></a>—for he, too, was now said to be ruling. Amid all this there was loud lamentation for the father whom the son had left unavenged and for whom foreigners had tried, in one way or another, to exact a vengeance.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_35_3" id="target_note_LCL263_35_3"><sup>3</sup></a> Gallienus, however, was moved to no such deed, for his heart was dulled by pleasure, but he merely kept asking of those about him, “Have we anything planned for luncheon? Have any amusements been arranged? What manner of play will there be to-morrow and what manner of circus-games?” So, having finished the procession, he offered hecatombs and returned to the royal residence, and then, the banquets and feastings having come to an end, he appointed further days for the public amusements. One well-known instance of jesting, however, must not be omitted. As a band of Persians, supposed to be captives, was being led along in the procession (such an absurdity!), certain wits mingled with them and most carefully scrutinized all, examining with open-mouthed astonishment the features of every one; and when asked what they meant by that sagacious investigation, they replied, “We are searching for the Emperor’s father” When this incident was reported to Gallienus, unmoved by shame or grief or filial affection, he ordered the wits to be burned alive—a measure which angered the people more than anyone would suppose, but so grieved the soldiers that not much later they requited the deed.</p>
