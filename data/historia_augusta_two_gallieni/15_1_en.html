over-tardy vengeance for his father—and, gathering an army with the help of the general Heraclianus, he played the part of a skilful prince. This Heraclianus, however, on setting out against the Persians, was defeated by the Palmyrenes and lost all the troops he had gathered,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_45_1" id="target_note_LCL263_45_1"><sup>1</sup></a> for Zenobia was ruling Palmyra and most of the East with the vigour of a man.</p>

The Goths were also defeated in a naval battle by the general Venerianus, though Venerianus himself died a soldier’s death. Then the Goths ravaged Cyzicus and Asia and then all of Achaea, but were vanquished by the Athenians under the command of Dexippus, an historian of these times.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_45_3" id="target_note_LCL263_45_3"><sup>3</sup></a> Driven thence, they roved through Epirus, Macedonia and Boeotia. Gallienus, meanwhile, roused at last by the public ills, met the Goths as they roved about in Illyricum, and, as it chanced, killed a great number. Learning of this, the Scythians, after making a barricade of wagons, attempted to escape by way of Mount Gessaces.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_45_4" id="target_note_LCL263_45_4"><sup>4</sup></a> Then Marcianus made war on all the Scythians with varying

Setting forth with 500 ships from the Sea of Azov, they sailed into the mouth of the Danube. Gallienus, engaged in the war against Postumus, deputed the various generals here mentioned to deal with them, but despite their efforts the invaders overran Greece, even as far as the Peloponnese. They were defeated by Dexippus in an attempt to take Athens on their return northward, and again by Gallienus himself (who had left the war against Postumus and hurried to meet them) in a battle on the river Nestos, the boundary between Macedonia and Thrace.
