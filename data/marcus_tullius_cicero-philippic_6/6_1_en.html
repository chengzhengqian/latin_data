Sometimes he remarks that a man who set the senate-house on fire has no business to sit there. And <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">11</span><span class="br"></span>for Trebellius Antonius now has great regard. He used to hate him at the time when Trebellius was opposing the cancellation of debts;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL189_313_11" id="target_note_LCL189_313_11"><sup>11</sup></a> but now Trebellius is the apple of his eye, ever since Antonius saw that Trebellius himself cannot survive without the cancellation of debts. For I think you have heard, Men of Rome—you could have actually seen it—that Lucius Trebellius’ sureties and creditors are meeting every day. Oh Faith!—I think Trebellius has taken that word as an additional element of his name—what greater faith than to defraud one’s creditors, flee from home, join the army under pressure of debt? Where now is that applause at the triumph,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL189_313_12" id="target_note_LCL189_313_12"><sup>12</sup></a> and often at the games, where is that aedileship conferred with the enthusiastic support of decent men? Can anybody doubt that his good behavior was due to chance, his criminality to a worthless character?</p>
