For that reason, Men of Rome, to be frank with you, I put up less of a fight today, I made less of an effort to have the senate adopt my proposal to decree a public emergency and order the wearing of military cloaks. I preferred my proposal to be praised by everyone in twenty days’ time<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL189_319_20" id="target_note_LCL189_319_20"><sup>20</sup></a> than blamed by a few today. Therefore, Men of Rome, wait for <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">17</span><span class="br"></span>the return of the envoys and swallow a few days’ inconvenience. When they return, if they bring peace, regard me as overly zealous, if war, as provident. Should I not look ahead for my fellow countrymen? Should I not be thinking day and night about your freedom and the safety of the Republic? What debt, Men of Rome, do I not owe to you, since you chose me, a man whose family starts with himself, for all offices ahead of the noblest citizens? Am I ungrateful? Who shows less ingratitude? When I had gained offices, I went on working in the Forum just as when I was seeking them. Am I a novice in public life? Who has more experience? For I have been waging war against treacherous citizens for twenty years.</p>
<p>Therefore, Men of Rome, I shall be on the alert and <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">18</span><span class="br"></span>keep watch for you by means of my counsel, the best I shall be able to offer, and by means of my labor, which will almost exceed my power. After all, is any citizen, especially of the rank to which you have been pleased to advance me, so forgetful of your favor, so unmindful of his native land, so inimical to his own standing, as not to be aroused and fired by this tremendous unanimity of yours? As consul, I held many great public meetings; I took part in many more: never have I seen one so large as yours today. You all </p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL189_319_20"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL189_319_20" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">20</sup>An estimate of the time needed for the envoys to return.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL189_319_20').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
