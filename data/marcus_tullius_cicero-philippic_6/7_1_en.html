Certainly not. Well, the thirty-five tribes chose him as their patron. Again you protest? Look at that gilt equestrian statue to the left. What does its inscription say? “The thirty-five tribes to their patron.” So Lucius Antonius is patron of the Roman people. To the devil with him! I agree with your shouts. Who ever had so great a position, such a record of achievement as to dare to call himself the patron of the Roman people, conqueror and lord of all nations?—let alone this brigand whom nobody would want to have as a client.
