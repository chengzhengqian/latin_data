Which should we have sent to this man, envoys or legions? But let us not dwell on what is past: let the envoys make haste, as I see they will; you, on your side, get your military cloaks ready. For it is so decreed: if he does not obey the authority of the senate, all shall put on military cloaks. That is what will happen; he will not obey. But we shall lament that so many days for action have been lost.</p>

<p>[4] I am not afraid, Men of Rome, that when Antonius hears I have asserted both in the senate and before a meeting of the people that he will never submit to the control of the senate, he will turn around and obey the senate in order to refute me, so that I seem to have been blind. He will never do that; he will not begrudge me this credit. He will prefer you to think me shrewd than to think him well-behaved. Again, even if he himself were to be willing, do we <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">10</span><span class="br"></span>suppose that his brother Lucius will allow it? Not long ago, near Tibur I think, Lucius is said to have threatened his brother with death, when he thought Marcus Antonius was wavering.

For in that company he is the Africanus:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL189_311_8" id="target_note_LCL189_311_8"><sup>8</sup></a> he stands in higher regard than Lucius Trebellius, higher than Titus Plancus. </p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL189_311_5"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL189_311_5" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">5</sup>As consul-elect for 42 Brutus would have been the first to be called on to speak in the senate (cf. 1.15, n. 30).</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL189_311_5').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL189_311_6"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL189_311_6" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">6</sup>As an alleged descendant of L.
