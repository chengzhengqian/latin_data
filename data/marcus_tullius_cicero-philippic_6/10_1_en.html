All classes want the same thing; the municipalities, the colonies, all Italy are putting their shoulders to the same wheel. And so the senate, commendably firm of its own volition, has been made firmer by your backing. The time has come, Men of Rome, later than befitted the <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">19</span><span class="br"></span>Roman people, it is true, but still just at the right moment so that it cannot be deferred another hour. What may be called a fate-ordained misfortune befell us,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL189_321_21" id="target_note_LCL189_321_21"><sup>21</sup></a> which we endured as best we could. If anything of the kind happens now, it will be of our own choice. It is against divine law for the Roman people to be enslaved, since the immortal gods willed that they rule over all nations. The ultimate crisis is upon us; freedom is at stake. Either you must be victorious, Men of Rome, as you surely will be thanks to your patriotism and your strong united will, or—anything but slavery. Other nations can endure servitude, but the birthright of the Roman people is freedom.</p>
