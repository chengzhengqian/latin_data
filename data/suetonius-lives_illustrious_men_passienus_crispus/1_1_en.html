<h1><span class="ac">The Life of Passienus Crispus</span></h1>
<p>Passienus Crispus, a native of Visellium, began his first speech in the senate with these words: “Conscript fathers and you, Caesar,” and was in consequence highly commended by Tiberius, though not sincerely. He voluntarily pleaded a number of cases in the court of the Hundred,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL038_489_60" id="target_note_LCL038_489_60"><sup>60</sup></a> and therefore his statue was set up in the Basilica Julia.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL038_489_61" id="target_note_LCL038_489_61"><sup>61</sup></a> He was twice consul. He married twice: first Domitia and then Agrippina, respectively the aunt and the mother of the emperor Nero. He possessed an estate of two hundred million sesterces. He tried to gain favour with all the emperors, but especially with Gaius Caesar, whom he attended on foot when the emperor made a journey. When he was asked by Gaius in a private conversation whether he had commerce with his own sister, as the emperor had with his, he replied “Not yet”; a very fitting and cautious answer, neither accusing the emperor by denying the allegation, nor dishonouring himself with a lie by admitting it. He was slain by the treachery of Agrippina, whom he had made his heir, and was honoured with a public funeral.</p>
