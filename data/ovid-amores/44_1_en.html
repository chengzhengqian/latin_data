Cypassis, the deft girl that tires your hair, is cast at me, accused of wronging her mistress’ couch. Ye gods grant me better, if I have a mind to sin, than find my pleasure in a love of mean and despisèd lot!

I am neither greater than Tantalus’ son, nor greater than Achilles; why should I judge base for me what was fit for kings?</p>
