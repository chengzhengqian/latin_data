coursers dash from the starting-chamber, with fearless heart will I tread the car and urge them on, now giving the rein, now striping their backs with the lash, now grazing the turning-post with inner wheel. Have I caught sight of you as I career, I will stop, and the reins, let go from my hands, will drop. Yea, how near Pelops came to falling by Pisaean spear while looking on thy face, Hippodamia! Yet he won, of course through the favour of his lady. May we owe our victories, all of us, to the favour of our loves!</p>

Such were the limbs of fleet Atalanta that Milanion burned to hold up with his hands. Such in pictures are the limbs of upgirt Diana pursuing the bold wild beasts, herself more bold than they. I burned before, when I had not seen; what will become of me now that I have? You add flames to flame, and waters to the sea. I suspect from them that all else, too, that lies well hidden under your delicate gown, might please.</p>
