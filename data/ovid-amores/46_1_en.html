the quarry that flies; what he has taken he leaves behind, and ever strains to the prey ahead. We, a people who have surrendered to thee, feel the weight of thy weapons; with the foe that resists, thy hand is slow to move. Of what avail to blunt thy barbed arrows on naked bones?—for love is leaving my bones naked. So many men there are without love, without love so many maids!—there is thy field for great and glorious triumph. Rome, had she not employed her powers against the boundless world, would be filled even now with straw-thatched huts.</p>

<p>“<span class="sc">Lay</span> aside thy loves,” should some god say to me,”and live without them,” I would pray him not ask it—even so sweet an evil are the fair. When I have grown weary of love and the ardour of my heart has cooled, my soul is somehow seized upon by a whirlwind of wretchedness. As a hard-mouthed horse bears headlong in flight the master who strives in vain to hold him back with foaming bit; as on a sudden, when land is now all but gained and the keel is touching the haven, the wind sweeps it out to the deep—so am I oft carried away again by the veering gale of Cupid, and bright Love takes up again the weapons I know well.</p>
