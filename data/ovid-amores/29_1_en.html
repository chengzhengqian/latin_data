 they yield themselves to iron and fire to form the close-curling ringlet with its winding orb! I kept crying out: “’T is crime, ’t is crime to burn those tresses! They are beautiful of themselves; spare your own head, O iron-hearted girl! Away from there with force! That is no hair should feel the fire; your curls themselves can school the irons you apply!”</p>
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">31</span><span class="br"></span><p>The beautiful tresses are no more—such as Apollo could desire, such as Bacchus could desire, for their own heads! I could compare with them the tresses which nude Dione is painted holding up of yore with dripping fingers.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL041_375_a" id="target_note_LCL041_375_a"><sup>a</sup></a> Why do you lament the ruin of your ill-ordered hair? why lay aside your mirror with sorrowing hand, silly girl? You are gazed upon by yourself with eyes not well accustomed to the sight; to find pleasure there, you must forget your old-time self. No rival’s enchanted herbs have wrought you ill, no treacherous grandam has laved your hair with water from Haemonian land;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL041_375_b" id="target_note_LCL041_375_b"><sup>b</sup></a> nor has violent illness harmed—far from us be the omen! —nor envious tongue diminished your dense locks. The loss you feel was wrought you by your own hand and fault; yourself applied the mingled poison to your head.</p>
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">45</span><span class="br"></span><p>Now Germany will send you tresses from captive women; you will be saved by the bounty of the race we lead in triumph. O how oft, when someone looks at your hair, will you redden, and say: “The ware I have bought is what brings me favour now. ’T is some Sygambrian woman that yonder one is praising now, instead of me. Yet I remember when that glory was my own.”</p>
