Both Paris and she who loved him, misdeed far-famed, are in your song, and Laodamia, comrade to her lord in death. If I know you well, not more gladly you sing of-wars than of themes like these, and are passing from your camp to mine.</p>

What one may do freely has no charm; what one may not do pricks more keenly on. He has a heart of iron who loves what another concedes. Let us hope while we fear and fear while we hope, we lovers, and let repulse sometimes be ours to make a place for vows. What care I for the fortune that never troubles to deceive? May nothing be mine that never wounds!</p>

Ah, how often has she feigned an aching head when wholly well, and bid me go away when my tardy foot delayed! Ah, how oft has she feigned a charge, and put on the air—as far as she could with a guiltless man—of attacking me! Thus, when she had stirred me up, and fanned into flame again the cooling fires, she would be friendly once more, and compliant to my prayers. What winsome ways she would have, how sweet she would make her words! And kisses, O great gods, what kisses, and how many she would give!</p>
