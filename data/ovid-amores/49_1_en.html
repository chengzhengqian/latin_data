may it be my lot when I die to languish in Venus’ embrace, and be dissolved in the midst of its delight; and may one, dropping tears at my funeral, say: “Thine was a death accorded with thy life”</p>
<h3>XI</h3>
<p>’<span class="sc">Twas</span> the pine felled on Pelion’s top that first taught men the evil paths of the sea, while the waves looked on in wonder—the craft that rashly sailed between the clashing rocks and bore away the wool sightly with yellow flock. O that the Argo had been o’erwhelmed and drunk the waters of doom, so that no one should trouble with oar the far-stretching seas!</p>
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">7</span><span class="br"></span><p>Lo! Corinna flies from the couch that knows her, and the Penates she has shared, and makes ready to venture forth on treacherous paths. How —wretched me!—shall I fear for you the West-wind and the East, and frozen Boreas, and the balmy South! Not yonder will you gaze on towns, not upon groves; there is only the deep-blue form of the unjust sea. Nor do the waters in the mid of the deep have delicate shells and painted pebbles; for those we linger on the thirsty strand. Print ye the strand with marble-white feet, fair maids; so far is safe—the rest of the way is blind. And let others tell you tales of battling winds; of waters that Scylla makes dread, or Charybdis; of rocks where the violent Ceraunians tower from the sea; of the fold in the shore where the Syrtes, great and lesser, lie in wait. These things let others tell you; whatever each shall say, believe it! Believing brings no harm from any storm.</p>
