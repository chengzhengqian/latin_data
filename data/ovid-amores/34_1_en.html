Her husband, too, is anything but wise; for why take pains to watch over that from which, even did you not guard, nothing would be lost? But let him, mad fool, do as his passion prompts him, and let him think she can be chaste who takes the eye of many; be you the means of giving her stolen liberty, that she may render back to you the freedom you gave to her. Be willing to conspire with her—the mistress is bound to the slave; fear you to conspire—you can pretend. She will read a missive by herself —think that her mother sent it! One comes not known to you—in a moment you will know him well! She will go to a sick friend, who will not be ill—let her go to see her; let the friend be ill in your judgment! Is she late in coming back, you need not let long waiting tire you out, but may lay your head in your lap and snore. And make it not your business to ask into what happens at linen-clad Isis’ temple, nor concern yourself about the curving theatre! The accomplice in a secret will reap continual reward—and what is less labour, too, than keeping silence? He is one favoured, and rules in the house, and feels no blows; he is one with power —the rest, a mean crowd, are at his feet. For the husband empty reasons are fashioned to keep the true ones hid; and both master and mistress approve what the mistress alone approves. After her lord has put on a scowling face and bent his brows, he does what the wheedling wife has willed shall be done.</p>
