<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">63</span><span class="br"></span>’Tis no crime we are entering on; we are not coming together to mingle poisons; no drawn sword flashes in our hands. What we ask is that you will give us the means to love in safety. What can be more modest than our prayers?</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p><span class="sc">Miserable</span> me, that you who guard your mistress are neither man nor woman, and cannot know the joys of mutual love! He who first robbed boys of their nature should himself have suffered the wounds he made. Readily would you be compliant and yielding to lovers’ prayers, if you had ever grown warm with love for any woman. You were not born for a horse, nor for the strenuous service of arms; the warlike spear fits not your right hand. Let men engage in those ways of life; do you lay aside all manly hopes. The standards you bear must be of your mistress’s service. She is the one for you to ply with deserving deeds; hers is the favour to bring you gain; should you lack her, what then will be your use?</p>
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">13</span><span class="br"></span><p>Then, too, she has charms, and her years are apt for love’s delights; ’tis a shame for her beauty to perish by dull neglect. She could have eluded you, strict guardian though you are called; what two have willed lacks not accomplishment. Yet since ’twill be better to have tried entreaty, we ask your aid, while you still have power to place your favours well.</p>
