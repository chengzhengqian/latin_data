 rugged in art, and Accius of the spirited tongue, possess names that will never fade. Varro and the first of ships—what generation will fail to know of them, and of the golden fleece, the Aesonian chieftain’s quest? The verses of sublime Lucretius will perish only then when a single day shall give the earth to doom. Tityrus and the harvest, and the arms of Aeneas, will be read as long as Rome shall be capital of the world she triumphs o’er; as long as flames and bow are the arms of Cupid, thy numbers shall be conned, O elegant Tibullus; Gallus shall be known to Hesperia’s sons, and Gallus to the sons of Eos, and known with Gallus shall his own Lycoris be.</p>

Before song let monarchs and monarchs’ triumphs yield—yield, too, the bounteous banks of Tagus bearing gold! Let what is cheap excite the marvel of the crowd; for me may golden Apollo minister full cups from the Castalian fount, and may I on my locks sustain the myrtle that fears the cold; and often be perused by anxious lovers! It is the living that Envy feeds upon; after doom it stirs no more, when each man’s fame guards him as he deserves. I, too, when the final fires have eaten up my frame, shall still live on, and the great part of me survive my death.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL041_379_a" id="target_note_LCL041_379_a"><sup>a</sup></a></p>
