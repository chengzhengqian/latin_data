that mine were the car from which first came the seeds of Ceres when cast on the untilled ground.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL041_469_a" id="target_note_LCL041_469_a"><sup>a</sup></a> But the wonders whereof I speak are false tales of olden bards; no day e’er brought them forth, and no day will.</p>

Thine, O torrent, will be hate unbearable, believe, if I perchance am said to have been kept by thee—I, a lover! Rivers ought to aid young men in love; what love is, rivers themselves have felt. The Inachus, they say, went pale for Bithynian Melie, and his chill waves felt love’s warmth. Not yet had Troy been under siege two lustrums when Neaera ravished thine eyes, O Xanthus. What? did not Alpheus flow in far-separate lands, driven by faithful love for Arcadian maid?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL041_469_b" id="target_note_LCL041_469_b"><sup>b</sup></a> Thou, too, Peneus, they say didst hide away, in the land of the Phthiotes, Creusa, promised bride to Xuthus. Why call to mind Asopus, smitten with Thebe, child of Mars— Thebe, destined mother of daughters five? If I ask of thee, Achelous, where are now thy horns, thou wilt complain of their breaking by wrathful Hercules’ hand; what neither Calydon could win from him, nor all Aetolia, Deianira none the less alone could win. Rich Nile yonder, who flows through seven mouths and hides so well the homeland of his mighty waters, ’tis said could not drown out with his own floods the fires Asopus’ child Euanthe kindled in him. Enipeus, to dry himself for the arms of Salmoneus’ child, bade his waters retire; the waters, so bid, retired.</p>
