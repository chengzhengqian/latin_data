wrongs called forth: “Oh, would that my bones had been gathered and laid away in the tomb of my fathers when they yet could be gathered the bones of a maid! Why, but now a Vestal, am I bid to any marriage-torch, disgraced and to be denied my place at Ilion’s altar-fires?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL041_473_a" id="target_note_LCL041_473_a"><sup>a</sup></a> Why tarry I alive to be pointed out a jade by the finger of the crowd? Perish the face that bears the brand of shame and disrespect!”</p>

The smooth-gliding stream, they say, laid his hands to her breast and bore her up, and shared with her the rights of the wedded couch.</p>
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">83</span><span class="br"></span><p>Thou, too, ’tis easy to believe, hast warmed for some fair maid; but grove and forest cover up thy fault. Even while I speak, thy waters have grown more deep and wide, and thy channel, though deep, contains not the headlong waves. What have I with thee, mad stream? Why dost thou defer the joys I am to share? Why dost thou, churl, break off the journey I have begun? What? wert thou called rightly stream, wert thou a river of name, were thine greatest fame o’er all the earth— but thou hast no name, thou art but gathered from failing rivulets, and hast neither fountain-source nor fixed abode! In place of source thou hast only the rain and the melted snows, riches that sluggish winter serves to thee; either thou runnest a muddy course in the brumal time, or hast a dried and dusty bed. What thirsty farer has e’er been able then to drink of thee? Who in grateful tone has said of thee: “Mayst thou flow on for ever?”
