Or is this rather the heat of my heart and not of the air, and does love for a woman burn my ravished breast? While I am talking, a sprinkling of light dust has got on your white dress. Vile dust, away from this snowy body!</p>

The time for applause is here—the golden procession is coming.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL041_453_a" id="target_note_LCL041_453_a"><sup>a</sup></a> First in the train is Victory, borne with wings outspread—come hither, goddess, and help my love to win! Applaud Neptune, ye who trust o’ermuch the wave! Naught will I with the sea; I choose that the land keep me. Applaud thy Mars, O soldier! Arms I detest; peace is my delight, and love that is found in the midst of peace. And Phoebus—let him be gracious to augurs, and Phoebe gracious to huntsmen! Minerva, turn in applause to thee the craftsman’s hands! Ye country dwellers, rise to Ceres and tender Bacchus! Let the boxer court Pollux, the horseman Castor! We, winsome Venus, we applaud thee, and thy children potent with the bow; smile, O goddess, upon my undertakings, and put the right mind in my heart’s new mistress! Let her endure to be loved!</p>

What the goddess has promised, yourself promise, I ask; with Venus’ permission let me say it, you will be the greater goddess. I swear to you by all these witnesses and by the train of the gods, I am asking you to be for all time to come my queen!</p>
