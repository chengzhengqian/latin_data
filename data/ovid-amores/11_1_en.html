 thus exclude a lover? The hours of the night are going; away with the bar from the door!<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL041_339_a" id="target_note_LCL041_339_a"><sup>a</sup></a></p>
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">33</span><span class="br"></span><p>I come with no following of soldiers, and under arms; I were alone, were cruel Love not at my side. Him, even should I wish, I can nowhere dismiss; ere that, I shall be divided from my very self. And so, you see, it is Love, and moderate wine coursing through my temples, and a chaplet falling from my perfume-laden hair, that are my escort. Who would tremble before arms like these? Who would not go to face them? The hours of night are going; away with the bar from the door!</p>
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">41</span><span class="br"></span><p>You are unyielding; or does sleep—and may it be the ruin of you!—give to the winds the lover’s words your ears repulse? Yet at first, I remember, when I wished to escape your eye, you were wakeful up to the midnight stars. It may be that you, too, have a love, who is resting even now at your side—alas, how much better your lot than mine! Could I be only in such case, come hither, hard chains, to me! The hours of the night are going; away with the bar from the door!</p>

I am deceived—it was only the beating of a gusty wind upon the portal. Ah me, how far has that breeze borne away my hope! If thou rememberest well thy stolen Orithyia, Boreas, come hither, and beat down with thy blast these deaf doors! Through all the city there is silence, and, wet with the crystal dew, the hours of the night are passing; away with the bar from the door!</p>
