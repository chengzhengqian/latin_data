<h2>VI</h2>
<p><span class="italic">Fulgentius Mythologiae I (p. 12 ed. Helm):</span> You do not know . . . how women dread satire. Lawyers may retreat and scholars may not utter a syllable before the flood of a woman’s words, the rhetorician may be dumb and the herald may stop his cries; satire alone can put a limit to their madness, though it be Petronius’s <span class="italic">Albucia</span> who is in heat.</p>

<h2>VII</h2>
<p><span class="italic">Fulgentius Mythologiae III, 8 (p. 73). (where he remarked that essence of myrrh is very strong):</span> Hence too Petronius Arbiter says <span class="italic">that he drank a myrrhine cup<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL015_391_1a" id="target_note_LCL015_391_1a"><sup>1</sup></a> in order to excite his passion.</span></p>

<h2>VIII</h2>
<p><span class="italic">Fulgentius in his Treatise on the Contents of Virgil’s works (p. 98):</span> For we have already explained above the application of the myth of Cerberus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL015_391_2" id="target_note_LCL015_391_2"><sup>2</sup></a> with Three Heads to quarrels and litigation in the courts. Hence too Petronius says against <span class="italic">Euscios, “The barrister was a Cerberus of the courts</span>.” C.f. <span class="italic">Fragm. XI</span> and p. 81.</p>

But at least the words <span class="italic">myrrhinum poculum</span> can be genuine. The expression would mean not a cup of myrrh, but a “myrrhine cup,” that is, one made either of best agate or of fluor-spar. In Book XXXVII, 18–22 of his <span class="italic">Natural History,</span> Pliny describes the costly “myrrhina,” the description on 21 and 22 suiting fluor-spar, one of its merits being its smell, probably caused by hot resin in which the fluor-spar was soaked to prevent it from falling to pieces when it was worked. In 20 Pliny says that Titus Petronius, when he was about to die, broke, to spite Nero, a myrrhine dipper which Petronius had bought for 300,000 sesterces, so that he thus far disinherited Nero’s table.
