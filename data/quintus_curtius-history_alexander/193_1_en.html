the outcome of the war, which broke out suddenly, yet was ended before Alexander overcame Darius at Arbela.</p>
<p>II. But Alexander, as soon as a mind which was better qualified for coping with military toil than with quiet and ease was relieved of pressing cares, gave himself up to pleasures, and one whom the arms of the Persians had not overcome fell victim to their vices: <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> banquets begun early,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL369_17_a" id="target_note_LCL369_17_a"><sup>a</sup></a> the mad enjoyment of heavy drinking and being up all night,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL369_17_b" id="target_note_LCL369_17_b"><sup>b</sup></a> sport, and troops of harlots. There was a general slipping into foreign habits. By emulating these, as if they were preferable to those of his country, he so offended alike the eyes and the minds of his countrymen, that by many of <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> his former friends he was regarded as an enemy. For men who held fast to<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL369_17_c" id="target_note_LCL369_17_c"><sup>c</sup></a> their native discipline, and were accustomed with frugal and easily obtained<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL369_17_d" id="target_note_LCL369_17_d"><sup>d</sup></a> food to satisfy the demands of nature, he had driven to the <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span> evil habits of foreign and conquered nations. Hence the more frequent making of plots against his life, mutiny of the soldiers, and freer expression of resentment amid mutual complaints, then on his own part now anger, now suspicions aroused by groundless fear, and other similar evils, of which an account will <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span> be given later. Alexander, therefore, when he was wasting days and nights alike in early and prolonged banquets, used to relieve the satiety of his feasts with entertainments, not content with a throng of artists<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL369_17_e" id="target_note_LCL369_17_e"><sup>e</sup></a> whom he had summoned from Greece; for captive women were bidden to sing after their manner a song discordant and hateful to foreign ears,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL369_17_f" id="target_note_LCL369_17_f"><sup>f</sup></a></p>
