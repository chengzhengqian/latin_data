No poison is more dangerous; for instant death followed their bite unless an antidote was <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">13</span><span class="br"></span> furnished by the natives. From there over deserts<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL369_369_b" id="target_note_LCL369_369_b"><sup>b</sup></a> they came to the river Hyraotis.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL369_369_c" id="target_note_LCL369_369_c"><sup>c</sup></a> Close to the river was a shady grove, abounding in trees not seen elsewhere <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">14</span><span class="br"></span> and in a quantity of wild peafowl.
