believed would keep in silence the secrets about himself <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">8</span><span class="br"></span> self, having named others, me alone he left out. Pray, fellow-soldiers, if Cebalinus had not come to me, if he had wished me to know nothing about the conspirators, would I to-day be pleading my cause, when <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">9</span><span class="br"></span> no one named me? Suppose that Dymnus were still alive and wished to spare me, what of the rest? Those who will confess their own guilt will of course be silent about me! Calamity is malign, and as a rule a guilty person, when suffering his own torture, <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">10</span><span class="br"></span> assents to that of another. Will so many accomplices not confess the truth even when placed upon the rack? And yet no one spares one who is about to die, and in my opinion one who is about to die spares no one.</p>
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">11</span><span class="br"></span><p>“I must return to the real and only accusation against me: ‘Why did you keep silence about the matter which was reported to you? why did you hear it with so little concern?’ This, such as it is, you, Alexander, wherever you are, pardoned when I confessed it; grasping your right hand, as a pledge of restored friendship, I even was present at your <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">12</span><span class="br"></span> banquet. If you believed me, I was acquitted, if you spared me, I was dismissed; pray abide by your decision. What have I done during this last night, when I left your table? what new crime has been reported <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">13</span><span class="br"></span> to you and changed your mind? I was resting in heavy sleep, when, as I had fallen asleep over my misfortunes, my enemies awakened me by binding me. Whence did such deep sleep come to a traitor and <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">14</span><span class="br"></span> one who had been betrayed? The wicked cannot sleep soundly because of the clamours of conscience; the Furies torment them when their treason is merely planned, much more when it has been accomplished.
