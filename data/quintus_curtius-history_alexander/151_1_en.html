might be more inclined to believe that the king
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">15</span><span class="br"></span>himself was in the camp. Further, if haply Ario-barzanes should have learned that he was entering through the winding paths,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL368_365_a" id="target_note_LCL368_365_a"><sup>a</sup></a> and should try to oppose a part of his forces to block his advance, Craterus was to hold him back by alarming him, and force him to turn the attention of his army to the nearer
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">16</span><span class="br"></span>danger; but if he himself should elude the enemy and get possession of the pass, then Craterus, following the king, when he heard the noise made by the confusion of the enemy, must not hesitate to take that same route from which they had been driven the day before; for it would be empty when the attention of the enemy had been turned to himself.</p>
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">17</span><span class="br"></span><p>Alexander himself in the third watch in silent march and not even having given the signal with the trumpet, went on to the route, which had been pointed out, through the paths; he had ordered the soldiers, who were lightly armed, to carry provisions
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">18</span><span class="br"></span>for three days. But besides the pathless rocks and steep crags which from time to time made their footing insecure,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL368_365_b" id="target_note_LCL368_365_b"><sup>b</sup></a> snow drifted by the wind made their progress wearisome; for they were swallowed up as if they had fallen into pits, and when their comrades tried to lift them out, they dragged down instead of coming up with those who were aiding
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">19</span><span class="br"></span>them. Night also and the unknown country, as well as the guide—since it was uncertain whether he was wholly to be trusted—increased their fear; for if he had deceived his guards, they themselves could be caught like so much wild game. The safety of their king and of themselves depended either on the trustworthiness or the life of a single prisoner.</p>
