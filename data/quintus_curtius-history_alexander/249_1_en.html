addressing one of the basest<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL369_129_a" id="target_note_LCL369_129_a"><sup>a</sup></a> and one who enjoyed only this privilege of military service, of distributing the horses of others to those who were going to fight. For it has come to this condition of evils, that I must excuse my words at the same time both to Alexander and to Antiphanes!</p>
