<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span>by an oracle to do that thing. The envoys replied that there was a temple of Hercules outside of the city, in the place which they call Old Tyre<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL368_177_b" id="target_note_LCL368_177_b"><sup>b</sup></a>; that there the king would properly offer sacrifice to

And there was nothing which more than that wind stood in the way of receiving the work by which the Macedonians were preparing to join the island to the mainland.
