this victory in greater part to his merit than to his fortune; he won it by his genius, not, as before, by
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">28</span><span class="br"></span>the advantage of the ground. For he drew up his line of battle with the utmost skill, he personally fought most valiantly, and with great good judgement he scorned the loss of packs and baggage, since he saw that the issue of ultimate success depended upon his line of battle, and while the result of the fight was still in doubt, he conducted himself as a victor.</p>
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">29</span><span class="br"></span><p>Then, when he had routed the panic-stricken foe he pursued them in their flight with greater prudence than over-eagerness, a thing which can hardly be
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">30</span><span class="br"></span>believed in a man of such fiery spirit. For if, while a part of his army was still engaged in battle, he had persisted in pressing after them as they gave way, he would either have been defeated through his own fault, or he would have owed his victory to anotherâ€™s valour. Finally, if he had yielded to fear of the large force of cavalry which fell upon him he would have been forced, in the hour of victory, either to flee in disgrace or to perish miserably.</p>
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">31</span><span class="br"></span><p>The leaders of his forces too must not be cheated of their meed of glory; in fact the wounds which each
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">32</span><span class="br"></span>man suffered are proofs of their valour; Hephaestion was struck in the arm by a spear, Perdiccas and Coenus and Menidas were all but slain with arrows.</p>
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">33</span><span class="br"></span><p>And if we wish justly to estimate the Macedonians of that day, we shall admit that their king was fully worthy of such subordinates, and they of so great a king.</p>
