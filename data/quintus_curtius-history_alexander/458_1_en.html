<p>IX. But already by the Fates civil wars were being forced upon the Macedonian nation; for royal power desires no associate<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL369_547_a" id="target_note_LCL369_547_a"><sup>a</sup></a> and was being sought by many. <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> First therefore they brought their forces into collision, then separated them; and when they had weighted the body with more than it could carry, the limbs<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL369_547_b" id="target_note_LCL369_547_b"><sup>b</sup></a> also began to give out, and an empire that might have endured under one man fell in ruins while it was <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> being upheld by many. Therefore the Roman people rightly and deservedly asserts that it owes its safety to its prince,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL369_547_c" id="target_note_LCL369_547_c"><sup>c</sup></a> who in the night which was almost our <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span> last shone forth like a new star.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL369_547_d" id="target_note_LCL369_547_d"><sup>d</sup></a> The rising of this star, by Heaven! rather than that of the sun, restored light to the world in darkness, since lacking their head the limbs were thrown into disorder. <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span> How many firebrands did it extinguish! How many swords did it sheath! How great a tempest did it dispel with sudden prosperity! Therefore our empire <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">6</span><span class="br"></span> not only lives afresh but even flourishes. Provided only that the divine jealousy be absent, the posterity of that same house will continue the good times of this our age, it is to be hoped forever, at any rate for very many years.</p>
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">7</span><span class="br"></span><p>But to return to the series of events from which the contemplation of the public happiness had diverted me, Perdiccas rested the sole hope of his safety on the death of Meleager; he thought that a man who was vain, faithless and quick to revolt, and his own bitterest enemy, must be attacked first. <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">8</span><span class="br"></span> But he hid his design with deep dissimulation, in order to crush him when he was off his guard.
