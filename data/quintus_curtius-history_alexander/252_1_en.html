<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">11</span><span class="br"></span><p>Then he dismissed the assembly and ordered Polydamas<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL369_135_b" id="target_note_LCL369_135_b"><sup>b</sup></a> to be called. He was by far the dearest of Parmenion’s friends, accustomed to stand by his side <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">12</span><span class="br"></span> in battle. And although, relying on a clear conscience, he had come into headquarters, yet when he was ordered to produce<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL369_135_c" id="target_note_LCL369_135_c"><sup>c</sup></a> his brothers, who were very young and unknown to the king because of their youth, his confidence changed to anxiety and he began to be afraid, considering more frequently what could harm them than by what means he could parry <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">13</span><span class="br"></span> such attacks.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL369_135_d" id="target_note_LCL369_135_d"><sup>d</sup></a> And now the guards who had been ordered to do so had brought them in, when the king ordered Polydamas, deathly pale with fear, to draw nearer, and, removing all witnesses, said: “We have all alike been attacked by the crime of Parmenion, especially you and I, whom he has deceived by the <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">14</span><span class="br"></span> guise of friendship. To pursue and punish him—see how much I trust to your loyalty—I have decided to use you as my instrument. While you are doing <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">15</span><span class="br"></span> this, your brothers will be hostages.

You will also take letters to Parmenion, one from me, the other written in the name of Philotas. The seal of his ring is in my possession.
