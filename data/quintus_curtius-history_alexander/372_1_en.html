began to pull away the leg of a dog that with the others was clinging to the lion, and then, because the animal did not let go, to cut the leg off with a <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">33</span><span class="br"></span> knife. When even then the dog’s persistency was not overcome, he began to cut another part, and when the dog held fast with equal strength, to make cuts at the dog’s body as well; but the dog even in dying kept his teeth fixed in the lion’s wound. Such is the eagerness for the chase which Nature is <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">34</span><span class="br"></span> reported to have implanted in those animals. As for myself, I report more things than I believe; for I cannot bring myself to vouch for that about which I am in doubt, nor to suppress what I have heard. <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">35</span><span class="br"></span> Alexander then, leaving Sopithes in his kingdom, advanced to the river Hypasis,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL369_375_a" id="target_note_LCL369_375_a"><sup>a</sup></a> joined by Hephaestion, <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">36</span><span class="br"></span> who had subdued a different region.

On the third day he had decided to pass over the river, which was difficult to pass, not only because of the extent of its waters, but also because it was encumbered <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> with rocks. Accordingly, having inquired of Phegeus what he needed to know, he learned that beyond the river there was a journey of twelve days through desert wastes and that then they came to <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> the Ganges, the greatest river of all India, and that on its farther bank dwelt the races called Gangaridae and Prasii; that their king was Aggrammes<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL369_375_c" id="target_note_LCL369_375_c"><sup>c</sup></a> and that he was blocking the roads with 20,000 cavalry
