Nabarzanes, a general of Darius, had sent it, urging Sisines to accomplish something worthy of his rank and character; that it

This advice was less displeasing to the king than to his courtiers; they declared that men of doubtful loyalty, to be bought for pay,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL368_109_c" id="target_note_LCL368_109_c"><sup>c</sup></a> were intent upon treachery, and wished his forces to be divided for no
