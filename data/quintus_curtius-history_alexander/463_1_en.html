after their manner, at first, as if he were still breathing, did not dare to lay their hands upon him; then after praying that it might be right and lawful for mortals to handle a god, they emptied the body of entrails, the golden coffin was filled with perfumes, and the emblem of his rank was placed upon the king’s head.</p>
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">14</span><span class="br"></span><p>Many believed that he had been slain by poison<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL369_557_a" id="target_note_LCL369_557_a"><sup>a</sup></a>; that a son of Antipater among his attendants, Iollas by name, had administered it by his father’s command. Certain it is that Alexander was often heard to say that Antipater took upon himself the, state of a king, that he was more powerful than a prefect ought to be, and that he was puffed up by the rich spoil and fame<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL369_557_b" id="target_note_LCL369_557_b"><sup>b</sup></a> of his Spartan victory while he claimed <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">15</span><span class="br"></span> as his own all that the king had given him.
