to have an expression presenting the appearance of joy, he ran to embrace him, and after they had exchanged greetings, Polydamas handed him the letter <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">25</span><span class="br"></span> written to him by the king. Parmenion, as he loosed the fastening<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL369_139_a" id="target_note_LCL369_139_a"><sup>a</sup></a> of the letter, asked what the king was doing. Polydamas replied that he would learn from <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">26</span><span class="br"></span> the letter itself. Parmenion, after reading the letter, said: “The king is preparing an expedition against the Arachosii.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL369_139_b" id="target_note_LCL369_139_b"><sup>b</sup></a> An active man, who never rests! But it is time for him to show consideration for his own welfare, after having already gained so much glory.” <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">27</span><span class="br"></span> Afterwards he was reading the second letter, written in the name of Philotas, with pleasure, as could be seen from his expression; then Cleander plunged his sword into his side and struck him again in the throat, and the others stabbed him even after he was lifeless.</p>
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">28</span><span class="br"></span><p>And the guards, who were posted at the entrance of the grove, on learning of the murder, the cause of which was unknown to them, came into the camp and aroused the soldiers with the alarming message. <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">29</span><span class="br"></span> They armed themselves and went in a body to the grove in which the murder had been committed, threatening that unless Polydamas and the rest who had shared in the same outrage<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL369_139_c" id="target_note_LCL369_139_c"><sup>c</sup></a> were delivered to them, they would throw down the wall surrounding the grove and offer expiation for the death of their <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">30</span><span class="br"></span> leader with the blood of all. Cleander ordered their leaders to be admitted, and read to the soldiers the letters which the king had written, in which were contained an account of the plots of Parmenion against the king and Alexander’s prayers that they <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">31</span><span class="br"></span> should avenge him. Accordingly, when the wish of the king was known, the mutiny of the troops was checked, but nevertheless not their indignation.
