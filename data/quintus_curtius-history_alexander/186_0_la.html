<p><span class="italic">While Alexander was winning victories in Asia there were disturbances in Greece and Macedonia. Agis, king of Lacedaemon, urges the Greeks to throw off the Macedonian yoke while the Persians still had power to resist. With money from Pharnabazus and Autophradates he hired mercenaries, and taking advantage of Antipater’s absence in Thrace, won over to his side nearly the whole Peloponnesus and raised an army of 20,000 foot and 2000 horse. Antipater settled the war in Thrace on the best conditions he could and from the friendly and allied cities of Greece raised 40,000 troops. He sent messengers to Alexander informing him of the revolt and theking sent him money and ships. The beginning of the war was favourable to the Lacedaemonians. The final battle was hotly contested, but after Antipater constantly sent fresh troops to the aid of his hard-pressed men, the Lacedaemonians began to give ground. Thereupon Agis with the royal cohort, his bravest men, rushed into the thick of the fight.</span></p>
<p>A description of the battle. Agis fights valiantly, but is slain. The Greek army is defeated and the revolt collapses. Antipater, knowing Alexander’s spirit, did not venture to act as arbiter, but left that to a council of the Greeks. The Lacedaemonians through envoys gain pardon from Alexander (i).</p>
<p>Alexander, invincible in war, is overcome by leisure and pleasure. His adoption of foreign habits gave offence to his own countrymen and led to conspiracies and mutinies. He favours those of his prisoners who are of high birth. A rumour arises that the king thinks of returning to Macedonia (ii).</p>
<p>Alexander reviews what he has accomplished, tells his men what remains to be done and urges them to bring the war to a triumphant conclusion (iii).</p>
