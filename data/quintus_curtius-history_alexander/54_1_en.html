<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">28</span><span class="br"></span>of circumstances. And having roused his soldiers to the hope offered by so great an exploit, he told them that Sabaces, the governor of Egypt, had fallen in battle; that the Persian garrison was both leaderless and weak, and that the Egyptians, always at odds with their governors, would regard them as allies,
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">29</span><span class="br"></span>not as enemies. Necessity compelled them to try everything; for when Fortune has stranded our first hopes, the future seems to be preferable to the present. Therefore they all shouted that he might lead them wherever he wished. So, thinking it best to make use of their spirits while they were warm with hope,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL368_171_c" id="target_note_LCL368_171_c"><sup>c</sup></a> he made his way to the Pelusian mouth,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL368_171_d" id="target_note_LCL368_171_d"><sup>d</sup></a> pretending that he had been sent as governor by
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">30</span><span class="br"></span>Darius. Then, having got possession of Pelusium, he moved his forces on to Memphis. At the report of this the Egyptians, a fickle race<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL368_171_e" id="target_note_LCL368_171_e"><sup>e</sup></a> and more inclined to start a revolution than to achieve anything great<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL368_171_f" id="target_note_LCL368_171_f"><sup>f</sup></a> of their own accord rushed thither together, each from his own village or city, to destroy the Persian garrisons.</p>
