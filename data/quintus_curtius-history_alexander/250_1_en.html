Macedonian infantry and 600 horsemen<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL369_131_a" id="target_note_LCL369_131_a"><sup>a</sup></a>; a part of these would not have followed me, if I had been willing to show indulgence to those who shrank from military service. Therefore it follows that, because it is for that reason that she is angry with us, you should soothe your mother, since it is you who have exposed us to her anger.”</p>
<p>II. While Amyntas was making this plea, those chanced to arrive who had pursued his brother Polemon, of whom mention has been made before,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL369_131_b" id="target_note_LCL369_131_b"><sup>b</sup></a> and whom, being in flight, they were bringing back in bonds. The incensed assembly could hardly be restrained from at once stoning him to death, according to their custom. But he, quite unterrified, said: <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> “I ask no mercy for myself, provided my flight be not prejudicial to the innocence of my brothers.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL369_131_c" id="target_note_LCL369_131_c"><sup>c</sup></a> If this cannot be defended, let the guilt be mine. Their cause is the better for the very reason that I was <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> suspected because I took flight.” But when he had said this, the whole assembly sympathized; now they all began to shed tears, and were suddenly so changed to the opposite opinion that what had especially damaged his cause was the only thing that was <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span> in his favour. He was a young man just come to maturity and in the first bloom of his youth, one of the horsemen who had been terrified by the torture of Philotas and whom the alarm of others had led to flee; deserted by his companions, and wavering between the purpose of returning and of fleeing, he was overtaken by those who had followed him.
