But such was the darkness that the only thing which revealed the buildings was <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">16</span><span class="br"></span> their smoke. When the natives, who had never before seen a stranger in their country, suddenly caught sight of armed men, they were paralysed with fear and brought them whatever they had in their <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">17</span><span class="br"></span> huts, begging them to spare their lives.
