with a few over whom shame had more power than fear, proceeded to collect his scattered forces and to advance against the foe, giving orders that the elephants be put in front of his line of troops.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL369_353_a" id="target_note_LCL369_353_a"><sup>a</sup></a> <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">23</span><span class="br"></span> The brutes caused great terror, and their trumpeting not only threw into confusion the horses, animals so fearful of everything, but also the men and the ranks.</p>
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">24</span><span class="br"></span><p>And already those who shortly before were victors were looking about for an opportunity for flight, when Alexander sent against the elephants the lightarmed Agriani and the other Thracians, troops <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">25</span><span class="br"></span> better in a rapid attack<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL369_353_b" id="target_note_LCL369_353_b"><sup>b</sup></a> than in close combat. These cast a great shower of weapons both upon the elephants and upon those who were guiding them.
