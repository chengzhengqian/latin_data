have fallen under a tyranny endurable neither to the gods, to whom he makes himself equal, nor to men, <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">25</span><span class="br"></span> from whom he separates himself. Have we at the price of our blood created a god who disdains us, who is reluctant to enter into council with mortals? Believe me, we too, if we are men, shall be adopted by <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">26</span><span class="br"></span> the gods. Who avenged the death of Alexander,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL369_107_a" id="target_note_LCL369_107_a"><sup>a</sup></a> the ancestor of this one, who afterwards that of Archelaüs,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL369_107_b" id="target_note_LCL369_107_b"><sup>b</sup></a> who of Perdiccas?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL369_107_c" id="target_note_LCL369_107_c"><sup>c</sup></a> He himself pardoned the murderers of his father.’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL369_107_d" id="target_note_LCL369_107_d"><sup>d</sup></a></p>
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">27</span><span class="br"></span><p>“These were the words of Hegelochus at dinner<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL369_107_e" id="target_note_LCL369_107_e"><sup>e</sup></a>; and on the dawn of the following day I was summoned by my father. He was troubled and saw that I was sad; for we had heard what struck anxiety <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">28</span><span class="br"></span> into our hearts. Therefore, in order to learn whether Hegelochus had blurted out those words when heavy with wine, or whether they were inspired by some deeper design, we decided to have him summoned. He came, and after repeating the same sentiments of his own accord, he added that if we dared to take the lead, he would claim from us the honour of seconding our plan, or if we lacked the courage, he would bury <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">29</span><span class="br"></span> the plan in silence. To Parmenion the plan seemed premature while Darius still lived: for they would be killing Alexander, not for themselves, but for the enemy; but if Darius were out of the way, as a reward for killing the king Asia and the entire Orient would fall to his slayers. This advice was approved, and a pledge to that end was given and received. <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">30</span><span class="br"></span> So far as Dymnus is concerned, I know nothing, but I know that after this confession it does not avail me that I have no part in the present crime.”</p>
