to me and mine to you, in which we rival each other, I beg and implore you not to desert your foster-child and fellow soldier, not to say your king,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL369_385_a" id="target_note_LCL369_385_a"><sup>a</sup></a> as he is <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">29</span><span class="br"></span> approaching the ends of the universe. All the rest I have ordered you to do; this one thing I shall owe you. And I who ask this of you am one wno has never ordered you to do anything without first exposing himself to its dangers, one who has often covered the army with his shield. Do not break the palm<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL369_385_b" id="target_note_LCL369_385_b"><sup>b</sup></a> that is in my hands, with which I shall equal Hercules and Father Liber, if Nemesis withhold her <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">30</span><span class="br"></span> hands.
