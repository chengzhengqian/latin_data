Athenian, a celebrated boxer, and because of the extraordinary greatness<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL369_429_a" id="target_note_LCL369_429_a"><sup>a</sup></a> of his strength already both well known to the king and a favourite of his. Some through jealousy and malice carped at him with mingled seriousness and jest, saying that they had as a companion a useless brute with an over-fed body; that while they entered battle, he, dripping <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">17</span><span class="br"></span> with oil, was preparing his belly for feasts. Thus it was that at the banquet Corratas, a Macedonian, already overcome by wine, began to upbraid Dioxippus, and to demand that, if he were a man, he should fight with him on the following day with swords; that the king at last would have an opportunity to judge of Corratas’ rashness or the other’s <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">18</span><span class="br"></span> cowardice.
