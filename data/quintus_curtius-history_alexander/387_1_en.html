wall.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL369_405_a" id="target_note_LCL369_405_a"><sup>a</sup></a> The crown of the wall was narrow and its summit was not marked by battlements, as is usually the case, but a parapet was built all along it and prevented <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">31</span><span class="br"></span> assailants from crossing it. Hence the king was rather clinging to this parapet than standing on its edge, defending himself with his buckler from the <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">32</span><span class="br"></span> spears that fell upon him from every side; for he was being attacked at long range from the towers<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL369_405_b" id="target_note_LCL369_405_b"><sup>b</sup></a> and his soldiers could not come up<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL369_405_c" id="target_note_LCL369_405_c"><sup>c</sup></a> because they were overwhelmed by a storm of weapons from above. But at last shame overcame the greatness of their peril; for they saw that by their delay the king was <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">33</span><span class="br"></span> being abandoned to the enemy. But their help was delayed by their hurry; for while each man strove to be the first to reach the top of the wall they overloaded the ladders; and when these could not hold the burden put upon them, they fell and thus deprived the king of his sole hope. For in the sight of so great an army he stood alone, as if left utterly deserted.</p>
<p>V. By this time he had tired his left hand, by which he was shifting his shield about to parry the shots, and his friends were shouting to him to leap down to them, and were standing ready to catch him; when he dared an incredible and unheard-of deed, one which added much more to his reputation for rashness <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> than to his glory. For with a headlong leap he threw himself into the city filled with enemies, although he could hardly hope<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL369_405_d" id="target_note_LCL369_405_d"><sup>d</sup></a> that he would at least die fighting and not unavenged; for before he could rise to his feet, he was likely to be overpowered and taken <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> prisoner. But by good luck he had balanced his body so well that he alighted on his feet; hence he was standing erect when he began to fight. Fortune
