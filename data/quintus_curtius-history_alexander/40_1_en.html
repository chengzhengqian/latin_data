some of the captive eunuchs pointed out which was Alexander, and Sisigambis fell at his feet, begging pardon for not recognizing the king, whom she had never seen before. The king, taking her hand and raising her to her feet, said: “You were not mistaken, mother; for this man too is Alexander.”
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">18</span><span class="br"></span>And indeed, if he could have continued to practise such moderation to the end of his life, I could believe that he would have been happier than he seemed to be when he was imitating the triumphal procession of Father Liber, passing victorious over every nation all the way from the Hellespont to the Ocean.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL368_143_a" id="target_note_LCL368_143_a"><sup>a</sup></a></p>
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">19</span><span class="br"></span><p>Then he would surely have mastered pride and wrath, faults which he did not conquer, thus he would have refrained from murdering his friends at banquets, and he would have feared to put to death without a trial men distinguished in warfare, and in company

But at that time, at any rate, he so conducted himself that he surpassed all former kings in continence and clemency; the royal maidens of surpassing beauty he treated with as much deference as if they had been
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">22</span><span class="br"></span>born from the same mother as himself: the wife of Darius, who was also his sister, whom no woman of her time surpassed in personal beauty, he was so far from violating, that he took the greatest care that no one should make shameful sport of her person
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">23</span><span class="br"></span>while she was a prisoner. He gave orders that all their ornaments should be returned to the women, and the captives lacked nothing of the splendour of their former fortune except confidence.</p>
