The walls and towers of the city were surrounded by very deep sea; artillery could not be used except when its shots were hurled from ships at a distance, nor could scaling-ladders be applied to the fortifications, since the walls, descending sheer into the surge, had blocked any approach on foot; moreover Alexander had no ships, and if he could have brought them up to the wall, being afloat and unsteady,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL368_179_b" id="target_note_LCL368_179_b"><sup>b</sup></a> they could have been kept at bay by missiles.</p>

Accordingly, the Tyrians declared war and placed artillery at intervals along the walls and in the towers, distributed arms to the men of military age, and assigned workmen, of whom the city had a great abundance, to the various factories. The whole place resounded with preparation for war; iron hands<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL368_179_ea" id="target_note_LCL368_179_ea"><sup>e</sup></a> also (they call them <span class="italic">harpagones,</span>“grapplers”), to throw upon the enemies’
