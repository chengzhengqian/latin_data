<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">20</span><span class="br"></span><p>At last they reached the summit. On the right was a road to Ariobarzanes himself; here the king left Philotas and Coenus with Amyntas and Polypercon in command of a light-armed band, advising them to advance slowly, since cavalry<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL368_367_a" id="target_note_LCL368_367_a"><sup>a</sup></a> mixed with infantry were marching, and the soil was very rich and abounded in fodder; guides for their route were given them from among the prisoners.</p>
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">21</span><span class="br"></span><p>Alexander himself with his guards and a company of what they called the <span class="italic">agema,</span> advanced<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL368_367_b" id="target_note_LCL368_367_b"><sup>b</sup></a> with great trouble by a path which was steep, but more remote
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">22</span><span class="br"></span>from the pickets of the enemy. It was midday, and rest was essential for the wearied soldiers—for as much of the route was left as they had traversed, but
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">23</span><span class="br"></span>it was less steep and difficult—therefore, when the troops had been refreshed by food and sleep, he continued his march<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL368_367_c" id="target_note_LCL368_367_c"><sup>c</sup></a> of at the second watch. And the rest he passed over without trouble; but where the summit of the mountains gradually descends to the more level ground, a great abyss, hollowed out by the rushing together of torrents, had broken
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">24</span><span class="br"></span>into the road. Besides this, the branches of the trees, entangled one with another and clinging together, had interposed an apparently continuous hedge. In consequence, such extreme despair had fallen upon them, that they could hardly refrain
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">25</span><span class="br"></span>from tears. The darkness especially was a cause of terror; for even if any stars shone through the clouds, the trees, which were completely covered with leaves, prevented them from getting sight of them. Not even the use of their ears was left them, since the woods were shaken by the wind, which made a greater noise when the branches knocked against each other than was proportionate to its blast.</p>
