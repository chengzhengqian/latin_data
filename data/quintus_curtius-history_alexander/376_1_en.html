for the first time will have to withstand a disorderly <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">23</span><span class="br"></span> throng! Testimony to the invincible strength of the Macedonians against a superior number is given by the river Granicus, by the flooding of Cilicia with the blood of the Persians, and by Arbela, whose plains are strewn with the bones of those whom we <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">24</span><span class="br"></span> decisively defeated. You are late in having begun to count<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL369_383_a" id="target_note_LCL369_383_a"><sup>a</sup></a> the enemy’s legions, after you have made a desert in Asia by your victories. When we were sailing through the Hellespont was the time to think of our small numbers; now the Scythians follow us, we have Bactrian auxiliaries at hand, the Dahae <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">25</span><span class="br"></span> and the Sogdiani are fighting in our ranks. Yet it is not in that mob that I trust. To your hands I look, your valour I have as a bail and a surety for what I am about to accomplish. So long as I shall stand in battle with you I do not number my army nor that of the enemy; do you only furnish me with hearts full <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">26</span><span class="br"></span> of enthusiasm and confidence. We stand, not on the threshold of our labours and toils, but at the end; we have come to the rising sun<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL369_383_b" id="target_note_LCL369_383_b"><sup>b</sup></a> and the Ocean. If cowardice does not stand in our way we shall return from there in triumph to our native land after subduing the whole world.</p>
<p>“Do not, as lazy husbandmen do, through negligence <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">27</span><span class="br"></span> let the ripe crop escape your grasp. The prizes are greater than the dangers; that region is both rich and unwarlike.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL369_383_c" id="target_note_LCL369_383_c"><sup>c</sup></a> Therefore I am leading you not so much to glory as to booty. You deserve to bear back to your native land the wealth which that sea casts upon its shores,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL369_383_d" id="target_note_LCL369_383_d"><sup>d</sup></a> you deserve to leave nothing untried, nothing neglected through <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">28</span><span class="br"></span> fear. By yourselves and your glory, in which you rise above human heights, and by your services
