He had thrown himself on the ground, while all the whole royal quarters rang with his groans and piteous wailing. Then he tore his face with his nails, begging those who stood around him not to suffer him to survive such a disgrace.</p>
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">6</span><span class="br"></span><p>Amid prayers like these the whole night was spent. And while he was considering whether he had been driven to commit such a great crime by the anger of the gods, it occurred to him that he had not paid the annual sacrifice to Father Liber at the appointed time. Hence it was evident that the murder committed amid wine and feasting was a manifestation <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">7</span><span class="br"></span> of the anger of that god. But the king was still more disturbed because he saw that the minds of all his friends were terror-stricken, that no one would dare hereafter to converse<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL369_249_a" id="target_note_LCL369_249_a"><sup>a</sup></a> with him, but he must live in solitude like a savage beast which now inspires terror in other beasts and at other times is itself in fear <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">8</span><span class="br"></span> of them. Later, at dawn, he ordered the body to be taken into his tent, all bloody as it still was. When it was placed before him, he said with eyes filled with tears: “This is my requital to my nurse,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL369_249_b" id="target_note_LCL369_249_b"><sup>b</sup></a> whose two sons met death at Miletus for my glory, this her brother, the sole comfort of her bereavement, <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">9</span><span class="br"></span> I have slain at a banquet. Where will the poor woman turn now? Of all her kindred I alone am living, and I am the only one whom she will not be able to look upon with kindly eyes. And I, the assassin of my preservers, shall return to my native land without being able even to offer my hand to my nurse without reminding her of her bereavement!” <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">10</span><span class="br"></span> And since he did not put an end to his tears and laments, by order of his friends the body was removed.</p>
