<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">29</span><span class="br"></span><p>Such was the form of the right wing. On the left Cratcrus led the cavalry of the Peloponnesians, and to these were joined the horsemen of the Achaeans, the Locrians, and the Malieis. The rear of these was brought up by the Thessalian cavalry, led by Philippus. The infantry force was protected by the
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">30</span><span class="br"></span>cavalry. This was the front of the left wing. But in order that it might not be surrounded by superior numbers, he had girt it in the rear<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL368_287_e" id="target_note_LCL368_287_e"><sup>e</sup></a> by a powerful force. He had strengthened the wings<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL368_287_f" id="target_note_LCL368_287_f"><sup>f</sup></a> also by reserves, placed not straight in front but on the flanks, in order that, if the enemy should try to surround the
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">31</span><span class="br"></span>line of battle, they should be ready to fight. Here were the Agriani, whom Attalus commanded, and joined with them the Cretan archers. The hinder-most ranks he faced towards the rear, so as to fortify the whole battle-line by a circular formation.</p>
