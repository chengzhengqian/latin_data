not to those who had witnessed the initiatory rites of Samothrace<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL369_241_a" id="target_note_LCL369_241_a"><sup>a</sup></a> at a time when Asia should have been laid waste by fire, but to those who by the greatness of their deeds had surpassed belief.</p>
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">27</span><span class="br"></span><p>These and similar things the young soldiers heard with pleasure, but they were odious to the older men, especially because of Philip, under whom they <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">28</span><span class="br"></span> had lived longer, when Clitus, who was himself by no means wholly sober, turned to those who were reclining below him, and quoted a line of Euripides<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL369_241_b" id="target_note_LCL369_241_b"><sup>b</sup></a> in such a tone that the sound could be heard by the king <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">29</span><span class="br"></span> rather than the words made out, to the effect that it was a bad custom of the Greeks to inscribe on their trophies only the names of kings; for the kings stole the glory won by the blood of others. Therefore Alexander, for he suspected that the words had been somewhat malicious, began to ask those next to him <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">30</span><span class="br"></span> what they had heard Clitus say. And when they maintained an obstinate silence, Clitus, gradually raising his voice, spoke of the deeds of Philip and the wars which he had waged in Greece, rating them <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">31</span><span class="br"></span> all higher than the present victories. From this there arose a dispute between the younger and the older soldiers. And the king, although he appeared to hear with patience the words in which Clitus belittled <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">32</span><span class="br"></span> his glory, had become exceedingly angry. But when it seemed that he would control himself if Clitus would put an end to the talk which he had wantonly begun, as he did not in any way moderate it, the king became more exasperated.</p>
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">33</span><span class="br"></span><p>And now Clitus even ventured to defend Parmenion and extolled the victory of Philip over the Athenians<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL369_241_c" id="target_note_LCL369_241_c"><sup>c</sup></a> above the destruction of Thebes, being carried away, not only by wine, but by a perverse spirit of contention.
