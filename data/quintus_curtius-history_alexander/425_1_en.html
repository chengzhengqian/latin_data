letter from Coenus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL369_481_a" id="target_note_LCL369_481_a"><sup>a</sup></a> about what had happened in Europe and Asia while the king subdued India. <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">44</span><span class="br"></span> Zopyrion, governor of Thrace, while making an expedition against the Getae, had been overwhelmed with his whole army by tempests and gales which <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">45</span><span class="br"></span> suddenly arose.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL369_481_b" id="target_note_LCL369_481_b"><sup>b</sup></a> On learning of this disaster Seuthes had forced his subjects the Odrysae to revolt.

For Alexander, by punishing the insolence of certain satraps who, while he was detained at the end of the world by war with the Indi, had practised the greatest and most disgraceful crimes against the provincials, had inspired fear in the rest. These, being guilty of like offences and fearing the same punishment for their crimes, took refuge in the protection of the mercenary soldiers, expecting by such troops as these to defend themselves if they should be demanded for punishment, or after exacting as much money as they could, sought safety in fight. After this was known, letters were sent to all the governors of Asia, and when these were read, they found that they were ordered to disband on the spot all the foreign soldiers who were serving under them.</span></p>
<p><span class="italic">Among these was Harpalus. Alexander, because years before Philip, just on account of the friendship between Harpalus and his son, had driven him out and Harpalus had fled the country, regarded him as one of his most faithful friends. And after the death of Mazaeus he had made him satrap<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL369_481_d" id="target_note_LCL369_481_d"><sup>d</sup></a> of Babylon and had appointed him custodian of the royal treasures.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL369_481_e" id="target_note_LCL369_481_e"><sup>e</sup></a> Harpalus, then, having by his fagrant offences lost the confidence which he could have felt in the remarkable favour of the king, abstracted 5000 talents<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL369_481_f" id="target_note_LCL369_481_f"><sup>f</sup></a></span>
