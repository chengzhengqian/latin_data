silence ensued and the rest were looking at him alone, said: “If the king had been present at your talk, surely the words of no one would be needed to reply to you; for he himself would beg that you should not force him to descend to foreign and alien rites, nor would you expose his highly successful exploits to <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">15</span><span class="br"></span> odium by such flattery. But since he is not present, I am replying to you in his behalf that no fruit is at the same time both durable and prematurely ripened,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL369_279_a" id="target_note_LCL369_279_a"><sup>a</sup></a> and that you are not giving divine honours to your king, but taking them from him. For there is need of time for a man to be believed to be a god, and it is always thus that future generations requite great <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">16</span><span class="br"></span> men. But I pray for a late immortality for the king, in order that his life may be long and his majesty eternal. Divinity sometimes overtakes a man, it never accompanies him.</p>
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">17</span><span class="br"></span><p>“You mentioned Hercules and Father Liber just now as examples of consecration to immortality. Do you believe that they were made gods by the decree of a single banquet? Their mortal nature was removed from sight before Fame transported them <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">18</span><span class="br"></span> to Heaven. Forsooth you and I, Cleo, make gods, from us the king will receive endorsement of his divinity! I should like to try your power; make someone a king, if you can make a god. Is it easier <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">19</span><span class="br"></span> to bestow heaven than empire? May the propitious gods have heard without offence what Cleo said, and suffer things to go on in the same course in which they have flowed up to now. May they allow us to be content with our habits. I am not ashamed of my fatherland, nor do I desire to learn from the vanquished how I ought to do honour to my king.
