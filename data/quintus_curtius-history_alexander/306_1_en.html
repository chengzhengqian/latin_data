I am sent to wild beasts, to which <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">36</span><span class="br"></span> Nature has given incorrigible recklessness. But of what concerns me I have nothing to say. You scorn the soldiers of Philip, forgetting that if old Atarrhias<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL369_243_b" id="target_note_LCL369_243_b"><sup>b</sup></a> here had not called back the younger men when they shrank from battle, we should still be lingering around <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">37</span><span class="br"></span> Halicarnassus.

And he added nothing else than that perhaps if Clitus had spoken at greater length, he would have taunted him with having saved his life; for of this he had often <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">40</span><span class="br"></span> arrogantly boasted. And when Clitus still delayed to rise, those who had reclined next to him laid hands upon him and with remonstrances and warning were <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">41</span><span class="br"></span> trying to lead him from the room.
