and the Magi<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL368_217_a" id="target_note_LCL368_217_a"><sup>a</sup></a> believe that no great cause can be upheld by one who finds it hard to keep silence, which Nature has decreed to be the easiest thing
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">7</span><span class="br"></span>for a man to do. For this reason Alexander, unaware of everything which was going on among the enemy, was besieging the city of Gaza.</p>
<p>The governor of the city was Betis, a man of exceptional loyalty to his king, and he was defending strongly fortified walls with a force of only moderate
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">8</span><span class="br"></span>size. Alexander, after examining the situation of the place,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL368_217_b" id="target_note_LCL368_217_b"><sup>b</sup></a> ordered mines to be dug, since the soil, being light and easy to work, was suitable for underground operations; for the neighbouring sea throws up a great amount of sand and there are neither stones
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">9</span><span class="br"></span>nor sharp rocks to hinder tunnelling. Accordingly he began the work at a place which was out of sight of the defenders, and to prevent their being aware of it,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL368_217_c" id="target_note_LCL368_217_c"><sup>c</sup></a> he ordered towers to be moved against the walls. But the same ground was useless for moving towers, since the sinking<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL368_217_da" id="target_note_LCL368_217_da"><sup>d</sup></a> of the sand retarded the turning of the wheels and broke down the flooring of the towers, and many men were wounded without being able to retaliate, since the toil, which was the same in moving back the towers as in pushing them forward, wore
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">10</span><span class="br"></span>them out. Therefore the signal for retreat was sounded, and on the following day Alexander gave orders to surround the walls with a cordon of soldiers. And at sunrise, before leading forward the army, imploring the help of the gods, he performed a sacrifice in accordance with the usage of his country.</p>
