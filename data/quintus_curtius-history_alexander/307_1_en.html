Then he also reproached the king with the murder of Attalus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL369_245_a" id="target_note_LCL369_245_a"><sup>a</sup></a> and finally, mocking the oracle of Jupiter, whom Alexander claimed as his father, he said that he himself had spoken to the king more truly than his “father” had done.</p>
