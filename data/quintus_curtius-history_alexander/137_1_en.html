Moreover, all these great works are surrounded by artificial hollows, sunk to a vast depth to meet the rush of the river; for when it has risen above the top of the embankment built against it, it would damage the buildings of the city, if there were
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">29</span><span class="br"></span>no hollows and pools to receive it. These are built of baked brick<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL368_337_b" id="target_note_LCL368_337_b"><sup>b</sup></a> and the entire work is cemented with bitumen. A bridge of stone built over the river connects the two parts of the city. This also is counted among the marvels of the Orient. For the Euphrates carries a depth of mud, and even when this was dug out far into the river for laying the foundations, they could with difficulty find firm ground for supporting the

Ker Porter (in Mützell) says that Diodorus and Curtius describe it as built of courses of sun-dried bricks encased with mortar and bitumen, which is not true of the latter, and that he traced courses of such bricks. He thinks that its use was chiefly confined to the foundations and lower parts of the Chaldean buildings. He found the sun-dried bricks that were mixed with chopped straw or broken reeds equal in solidity to the hardest stone.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL368_337_a').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL368_337_b"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL368_337_b" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">b</sup>See note <span class="italic">a.</span></a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL368_337_b').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL368_337_c"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL368_337_c" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">c</sup><span class="italic">Cf.</span> Diod. ii. 8. 2, who makes no mention of the sand.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL368_337_c').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL368_337_d"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL368_337_d" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">d</sup><span class="italic">Meare</span> is a poetic word.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL368_337_d').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL368_337_e"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL368_337_e" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">e</sup>So also Diod. ii. 8. 6.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL368_337_e').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL368_337_f"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL368_337_f" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">f</sup>It is named among the “Seven Wonders of the World” by Gell. x. 18. 4, note.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL368_337_f').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
