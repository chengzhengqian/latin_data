Having addressed them courteously, Alexander sent one of his friends, Derdas, to those Scythians who dwell in Europe; he was to command them not. to cross the Tanais<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL369_181_a" id="target_note_LCL369_181_a"><sup>a</sup></a> river without the kingâ€™s order. He charged the same messengers to reconnoitre the country and to visit those Scythians also who dwell above<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL369_181_b" id="target_note_LCL369_181_b"><sup>b</sup></a> the Bosphorus. <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">13</span><span class="br"></span> He had chosen a site for founding a city on the bank of the Tanais,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL369_181_c" id="target_note_LCL369_181_c"><sup>c</sup></a> as a barrier both to those who had already been subdued and to those whom he had decided to attack later; but his design was put off by the reported revolt of the Sogdiani, which also <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">14</span><span class="br"></span> involved the Bactriani. These consisted of 7000 cavalry, whose authority the rest followed.</p>
<p>Alexander ordered Spitamenes and Catanes to be summoned, by whom Bessus had been delivered to him, not doubting that by their aid they<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL369_181_d" id="target_note_LCL369_181_d"><sup>d</sup></a> could be reduced into his power by the suppression of those <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">15</span><span class="br"></span> who had stirred up a revolt. But they, being the ringleaders of the revolt to the suppression of which they were summoned, had spread abroad the report that all the Bactrian cavalry were being sent for by the king, in order that they might be slain, but that they however could not bring themselves to execute this order which had been given them, for fear of committing an inexpiable crime against their countrymen. That they had been no more able to endure the savage cruelty of Alexander than the parricide of Bessus. Therefore they aroused to arms without difficulty those who were already of their own accord alarmed by fear of punishment.</p>
