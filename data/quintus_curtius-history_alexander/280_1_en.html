are attacking us without provocation, we shall return <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">12</span><span class="br"></span> an object of contempt to those who have revolted; if however we cross the Tanais and show by the defeat and slaughter of the Scythians that we are everywhere invincible, who will hesitate to obey those who <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">13</span><span class="br"></span> are victors even over Europe also? He is deceived who measures our glory by the space which we are about to cross. A single river flows between us; if <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">14</span><span class="br"></span> we cross that, we carry our arms into Europe. And how highly must it be regarded, while we are subjugating Asia, to set up trophies in what might be called another world, and suddenly to join in one victory places which Nature seems to have separated by so <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">15</span><span class="br"></span> great a space?

Besides, only one army of this nation has yet arrived, the rest are expected. Hence by avoiding war, we shall give it strength, and in a war in which we can take the offensive we shall be reduced to defence.</p>

But if you are willing to follow me, I am strong, my friends. I have sufficient strength to endure the dangers which I have suggested; or, if the end of my life is already at hand, in what exploit,
