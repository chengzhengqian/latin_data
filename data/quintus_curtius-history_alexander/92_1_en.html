From there, having advanced about eighty stadia, he pitched his camp by a second river—its name is Boumelus.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL368_247_b" id="target_note_LCL368_247_b"><sup>b</sup></a> It was a region most advantageous for deploying his forces, being an empty plain suitable for cavalry; not even shrubs and short bushes hide the ground, and an unobstructed view is allowed even to objects which are far away; and if there was any eminence in the plains, he gave orders that it should be levelled and the whole rising made flat.</p>
