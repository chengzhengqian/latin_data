Both the time at which he had come and the anxious expression of both brothers, betraying surely a troubled mind, as well as the sadness of one of them, alarmed Ptolemy and Leonnatus, who were on watch at the door of the king’s bedchamber. Therefore opening the doors and bringing in a light, they awoke the king whom wine had buried<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL369_289_a" id="target_note_LCL369_289_a"><sup>a</sup></a> in deep sleep.
