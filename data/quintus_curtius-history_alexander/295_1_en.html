you, O youths, my comrades, that I have overcome the fortifications of cities that before now were unconquered, that I have traversed the heights of mountains buried in perpetual snow, that I entered the passes of Cilicia, and have endured the intense cold of India<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL369_221_a" id="target_note_LCL369_221_a"><sup>a</sup></a> without fatigue. I have given you <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">9</span><span class="br"></span> proofs of myself, and I have had proofs of you. The rock which you see has only one approach, which the barbarians beset, they neglect the rest; they have no sentinels except those that are watching our <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">10</span><span class="br"></span> camp.

But I am sure that you will have an eye, not so much to the reward, as to my desire.‚Äù</p>
