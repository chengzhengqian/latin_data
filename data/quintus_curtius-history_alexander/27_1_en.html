at least was certain, that he would die nobly and with great glory.</p>
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">22</span><span class="br"></span><p>Therefore he ordered the soldiers to refresh themselves,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL368_117_a" id="target_note_LCL368_117_a"><sup>a</sup></a> and then to be ready and armed at the third watch<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL368_117_b" id="target_note_LCL368_117_b"><sup>b</sup></a>; he himself mounted to the summit of a lofty mountain and by the bright light of many torches offered sacrifice to the tutelary gods of the
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">23</span><span class="br"></span>place. And now the soldiers, ready at the same time for both the march and for battle, had received the third signal of the trumpet<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL368_117_c" id="target_note_LCL368_117_c"><sup>c</sup></a> and, as warned beforehand, were ordered to advance vigorously; and at daybreak they came to the narrow place<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL368_117_d" id="target_note_LCL368_117_d"><sup>d</sup></a> which they had decided to hold. Those who had been sent ahead reported that Darius was thirty

<p>The terrified peasants reported the coming of the enemy to Darius, who found it difficult to believe that those whom he was pursuing as fugitives were
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">25</span><span class="br"></span>actually advancing to meet him. Hence no slight dread assailed the minds of all—for they were prepared rather for marching than for battle—and they
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">26</span><span class="br"></span>hurriedly armed themselves. But the very haste of those who were running about and calling their companions to arms inspired greater fear; some had gone up to the ridge of the mountain to look out from there for the enemy’s line of march, very many were bridling their horses. The army, in disorder and attending to more than one command, by its varied tumult had thrown everything into confusion.</p>
