Bactriani, on the south their territory slopes toward <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">8</span><span class="br"></span> the Indian sea. They build huts of unbaked brick, and because the land is destitute of timber, since even the ridge of the mountain is bare, they use the same <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">9</span><span class="br"></span> brick up to the very top of their buildings. But their structure is broader at the base and gradually becomes narrower as the work grows, and finally it comes together very much like the keel of a ship.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL369_147_a" id="target_note_LCL369_147_a"><sup>a</sup></a> There they leave an opening and let in light from <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">10</span><span class="br"></span> above.
