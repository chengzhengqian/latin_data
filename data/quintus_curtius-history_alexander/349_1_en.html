<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">13</span><span class="br"></span><p>And now they had gone so far that except as victors, they could not return without destruction, since the barbarians were rolling down huge stones upon them as they went up, and when struck by these while their footing was unsteady and slipping, <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">14</span><span class="br"></span> they fell back headlong. Nevertheless Alexander and Charus, whom the king had sent ahead with thirty selected men, had gained the height and were already fighting hand to hand; but since the barbarians showered javelins upon them from above, they themselves were wounded more often than they <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">15</span><span class="br"></span> inflicted wounds. Therefore Alexander,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL369_329_a" id="target_note_LCL369_329_a"><sup>a</sup></a> remembering his name and his promise, while fighting more fearlessly than cautiously, was struck from every side <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">16</span><span class="br"></span> and overwhelmed. When Charus saw him lying prostrate, unmindful of everything except revenge he began to rush upon the enemy and killed many with his lance, some with his sword; but when so many assailed one man, he fell lifeless upon the body <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">17</span><span class="br"></span> of his friend. The king, troubled as was natural by the death of these most valiant young men and of the <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">18</span><span class="br"></span> rest of his soldiers, gave the signal for retreat. They saved themselves by withdrawing gradually and unterrified, and the barbarians, content with having dislodged the enemy, did not follow them up as they <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">19</span><span class="br"></span> gave ground. But although Alexander had decided to abandon the attempt<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL369_329_b" id="target_note_LCL369_329_b"><sup>b</sup></a>—for no hope was offered of getting possession of the rock—yet he made a show of persisting in the siege. For he ordered the roads to be beset, and the towers to be advanced, and others to take the place of the wearied.</p>
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">20</span><span class="br"></span><p>When his persistence was known, the Indi feasted for two days and two nights with a display, not only of confidence, but even of victory, beating drums
