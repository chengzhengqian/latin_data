<p>IV. After these matters had been arranged, he withdrew the army from winter quarters<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL369_265_a" id="target_note_LCL369_265_a"><sup>a</sup></a> after two monthsâ€™ stay, intending to go to the region which is <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> called Gazaca.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL369_265_b" id="target_note_LCL369_265_b"><sup>b</sup></a> The first day allowed a quiet march, the following day was, it is true, not yet stormy and gloomy, yet it was darker than the preceding one, and did not pass without threat of growing trouble, <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> on the third, lightning flickered from every quarter of the heavens, and the light which now shone through and now was hidden, began, not only to dazzle the eyes of the advancing army, but even to <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span> terrify them.
