assembly of the foreign<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL369_495_a" id="target_note_LCL369_495_a"><sup>a</sup></a> troops to be called, while the Macedonians were kept within their camp, and when the foreign troops had come together in great numbers, he summoned an interpreter and addressed them as follows:</p>
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">7</span><span class="br"></span><p>“When I was crossing from Europe into Asia, I hoped that I should add many famous nations and a great force of men to my kingdom. And I was not deceived in believing what was reported about them. <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">8</span><span class="br"></span> But to that report this also is added, that I behold brave men of invincible loyalty towards their kings. <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">9</span><span class="br"></span> I had supposed that luxury prevailed everywhere, and that by excess of good fortune you were plunged into pleasures; but, by Heaven! you endure with equal indefatigability, such is that strength of yours of both mind and body, the duties of military service, and while you are brave men, you cultivate loyalty <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">10</span><span class="br"></span> no less than courage.
