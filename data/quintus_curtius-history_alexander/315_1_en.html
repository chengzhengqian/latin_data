would have slain her if he had not been prevented by the hurried intervention of her brothers.</p>
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span><p>However he ordered her to quit his sight, adding a threat of death if she should show herself before his eyes, and to satisfy his longing he began to <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">6</span><span class="br"></span> pass his nights with concubines. But his deep-seated love was inflamed through disgust with his present associates. Therefore, again devoted to his wife alone, he did not cease to beg her to refrain from giving such advice, and to endure whatever lot Fortune should offer them, saying that to him death was a lighter <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">7</span><span class="br"></span> thing than surrender. But she excused herself for having advised what she thought expedient, perhaps with feminine weakness, but yet in a loyal spirit, saying that for the future she would submit to <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">8</span><span class="br"></span> her husbandâ€™s authority. Spitamenes, won by this feigned compliance, ordered a prolonged<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL369_261_a" id="target_note_LCL369_261_a"><sup>a</sup></a> banquet to be prepared, from which he was carried to his <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">9</span><span class="br"></span> chamber heavy with wine and half-asleep. As soon as his wife saw that he was sunk in a deep and heavy slumber, she drew a sword which she had hidden under her robe, cut off his head, and, bespattered with blood, handed it to a slave who had been her <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">10</span><span class="br"></span> accomplice in the crime. Attended by the slave, with her robe all blood-stained as it was, she came into the camp of the Macedonians and ordered it to be announced to Alexander that there was something <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">11</span><span class="br"></span> that he ought to hear from her own lips. He at once ordered the barbarian woman to be admitted. When he saw her bespattered with blood, thinking that she had come to complain of some outrage, he bade her <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">12</span><span class="br"></span> tell him what she wished. But she desired that the slave whom she had ordered to stand in the vestibule should be brought in.</p>
