But to me, first my blamelessness, then your right hand, had brought freedom from care; I had no fear that more would be allowed on your part <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">15</span><span class="br"></span> to the cruelty of others than to your clemency. But to prevent you from regretting your belief in me, let me say that the matter was reported to me by a mere boy, who could show me no witness nor proof of his information, and who would fill all with fear if he should begin to be heard. Unhappily I believed that my ears had <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">16</span><span class="br"></span> been exposed to a quarrel of a wanton and his boy, and besides I suspected his truthfulness because, he did not himself bring the report, but employed his <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">17</span><span class="br"></span> brother instead.

But, by Heaven, if I had been an accomplice with Dymnus in so great a crime, I ought not to have concealed for those two days my knowledge that we had been betrayed; Cebalinus himself could have been put out of the <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">21</span><span class="br"></span> way, and with no trouble. Finally, after the information which I was going to conceal had been made known, I entered the king’s bedroom alone, and wearing a sword. Why did I put off the deed? Was <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">22</span><span class="br"></span> it that I did not dare to do it without Dymnus? He then was the leader of the conspiracy and I, Philotas,
