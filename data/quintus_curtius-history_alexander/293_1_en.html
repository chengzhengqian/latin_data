Bessus to be taken to Ecbatana,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL369_217_a" id="target_note_LCL369_217_a"><sup>a</sup></a> to expiate with <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">11</span><span class="br"></span> his life his murder of Darius. At about the same time Ptolemy and Melanidas<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL369_217_b" id="target_note_LCL369_217_b"><sup>b</sup></a> brought the king 4000 infantry and 1000 horsemen, to serve as mercenaries. <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">12</span><span class="br"></span> Asander<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL369_217_c" id="target_note_LCL369_217_c"><sup>c</sup></a> also came from Lycia with an equal number of foot-soldiers and 500 horsemen. The same number followed Asclepiodorus from Syria. Antipater had sent 8000 Greeks, among whom were <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">13</span><span class="br"></span> 600 cavalry. With his army thus increased the king marched forth to set in order the provinces which had been disordered by the revolt; and after putting to death the ringleaders of the disturbance, he returned on the fourth day to the river Oxus. This river, because it carries silt, is always turbid and unwholesome <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">14</span><span class="br"></span> to drink. Therefore the soldiers had begun to dig wells; yet, although they excavated the soil to a great depth, they found no water. At length a spring was found right in the king’s tent,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL369_217_d" id="target_note_LCL369_217_d"><sup>d</sup></a> and because they had been late in perceiving it, they spread the report that it had suddenly appeared, and the king himself wished it to be believed that it was a <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">15</span><span class="br"></span> gift of the gods. Then he crossed the rivers Ochus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL369_217_e" id="target_note_LCL369_217_e"><sup>e</sup></a> and Oxus and came to the city of Margiana. Round about it six sites were chosen for founding towns, two facing south and four east; they were distant from one another only a moderate space, so that they might be able to aid one another without seeking help from a distance. All these were situated on <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">16</span><span class="br"></span> high hills. At that time they served as curbs upon the conquered nations; to-day, forgetful of their origin, they serve those over whom they once ruled.</p>
<p>XI. And everything else the king had subdued.
