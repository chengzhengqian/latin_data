The city was garrisoned by 38,000 infantry<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL369_321_a" id="target_note_LCL369_321_a"><sup>a</sup></a> and was fortified, not only by its situation, but also by art. For where it looks towards the east it is girt by a very rapid river, which, having precipitous banks on both sides, makes <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">24</span><span class="br"></span> approach to the city difficult. Towards the west and the south Nature, as if by design, has thrown up towering crags, below which lie caverns and abysses which have been deeply hollowed by long lapse of time, and where they come to an end ditches have been <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">25</span><span class="br"></span> interposed with enormous labour.
