It was nearly the third hour, when the Ocean, in its regular change,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL369_445_a" id="target_note_LCL369_445_a"><sup>a</sup></a> began to be carried on a flood-tide into the river, and pushed it back. The stream, at first checked and then pushed more violently, was driven upstream with greater speed than that of torrents<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL369_445_b" id="target_note_LCL369_445_b"><sup>b</sup></a> running in a <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">10</span><span class="br"></span> precipitous channel. The nature of the sea was unknown to the common soldiers,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL369_445_c" id="target_note_LCL369_445_c"><sup>c</sup></a> who thought that they were witnessing portents and signs of the anger of the gods when the sea continually swelled and overflowed to flood fields that shortly before were dry.</p>
