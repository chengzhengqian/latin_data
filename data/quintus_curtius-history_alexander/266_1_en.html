But Erigyius, drawing the spear from the wound, directed it again at his face. Satibarzanes seized it with his hand, in order to die more <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">38</span><span class="br"></span> quickly, and aided the enemy’s stroke. The barbarians, having lost their leader, whom they had followed rather on compulsion than voluntarily, and then not unmindful of the merits of Alexander, <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">39</span><span class="br"></span> surrendered to Erigyius. The king, rejoicing in this success, although by no means free from anxiety about the Spartans, yet bore their revolt<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL369_163_a" id="target_note_LCL369_163_a"><sup>a</sup></a> with great courage, saying that they had not dared to reveal their design until they knew that he had come to <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">40</span><span class="br"></span> the confines of India.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL369_163_b" id="target_note_LCL369_163_b"><sup>b</sup></a> He himself moved his forces in pursuit of Bessus; Erigyius met him, displaying the head of the barbarian, as a glorious spoil of war.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL369_163_c" id="target_note_LCL369_163_c"><sup>c</sup></a></p>

For 400 stadia not even a drop of water <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> is to be found. The heat of the summer sun makes the sands hot, and when they began to glow, everything is burned as if by a continuous conflagration.
