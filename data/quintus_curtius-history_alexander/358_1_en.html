troops which he sent was Spitaces, his brother,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL369_347_a" id="target_note_LCL369_347_a"><sup>a</sup></a> and the greater part of his strength was in his chariots; <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> each of these carried six men, two with bucklers, two archers stationed on each side, the rest were the drivers, who were by no means unarmed; for when it was necessary to fight hand to hand, they dropped the reins and poured a shower of javelins upon the enemy. <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span> However, on that day this aid was of hardly any use; for, as was said above, the rain which had fallen with greater violence than usual had made the plains slippery and unfit for riding, and the heavy and almost immovable chariots stuck fast in the muck and <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span> mudholes. On the other hand, Alexander with his unencumbered and light-armed force charged them vigorously. The Scythians and the Dahae first of all attacked the Indi; then Alexander sent Perdiccas<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL369_347_b" id="target_note_LCL369_347_b"><sup>b</sup></a> with the cavalry against the right wing of the enemy.</p>

This was a common evil for both sides. For the foot-soldiers of the Macedonians were trampled at the first attack, and the chariots sent over the slippery and impassable ground <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">8</span><span class="br"></span> shook off those who guided them. The frightened horses of others dragged the chariots not only into <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">9</span><span class="br"></span> the mudholes and pools, but even into the river, a few, driven by the enemy’s weapons, made their way to Porus, who was vigorously urging on the fight.
