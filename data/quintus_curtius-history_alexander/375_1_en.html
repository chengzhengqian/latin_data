Indeed, the wider the extent of a river, the more quietly it flows; for when restrained by banks that are close together, and hence dashed into a narrower channel, they carry torrential waters, and on the contrary their course is more sluggish in a spacious <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">18</span><span class="br"></span> channel. Besides this, all the danger is at the bank, where the enemy awaits us as we are landing our boats.
