wearied the ears of Alexander by excessive vaunting of his valour and his services, and hence was suspected, <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span> not indeed of crime, but of arrogance. Thinking that there would be no more advantageous opportunity of ruining his enemy, disguising his hatred under a pretence of loyalty, he said: “I only wish that at the very beginning of this matter you <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span> had deliberated with us! We should have persuaded you, if you wished to pardon Philotas, to suffer him to be ignorant how much he was indebted to you, rather than, after he had been brought even to the very fear of death, to think more often of his own danger than of your kindness. For he will always be able to plot against you, you will not always be able to pardon <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">6</span><span class="br"></span> Philotas. There is no reason for you to think that one who has dared so much can be changed by a pardon. He knows that those who have exhausted <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">7</span><span class="br"></span> mercy can no longer hope for it. But even if he himself, either through change of heart or overcome by your kindness, shall wish to remain quiet, I at any rate know that his father Parmenion, the leader of so great an army, and because of his long-continued influence with his soldiers holding a position not much below the height of your greatness, will not with equanimity <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">8</span><span class="br"></span> owe his son’s life to you. There are some favours which we hate. One is ashamed to admit that one has deserved death; therefore, Philotas would prefer to seem to have suffered an injury rather than to have been granted his life. Therefore be sure that you <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">9</span><span class="br"></span> will have to fight with those men for your life. There are enemies enough left, in pursuit of whom we are about to go; guard yourself against domestic foes. If you get rid of these, I fear nothing from without.”</p>
