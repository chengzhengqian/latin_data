of the decisions entered on should be given to <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">16</span><span class="br"></span> the guilty parties. Philotas was even invited to a banquet, which was his last, and the king had the heart, not only to dine with him, but even to talk familiarly with the man whom he had condemned. <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">17</span><span class="br"></span> Then in the second watch, when the lights had been put out, there came to the king’s tent, with a few others, Hephaestion, Craterus, Coenus, and Erigyius, these from the number of his friends, and from the body-guard Perdiccas and Leonnatus. By these it was ordered that those who were on guard at the king’s <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">18</span><span class="br"></span> tent should remain on watch and under arms. Already cavalry had been stationed at all the entrances, and they had been ordered also to beset the roads, in order that no one might secretly go out to Parmenion, who was then governing Media and was in command <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">19</span><span class="br"></span> of great forces. Atarrhias, moreover, with 300 armed men had entered the royal tent; to him were given besides ten attendants,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL369_75_a" id="target_note_LCL369_75_a"><sup>a</sup></a> each followed by ten men-at-arms. <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">20</span><span class="br"></span> These were sent in different directions to arrest the other conspirators. Atarrhias was sent with 300 men to Philotas and set about breaking open<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL369_75_b" id="target_note_LCL369_75_b"><sup>b</sup></a> the closed entrance to his house, attended by fifty of the bravest of his soldiers; for he had ordered the rest to surround the house on all sides, for fear that Philotas might be able to slip out by a secret <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">21</span><span class="br"></span> door. But he, either through absence of anxiety or worn out by fatigue, had been overcome by sleep: Atarrhias seized him while he was still drowsy. <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">22</span><span class="br"></span> When at last he was fully awake and chains were put upon him, he said: “O Sire, the bitterness of my enemies has prevailed over your kindness.” And without further words on his part they led him with veiled head into the king’s quarters.</p>
