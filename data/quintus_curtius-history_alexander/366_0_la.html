<h2><span class="sc">Contents of Book IX</span></h2>
<p>Alexander advances to the Hypasis River; he subdues many nations and cities, whose manners and customs are described (i).</p>
<p>When he prepares to cross the Hypasis and attack two powerful nations, his soldiers show signs of weariness and reluctance to go farther. The king appeals to their devotion in an eloquent speech (ii).</p>
<p>Coenus replies to the king in the name of the soldiers. Alexander finally turns back after setting up twelve altars as a memorial of his expedition, and founding Nicaea and Bucephala. He prepares a fleet and sails down the Hypasis. Coenus falls ill and dies (iii).</p>
<p>Alexander subdues the Sibi. He suffers great peril at the confluence of the Hydaspes and the Acesines, but reaches the land of the Malli. The soldiers show renewed signs of disaffection, but a speech of the king rouses their enthusiasm. He defeats the barbarians, and in spite of the warning of a seer attacks their city (iv).</p>
<p>He leaps from the wall of the citadel into the midst of the enemy and, after fighting against great odds, is severely wounded but is rescued by members of his body-guard (v).</p>
<p>Before his wound is healed the king appears in public. His friends urge him to have more consideration for his own and the public safety. He expresses gratitude, but persists in his determination to conquer the whole world (vi).</p>
<p>Disturbances among the Greeks in Bactriana. Envoys from the Malli and the Sudracae offer submission. Alex, ander gives them a banquet, at which Dioxippus, an Athenian-and Corratas, a Macedonian, fight a duel. The Greek is victor, but kills himself because of the calumnies of his enemies (vii).
