They kept watch at night in turn close to the doors of the room in which the king slept. By these youths concubines were brought in by a different entrance from that before which the <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span> armed guards were posted. They also received the horses from the grooms, brought them to the reigning king when he was about to mount, and accompanied him in the chase and in battle, besides being thoroughly trained in all the accomplishments of <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span> liberal studies.

Sostratus was a member of the same troupe and an ardent lover of Hermolaüs; when he saw the lacerated body of which he was enamoured, perhaps being already angered with the king for some other reason also, he induced Hermolaüs, who was already incensed on his own account, to give and receive a pledge to join with him in forming
