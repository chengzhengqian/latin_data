Alexander, entering it with his whole army, ordered <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">14</span><span class="br"></span> an attack on the wild beasts from every side. Among these when a lion of extraordinary size rushed to attack the king himself, it happened that Lysimachus, who was afterwards a king,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL369_237_a" id="target_note_LCL369_237_a"><sup>a</sup></a> being beside Alexander, began to oppose his hunting-spear to the animal; but the king pushed him aside and ordered him to retire, adding that a lion could be killed by <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">15</span><span class="br"></span> himself alone as well as by Lysimachus. And in fact Lysimachus, once when they were hunting in Syria, had indeed alone killed a lion of remarkable size, but had had his left shoulder torn to the bone <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">16</span><span class="br"></span> and thus had come into great peril of his life. The king, taunting him with this very experience, acted more vigorously than he spoke; for he not only met the wild beast, but killed him with a single wound.</p>
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">17</span><span class="br"></span><p>I am inclined to believe that the story which without evidence spread the report<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL369_237_b" id="target_note_LCL369_237_b"><sup>b</sup></a> that Lysimachus was exposed by the king to the attack of a lion arose from the incident which we have just mentioned. <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">18</span><span class="br"></span> But the Macedonians, although Alexander had been successful in his attempt, nevertheless voted in the manner of their nation that he should neither hunt on foot nor without being accompanied by selected <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">19</span><span class="br"></span> officers or friends. He, after having laid low 4000 wild beasts, banqueted in that same park with his entire army.</p>
<p>From there the king returned to Maracanda; and having accepted Artabazus’ excuse of old age, he <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">20</span><span class="br"></span> made over his province<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL369_237_c" id="target_note_LCL369_237_c"><sup>c</sup></a> to Clitus. It was he, an old soldier of Philip and distinguished by many exploits in war,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL369_237_d" id="target_note_LCL369_237_d"><sup>d</sup></a> who at the river Granicus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL369_237_e" id="target_note_LCL369_237_e"><sup>e</sup></a> covered the
