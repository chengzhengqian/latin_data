<p>From Issus Darius hastens to the Euphrates. Alexander marches into Phoenicia and takes Marathus, Byblus, and Sidon; at Marathus he answers a haughty letter of Darius, at Sidon makes Abdalonymus king of Sidon. The deserter Amyntas attempts to take possession of Egypt, but is killed by the Persians (i).</p>
<p>Alexander, wishing to sacrifice to Hercules at Tyre, is refused admission to the city. He lays siege to the city, which is separated from the mainland by a strait of four stadia. The Tyrians, trusting to the strength of their position, and hoping for aid from Carthage, refuse to submit (ii).</p>
<p>The siege of Tyre is carried on with great courage and skill on both sides. It was necessary to construct a causeway from the mainland, and the Tyrians made every effort to hinder the work. When Alexander was in doubt whether to continue the attack, he was encouraged by the arrival of a fleet from Cyprus and of Greek soldiers. The Carthaginians were unable to send help to the Tyrians (iii).</p>
<p>A sea monster of enormous size gives an omen which both sides interpret as favourable to themselves. While the Tyrians with feasting and abundant wine are celebrating the victory which they look upon as foretold, their city is stormed and destroyed (iv).</p>
<p>Alexander rejects a second offer of peace made by Darius. The Rhodians surrender their city and port to him. The Greeks at the Isthmian games vote him a golden crown. He appoints governors for the lands which he has conquered. Amphoterus and Hegelochus take Chios and MethymnÃª (v).</p>
<p>Alexander lays siege to Gaza, which is vigorously defended by Betis. Alexander finally storms the city and, angry because he had been wounded during the attack, inflicts a cruel punishment upon Betis (vi).</p>
