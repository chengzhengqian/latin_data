<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">17</span><span class="br"></span><p>Now, as Alexander kept on his way to Babylon, Mazaeus, who had fled to that city from the battlefield, met him as a suppliant with his mature children, and surrendered the city and himself. His coming was welcome to the king; for the siege of so strongly
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">18</span><span class="br"></span>fortified a city would have been a great task. Moreover, it was evident that a man of distinction and ready action, who had also gained widespread reputation in the recent battle, would by his example induce the rest to surrender. Therefore the king
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">19</span><span class="br"></span>received him courteously with his children; but he ordered his men to enter the city in square formation,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL368_333_a" id="target_note_LCL368_333_a"><sup>a</sup></a> with himself at their head, as if they were going into battle.</p>

<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">20</span><span class="br"></span>out to meet him. Among the latter Bagophanes, guardian of the citadel and of the royal funds, in order not to be outdone in alacrity by Mazaeus, had strewn the whole road with flowers and garlands, and had placed here and there on both sides silver altars, which he had piled high, not only with frankincense,
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">21</span><span class="br"></span>but with perfumes of all kinds. As gifts there followed him herds of horses and cattle; lions and leopards too were carried before them in cages.</p>
