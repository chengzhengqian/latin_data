<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span><p>All this seemed incredible to Alexander; therefore he asked Porus—for he was with him—whether <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">6</span><span class="br"></span> what was said was true. Porus assured him that the strength of the nation and of the kingdom was not exaggerated, but that the ruler was not only of humble, but of the lowest condition; in fact, his father, a barber whose daily profit barely kept him from starving, because he was not bad looking had <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">7</span><span class="br"></span> been beloved by the queen. By her he had been advanced to intimate friendship with the king who then reigned, and having treacherously killed him, had usurped the throne under the pretext of guardianship of the king’s children; then, having murdered the children, he had begotten the present king, who was hated and despised by his subjects and mindful <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">8</span><span class="br"></span> rather of his father’s fortune than of his own.
