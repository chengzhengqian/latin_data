<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">16</span><span class="br"></span><p>Some agreed with Ptolemy, fewer with Perdiccas. Then Aristonus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL369_531_b" id="target_note_LCL369_531_b"><sup>b</sup></a> began to speak, saying that Alexander, when he was asked to whom he left his kingdom, wished the best man to be chosen; moreover, he had himself judged that Perdiccas, to whom he <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">17</span><span class="br"></span> had handed his ring, was the best man. For he was not the only one who sat by Alexander when he was dying, but, the king, looking about, had chosen him from his throng of friends to give it to. Therefore it was Alexander’s wish that the supreme power <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">18</span><span class="br"></span> should be bestowed upon Perdiccas. And there was no doubt that Aristonus’ opinion was the truth. Therefore all bade Perdiccas to come forward and take up the king’s ring. He wavered between inclination and shame, and believed that the more modestly he sought what he coveted the more persistently they <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">19</span><span class="br"></span> would press it upon him. So, after delaying and being for a long time uncertain what to do, he finally retired to the back part of the assembly, and stood behind those who were nearest to the throne.</p>
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">20</span><span class="br"></span><p>But Meleager, one of the generals, taking the courage which the hesitation of Perdiccas had aroused, said: “May the gods themselves not permit that the fortune of Alexander and the burden of so great a kingdom should fall upon such shoulders; certainly men will not allow it. I say nothing of those of nobler birth<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL369_531_c" id="target_note_LCL369_531_c"><sup>c</sup></a> than this fellow, but only of brave men, who need to endure nothing against their <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">21</span><span class="br"></span> will. And truly it makes no difference whether you have for king the son of Roxanê, whenever he shall be born, or Perdiccas, since that fellow will usurp the royal power under the guise of regency.
