And they did not execute the plan with youthful impetuosity; for they chose with care those whom they would admit as associates in the intended crime. They decided to include Nicostratus, Antipater, Asclepiodorus and Philotas<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL369_285_a" id="target_note_LCL369_285_a"><sup>a</sup></a>; through these there were added Anticles and Aphthonius <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">10</span><span class="br"></span> and Epimenes. But for carrying out the plan no easy road at all lay open; for it was necessary that all the conspirators should be on guard the same night, in order not to be interfered with by those who were not in the plot, but it happened that they <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">11</span><span class="br"></span> were on watch on different nights.
