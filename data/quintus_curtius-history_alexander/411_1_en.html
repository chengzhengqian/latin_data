barren and poor in water met him; having passed through this, he crossed into the land of the Horitae. There he handed over the greater part of the army to Hephaestion and shared the light-armed troops <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">7</span><span class="br"></span> with Ptolemy<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL369_453_a" id="target_note_LCL369_453_a"><sup>a</sup></a> and Leonnatus. Three armies at the same time were pillaging the Indi, and a great amount of booty was driven off; Ptolemy was burning the maritime regions, the king himself and in another direction Leonnatus, the rest of the country. In this region also he founded a city,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL369_453_b" id="target_note_LCL369_453_b"><sup>b</sup></a> and colonized it with Arachosii.</p>
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">8</span><span class="br"></span><p>From there he came to the Indi who dwell along the sea-coast.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL369_453_c" id="target_note_LCL369_453_c"><sup>c</sup></a> They occupy a great extent of country which is barren and desolate, and mingle in no kind of <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">9</span><span class="br"></span> intercourse even with their neighbours. Their very solitude has made quite wild their dispositions, which are savage even by nature; their nails grow long, never having been cut, their hair is shaggy and unshorn. <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">10</span><span class="br"></span> They adorn their huts with shells<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL369_453_d" id="target_note_LCL369_453_d"><sup>d</sup></a> and other things thrown up by the sea. Clad in the skins of wild beasts, they feed upon fish cured in the sun, and also on the flesh of larger animals cast up by the sea. <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">11</span><span class="br"></span> Therefore, since their supplies were used up,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL369_453_e" id="target_note_LCL369_453_e"><sup>e</sup></a> the Macedonians began to suffer at first scarcity, and finally starvation, grubbing everywhere for the roots of palmsâ€”for that is the only kind of tree that grows <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">12</span><span class="br"></span> there. And when even this nourishment had failed them, they began to kill their draught animals, not even abstaining from the horses. And when they had nothing to carry their packs, they burned the spoils taken from the enemy, for the sake of which they had traversed the remotest parts of the Orient.</p>
