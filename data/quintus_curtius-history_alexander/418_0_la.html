He gives orders that all sons begotten from Asiatic wives be left with him. More than 10,000 veterans, led by Craterus, are discharged and sent to Greece. Antipater is directed to give them special honours and privileges. Craterus is made governor of Macedonia, and Antipater is ordered to come to Alexander with reinforcements.
