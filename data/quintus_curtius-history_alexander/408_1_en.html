the oars to be shorn off in turn, and the crews to foul one anotherâ€™s ships. You would have supposed, not that it was the fleet of one army, but that the fleets of two armies were engaged in a sea-fight. <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">17</span><span class="br"></span> Prows were dashed against sterns, those ships that damaged ships in front of them were in turn injured by ships behind them; from angry words they even came to blows.</p>
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">18</span><span class="br"></span><p>And now the tide had flooded all the plains about the river except for mounds projecting like small islands, to which many in their trepidation hastened <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">19</span><span class="br"></span> to swim, deserting the ships. The scattered fleet stood, a part in very deep water, where valleys had made low ground, a part were stranded on shoals, wherever the waters had covered land of uneven but rising level; when on a sudden a new cause of terror, greater than the former one, surprised <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">20</span><span class="br"></span> them. The sea began to flow back with great pull,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL369_447_a" id="target_note_LCL369_447_a"><sup>a</sup></a> as the waters ran back to their own channel and restored the lands which a little before had been submerged in deep surge. Hence some of the ships, being thus stranded, were thrown upon their prows, others fell upon their sides. The fields were strewn with baggage, arms, and fragments of <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">21</span><span class="br"></span> broken planks and oars. The soldiers dared neither to land nor to stay aboard, since they were awaiting more serious calamities than the present that might follow at any time. They could hardly believe that they actually beheld what they were experiencing, shipwreck on dry land, the sea in the river.</p>
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">22</span><span class="br"></span><p>And there was no end to their troubles; for since they did not know that the sea would a little later bring back the tide by which their ships would be floated, they foresaw famine and the utmost extremities.
