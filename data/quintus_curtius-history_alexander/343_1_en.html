by weapons. In consequence some favoured surrender, others the trial of battle.</p>
<p>When their hesitation became known, Alexander directed that they should merely be beleaguered and <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">11</span><span class="br"></span> not killed, and at last, exhausted by the hardships of a siege, they gave themselves up. They said that they had been founded by Father Liber; and this <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">12</span><span class="br"></span> was in fact their origin. The city is situated at the foot of a mountain which the natives call Meros<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL369_317_a" id="target_note_LCL369_317_a"><sup>a</sup></a>; from this the Greeks took the liberty of inventing the fable<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL369_317_b" id="target_note_LCL369_317_b"><sup>b</sup></a> that Father Liber had been hidden in the <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">13</span><span class="br"></span> thigh of Jupiter. Alexander, having learned from the natives the situation of the mountain, had supplies sent in advance, and ascended to its summit<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL369_317_c" id="target_note_LCL369_317_c"><sup>c</sup></a> with his whole army. Ivy and vines in abundance grow all over the height, and many perennial springs <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">14</span><span class="br"></span> gush forth.

Laurel, box, and myrtle form a natural grove <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">15</span><span class="br"></span> on those rocks. Carried away, as I for my part believe, not by divine inspiration but by a spirit of playfulness, they plucked the foliage of the ivy and the vines everywhere, and wreathed with garlands made from the leaves, wandered here and there through the whole grove like so many bacchantes. <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">16</span><span class="br"></span> Hence the mountain heights and valleys rang with the shouts of so many thousands, as they invoked the god who presided over that grove, since as soon as this wantonness was begun by a few, as commonly happens it quickly spread to the whole company. <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">17</span><span class="br"></span> In fact, as if they were in full enjoyment of peace, they threw themselves on the grass and the leaves
