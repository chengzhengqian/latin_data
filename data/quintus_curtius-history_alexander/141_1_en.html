<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span><p>A great throng of soldiers had assembled to take part in this illustrious contest, both to act as witnesses of the deeds of each entrant, and to give their opinion as to the judges<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL368_345_a" id="target_note_LCL368_345_a"><sup>a</sup></a>; for they could not fail to know whether honour was paid to each man justly or
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span>falsely. First of all the prize for valour was awarded to old Atarrhias,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL368_345_b" id="target_note_LCL368_345_b"><sup>b</sup></a> who before Halicarnassus, when the battle was abandoned by the younger men, had been chiefly instrumental in arousing them to action, Antigenes was judged to be next to him, Philotas of Augaea<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL368_345_c" id="target_note_LCL368_345_c"><sup>c</sup></a> gained third place, the fourth was assigned to Amyntas<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL368_345_d" id="target_note_LCL368_345_d"><sup>d</sup></a> and after these came Antigonus and next Lyncestes Amyntas, Theodotus gained seventh place, and Hellanicus the last.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL368_345_e" id="target_note_LCL368_345_e"><sup>e</sup></a></p>
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">6</span><span class="br"></span><p>Also in the military discipline handed down by his predecessors Alexander made many changes of the greatest advantage. For whereas before the cavalry were enrolled each man in his own race, apart from the rest, he gave up the separation by nations and assigned them to commanders not necessarily of their own
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">7</span><span class="br"></span>people, but of his own choice<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL368_345_f" id="target_note_LCL368_345_f"><sup>f</sup></a> When he wished to move his camp, he used to give the signal with the trumpet, the sound of which was often not readily enough heard amid the noise made by the bustling soldiers; therefore he set up a pole on top of the general’s tent, which could be clearly seen from all sides, and from this a lofty signal, visible to all alike, was watched for, fire by night, smoke in the daytime.</p>
