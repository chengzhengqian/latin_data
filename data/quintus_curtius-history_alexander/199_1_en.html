leave nothing which will do harm,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL369_29_a" id="target_note_LCL369_29_a"><sup>a</sup></a> so let us cut away whatever stands in the way of our rule. Often to have ignored a tiny spark has roused a great conflagration. Nothing is safely despised in an enemy; one whom you have scorned you make stronger by <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">12</span><span class="br"></span> neglect. Not even Darius received the rule of the Persians by right of succession, but he was admitted to the throne of Cyrus by the favour of Bagoas, a eunuch<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL369_29_b" id="target_note_LCL369_29_b"><sup>b</sup></a>; so do not suppose that it will be hard <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">13</span><span class="br"></span> labour for Bessus to seize a vacant kingdom. We certainly committed a sin, soldiers, if we conquered Darius for the purpose of turning over the sovereignty to his slave, who, having dared the worst of crimes, held his king in fetters, like a captive, even when he was in need of aid from without, and whom we, the victors, would surely have spared, and finally slew <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">14</span><span class="br"></span> him in order that he might not be saved by us.

But, by Heaven! if presently it shall have been announced that the same wretch is laying waste the cities of the Greeks and the Hellespont, what grief will you feel that a Bessus has robbed you of the fruits of your victory! Then you will hurry to recover what is yours, then you will take up arms. But how much better it is to crush him while he is still in fear and almost beside himself.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL369_29_d" id="target_note_LCL369_29_d"><sup>d</sup></a></p>
