However, they could not talk together without an interpreter; accordingly, when one had been furnished, the barbarian said that he had met Alexander with his army, intending at once to deliver to him all the forces of his empire, and had not waited for a pledge of safety to be given through <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">10</span><span class="br"></span> messengers. He said that he entrusted his person and his realm to a prince whom he knew to be fighting for glory and to fear nothing more than a reputation for treachery. Pleased by the sincerity of the barbarian, the king gave him his hand as a pledge of <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">11</span><span class="br"></span> good faith, and restored his kingdom to him.

Both reigned beyond the river Hydaspes,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL369_335_c" id="target_note_LCL369_335_c"><sup>c</sup></a> and they had decided to try the fortune of war against <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">14</span><span class="br"></span> anyone who attacked them. Omphis with the permission of Alexander assumed the royal diadem, and according to the usage of his race took the name which his father had had; the people called him Taxiles, a name which went with the sovereignty <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">15</span><span class="br"></span> of whoever succeeded to it. Having then entertained Alexander as his guest for three days, on the fourth day he both made known how much grain he had furnished to the forces which Hephaestion had brought,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL369_335_d" id="target_note_LCL369_335_d"><sup>d</sup></a> and gave golden crowns to Alexander
