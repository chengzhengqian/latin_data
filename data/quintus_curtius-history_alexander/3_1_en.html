<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">13</span><span class="br"></span>distant from the Pontic and the Cilician sea. We have been informed that between these two seas is the narrowest part of Asia, since they compress the lands into a narrow passageway. And because Asia is joined to the mainland, but is in great part surrounded by waters, it presents the appearance of an island, and were it not for this slight intervening space, what now separates the seas would unite them.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL368_69_aa" id="target_note_LCL368_69_aa"><sup>a</sup></a>
