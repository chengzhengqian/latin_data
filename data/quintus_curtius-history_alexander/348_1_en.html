<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">7</span><span class="br"></span> a sharp point. The Indus River comes close up to its base, and is very deep with steep banks on both sides; on the other side there are deep abysses and chasms.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL369_327_a" id="target_note_LCL369_327_a"><sup>a</sup></a> There was no other way open for storming the place <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">8</span><span class="br"></span> except by filling these. There was a forest at hand; this the king ordered to be cut in such a way that the tree-trunks should be thrown in stripped bare; for the branches covered with leaves would have hampered those who carried them. Alexander himself trimmed and threw in the first tree, and the armyâ€™s shouting which followed was an indication of their eagerness, since no one shirked the task in which the <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">9</span><span class="br"></span> king had taken the lead. In this way before the seventh day they had wholly filled the caverns, when the king ordered the archers and the Agriani to try to mount the heights. Also he chose thirty of the <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">10</span><span class="br"></span> most active men of his own cohort.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL369_327_b" id="target_note_LCL369_327_b"><sup>b</sup></a> As leaders he gave them Charus and Alexander, and the king exhorted the latter to remember the name which he had in common with himself. And at first, because the danger was so evident, the king himself decided <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">11</span><span class="br"></span> not to run the risk, but when the signal was given by the trumpet, that prince of ready daring, turning to his guards, ordered them to follow him, and was the first to climb upon the rock. Then not one of the Macedonians stayed behind, but leaving their posts <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">12</span><span class="br"></span> of their own accord, they followed the king. Many met a wretched death, for they slipped from the steep rock, and the river which flowed by swallowed them up, a sad sight even for those who were not at the moment in danger; but when by the death of others they were reminded what they themselves had to fear, compassion changing to dread, they lamented, not the dead, but themselves.</p>
