And then the other Tyrian ship, which was not held fast, made a free attack on the other side<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL368_201_a" id="target_note_LCL368_201_a"><sup>a</sup></a> of the five-banker. Then with wonderful timeliness a three-banker of Alexander’s fleet charged upon the very ship which was threatening the five-banker, with such force that the Tyrian steersman was hurled from the stern into

Then more Macedonian ships came up, and the king also was close at hand, when the Tyrians backed water and with difficulty tore away the ship which was entangled, and all their vessels together made for the port. Immediately Alexander pursued them; he was unable to enter the harbour, since he was thrust far from the walls by missiles, but he captured or sank nearly all<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL368_201_b" id="target_note_LCL368_201_b"><sup>b</sup></a> the ships.</p>
