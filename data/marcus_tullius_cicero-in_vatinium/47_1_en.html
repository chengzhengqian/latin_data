48 <span class="sc">b.c.</span>, M. Octavius, a Pompeian admiral, appeared to have Caesar’s forces, then under Q. Cornificius, at his mercy. But Vatinius at Brundisium improvised a fleet, manned by veterans who had been left there sick, and answered Cornificius’ urgent call for help by setting out to challenge M. Octavius, who was blockading Epidaurum, off the coast of Illyria. Octavius then sailed northwards and at the island of Tauris (Torcoli) was defeated by Vatinius’ bold tactics. Cornificius was thus free to return to his task of pacifying Illyria. Vatinius returned to Italy in triumph and, as a reward, was made by Caesar <span class="italic">consul suffectus</span> for the last few days of the year 47 <span class="sc">b.c.</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL309_333_a" id="target_note_LCL309_333_a"><sup>a</sup></a></p>
<p>In 46 or 45 <span class="sc">b.c.</span> Caesar sent him with three legions to a command in Illyria, during which he made some successful expeditions against the Dalmatians. Vatinius has given us some account of these in his two and a half letters to Cicero which have come down to us. Blunt and amusing, they are an admirable pointer to his character.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL309_333_b" id="target_note_LCL309_333_b"><sup>b</sup></a> He was then on the best of terms with Cicero. For his successes he was saluted <span class="italic">imperator</span> by his soldiers, and in 45 <span class="sc">b.c</span>. a <span class="italic">supplicatio</span> was decreed in his honour. In 43 <span class="sc">b.c</span>. he was again on the east coast of the Adriatic and held out for some time against the Republicans at Dyrrhachium, but finally surrendered to M. Brutus. Nevertheless, on his return to Rome the Triumvirs allowed him to triumph for his exploits in Dalmatia.
