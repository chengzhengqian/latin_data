as consul seems to have acknowledged the validity of Clodius’ law. The two scholars who have most recently investigated this problem, W.F. McDonald and S. Weinstock, differ in their conclusions. McDonald<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL309_318_a" id="target_note_LCL309_318_a"><sup>a</sup></a> held that Clodius amended but did not wholly repeal the <span class="italic">lex Aelia Fufia</span>: in his view, tribunes and augurs were left with their general right of <span class="italic">obnuntiatio</span>; curule magistrates were allowed to retain their right of <span class="italic">obnuntiatio</span> at elective, but to lose it at legislative, Assemblies; and the Assemblies could meet for the transaction of business on all <span class="italic">dies fasti</span>. Weinstock,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL309_318_b" id="target_note_LCL309_318_b"><sup>b</sup></a> however, concluded that there is evidence for the full observance of the <span class="italic">lex Aelia Fufia</span> immediately after Clodius’ tribunate and that Dio Cassius’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL309_318_c" id="target_note_LCL309_318_c"><sup>c</sup></a> statement that the purpose of Clodius’ law was to facilitate proceedings against Cicero is wholly acceptable. In his view, Clodius repealed the whole of the <span class="italic">lex Aelia Fufia</span>, but the Senate, on an augural decision, pronounced his adoption illegal, and his legislation invalid (p. 13).</p>
<p>The relevant incidents of the years 57 and 54 <span class="sc">b.c.</span> which suggest that the <span class="italic">lex Aelia Fufia</span> was then in full operation may now be mentioned.</p>
<p>1. Cicero (<span class="italic">Pro Sestio</span>, 78) says that <span class="italic">obnuntiatio</span> could have been used to oppose the <span class="italic">rogatio</span> for Cicero’s restoration which on 23 January 57 <span class="sc">b.c.</span> a tribune, Q. Fabricius, was proposing to submit to an Assembly. The Assembly, however, was broken up by Clodius’ rioters reinforced by gladiators supplied by Clodius’ brother, Appius Claudius, a praetor of the year.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL309_318_da" id="target_note_LCL309_318_da"><sup>d</sup></a></p>
