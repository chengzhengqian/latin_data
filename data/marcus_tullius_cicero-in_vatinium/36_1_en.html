<p>The right of looking for <span class="italic">auspicia impetrativa</span> was known as <span class="italic">spectio</span>; and the exercise of that right as <span class="italic">servare de caelo</span>, “to look for something coming down from the sky.” Mommsen assumed that this right<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL309_311_a" id="target_note_LCL309_311_a"><sup>a</sup></a> was confined to magistrates. According to strict practice, a magistrate, or otherwise qualified person, who had observed an unfavourable omen was bound to announce it to the magistrate who was about to preside over an Assembly.
