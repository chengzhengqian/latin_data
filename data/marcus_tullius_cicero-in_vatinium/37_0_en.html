word <span class="italic">obnuntiatio</span>, properly denoting the formal completion of an act of obstruction, was commonly used to include the preliminary act <span class="italic">servare de caelo</span>.</p>
<p>The act <span class="italic">servare de caelo</span> had to take place before the holding of the proposed Assembly, as is clear from the passage of Cicero quoted on page 311, note <span class="italic">b</span>.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL309_312_a" id="target_note_LCL309_312_a"><sup>a</sup></a> In the Ciceronian Age <span class="italic">servare de caelo</span> cannot have been anything more than a fiction, and an unfavourable omen anything more than a fabrication. The Roman religious conscience acquiesced in the manufacture of <span class="italic">auspicia impetrativa</span>, but required that <span class="italic">auspicia oblativa</span> should be genuine. This process of “make-believe” was perhaps originally helped<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL309_312_b" id="target_note_LCL309_312_b"><sup>b</sup></a> by the fact that a Roman Assembly met early in the day, and that <span class="italic">servare de caelo</span> would be carried out during the night or the small hours of the morning. If lightning, frequent during summer nights in southern Europe, had taken place during the night, few would be in a position to deny the occurrence of this unfavourable omen.</p>
<p>The right, however, to announce unfavourable <span class="italic">auspicia oblativa</span> was not restricted to magistrates or those otherwise qualified, but was open to all citizens. Augurs naturally had special competence in this matter. These omens might take the form, for example, of a flash of lightning, of an epileptic seizure (<span class="italic">morbus comitialis</span>) or even of a sudden noise.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL309_312_c" id="target_note_LCL309_312_c"><sup>c</sup></a> A presiding magistrate could respect or ignore at will such an announcement by a private individual,
