of Cicero’s elaboration of his spoken speech into a political manifesto.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL309_299_a" id="target_note_LCL309_299_a"><sup>a</sup></a> Without going so far as this, it is immaterial for our purpose whether or not Cicero delivered in court in their present form the well-known sections (96-101; 136-139) which are his fullest extant declaration that the political programme of the Optimates was the establishment in the State of <span class="italic">cum dignitate otium</span>.

The failure of this having led the prosecution to compare the weakness of Cicero’s friends with the success of his enemies, the orator passes to his main subject (§§ 96-143), an elaborate account of the Optimates, whose policy he defends as true patriotism. Having interwoven with this an account of the later and successful stage of the movement for his recall, Cicero concludes by an exhortation to the rising generation to be faithful to the political principles of the Optimates as expressed in government by the Senate and in their aim of <span class="italic">cum dignitate otium</span>.</p>
