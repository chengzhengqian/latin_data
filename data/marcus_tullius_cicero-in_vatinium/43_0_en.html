<p>In the autumn of 50 <span class="sc">b.c.</span> Sestius, in some semiofficial capacity, was on a visit to the province of Cilicia,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL309_324_b" id="target_note_LCL309_324_b"><sup>b</sup></a> of which Cicero had just relinquished the government. As he seems to have taken over a sum of money which Cicero had saved from his allowance as governor, and had deposited with L. Mescinius Rufus, one of his quaestors, it is probable that Sestius had been marked out to succeed Cicero as governor. Sestius had, of course, no <span class="italic">imperium</span> during this visit to Cilicia, for in the political <span class="italic">impasse</span> of 50 <span class="sc">b.c.</span> no provincial appointments were made.

If, however, we may assume that he was indicted <span class="italic">de ambitu</span> (as Appian states in <span class="italic">Bell. Civ</span>. ii. 2. 24, although the possibility should not be excluded that he is confusing this trial of Sestius with that of 56 <span class="sc">b.c.</span>), his praetorship may perhaps be dated to 53 <span class="sc">b.c</span>. If so, Sestius may have been charged with corruption in an election to a praetorship for the remainder of 53 <span class="sc">b.c.</span> at the elections held as late as July in that year (Dio Cassius, xl. 45). A.C. Clark (Cicero, <span class="italic">Pro Milone</span>, p. xii), has shown that it is exceedingly doubtful that Pompey’s law <span class="italic">de ambitu</span> embraced any offence committed earlier than 53 <span class="sc">b.c</span>. This would exclude a candidature by Sestius for a praetorship of an earlier year. Broughton, <span class="italic">The Magistrates of the Roman Republic</span>, ii, p. 621, says “Praetor by 54? <span class="italic">or</span> 50?” We must assume that Cicero’s defence of Sestius was again successful.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL309_324_a').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL309_324_b"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL309_324_b" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">b</sup>Cicero, <span class="italic">Epp. ad Fam</span>. v. 20. 5; Tyrrell and Purser, <span class="italic">The Correspondence of Cicero</span>, vol. iv, pp. 11-12.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL309_324_b').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
