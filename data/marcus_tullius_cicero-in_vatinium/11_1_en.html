your cause to the Senate, as Caesar does<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL309_261_a" id="target_note_LCL309_261_a"><sup>a</sup></a>; in the second place, what is the authority of a man who defends himself by the act of another, not by his own. Next, for the truth shall at length force utterance, and I shall not hesitate to say what I think. Suppose for a moment that Caesar did break out into some excesses; that the strain of conflict, his passion for glory, his outstanding genius, his exalted birth, did drive him into some acts which at that moment and in such a man might be tolerable, but should be wiped out of memory by his subsequent mighty achievements<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL309_261_b" id="target_note_LCL309_261_b"><sup>b</sup></a>; will you, you rascal, claim the same forbearance; and shall we give ear to the voice of Vatinius, brigand and temple-robber, demanding for himself the same privileges as Caesar?</p>
