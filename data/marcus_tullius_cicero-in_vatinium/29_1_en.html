you are never in the habit of admitting to be a greater scoundrel than yourself, the other at your instigation, but with his assistance,—none the less I ask you, then, how can you separate in your evidence two men whom you confound in the same accusation?</p>
<p>The last question to which I want an answer is this. When you asserted at length<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL309_297_a" id="target_note_LCL309_297_a"><sup>a</sup></a> that Albinovanus was acting collusively, did you not say that you had not approved of Sestius being accused of violence, and that he ought not to have been so accused<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL309_297_b" id="target_note_LCL309_297_b"><sup>b</sup></a>; that he should rather have been accused under any law, on any charge; did you not also say that the cause of Milo, that heroic man, was thought to be bound up with that of Sestius; that all that had been done by Sestius on my behalf was approved by good citizens?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL309_297_c" id="target_note_LCL309_297_c"><sup>c</sup></a> I do not reproach you for the inconsistency between your speech<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL309_297_d" id="target_note_LCL309_297_d"><sup>d</sup></a> and your evidence; for you have given evidence at length against those measures of Sestius which you declare were approved by good citizens, and you associate with the cause and accusation of Sestius the man<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL309_297_e" id="target_note_LCL309_297_e"><sup>e</sup></a> whom you praised so highly. But this I do ask, whether you think that Publius Sestius ought to be condemned by virtue of that law, under which you assert that he ought on no account to have been accused; or, if you object while giving evidence to be asked your opinion, for fear that I might seem to attach any weight to it, tell me—whether you gave evidence on a charge of violence against a man who, you said, ought never to have been tried on a charge of violence.</p>
