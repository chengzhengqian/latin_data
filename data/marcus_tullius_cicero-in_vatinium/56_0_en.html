from poverty to wealth in a year when a stringent law was passed (by Caesar), <span class="italic">de pecuniis repetundis</span>, shows your contemptible treatment of your so-called best friend.</p>
<p>§§ 30-32. What did you mean by appearing in a dark dress at the funeral banquet given by my friend Q. Arrius in the Temple of Castor, when everyone knows that at such a banquet a light dress is worn? You will say that you disapproved of the public thanksgiving (for C. Pomptinus) which was then being held. Could you not express your disapproval otherwise than by such highly disrespectful behaviour?</p>
<p>§§ 33-34. When you were out of office (58 <span class="sc">b.c.</span>), were you not summoned under the <span class="italic">lex Licinia Iunia</span>? Was not your behaviour quite without precedent? You returned from your staff-duties (with Caesar in Gaul) to face your charge and actually appealed to tribunes, and to Clodius by name, to stop the case. Though Clodius could not lawfully oppose your trial, he put himself at the head of your men, broke up the court, put Memmius the praetor to flight, and even evicted the presidents of the neighbouring courts. While you could have avoided a trial by remaining at your post, why did you behave in that dishonest fashion?</p>
<p>§§ 35-36. Tell me what decree of the Senate conferred a staff-appointment upon you? Your answer is your own law, the <span class="italic">lex Vatinia</span>. Did you plan to sweep the Senate from the constitution? Not content with depriving the Senate of the right of assigning provinces, of appointing to military commands, of administering the Treasury, you commit the unexampled outrage of removing its ancient prerogative
