and his legislation was therefore invalid. But, on this hypothesis, it is difficult to see why Clodius’ three other laws apparently remained in force until his law restricting the powers of the censors was repealed in 52 <span class="sc">b.c</span>. by Q. Metellus Scipio, and until his laws for the revival and increase of the <span class="italic">collegia</span> and for the provision of free corn were, in the former case, repealed and, in the latter, amended by Julius Caesar as dictator.</p>
<p>In conclusion, brief reference should be made to an incident in 44 <span class="sc">b.c.</span> which may suggest that M.

In that year Caesar, in view of his proposed absence in Parthia, planned to resign his consulship in favour of Dolabella who was to be elected <span class="italic">consul suffectus</span> as colleague of Antonius.

Yet, in the same year, Antonius refused
