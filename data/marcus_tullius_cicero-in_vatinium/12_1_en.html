by all, many of them, with my approval also, by my friend Gaius Cosconius, a member of this jury, successful in the aediles’ election,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL309_263_b" id="target_note_LCL309_263_b"><sup>b</sup></a> whom you cannot see without bursting with envy. I wish <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">17</span><span class="br"></span> you would tell me whether any one of the whole college ventured to propose a law except yourself. What audacity was yours, what violence! what your nine colleagues held should be regarded with awe, you alone, one sprung from the mud, the lowest of the land in every way, regarded as contemptible, trivial, ridiculous! Do you know of any tribune of the commons since the foundation of Rome who transacted business with the commons, when it was well known that an announcement had been made that the heavens had been watched? I should also like <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">18</span><span class="br"></span> you to answer this. During your tribunate of the commons, the Aelian and Fufian Laws<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL309_263_c" id="target_note_LCL309_263_c"><sup>c</sup></a> still existed in the State, those laws which often checked and crippled revolutionary tribunes, those laws which no one except yourself has ever ventured to resist; laws, I may say, which the year after, while two men<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL309_263_d" id="target_note_LCL309_263_d"><sup>d</sup></a> were seated on the Rostra<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL309_263_e" id="target_note_LCL309_263_e"><sup>e</sup></a>—I will not say consuls, but two betrayers and plagues of our country,—were destroyed in the same conflagration as the auspices, as vetoes, and as all public law: I ask you, did you ever hesitate, contrary to those laws, to transact business with the commons and summon a Meeting?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL309_263_f" id="target_note_LCL309_263_f"><sup>f</sup></a> Have you ever heard that any of the most seditious tribunes of the commons was so audacious as to summon a Meeting in defiance of the Aelian or the Fufian Law?</p>
