of appointing staff-officers. Clodius quickly followed your example. Your fellow-tribesmen have therefore dishonoured you and you are the first member of your tribe, the Sergia, to lose the tribal vote.</p>
<p>§ 37. You have also, by giving a gladiatorial show during your candidature (for the praetorship), broken a law of mine, carried in due constitutional fashion, even though I obey your laws, however they were carried. Are you looking for a second Clodius to save you from prosecution?</p>
<p>§§ 38-39. If you disregard all this in your reliance on Caesar’s great affection for you, let me tell you what Caesar recently said at Aquileia. He expressed great annoyance at the defeat of C. Alfius (at the praetorian elections in 57 <span class="sc">b.c.</span>) and at the election (as praetor) of Cn. Domitius Calvinus. As for you, he said that Vatinius had done nothing during his tribunate without being paid for it, and that as he cared so much for money, he ought to put up with his defeat (for the aedileship). If Caesar, who allowed you to run amuck at your own risk, thinks that of you, and if your friends, relatives and fellow-tribesmen detest you, why not do the most popular thing you could ever do and seek death?</p>
<p>In the closing paragraphs (40-41) Cicero cross-examines Vatinius on some points arising from the trial of Sestius.</p>
<p>§§ 40-41. Finally, I will ask you a few questions on the case itself. Why are you so inconsistent as to praise Milo before a jury such as this, and, when you were recently brought up by Clodius before a meeting packed with his rabble, to say that Milo attacked the State with his gladiators? As all admit, Milo and Sestius have always been in close political partnership.
