Macedonia (62 <span class="sc">b.c.</span>) belongs Cicero’s only surviving letter to him (<span class="italic">Epp. ad Fam</span>. v. 6.). Its topics are Cicero’s promise to plead for an extension of his quaestorship in Macedonia; an admission that Cicero’s recent purchase from Crassus of a mansion on the Palatine had plunged him heavily into debt; and a statement that he had defended Antonius in the Senate on some charge of which we know nothing.</p>
<p>In the summer of 58 <span class="sc">b.c.</span> Sestius was elected tribune and was soon busily helping in Pompey’s campaign for the restoration of Cicero. Cicero’s letter from Thessalonica early in August 58 <span class="sc">b.c.</span> to his brother Quintus (<span class="italic">Epp. ad Quintum fratrem</span>, i. 4) praises Sestius as <span class="italic">officiosissimus</span> and <span class="italic">amicissimus</span>, but on 4 October Cicero wrote to Atticus (<span class="italic">Epp. ad Att</span>. iii. 20. 3) criticizing a bill which Sestius had prepared for his restoration as “lacking in sufficient regard for my position and in sufficient care.” Later in the year and before he entered upon his tribunate (10 December), Sestius visited Caesar in Cisalpine Gaul to intercede for Cicero, but with results which were not, apparently, immediately encouraging.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL309_323_a" id="target_note_LCL309_323_a"><sup>a</sup></a></p>
<p>The great services rendered in 57 <span class="sc">b.c.</span> by Sestius and his fellow-tribune Milo in crushing Clodius’ opposition to measures for Cicero’s recall have already been described (pp. 18-21). After his acquittal in 56 <span class="sc">b.c.</span> we next hear of him in 52 <span class="sc">b.c.</span> The fact that Sestius was in 49 <span class="sc">b.c.</span> invested with <span class="italic">imperium</span> as governor of Cilicia suggests that he was an ex-praetor. If so, we are compelled to conjecture the year of his praetorship, for our sources are silent. 55 <span class="sc">b.c.</span>, which has been tentatively suggested, seems too near the
