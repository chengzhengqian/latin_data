<p>But when we come to the <span class="italic">In Vatinium</span> there is a different story to tell. For the vehemence of Cicero’s attack on Vatinius himself and his tribunate there is confirmatory evidence in two of Cicero’s letters. In <span class="italic">Epp. ad Quintum fratrem</span>, ii. 4. 1 (March 56 <span class="sc">b.c</span>.) we read: “In conducting the defence (of Sestius) . . .

No such remark is to be found in the extant speeches, <span class="italic">Pro Sestio</span> and <span class="italic">In Vatinium</span>. Two explanations have been offered: either, that the remark may have been deleted from the published version as highly offensive to Caesar; or, that it may have appeared in a lacuna of about forty lines occurring in the text of the <span class="sc">ms.</span> of the <span class="italic">In Vatinium</span> known as P between the present sections 4 and 5.
