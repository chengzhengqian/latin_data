accused person mounted the tribunal of his judge<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL309_287_a" id="target_note_LCL309_287_a"><sup>a</sup></a> and violently thrust him down from it, scattered the benches, thrown down the urns, and, in short, in order to upset a trial, committed all those excesses, which were the very reason why trials were established? Do you not know that Memmius then took to flight? That your accusers<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL309_287_b" id="target_note_LCL309_287_b"><sup>b</sup></a> had to be rescued from your hands and from those of your accomplices? That the presidents of the neighbouring courts were turned out of their seats? That in the Forum, in broad daylight, in view of the Roman People, a court of law, magistrates, old customs, laws, judges, a defendant, a penalty, were set at nought? Do you not know that all this, thanks to the diligence of Gaius Memmius, has been set down in the public records and duly attested? And I ask you this also.

How then, after refusing to use the means of escape offered by a staff-appointment, was it consistent to have sought a guilty refuge in a most dishonest appeal?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL309_287_d" id="target_note_LCL309_287_d"><sup>d</sup></a></p>
