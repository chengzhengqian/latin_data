since Cicero says in a letter of 3 March 49<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL309_325_a" id="target_note_LCL309_325_a"><sup>a</sup></a> that Sestius then had the <span class="italic">imperium</span>, it is probable that he and other governors obtained their <span class="italic">imperium</span> through the Pompeian Senate sometime between 7 January, when the <span class="italic">senatus consultum de re publica defendenda</span> was passed, and the end of February.
