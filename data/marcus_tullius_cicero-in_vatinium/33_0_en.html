The literal rendering offered on p. 169 and elsewhere, “peace with dignity,” may mean a salutary condition for the benefit of the whole State: peace and quietness for the masses, freedom from civil discord, “a responsible, effective, and respected government” (Balsdon, <span class="italic">op. cit</span>. p. 49). No programme of political or social reform was put forward in the <span class="italic">Pro Sestio</span>, for the speech was not basically a defence of the <span class="italic">status quo</span>, but a call for “the defence of <span class="italic">lex</span> and <span class="italic">ius</span> against <span class="italic">vis</span>“ (Lacey, <span class="italic">op. cit</span>. p. 68), and a plea for the justification of armed resistance in defence of the State against terrorism.</p>
<p>Cicero then turns to the Senate as the keystone of “the constitution so wisely established by our ancestors” (§ 137). His words contrast the transient magistrate and the permanent Senate; they insist that the Senate is to be composed of ex-magistrates who have been chosen by the whole electorate for merit (<span class="italic">industria et virtus</span>); and they imply a belief that the Senate was open to plebeians from the beginning of the Republic.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL309_304_a" id="target_note_LCL309_304_a"><sup>a</sup></a> Thus the Senate was to be no narrow oligarchy, but representative of all that was best in the citizen-body, merit and not birth being the qualification for it. It is noteworthy that such a Senate bears a striking resemblance to the Senate which Sulla planned to set up in supreme control of the State and to which he proposed to give representative character by popular election.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL309_304_b" id="target_note_LCL309_304_b"><sup>b</sup></a></p>
