He was said to have read out the text of his bill. His defence, attested by his colleagues, was that he had done so, not for the sake of reading it out publicly, but for the purpose of revising it. Yet it is at least certain that he dismissed the Meeting<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL309_247_e" id="target_note_LCL309_247_e"><sup>e</sup></a> on that day, and respected the veto of a tribune. But you, who disapprove of my defence of Cornelius—what case, or rather what face, will you present to your own advocates, when you already give them definite warning how disgraceful it will be for them if they undertake your defence, since you think that my undertaking that of Cornelius is a matter for accusation and abuse?
