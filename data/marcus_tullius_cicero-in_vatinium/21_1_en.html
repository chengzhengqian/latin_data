<p>Another thing also I should like to learn from you: <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">30</span><span class="br"></span>what was your design, what was your intention, in being present in a dark dress at the funeral celebration given by my friend Quintus Arrius?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL309_281_c" id="target_note_LCL309_281_c"><sup>c</sup></a> Had you ever seen, ever heard of anyone presenting himself on such an occasion in such a costume? What example, what custom authorized you to do so? You will say that you disapproved of the public thanksgivings that were then being held.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL309_281_da" id="target_note_LCL309_281_da"><sup>d</sup></a> Very well, I grant you that those thanksgivings were nothing. Do you see that I am not questioning you on the subject of that year, nor about the interests you seem to share with very high personages,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL309_281_e" id="target_note_LCL309_281_e"><sup>e</sup></a> but about your own misdeeds? Let us dismiss the thanksgiving from consideration. Tell me, whoever took his place at table in mourning? A funeral celebration, certainly, is so far funereal that gladiatorial games are part of the funeral, but the banquet itself is in honour of the celebrant,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL309_281_f" id="target_note_LCL309_281_f"><sup>f</sup></a></p>

<p>XIII. But I say nothing of the public funeral celebration, <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">31</span><span class="br"></span> of the festal day with its silver, dresses, all kinds of magnificence, and decorations worth seeing.
