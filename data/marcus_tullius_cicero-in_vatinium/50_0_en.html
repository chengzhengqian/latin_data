had crushed Clodius like a second Catiline, civil war would have broken out. Rather than endanger the State by my presence, I chose to yield. I should have failed in my public duty if I had wantonly sacrificed my life. Just as my death would have been a triumph for the enemies of disorder, so my restoration meant victory for the cause of order, peace and the prestige of the State.</p>
<p>§§ 53-67. To turn to my subject. On the day of my departure laws were passed to banish me and to assign provinces to the consuls. My family were persecuted; my property was looted by the exultant consuls; my house was burnt. The consuls acquiesced in the passing of other monstrous laws under which the censors lost power, political clubs were sanctioned, corn was issued free, Syria instead of Cilicia was assigned to Gabinius as his province, all laws and rules relating to ritual observances and legislative procedure were repealed. Abroad, Brogitarus of Galatia was made priest of Cybele at Pessinus; condemned exiles were restored to Byzantium; an inoffensive ruler and ally, King Ptolemy of Cyprus, was to be dethroned, scandalous treatment compared with our past generosity to enemies like Antiochus the Great and Tigranes of Armenia. The appointment of Cato to annex Ptolemy’s kingdom was a means of banishing an outspoken antagonist and a vain attempt to tarnish his integrity. The consuls’ irresponsibility in failing to protest against these measures is in keeping with their neglect to save from illegal banishment such a servant of the State as myself. And far worse would have followed, had not Pompey returned to public life after an absence and at length declared himself against Clodius.</p>
