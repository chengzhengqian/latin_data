<p>VIII. I also ask you, whether you have tried, have <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">19</span><span class="br"></span> ever had the wish or even the idea—for the crime is of such a kind that, if it only entered your mind, no one would fail to think you worthy of the extremest punishment—whether you ever had the idea, during your intolerable—I will not say reign as king (for that is what you like to hear) but your career as brigand,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL309_265_a" id="target_note_LCL309_265_a"><sup>a</sup></a> of being elected augur in place of Quintus Metellus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL309_265_ba" id="target_note_LCL309_265_ba"><sup>b</sup></a> so that whoever saw you might be twice pierced and twice anguished, both by the loss of a brave and illustrious man, and by the elevation of an infamous scoundrel? Did you indeed think that the State had been so undermined and the constitution so shaken under your tribunate—no, that Rome had fallen into captivity and ruin, so that we could endure Vatinius as augur? At this point I ask, if you had been <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">20</span><span class="br"></span> elected augur as you had desired—and what an idea it was! we who hated you could scarcely control our indignation, while those<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL309_265_c" id="target_note_LCL309_265_c"><sup>c</sup></a> whose darling you were could hardly restrain their laughter!—but I ask you, after all those other wounds, by which you thought the State was being destroyed, if you had inflicted this mortal blow also by your augurate, did you propose to decree, as all augurs since Romulus have decreed, that when Juppiter lightens it is sacrilege to transact business with the People, or, because you had always so transacted it, did you propose as augur to make a complete end of the auspices?</p>
