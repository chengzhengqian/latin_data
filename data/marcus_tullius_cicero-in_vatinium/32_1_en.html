(<span class="italic">Att</span>. vii. 11): “haec ait omnia facere se dignitatis causa.” There was a <span class="italic">dignitas</span> also of the State, as Lacey stresses (<span class="italic">op. cit</span>. p. 71): “dignitatem ac libertatem [rei publicae]” (<span class="italic">Ad fam</span>. ii. 5); also “mihi ante oculos obversatur rei publicae dignitas, quae me ad sese rapit” (<span class="italic">Pro Sestio</span>,§ 7). This <span class="italic">dignitas</span> had been outraged by Caesar’s methods in 59 <span class="sc">b.c.</span>, and by the gangsterism of Clodius not only when he was tribune (58 <span class="sc">b.c</span>.) and aedile (56 <span class="sc">b.c.</span>) but also when out of office in 57 <span class="sc">b.c.</span></p>
<p>The earliest association of <span class="italic">otium</span> and <span class="italic">dignitas</span> in what survives of Cicero’s works is found in his public speech of thanks made immediately after his return from exile in September, 57 <span class="sc">b.c</span>. In praising Pompey for the part which he had played in securing his return, he said that he had conferred not only on Cicero himself but also on the whole State, <span class="italic">salutem, otium, dignitatem</span> (<span class="italic">Post reditum ad populum</span>, § 16). The appearance of the phrase <span class="italic">cum dignitate otium</span> is rare and is limited to the years 56-54 <span class="sc">b.c</span>. First, in the <span class="italic">Pro Sestio</span> we find it and its variant, <span class="italic">otiosa dignitas</span>, on three occasions (§§ 98, 99, 104). Secondly, in the <span class="italic">De Oratore</span>, finished in 55 <span class="sc">b.c.</span>, we find <span class="italic">otio cum dignitate</span> (§ 1). Lastly, <span class="italic">cum dignitate otium</span> appears in the celebrated letter (<span class="italic">Ad fam</span>. i. 9. 21) which Cicero wrote in 54 <span class="sc">b.c</span>. to P. Lentulus Spinther to explain not only the political change which he would find on his return from his proconsulship in Cilicia, but also that in Cicero’s own position since Lentulus’ departure at the end of 57 <span class="sc">b.c.</span></p>
<p>The difficulty of interpreting the expression <span class="italic">cum dignitate otium</span> is reflected in the differing versions given by translators: “leisure accompanied by dignity” (Barker, see p. 166, note <span class="italic">b</span>); “social </p></section><notes></notes></section>
