Since Clodius and yourself are associated in prosecuting Milo and Sestius, how can you differentiate between the two in your evidence?</p>
<p>Moreover, in your recent speech in court, when you were accusing Albinovanus of collusion, did you not say that Sestius should on no account have been charged with breach of the peace, since his case and Milo’s were so similar, and that Sestius’ work in my cause was approved by the best people in the State? I pass over the inconsistency between your speech and your evidence. But tell me whether you think that Sestius should be condemned on a charge which you say should never have been brought against him; and whether you gave evidence on a charge of breach of the peace against a man who, you say, should on no account have been so charged.</p>
