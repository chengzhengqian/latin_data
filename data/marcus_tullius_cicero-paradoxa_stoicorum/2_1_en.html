make it acceptable, nothing so rough and uncultured as not to gain brilliance and refinement from eloquence. And holding this opinion I have acted even more boldly than the person I am speaking of himself. For Cato at all events follows the Stoic practice of employing the embellishments of eloquence when he is discoursing on grandeur of mind, or self-control, or death, or the glory of virtue in general, or the immortal gods, or love of country; but I for my part have amused myself by throwing into common form,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL349_257_a" id="target_note_LCL349_257_a"><sup>a</sup></a> for your benefit, even those doctrines which the Stoics scarcely succeed in proving in the retirement of the schools <span class="innerMarginNote left">4</span>of philosophy. These doctrines are surprising,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL349_257_b" id="target_note_LCL349_257_b"><sup>b</sup></a> and they run counter to universal opinion—the Stoics themselves actually term them <span class="italic">paradoxa</span>; so I wanted to try whether it is possible for them to be brought out into the light of common daily life and expounded in a form to win acceptance, or whether learning has one style of discourse and ordinary life another; and I wrote with the greater pleasure because the doctrines styled <span class="italic">paradoxa</span> by the Stoics appear to me to be in the highest degree Socratic, <span class="innerMarginNote left">5</span>and far and away the truest. You will therefore receive this brief little essay, the lamplight production of the nights that are now growing shorter, since the former occupation of my longer watches has already appeared in your name<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL349_257_c" id="target_note_LCL349_257_c"><sup>c</sup></a>; and you will sample a class of exercises that I have made a practice of employing when transposing things expressed in the schools of philosophy in the form of logical demonstration<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL349_257_d" id="target_note_LCL349_257_d"><sup>d</sup></a> into this oratorical style of discourse that is my own. All the same, I make no demand that you should place this work to my credit, for it is
