laying violent hands on the life of one’s father many transgressions are committed: violence is done to the author of one’s being, to him who gave us nurture and education and a place in his house and home and in the state; the parricide stands first in the number of his transgressions and therefore deserves a greater penalty. But in the conduct of life we ought not to consider what penalty belongs to each transgression but how much is permitted to each person: we ought to deem whatever is wrong a crime, whatever is not permitted a sin. ‘Even in the smallest things?’ Yes, inasmuch as we are not able to impose regulation on things, but are able to <span class="innerMarginNote left">26</span>regulate our minds. If an actor makes a movement that is a little out of time with the music, or recites a verse that is one syllable too short or too long, he is hissed and hooted off the stage: in real life, will you, whose conduct ought to be more carefully controlled than any stage, gesture, more accurately proportioned than any verse of poetry, say that you only transgress by a single syllable? I will not listen to a poet when he transgresses in trifles: am I to listen to a citizen when he measures off on his fingers his transgressions in the intercourse of life—‘if they appear smaller in size, they appear less in gravity?’ How could they appear smaller in size, when every transgression is a transgression caused by the dislocation of system and order, but when system and order have once been dislocated nothing further can be added to make a greater degree of transgression appear possible?</p>
