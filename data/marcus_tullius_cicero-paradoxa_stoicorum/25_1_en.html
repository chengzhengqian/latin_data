I only wish we were! but it is one’s mode of life and one’s culture, not one’s valuation for rating, that <span class="innerMarginNote left">51</span>really fixes the amount of one’s money. Not to be covetous is money, not to love buying things is an income; in fact contentment with one’s own possessions is a very large and perfectly secure fortune!</p>
<p>Indeed if your skilled valuers set a high value on particular rural and urban sites for the reason that this class of property is least liable to damage, how great a value should be set on virtue, of which one can never be robbed or cheated, and which is not lost by shipwreck or fire, or affected by the violence <span class="innerMarginNote left">52</span>of storms or by stormy periods in politics! Those endowed with virtue alone are rich, for they alone possess property that both produces profit and lasts for ever, and they alone have the special characteristic of wealth—contentment with what is theirs; they think what they have got is enough and seek for nothing more, they want nothing, think that they lack nothing, need nothing. Whereas the wicked and the covetous, as the property that they own is uncertain and depends on chance, and as they are always seeking to get more and not one of them was ever hitherto found who was content with what he had, are to be deemed not only not well-off and rich but actually needy and poor.</p>
