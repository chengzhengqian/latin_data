<p>Again, when the mastership of the desires is over, and another master has arisen—fear, springing from a guilty conscience,—what a wretched and what a hard slavery that is! it means having to truckle to young people that are a little too talkative, and fearing as one’s masters all the people who seem to know something. Then what a powerful master is a judge! what fear he inspires in the guilty! and is not all <span class="innerMarginNote left">41</span>fear slavery? What is the value therefore of that oration,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL349_293_a" id="target_note_LCL349_293_a"><sup>a</sup></a> marked by more fluency than wisdom, delivered by a man of the greatest eloquence, Lucius Crassus? ‘Rescue us from slavery’: what slavery does this mean, as affecting so famous and distinguished a person? all the timidity of a weakened and humbled and broken spirit is slavery. ‘Do not allow us to be in slavery to anybody’: does he want to be emancipated in the literal sense? by no means; for what does he add next? ‘except to your entire body’: he wants to change masters, not to be free. ‘Whose servants we both can be and ought to be.’ We on the contrary, as we have a high and lofty spirit, exalted by the virtues, neither ought to be nor can be; but for your part by all means say that you can, inasmuch as that is the case, but do not say that you ought, inasmuch as no one owes any service save what it is dishonourable not to render.</p>
