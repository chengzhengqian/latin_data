But can you be a citizen if owing to you at one period no state existed, and do you designate me by the appellation that belongs to you, although everybody thinks that with my departure the commonwealth went into exile? O maddest of mankind, will you never look around you? will you never consider what you are doing, or what you are saying? Do you not know that exile is a penalty for crime, but that that journey of mine was undertaken on account of the <span class="innerMarginNote left">31</span>glorious deeds that I had accomplished? All impious criminals (whose leader you openly profess yourself to be) whom the laws wish to be punished with exile are exiles, even if they have not left the country: would not an enemy term you ‘exile’ when all the laws ordain that you are to be one? ‘A person found with a weapon’: your dagger<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL349_283_a" id="target_note_LCL349_283_a"><sup>a</sup></a> was detected in front of the senate-house; ‘who has killed a man’: you have killed a great many; ‘who has caused a fire’: your hand set fire to the Temple of the Nymphs and it, was burnt down; ‘who has seized temples’: you encamped in the forum. But why need I <span class="innerMarginNote left">32</span>quote the universal principles of law, by all of which you are an exile? your closest intimate carried a special bill with regard to you, to punish you with exile if you intruded on the secret shrine of the Good Goddess<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL349_283_b" id="target_note_LCL349_283_b"><sup>b</sup></a>; but you actually make a habit of boasting that you did so. As therefore so many laws have flung you into exile, how is it you do not fear and dread the name of exile? ‘I am at Rome,’ you say. Yes, and in fact you were in the secret shrine. Therefore a man will not have the rights of the particular place where he happens to be if by law he ought not to be there.</p>
