the action’s being a transgression consists in its not having been allowed, the transgressions springing from the fact of non-allowance must necessarily be <span class="innerMarginNote left">21</span>equal. And if virtues are equal to one another, vices also must necessarily be equal to one another; but it can very easily be seen that virtues are equal, and that no one can be better than a good man or more temperate than a temperate man or braver than a brave man or wiser than a wise man. Will you call a man good who pays back ten pounds of gold when as the money had been entrusted to him without a witness he could easily have pocketed it without punishment, if he fails to do the same in the case of a sum of ten thousand pounds? or temperate, who restrains himself in one sort of excess but lets himself <span class="innerMarginNote left">22</span>go in another? Virtue in harmony with reason and unbroken constancy is one—nothing can be added to it to make it virtue in a greater degree, and nothing can be taken away from it and yet the name of virtue be left to it. In fact if good deeds are deeds done rightly, and if nothing is more right than that which is right, undoubtedly also nothing can be found that is better than that which is good. It follows therefore that vices also are equal, inasmuch as vices are correctly termed ‘deformities<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL349_273_a" id="target_note_LCL349_273_a"><sup>a</sup></a> of the mind.’ But inasmuch as virtues are equal, right actions must be equal, since they proceed from the virtues, and similarly transgressions must necessarily be equal since they emanate from vices.</p>
