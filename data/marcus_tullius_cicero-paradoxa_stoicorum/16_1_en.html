<p><span class="italic">That only the wise man is free, and that every foolish man is a slave.</span></p>
<p><span class="innerMarginNote left">33</span>But granted that this person is lauded as commander-in-chief, or even that he is so styled, or is deemed worthy of that title: commander in what sense? or to what free man will this person possibly issue commands, who cannot command his own desires? First let him curb his lusts, despise pleasures, restrain his angry temper, control his avarice, repulse all the other defilements of the mind; let him start commanding others only when he has himself left off obeying those most unprincipled masters, unseemliness and turpitude: so long as he is subservient to these, he will be altogether unworthy to be deemed not merely a commander but even a free man.</p>
<p>For an excellent dictum is current among people of the greatest learning—whose authority I should not employ if I had to deliver this discourse before persons of no cultivation, but as I am speaking in the presence of people of the highest wisdom, to whom these doctrines are no novelty, why should I pretend that I have wasted any trouble that I may have spent in these studies?—well, it has been said by men of the greatest erudition that no one is free save the <span class="innerMarginNote left">34</span>wise man. For what is freedom? the power to live as you will. Who then lives as he wills except one who follows the things that are right, who delights in his duty, who has a well-considered path of life mapped out before him, who does not obey even the laws because of fear but follows and respects them
