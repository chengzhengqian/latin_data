he cried: “I have lived long enough, since I die unconquered.” Then he drew out the iron and at once breathed his last.</p>
<p><span class="bold">10.</span> Epaminondas never took a wife. Because of this he was criticized by Pelopidas,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL467_183_1" id="target_note_LCL467_183_1"><sup>1</sup></a> who had a son of evil reputation; for his friend said that the great Theban did a wrong to his country in not leaving children. Epaminondas replied; “Take heed that you do not do her a greater wrong in leaving such a son as yours. And besides, I cannot lack offspring; for I leave as my daughter the battle of Leuctra, which is certain, not merely to survive me, but even to be immortal”. When the exiles, led by Pelopidas, took Thebes and drove the Lacedaemonian garrison from the citadel, so long as the citizens were being slain Epaminondas remained in his house,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL467_183_2" id="target_note_LCL467_183_2"><sup>2</sup></a> since he was unwilling either to aid the traitors or to fight against them, from reluctance to stain his hands with the blood of his countrymen; for he thought that every victory won in a civil war was pernicious. But as soon as the combat began with the Lacedaemonians at the Cadmea, he stood in the forefront.</p>
<p>Enough will have been said of this great man’s virtues and of his life, if I add this one thing, which nobody will deny. Before the birth of Epaminondas, and after his death, Thebes was subject constantly to the hegemony<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL467_183_3" id="target_note_LCL467_183_3"><sup>3</sup></a> of others; but, on the contrary, so long as he was at the head of the state, she was the leading city of all Greece. This fact shows that one man was worth more than the entire body of citizens.</p>
