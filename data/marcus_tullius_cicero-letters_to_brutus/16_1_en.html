<p>How delighted I am to learn of the successes of our
friend Brutus and the Consuls it is easier for you to imagine
than for me to write. I applaud and rejoice at all of
it, but especially the fact that Brutus’ breakout not only
brought safety to himself but also made a major contribution
to the victory.</p>
<p>You tell me that the three Antonii are in one and the
same boat, and that my view is for me to determine. My
only conclusion is that the Senate or the People of Rome
must pass judgement on those citizens who have not died
fighting. You will say that my calling men hostile to the
state ‘citizens’ is an impropriety in itself On the contrary, it
is quite proper. What the Senate has not yet decreed, nor
the Roman People ordered, I do not take it upon myself to
prejudge, I do not make myself the arbiter. This much I
maintain: in dealing with a person<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_237_1" id="target_note_LCL462_237_1"><sup>1</sup></a> whose life circumstances
did not oblige me to take, I have neither despoiled
him cruelly nor indulged him laxly, and I have kept him in
my power for the duration of the war.</p>
<p>In my judgement it is much more honourable and
profitable to the commonwealth to refrain from bearing
hard on the unfortunate than to make endless concessions
to the powerful which may whet their appetite and arrogance.
In which regard, my excellent and gallant friend,
whom I love so well and so deservedly both on my own account
and on that of the commonwealth, you seem to me to
be trusting your hopes too fondly. The moment somebody
behaves well you seem to set no bounds to your favours
