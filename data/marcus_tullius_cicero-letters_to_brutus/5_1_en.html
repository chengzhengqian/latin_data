<p>Here I have trouble enough on my hands with that
madman Servilius. I put up with him longer than suited my
dignity, but I did that for the public sake, not wishing to
give traitors a rallying point—a semi-lunatic, to be sure,
but a nobleman; though rally to him they do none the less.
Still I thought he had better not be estranged from the
national cause. Well, my patience with him is at an end. His
insolence reached the point that he treated everybody
else like slaves. He flared up in an incredible passion
over Plancus’ matter and battled with me for two days. I
quashed him so effectively that I hope he will mend his
manners once and for all. Just when this combat was at its
height, on 9 April, a letter was delivered to me in the Senate

and Syria. I read it out at once and Servilius, along
with several more (there are a number of prominent persons
who are thoroughly disloyal), collapsed. But Servilius
bitterly resented my gaining my point about Plancus. He is
a political monstrosity, but will not last long, take my word.</p>
