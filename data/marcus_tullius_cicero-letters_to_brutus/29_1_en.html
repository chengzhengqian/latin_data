<p>The fears of the rest of the world make me apprehensive
about M. Lepidus. If he tears himself away from us (I
hope the general suspicion that he will is hasty and unjust),
I beg and implore you, Cicero, in the name of our friendship
and your good will towards me, to forget that my sister’s
children are Lepidus’ sons and to regard me as having
replaced him as their father. If you grant so much, I am
sure there is nothing you will hesitate to do on their behalf.
Others may stand on different terms with their kith and
kin, but nothing I can do for my sister’s children can satisfy
my feelings or my duty. And what mark of favour can honest
men confer upon me (that is, if I am worthy of any
such), or how am I going to help my mother and my sister
and those children, if you and the rest of the Senate will not
let their uncle Brutus count against their father Lepidus?</p>
<p>Anxiety and vexation make it impossible for me to write
to you at length, nor do I have to. After all, if I need words
to rouse and strengthen you in a matter so important and
close to my heart, there is no hope of your doing what I ask
and what is right. So don’t expect a lengthy appeal. Just
look at <span class="italic">me.</span> You ought to grant me this both as a private individual,
my very close friend Cicero, and as the great
Consular you are, private connections apart. Please write
back as soon as you can and let me know your intention.</p>
<p>Kalends of July, from camp.</p>
