would he not give, if there were room for bargaining, in return
for our support for the power which I suppose will indeed

and be called Consulars? Caesar will have perished for

the survival of the avengers and suppressors of despotism.
Is not that a relapse into the same old darkness? Should I
wish to see a community, or think it worthy of the name,
that cannot take freedom when handed on a platter and
rammed down its throat, and has more fear of the name of
