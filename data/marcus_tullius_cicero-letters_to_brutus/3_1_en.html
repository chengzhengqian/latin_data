<p>Antonius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_211_1" id="target_note_LCL462_211_1"><sup>1</sup></a> is still with me, but upon my word I am
moved by his pleas and I am afraid that the fanaticism of
certain people may pick him off. I am really troubled. If I
knew what course you favoured I should not be worried,
for I should be satisfied that it was best. So please let me
know your opinion as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Our friend Cassius holds Syria and the Syrian legions.
He was called in by Murcus and Marcius and the army itself.
I have written to my sister Tertia<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_211_2" id="target_note_LCL462_211_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and my mother to
tell them not to make this splendid success of Cassius’ public
before consulting with you and before you think proper.</p>
<p>I have read your two speeches,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_211_3" id="target_note_LCL462_211_3"><sup>3</sup></a> the one you made on
the Kalends of January and the one concerning my dispatch
which you delivered against Calenus. You won’t be
waiting for me to praise them.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_211_4" id="target_note_LCL462_211_4"><sup>4</sup></a> I don’t know whether these
pieces say more for your spirit or for your genius. I am now
willing to let them be called by the proud name of ‘Philippics,’
<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_211_5" id="target_note_LCL462_211_5"><sup>5</sup></a> as you jestingly suggested in one of your letters.</p>
<p>My dear Cicero, I have now two needs: money and reinforcements.
The latter you can provide by arranging for
a contingent of troops to be sent to me from Italy either by
way of a secret understanding with Pansa or through action
in the Senate. The former is a necessity, as much for the
other armies as for mine, which makes me all the sorrier
that we have lost Asia. I hear that Dolabella’s oppression of
the province makes Trebonius’ murder no longer appear
