vigilance, patriotism; for these are what it is everybody’s
duty to render. But I conceive that something more is required
of one whose voice is heard among leading statesmen,
namely wisdom. And having presumed to take the
helm of state, I should hold myself no less to blame if any
counsel I gave the Senate were inexpedient than I should if
it were dishonest.</p>
<p>I know you receive full and accurate reports of events
both past and current. As coming from myself, I should
like you to be well aware that <span class="italic">my</span> mind is in the fighting
line. I am not looking over my shoulder, unless it so happen
that the interests of the community make me turn my
head; but the minds of the majority are looking back, to
you and Cassius. So, Brutus, I would have you adjust yourself
to the realization that it will be your duty either to improve
our body politic, should the present conflict go well,
or to restore it, should we meet with a reverse.</p>

<p>I am eagerly waiting for a letter from you written after
the news of my doings and of Trebonius’ death, not doubting
that you will set out your views for me. By a dastardly
crime we have lost a fine Roman and have been ousted
from a province, which is neither easy to regain nor will the
thing be the less shameful and outrageous if it <span class="italic">can</span> be
regained.</p>
