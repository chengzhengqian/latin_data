from which you, her liberator, were taking flight—something
which had happened to me too in the days gone by in
circumstances of similar peril and sadder fortune—I proceeded
none the less and returned to Rome. There, quite
unsupported, I shook Antony’s position and strengthened
the defence against his nefarious arms which Caesar’s
judgement and prestige had put in our way. If he remains
loyal and obeys me, I think we shall have means enough to
defend ourselves. But if the advice of miscreants carries
more weight with him than mine, or if the frailty of his
years proves unequal to the heavy burden of affairs, all
hope lies in you.</p>
<p>Therefore, I beg you, hurry here and free in the final
Issue<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_257_4" id="target_note_LCL462_257_4"><sup>4</sup></a> the commonwealth of which you are the liberator in
virtue of your courage and self-devotion rather than in the
actual event. Everyone will rally like one man to your side.
Write to Cassius and urge him to do the same. Hope of
liberty lies nowhere but in your and his headquarters. To
be sure, we have strong armies and generals in the west.
For my part, I still think that we can rely on this young
man, but so many folk are pushing him the wrong way that
I am sometimes afraid of his changing his position.</p>
<p>I have given you a complete picture of the state of the
commonwealth, such as it is at the time of dispatching this
letter. I hope for better things in the future. If it turns out
otherwise (which heaven forfend!), I shall grieve for the
commonwealth, which ought to be everlasting. For myself,
how little time remains!</p>
