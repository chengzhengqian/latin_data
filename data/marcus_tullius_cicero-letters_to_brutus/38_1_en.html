deter the criminals among us by terror from attacking our
country in the present and to leave an object lesson for the
future, so that none shall be minded to imitate such madness.
To be sure this proposal was no more mine than

penalty to innocent children. But that is an ancient rule,
found in all communities. Even Themistocles’ children

which mean a great deal to me, than of my own
