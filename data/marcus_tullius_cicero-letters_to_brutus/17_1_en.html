too good to take offence at a warning, especially where the
common welfare is at stake. But you will do as you think

<p>* * * Now, Cicero, now is the time to act so that our joy
over Antonyâ€™s collapse does not turn out an illusion and so
that care to excise one evil does not always generate a new
and worse one. If anything untoward happens now, to our
surprise or with our tolerance, we shall all be to blame, but
you more than any; for the Senate and People of Rome not
only allows but desires you to exercise an authority as great
as can belong to any one man in a free community. You
should live up to that not only by thinking legally but by
acting wisely. Moreover, the only form of wisdom (of which
you have enough and to spare) felt to be lacking on your
part is restraint in bestowing honours. All else you have in
such ample measure that your qualities can be compared
with any of the great men of history. This one thing only,
which comes from a grateful and generous heart, people
criticize (?): they would like to see your generosity tempered
by caution and moderation. The Senate ought not to
grant any man a favour which might serve as a precedent
or a support to evil-designing persons. Accordingly, I am
alarmed about the Consulship. I fear your young friend
Caesar may think he has climbed so high through your decrees
