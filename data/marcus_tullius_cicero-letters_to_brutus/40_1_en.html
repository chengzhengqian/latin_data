in the greatest distress because it hardly looks as though I
can make good my promises in respect of the young man,
boy almost, for whom I went bail to the commonwealth.
Responsibility for someone elseâ€™s mind and sentiment, especially
in matters of great importance, is more burdensome
and difficult than the pecuniary kind. That can be
discharged and the loss of money can be borne. But how is
one to discharge a pledge to the commonwealth if the person
for whom one has made it is quite happy to leave his
backer to pay? However, I hope I shall still hold him,
though many people are pulling the other way. The natural
quality seems to be there, but it is an impressionable age
and there are plenty of would-be agents of corruption.
They are confident of dazzling his good disposition by dangling
in front of him the glitter of a false distinction. So this
care is added to my load. I must move every engine at my
disposal to hold the young man, or else be judged guilty of
indiscretion. And yet, where is the indiscretion? I bound
the one on whose behalf I gave the pledge rather than myself.
The commonwealth has no reason to find fault with
that pledge. Its subject shone in public action from natural
disposition and was the steadier because of my promise.</p>
<p>However, unless I am perhaps mistaken, our knottiest
political problem is shortage of money. The honest men
become more obdurate every day at the mention of a special
levy. The proceeds of the 1%,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_287_1" id="target_note_LCL462_287_1"><sup>1</sup></a> thanks to the scandalously
low returns put in by the wealthy folk, are entirely
absorbed in the bounties of the two legions. Yet limitless
expenses hang over us both for the armies which are now
defending us and for yours. As for our friend Cassius, it
looks as though he will be able to arrive tolerably well
