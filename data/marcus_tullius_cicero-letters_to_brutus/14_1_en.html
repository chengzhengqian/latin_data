<p>In a debate of 27 April on military operations against
those who have been declared public enemies, Servilius
made a speech mostly about Ventidius, but he also moved
that Cassius should take action against Dolabella. I concurred,
and proposed in addition that you should take military
action against Dolabella if you thought it expedient
and in the public interest; but that, if you could not do so
with benefit to the commonwealth or did not think it in the
public interest, you should keep your army where it now is.
The Senate could not pay you a greater compliment than
to let you decide for yourself what course you judge most
advantageous to the commonwealth. My personal feeling
is that if Dolabella has a following, a camp, anywhere to
make a stand, you should move against him as a matter of
loyalty and prestige. We know nothing about our friend
Cassiusâ€™ forces. No letters have arrived from him nor have
we any report on which we can firmly rely. I am sure you
appreciate how important it is that Dolabella should be
crushed, so that he pay for his crime and so that the traitor
chiefs in flight from Mutina do not have a rallying point.
You may remember from my previous letters that I held
this view at an earlier stage, although at that time your
camp was our harbour of refuge and your army our vital
reserve. Now that our dangers are, as I hope, safely over,
we ought to be all the more concerned about crushing
Dolabella. But you will give careful thought to all this and
come to a wise conclusion and if you see fit, please let us
know what you have decided and what you are doing.</p>
