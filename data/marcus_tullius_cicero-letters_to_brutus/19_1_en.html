Heraclea. When I see him, since you leave it in our hands,
we shall take counsel together about his returning to stand
for election or about recommending him for the office.</p>
<p>I very particularly recommend to you Pansa’s doctor,
Glyco, who is married to my friend Achilleus’ sister. We
hear that Torquatus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_243_1" id="target_note_LCL462_243_1"><sup>1</sup></a> suspects him in connection with
Pansa’s death and that he is being kept in custody as a murderer.
That is quite incredible. Pansa’s death hit nobody
harder. Besides he is a well-conducted, decent fellow, who
would not seem likely to have been driven to crime even by
self-interest. I beg you, and very earnestly (for my friend
Achilleus is no less disturbed about it than he should be),
to get him out of custody and keep him safe. I regard this as
a matter of private obligation for me, of importance equal
to any other.</p>
<p>As I was writing you these lines, a letter was delivered
to me from C. Trebonius’ Legate Satrius giving the news
that Dolabella has been cut to pieces and put to flight by
Tillius and Deiotarus. I am sending you a letter in Greek
from a certain Cicereius, sent to Satrius.</p>
<p>Our friend Flavius has chosen you as arbiter in the dispute
he has about an inheritance with the township of
Dyrrachium. I beg you, Cicero, and so does Flavius, to
settle the matter. There is no question but that the town
owed money to the person who made Flavius his heir. The
townspeople don’t deny it, but say that Caesar made them
a present of the debt. Don’t let a wrong be done to my
friend by your friends.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_243_2" id="target_note_LCL462_243_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
