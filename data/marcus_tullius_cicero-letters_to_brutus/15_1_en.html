<p>I should like our Marcus to be coopted into your College.
<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_235_1" id="target_note_LCL462_235_1"><sup>1</sup></a> I think that candidates at elections to priesthoods
can be admitted <span class="italic">in absentia.</span> It has been done before. C.
Marius was elected Augur under the lex Domitia when he
was in Cappadocia, and no later law has made this any the
less permissible in the future. Also the lex Julia, the most
recent law on priesthoods, reads as follows: ‘Whosoever
shall stand or whose candidature shall be admitted.’ That
clearly implies that the candidature of one not personally
standing is admissible. I have written to him on this subject
telling him to abide by your judgement, as in all matters.
And you must decide about Domitius and our young friend
Cato.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_235_2" id="target_note_LCL462_235_2"><sup>2</sup></a> However, even though candidature <span class="italic">in absentia</span> is allowable,
everything is easier for those on the spot. But if
you decide that you ought to go to Asia, there will be no
chance of fetching our young men back for the elections.
To be sure, I thought everything would go more quickly
with Pansa alive. He would have had his new colleague
elected at once, and then the elections for the priesthoods
would have been held before the praetorian elections.
Now I expect a long delay because of the auspices, since so
long as we have a single patrician magistrate the auspices
cannot revert to the patriciate.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_235_3" id="target_note_LCL462_235_3"><sup>3</sup></a> It is certainly a very confused
situation. I hope you will inform me of your views on
the whole matter.</p>
