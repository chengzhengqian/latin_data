<p>I have recommended many persons to you, and needs
must. For our best men and citizens are most eager for
your good opinion and all gallant spirits want to give you
enthusiastic service. Nor is there a man who does not believe
that my authority and influence counts for a great
deal with you. But I recommend to you nobody more earnestly
than C. Nasennius, a townsman of Suessa. He was
First Centurion of the eighth cohort in the Cretan War<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_249_1" id="target_note_LCL462_249_1"><sup>1</sup></a>
under General Metellus. Thereafter he has been busy with
his private affairs, but is now moved by loyalty to the patriotic
side and your outstanding prestige to wish to take
some position of authority by your appointment. I commend
him to you, Brutus, as a brave gentleman, a man of
worth and (if that is at all relevant) of wealth too. You will
greatly oblige me if you handle him so that he can thank me
on account of what you do for his benefit.</p>
