the People of Rome that no public enemies ever deserved
the harshest penalties more than those Romans who have
taken up arms against their country in this war. In all my
speeches I punish and harry them with the approval of all
honest men. Your view on the matter is for you to determine.
Mine is that the three brothers are in one and the
same boat.</p>

<p>We have lost two good Consuls—but ‘good’ is as much
as one can say. Hirtius fell in the moment of victory after
winning a great battle a few days earlier. Pansa had fled after
receiving wounds which were too much for him. Brutus
and Caesar are in pursuit of the remnant of the enemy.
And all those who have followed Mark Antony’s lead have
been pronounced public enemies. Most people interpret
that decree of the Senate as applying to those whom you
have captured or whose surrender you have accepted. For
my part I used no harsh language in making a proposal
about C. Antonius by name, having made up my mind that
the Senate should learn of his case from yourself.</p>
