that you had not written to your own people as you usually
do. He drew the conclusion that the letter was forged, and,
if you wish to know, the House agreed with him.</p>
<p>Now, Brutus, it is for you to judge of the whole character
of the war. Clearly lenience is to your liking and you
think it is the most rewarding policy. Admirable! But the
place for clemency is apt to be found, and ought to be
found, in other matters and circumstances. In the present
situation what is to be done, my friend? The hopes of
needy desperados hang over the temples of the immortal
gods. What is at issue in this war is our existence; no more,
no less. Whom are we sparing? What are we about? Are we
concerned for men who, if they win the day, will wipe us
out without a trace? For what difference is there between
Dolabella and any one of the three Antonii? If we spare
any of them, we have been too hard on Dolabella.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_225_3" id="target_note_LCL462_225_3"><sup>3</sup></a> That
this is the sentiment of the Senate and People of Rome
comes from the logic of the situation, but also in large measure
from my advice and influence. If you do not approve
of this attitude, I shall defend your view, but I shall not relinquish
my own. Men expect from you neither laxity nor
cruelty. It is easy to strike a balance; you need only be
strong with the leaders and generous to the rank and file.</p>
<p>I hope you will keep my son at your side as much as possible,
my dear Brutus. He will find no better training in
manly excellence than by watching and imitating you.</p>
<p>14 (?) April.</p>
