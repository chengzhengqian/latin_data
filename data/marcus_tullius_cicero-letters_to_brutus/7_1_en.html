<p>You say you wrote to your sister Tertia and your mother
telling them not to make Cassius’ successes public before I
thought proper. Evidently you were afraid, and with good
reason, that Caesar’s party, as it is still called, would be
much upset by the news. But the matter was common
knowledge before we got your letter. Even your own couriers

credit him, I am naturally no less glad than I ought to be.
And if your affection for him makes you exaggerate, the
very fact of your caring for him makes me exceedingly
happy.</p>

need for me to tell you my views about the nature of this
war, how I judge and what I advise.</p>
<p>My general political aims have always been identical
with yours, my dear Brutus; my policy in certain matters
