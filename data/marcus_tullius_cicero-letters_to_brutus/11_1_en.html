<p>* * * I am delighted that you find the army and the
cavalry so loyally disposed towards you. If you get any news
of Dolabella, you will inform me, as you say. I am glad that
I had the forethought to leave you free to decide about
making war on him. That was important for the commonwealth,
as I recognized at the time, and I now consider that
it was important for your prestige.</p>
<p>You say that I * * *<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_227_1" id="target_note_LCL462_227_1"><sup>1</sup></a> to attack the Antonii and commend
the same. I don’t doubt that you think so. But I am far from
approving the distinction you draw when you say that
we should be keener to prevent civil wars than to wreak
vengeance on the defeated. I strongly disagree with you,
Brutus. I consider myself as merciful a man as you, but
salutary severity is better than the hollow appearance of
mercy. If we want to be merciful, we shall never be without
a civil war. However, that is your problem. I can say of myself
what Plautus’ father says in <span class="italic">Song of Sixpence</span>: ‘My time
is nearly over. You’re the party most concerned.’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_227_2" id="target_note_LCL462_227_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Believe
me, Brutus, you and your friends will be overwhelmed if
you do not take care. You will not always have a people and
a Senate and a leader of the Senate as they are today. You
may take this as a Delphic oracle. Nothing can be more true.</p>
<p>20(?) April.</p>
