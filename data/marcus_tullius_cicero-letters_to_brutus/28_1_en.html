already too much. We are waiting for you and your army.
Without that it looks as though we shall hardly be sufficiently
free, even though everything else goes as we wish.
I shall be writing more on the whole situation in the letter
which I intend to give to our friend Vetus and shall then
perhaps have more solid news.</p>

<p>How dear L. Bibulus should be to me nobody can judge
better than you, who have been through so much struggle
and care for our country’s sake. His own qualities and our
connection ought to make you his friend. So I do not think
I need write at length. My wish ought to weigh with you,
provided it be legitimate and in pursuance of a necessary
obligation. He has decided to stand for Pansa’s vacancy.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_261_1" id="target_note_LCL462_261_1"><sup>1</sup></a>
You cannot do a favour to anyone closer to you than I am,
nor can you nominate a worthier candidate than Bibulus.</p>
<p>As for Domitius and Appuleius,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_261_2" id="target_note_LCL462_261_2"><sup>2</sup></a> it is superfluous for me
to write when they are so strongly commended to you by
their own persons. But you do have a duty to put your prestige
behind Appuleius. However, he shall have a letter to
himself to sing his praises. As for Bibulus, don’t let him out
of your care. He is already a fine fellow and, believe me, he
can develop into one on whom the praises of us his backers
will be fitly bestowed.</p>
