even count as a free man. And yet that is the goal and purpose,
that is the result which our excellent friend impatiently
pursues—for Octavius to be gracious to him! For
myself, I no longer allow any value to those arts<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_305_6" id="target_note_LCL462_305_6"><sup>6</sup></a> in which
I know Cicero is so well versed. What do they do for him,
all his copious writings in defence of national freedom,
on dignity, on death, banishment, and poverty? Philippus
seems to have a much better grasp of these subjects. He
has been less ready to make concessions to his stepson<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_305_7a" id="target_note_LCL462_305_7a"><sup>7</sup></a>
than Cicero who makes them to a stranger. So let him stop
his boasting which is an aggravation of our distresses. For
what is it to us that Antony has been defeated, if he was defeated
for somebody else to step into his shoes?—though
your letter suggests some uncertainty even now.</p>
<p>By all means let Cicero live, since he can live so, as a
helpless petitioner, if his age and honours and past
achievements don’t put him to shame! No slavery will be so
comfortable that <span class="italic">I</span> shall be turned away from waging war
against the thing itself, that is to say against monarchy,
and extraordinary commands, and despotism, and power
which sets itself above the laws—however good a man, as
he writes, Octavius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_305_8" id="target_note_LCL462_305_8"><sup>8</sup></a> may be, though I have never thought
so. But our forebears were not willing that even a parent
should be a master.</p>
<p>If my affection for you were not as great as Cicero believes
Octavius’ regard for himself I should not have written
to you in this strain. I am sorry that you are now vexed,
