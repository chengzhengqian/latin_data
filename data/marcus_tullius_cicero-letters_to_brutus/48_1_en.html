have been stimulated rather than checked by Cicero; and
that he goes so far in this indulgence as not to refrain from
offensive expressions which recoil upon himself in two
ways. For he took more than one life, and he must confess
himself an assassin before he says what he says against
Casca (in Casca’s case imitating Bestia in his own).<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_301_2" id="target_note_LCL462_301_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Because
