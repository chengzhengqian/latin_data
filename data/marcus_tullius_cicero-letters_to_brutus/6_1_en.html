but are leaving directly, I am scribbling these few words in
the hubbub of my morning levee.</p>
<p>I am happy about Cassius and congratulate the commonwealth,
and myself too in that against Pansa’s angry
opposition I proposed that Cassius should take military action
against Dolabella. Indeed I ventured to maintain that
he was already engaged in such action without any decree
of ours. I also said what I thought proper about yourself.
The speech<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_217_1" id="target_note_LCL462_217_1"><sup>1</sup></a> will be sent to you, since I see you enjoy my
Philippics.</p>
<p>With regard to your question about Antonius, I think he
should be held in custody until we know what happens to
Brutus. From the letter you have sent me it seems that
Dolabella is oppressing Asia and behaving there abominably.
Now you have written to several people that Dolabella
was refused admission by the Rhodians. If he has
approached Rhodes, then I suppose he has left Asia. If that
is so, I would advise you to remain where you are, but if he
has got possession of Asia I would advise you to pursue him
there. I do not think you can do better at this time.</p>
<p>You say you are in want of two necessities, reinforcements
and money. It is hard to make any suggestion. No
financial resources occur to me as available for your use
other than those which the Senate has decreed, namely
that you should borrow sums from civic bodies. As to reinforcements,
I do not see what can be done. So far from
Pansa assigning you anything from his own army or levies
he is not happy that so many volunteers are joining you,
because, as I for my part suppose, he thinks that no forces
are too large for the issues which are being determined in
Italy—but as many suspect, because he does not want even
you to be too strong. <span class="italic">I</span> have no such suspicion.</p>
