<p>I should do you the same office as you did for me in my
bereavement and write you a letter of consolation if I did
not know that you have no need in your grief of the remedies
with which you alleviated mine.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_259_1" id="target_note_LCL462_259_1"><sup>1</sup></a> And I hope you find
healing now in your own case easier than you found it in
mine. It is not like so great a man as you to be unable to
do the very thing he recommended to another. The arguments

you are accustomed to use. And so, esteeming your judgement
highly and in awe of it, I pulled myself together and

suffered a blow (the like of what you have lost was nowhere
on earth) and you must grieve in so heavy a calamity. To
lack all sense of grief might be more pitiable than grief itself.
But moderation in grief, which is expedient for other
men, is for you a necessity.</p>
<p>I should write more but that as written to <span class="italic">you</span> this is
