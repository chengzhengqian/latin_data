weight? If they have not been delivered to you, I think your
letters from home have not been reaching you either. You
say you will give Marcus a longer letter. Right, but this one
too should have been fuller. Now when you wrote to me
about Marcus’ leaving you I immediately pushed out couriers
and a letter to Marcus telling him to rejoin you even if
he had already returned to Italy. No other course is more
agreeable to me or more honourable to him. To be sure, I
had written to him more than once that by dint of a great
effort on my part, the elections to priesthoods were put off
till next year. I exerted myself to bring that about both for
Marcus’ sake and for that of Domitius, Cato, Lentulus, the
Bibuli,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_269_1" id="target_note_LCL462_269_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and others. I wrote the same to you, but apparently
you had not yet heard of it when you dispatched that tiny
letter to me.</p>
<p>So I ask you with all urgency, my dear Brutus, not to
send my son Marcus away but to bring him back with you.
And this latter you should do any day now if you have any
thought for the commonwealth which you were bred to
serve. For the war is reborn through Lepidus’ criminal behaviour,
and no small war either. Caesar’s army, which used
to be excellent, is not only no help but forces us to ask urgently
for <span class="italic">your</span> army. Once the latter touches Italian soil,
every Roman who can in conscience be so called will betake
himself to your camp. True, we have Brutus in fine
combination with Plancus. But you well know how uncertain
are the minds of men, tainted with party spirit, and
the results of battles. Even if we win, as I hope we shall,
the guidance of your counsel and prestige will be greatly
