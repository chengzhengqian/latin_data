<p>Your son Cicero earns my approval by his energy, endurance,
hard work, and unselfish spirit, in fact by every
kind of service. Indeed he seems never to forget whose son
he is. I cannot make you think more of one whom you so
deeply love than you already do, but trust my judgement in
assuring yourself that he will have no need to exploit your
renown in order to attain his father’s honours.</p>

<p>From Plancus’ dispatch,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_213_1" id="target_note_LCL462_213_1"><sup>1</sup></a> of which I think you have
been sent a copy, you will have been able to perceive his
fine spirit of patriotism as well as the legions, auxiliaries,
and resources at his disposal. On the other hand I suppose
that letters from your own circle will already have made
evident to you the irresponsibility, fickleness, and consistently
unpatriotic attitude of your connection Lepidus,

than his brother.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_213_2" id="target_note_LCL462_213_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>We are anxiously waiting for news &lt;from Mutina&gt;,
where the whole situation is at ultimate crisis point. All
hope lies in relieving Brutus.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_213_3" id="target_note_LCL462_213_3"><sup>3</sup></a>We are in grave fear for him.</p>
