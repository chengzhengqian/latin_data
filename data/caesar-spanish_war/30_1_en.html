They proceeded, in fact, to exert strong pressure on the enemy, driving him back from his positions, with the result that he began to transfer a legion from his right, to give support and to prevent our men from outflanking him. As soon as this legion had been set in motion Caesar’s cavalry began to exert pressure on the enemy left wing,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL402_369_1" id="target_note_LCL402_369_1"><sup>1</sup></a> so that, no matter how gallantly the enemy might fight, he was afforded no opportunity of reinforcing his line.
