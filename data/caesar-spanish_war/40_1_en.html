Yet both in the present war and in the period before it he was well aware that they had been unmindful of all these advantages, and ungrateful for them, both towards himself and towards the Roman people. ‘You,’ he went on, ‘who are well acquainted with the law of nations and the established usages of Roman citizens, have none the less behaved like savages and have laid violent hands more often than once upon the inviolable magistrates of the Roman people, and designed the dastardly murder of Cassius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL402_389_2" id="target_note_LCL402_389_2"><sup>2</sup></a> in broad daylight in the middle of the forum. You have always so hated peace that this province has never ceased to be occupied by the legions of the Roman people. With you good deeds count as misdeeds, and vice versa.

By their glorious deeds of valour . . .’</p>
