of Caesar’s arrival, envoys left this town unbeknown to Cn. Pompeius’ outposts, came to Caesar, and proceeded to entreat him to send them help at the earliest opportunity. Caesar, who was aware that the township in question had always deserved well of the Roman people, promptly gave orders that six infantry cohorts and a corresponding number of cavalry should set out at the second watch; and in command of them he put L. Vibius Paciaecus, a well-known
member of that province, and one that knew it pretty well.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL402_315_1" id="target_note_LCL402_315_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Now it so chanced that at the very time he came to Cn. Pompeius’ outposts he was beset by bad weather and a violent gale. So severe was the storm and so dark did it make the approaches to the town that they could scarcely recognise their next-door neighbours. To them indeed this drawback proved of the utmost advantage. And so, when they had got thus far, he bade the horsemen go up in file,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL402_315_2a" id="target_note_LCL402_315_2a"><sup>2</sup></a> and they pushed rapidly forward to the town straight through their opponent’s positions. When they were in the middle of their positions someone asked who they were; and one of our men told the questioner to hold his tongue: ‘just at the moment they were trying to come up to the wall so as to capture the town.’ It was in fact partly the disconcerting effect of this reply, partly the difficulties of the storm, which prevented the sentries from displaying proper attention to their duties.

The subsequent rapid advance, as well as the mention of the cavalry’s being numerically equal to the infantry, tends, I rather think, to support this interpretation. It would, however, fit much better in the next chapter, where the infantry undoubtedly took to the horses for a time. Perhaps the author was confused about the details of the two sorties, and attributed somewhat allusively to both the tactics which properly belonged only to one.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL402_315_2a').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
