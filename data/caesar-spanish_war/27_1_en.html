he had previously sent a despatch to the citizens of Ursao, who were supporters of his, saying that Caesar was unwilling to come down into the valley because the greater part of his army was inexperienced. This despatch stiffened the morale of the townsfolk considerably. Pompeius therefore, relying on this conviction,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL402_363_1a" id="target_note_LCL402_363_1a"><sup>1</sup></a> supposed that he could carry the whole thing off; for where he had established his camp he was protected not only by the natural conformation of the ground but also by the fortifications of the town itself. For, as we have pointed out earlier,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL402_363_2" id="target_note_LCL402_363_2"><sup>2</sup></a> it is lofty country, bastioned by hills with an occasional intervening plain; and this, it so happened, was the case on the present occasion.</p>

But would their increased confidence by itself lead Pompey to think he could carry the whole thing, off? It seems to me more likely that what the author really meant was this: “The reason why Pompey had led his forces out was that Caesar—so he had told the men of Ursao in a despatch, which considerably encouraged them—was
