<p><span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">15</span><span class="br"></span>With nearly all armies what normally happens in a cavalry battle is this: when a cavalryman is once dismounted and closes in with an infantryman to engage him, he is not by any means regarded as a match for the latter. However, it turned out quite otherwise in this battle. When picked light-armed infantry took our cavalry by surprise by coming forward to engage them, and when this manoeuvre was observed in the course of the fighting, quite a number of our horsemen dismounted. As a result, in a short time our cavalry began to fight an infantry action, to such good purpose that they dealt death right up close to the rampart. In this battle<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL402_335_2a" id="target_note_LCL402_335_2a"><sup>2</sup></a> on our opponents’ side there fell one hundred and twenty-three
men; and of those who were driven back to their camp not a few had been stripped of their arms and many were wounded. On our side there fell three men: twelve infantrymen and five horsemen were wounded. Later on that day the old routine

resulting, apparently, from the outpost skirmish described in ch. 14 above. It would seem that the figures are grossly distorted if only three Caesarians were killed out of several squadrons and some light-armed troops overrun by the enemy cavalry! (<span class="italic">cf.</span> Introduction, p. 306, and, for official suppression of casualty figures, ch. 18.) But I rather suspect that cavalry reinforcements were despatched by Caesar and fought a second, and more evenly-matched action closer to Pompey’s camp; and that brief details of this were originally given towards the end of ch. 14. If it is to this second action that the casualty figures relate, then it is not surprising that the Pompeians refused a third challenge on ground favourable to Caesar.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL402_335_2a').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
