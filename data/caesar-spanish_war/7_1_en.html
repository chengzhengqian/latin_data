Salsum—in such a way, however, that the river is nearest Ategua, the distance being about two miles.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL402_323_1" id="target_note_LCL402_323_1"><sup>1</sup></a> It was in this direction, namely that of Ategua, that Pompeius had his camp pitched in the mountains in sight of both towns, without, however, venturing to come to the aid of his comrades. He had the eagles and standards of thirteen legions; but among those which he thought afforded him any solid support two were native legions, having deserted from Trebonius; a third had been raised from the local Roman settlers; a fourth was one which was once commanded by Afranius and which Pompeius had brought with him from Africa<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL402_323_2a" id="target_note_LCL402_323_2a"><sup>2</sup></a>; while the rest were made up of runaways or auxiliaries. As for light-armed units and cavalry, our troops were in fact far superior both in quality and quantity.</p>

The only Pompeian legions definitely named in the narrative are:—the First (ch. 18); the Second (ch. 13); and the Thirteenth (ch. 34). From <span class="italic">Bell. Alex.</span> chs. 50–54 it is clear that Cassius, whom Trebonius succeeded as governor of Further Spain, had five legions: the Twenty-first and the Thirtieth (raised in Italy); the Second (long quartered in Spain); the ‘native legion’ (always thus named); and the Fifth (newly raised in Spain by Cassius himself). Of these the Second, Fifth and the native legion joined the mutiny against Cassius, and shewed Pom- peian sympathies; for which reason it would not seem surprising if they were opposing Caesar now. Holmes was satisfied that the other of the two native legions here mentioned was the Fifth; but he assumed, without accounting for the reference in ch. 13, that the Second had now joined Caesar. Klotz, on the other hand, asserting that there was never more than one native legion in Spain, adopts Mommsen’s emendation and reads <span class="italic">vernacula e&lt;t secunda&gt;.</span> This drastic course seems indeed the only method of including the Second; and the Fifth might well be the one described as ‘raised from the local Roman settlers’. But the whole problem is obscure.
