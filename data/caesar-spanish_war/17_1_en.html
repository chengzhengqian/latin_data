One man, according to this account, retorted that they should rather go into battle than display the signal for retreat; whereupon the author of this remark had his throat cut. At the same time some of Pompeius’ couriers were arrested on their way to the town. Caesar presented their despatches<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL402_343_2" id="target_note_LCL402_343_2"><sup>2</sup></a> to the townsfolk and directed that any of the couriers who wanted his life to be spared must set fire to a wooden tower belonging to the townsfolk, undertaking to grant him complete amnesty if he did so. But it was a difficult task for anyone to set fire to that tower without risking disaster; thus when any of them came close up to it, his legs were tied with a rope and he was killed by the townsfolk.

For no likely explanation occurs to me why the slave should have sent such a message to Caesar from Pompey’s camp. Whether it was his master or his mistress he killed (in ch. 20 most MSS. read <span class="italic">dominum</span>), and whether he was loyal to Caesar or to Pompey, it seems impossible
to account consistently for his actions and subsequent fate.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL402_343_1').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL402_343_2"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL402_343_2" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">2</sup>Klotz believes that these despatches notified the commandant of Ategua that Pompey was withdrawing.
