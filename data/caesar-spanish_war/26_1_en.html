Varus had been in command of the fortified zone. On that day Pompeius moved his camp and established it in an olive grove over against Spalis. Before Caesar set out for the same locality, the moon was observed at approximately the sixth hour. As Pompeius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL402_361_1" id="target_note_LCL402_361_1"><sup>1</sup></a> had thus withdrawn his camp, he accordingly instructed his garrison force which he had left behind to set fire to Ucubi, so that, when the town was burned out, they should retire to his principal camp. Later on Caesar proceeded to assault the town of Ventipo; and when it capitulated he marched to Carruca,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL402_361_2a" id="target_note_LCL402_361_2a"><sup>2</sup></a> and pitched camp over against Pompeius. Pompeius burned the town<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL402_361_3" id="target_note_LCL402_361_3"><sup>3</sup></a> for having barred its gates to his forces; and a soldier who had murdered his own brother in camp was intercepted by our troops and clubbed to death. From this area Caesar marched into the plain of Munda,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL402_361_4" id="target_note_LCL402_361_4"><sup>4</sup></a> and on his arrival there established his camp over against Pompeius.</p>

On receipt of this news Caesar displayed the flag-signal for action. Now the reason why Pompeius had led out his forces was this:
