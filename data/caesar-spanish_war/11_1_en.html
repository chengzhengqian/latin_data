It was on that day that A. Valgius—his father was a senator and his brother was in Pompeius’ camp—left all his kit behind, mounted his horse and deserted. A spy from the Second legion, on Pompeius’ side,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL402_331_1" id="target_note_LCL402_331_1"><sup>1</sup></a> was captured by our troops and put to death; and at the same time a sling-bullet was discharged which bore the following inscription: ‘On the day you advance to capture the town I shall lay down my shield.’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL402_331_2" id="target_note_LCL402_331_2"><sup>2</sup></a> This raised hopes in some of our men, who, feeling confident that they could now climb the wall and gain possession of the town without danger, proceeded on the next day to construct a field-work adjoining the wall; and having demolished a good large section of the first wall, . . .

Klotz regards the addition of Pompeiana as ‘remarkable, since Caesar did not have a Second legion.’ It is true that in the narrative there is no mention of the Second as fighting on Caesar’s side. But neither is there any mention of the Twenty-first, Twenty-eighth,
or Thirtieth, all of which may well have participated. I am inclined to think that <span class="italic">Pompeiana</span> is no accidental addition, but that it signified clearly one of two things: either that there were two Second legions (just as there were apparently two Fifth legions), and that this was not Caesar’s Second; <span class="italic">or</span>, if there was but one Second legion, that now, after months of wavering loyalty, it was on Pompey’s side. To the author’s contemporaries it was doubtless perfectly clear which was the meaning intended.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL402_331_1').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL402_331_2"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL402_331_2" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">2</sup>Some editors render ‘display a shield as a signal’; but the undertaking to offer no armed resistance seems to me to suit the context better.
