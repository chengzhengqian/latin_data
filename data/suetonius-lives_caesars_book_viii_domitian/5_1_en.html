<p>He also established a quinquennial contest in honour of Jupiter Capitolinus of a threefold character, comprising music, riding, and gymnastics, and with considerably more prizes than are awarded nowadays. For there were competitions in prose declamation<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL038_332_97" id="target_note_LCL038_332_97"><sup>97</sup></a> both in Greek and in Latin; and in addition to those of the lyre-players, between choruses of such players and in the lyre alone, without singing; while in the stadium there were races even between maidens. He presided at the competitions in half-boots, clad in a purple toga in the Greek fashion, and wearing upon his head a golden crown with figures of Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva, while by his side sat the priest of Jupiter and the college of the Flaviales,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL038_332_98" id="target_note_LCL038_332_98"><sup>98</sup></a> similarly dressed, except that their crowns bore his image as well. He celebrated the Quinquatria<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL038_332_99" id="target_note_LCL038_332_99"><sup>99</sup></a> too every year in honour of Minerva at his Alban villa, and established for her a college of priests, from which men were chosen by lot to act as officers and give splendid shows of wild beasts and stage plays, besides holding contests in oratory and poetry.</p>
<p>He made a present to the people of three hundred sesterces each on three occasions, and in the course of one of his shows in celebration of the feast of the Seven Hills gave a plentiful banquet,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL038_332_100" id="target_note_LCL038_332_100"><sup>100</sup></a> distributing large baskets of victuals to the senate and knights, and smaller ones to the commons; and he himself was the first to begin to eat. On the following day he scattered gifts of all sorts of things<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL038_332_101" id="target_note_LCL038_332_101"><sup>101</sup></a> to be scrambled for, and since the greater part of these fell where the people sat, he had five hundred tickets thrown into each section occupied by the senatorial and equestrian orders.</p>
