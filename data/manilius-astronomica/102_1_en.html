Nowhere does year bear resemblance to year or month to month; the very day, ever different, looks in vain for the replica of itself, and no hour’s space is fully run in the likeness of another, because the periods are mutually at variance, being, inasmuch as they are divided into all the sections of fleeting time, subject to their own special signs, and hence bring it about that the lives and fortunes of the living are a reflection of the stars, by whose changes we ourselves then change.</p>
