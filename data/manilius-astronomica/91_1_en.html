</a> sign, which leads the rest, appropriates in rising forty stades, and twice as many when it sets; in ascension it occupies an hour and a third and doubles this at its descension. Then do the other signs in rising upon earth increase by eight stades each and as many lose when they sink into the chill darkness. Through each single sign the hour of ascension has an additional increase of a quarter, to which is added the third part of its fifth part.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL469_185_c" id="target_note_LCL469_185_c">

</a> These are the increments of the rising signs as far as the constellation of the Balance: decreases of like amount are subtracted, when the signs pass beneath the earth. And again from the constellation of the Balance the signs return with similar gradations, but backwards and through a reverse order of times. For in as many stades and hours the Ram’s sign had risen, in so many does the Balance set; and the space and period of descension occupied by the Ram in setting are preserved by the Balance at its rising. The remaining signs succeed each other in an inverse progression. When this has been understood and stored in an alert mind, it is
