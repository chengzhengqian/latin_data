There are also shooting stars, which hurl long trails of slender fire and are seen flying everywhere, when wandering lights flash through the clear sky, and dart afar like winged arrows, tracing the slender line of a path on high. Indeed, fire is found mingled with every part of the universe; it dwells in the laden clouds and forges lightning, it makes its way into the earth and threatens heaven with the flames of Etna, it causes waters to boil at their very sources, and finds a habitation in hard flint and in verdant bark, when trees dashed against trees are set aflame; to such an extent does all nature abound with fire. So wonder not that torches suddenly burst forth from the skies; and that the air is kindled and shines with flickering flames after embracing the dry seeds exhaled by the earth, seeds which the swift fire, as it feeds, both pursues and shuns, for you see the lightning hurl its quivering flash from the midst of a rainstorm and the heavens rent with the thunderbolt. Possibly it is the principle of earth supplying seed for fleet fire which has given birth to comets; or perhaps in those torches nature has created dim stars that shine in heaven with meagre flames, but the Sun with its consuming heat attracts the blazing comets to itself, absorbs them in its own fire, and then releases them: just so do
