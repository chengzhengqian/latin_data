confine in spacious prisons seals which deem themselves as safe as in the open sea and shackle them fast in fetters; the unwary tunny they will draw along in a network of meshes. And their capture is not the end: the fish struggle against their bonds, meet a new assault, and suffer death by the knife; and the sea is dyed, mixed with blood of its own. Furthermore, when the victims lie dead along the shore, a second slaughter is perpetrated on the first; the fish are torn into pieces, and a single body is divided to serve separate ends. One part is better if its juices are given up, another if they are retained. In the one case a valuable fluid is discharged, which yields the choicest part of the blood: flavoured with salt, it imparts a relish to the palate.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL469_355_a" id="target_note_LCL469_355_a">

</a> Moreover, such men will be able to fill great salt-pans, to evaporate the sea, and to extract the seaâ€™s venom: they prepare a wide expanse of hardened ground and surround it with firm walls, next conduct therein waters channelled from the nearby sea and then deny them exit by closing sluice-gates: so the floor holds in the waves and begins to glisten as the water is drained off by
