darkness into uniform hours, you ascertain the duration of daylight and darkness at different seasons of the year, and first create a fixed standard by accurately calculating an hour which with increase here and decrease there holds day and night evenly balanced. Such an hour will be found when the nights are about to prevail over daylight in Libra or yield to it in mid-spring.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL469_183_a" id="target_note_LCL469_183_a">

</a> For then and then only do the two periods of night and day extend alike to twice six hours, since the Sun is revolving at the heavenly equator.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL469_183_b" id="target_note_LCL469_183_b">

</a> degree of two-formed Capricorn, then the brief day extends to nine and a half equinoctial hours and night, forgetful of day, to hours twice seven, increased, lest the full number go short, by half an hour. Thus the sum of the unequal night and day established by nature breaks evenly into two separate amounts of twelve hours and comes together again to form the full number. From this point the nights diminish and the days increase in length, thrust now on this side of the mean in their course through the zodiac and now on that in fixed gradations (of which a clear account has been drawn up in our science and will follow in my poem at the proper place<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL469_183_d" id="target_note_LCL469_183_d">

</a>), until their combat has reached the stars of scorching Cancer; and there the division of day and night changes to the winter one, but with roles reversed: daylight brings back the length of winter’s night, darkness the length of winter’s day, and now it is the other period which has the upper hand. Such at least is the measurement in the latitude of the lands inundated by the Nile,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL469_183_e" id="target_note_LCL469_183_e">
