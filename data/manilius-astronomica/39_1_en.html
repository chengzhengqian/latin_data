<span class="italic">its technical nature the second book is very elegantly written: it deals with the two circles involved in every horoscopeâ€”the movable circle of the twelve zodiacal signs and the immovable circle of the twelve temples. First, however, we are regaled with an extended proem celebrating those poets who have inaugurated different genres of hexameter poetry; this naturally leads to Manilius himself, who renews his claim of originality and his confession of the Stoic creed. He thereupon embarks on an exhaustive description of the signs of the zodiac: their groupings, their characteristics, their aspects, their tutelary deities, the parts of the body subject to them, and their tangled relationships. We learn of those portions of the zodiacal signs called dodecatemories, though the poet soon leaves this difficult subject, emphasizing that astrological like any other teaching must be imparted in a progressive and logical order. The last part of the book sets forth the special significance of the four cardinal points and the quadrants between them; and enumerates the twelve segments of this circle together with the aspects of human existence over which they preside.</span>
