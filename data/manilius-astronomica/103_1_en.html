month falls to a benign constellation, the sign of the day will be a sign of woe; oft that, if fortune smiles on the day, the hour will be a sombre one. It is not ordained that anything should place total reliance on itself: the years may not rely on their signs alone, nor the months on those of the revolving years, nor the days on those of the months, nor any hour on the sign of the day. The reason is that now these speed ahead, these lag behind; one period now deserts the others, and now is of their company; it successively moves away or comes back, and undergoes the changing influences of another, always being disturbed by the irregular cycle of the days.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL469_209_a" id="target_note_LCL469_209_a">

<sup>560</sup>Having taught what kind of life lies in store for us at any given moment, dealing with the separate periods of time, and to what star each year and month and therewith hour and day belong, I must now tell of another computation, which deals with the span of man’s lifetime and reveals the number of years each sign is held to confer. When seeking to foretell length of life by the stars, you must keep this scheme in mind and mark well its amounts.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL469_209_b" id="target_note_LCL469_209_b">

But there being, in the Roman calendar at any rate, sequences of 30, 31, and 28 (29) days in a month, the cycle of days soon gets out of step. For example, if Jan. 1 is allotted to Aries, so will be Jan. 13, Jan. 25, Feb. 6, Feb. 18, Mar. 2, etc, with Feb. 1 falling to Scorpio, and Mar. 1 to Pisces, etc, thus producing an irregular cycle.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL469_209_a').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL469_209_b"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL469_209_b" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">b</sup>The amounts (in years) are as follows: Aries, Pisces 10 ⅔; Taurus, Aquarius 12 ⅔; Gemini, Capricorn 14 ⅔; Cancer, Sagittarius 16 ⅔; Leo, Scorpio 18 ⅔; Virgo, Libra 20 ⅔ (<span class="italic">cf.</span> Introduction p. lxxix and figure 21).</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL469_209_b').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
