However, signs suffer together in pairs, not of those situated side by side but of those which shine at each other from opposing quarters, since the Moon’s orb only fails when she does not see Phoebus as he courses in the opposite sign. But the signs are not all enfeebled for an equal duration, but sometimes a whole year is spent in this condition, sometimes they remain exhausted for a shorter period, and sometimes for a longer one, when their affliction outlives the Sun’s yearly cycle. Now when the period allotted to each is accomplished, and the pair of signs which shine at each other across heaven have at the appointed limit discharged their tour of toil, then the two adjacent signs which precede them in rising above and setting beneath the Earth’s horizon succumb by a shift of affliction, in such a way that this does not battle against the rotation of the starry sphere but advances in the direction of heaven’ motion<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL469_291_c" id="target_note_LCL469_291_c">
