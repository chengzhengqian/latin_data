poorly conceived plans are rewarded, whilst foresight fails; nor does Fortune examine the merits of a case and attend the deserving, but moves capriciously through the lives of all without distinction. Clearly, there is another and greater power to constrain and rule us, and to subject mortal affairs to laws of its own: it gives birth to men and at their birth determines the number of their years and the changes of their fortunes. Oft it conjoins body of beast with limb of man<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL469_231_a" id="target_note_LCL469_231_a">

</a>: yet that will be found no product of the seed. What has our human nature in common with a beast’s? When has the sin of adultery been punished with a monstrous birth? It is the stars which fashion strange shapes; it is heaven which intrudes these hybrid features. After all, if a pattern of fate does not exist, how comes it that it is represented as existing and all that will come to pass at particular moments prophesied? Not that this reasoning goes so far as to defend crime or deprive virtue of the gifts that are its reward. For no one will hate poisonous plants the less because they grow from their appointed seed and not by their own choice, nor will tasty food find less favour because the crops are nature’s bounty and not given us by any decision of their own. Let man’s merits, therefore, possess glory all the greater, seeing that they owe their excellence to heaven; and, again, let us hate the wicked all the more, because they were born for guilt and punishment. Crime, whencesoever sprung, must still be reckoned crime. This, too, is sanctioned by fate, that I should thus expound the rule of fate.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL469_231_ba" id="target_note_LCL469_231_ba">
