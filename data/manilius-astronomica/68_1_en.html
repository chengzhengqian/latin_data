</a> and that all the signs might have place in each other: thus by this interchange would harmony prevail through the zodiac and its signs would protect one another in a common interest. Men born on earth are created under this law; and so, although their nativities occur in the same signs, they exhibit different traits and conflicting desires; and oft does nature stray from good to bad, and birth of female follows that of male: the genitures differ in a single constellation, because the individual signs vary on account of the distribution of their divisions and modulate their respective powers in the dodecatemories.</p>
<p>
<sup>713</sup>Now shall I recount what dodecatemory belongs to each sign and in what order they are to be found,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL469_139_b" id="target_note_LCL469_139_b">

</a> lest you go astray and err because you know not the divisions of the signs. Within their own domain the constellations keep the first division for themselves, the next is bestowed upon the sign following, and the remaining signs according to their place in the sequence are allotted successive divisions, and the last assignment is made to the farthest sign away. Thus each sign occupies in every constellation two and a half of its degrees,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL469_139_c" id="target_note_LCL469_139_c">

</a> making a total of thirty degrees exacted from the whole zodiac.</p>

<sup>722</sup>But there is more than one system of calculating dodecatemories, and the procedure handed down admits an alternative. Nature has placed the truth in more methods than one and has separated the paths which lead to herself, wishing the quest for her to be made along every path. The following procedure also<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL469_139_d" id="target_note_LCL469_139_d">

</a> has been devised for these same dodecatemories. Multiply thrice four times whatever
