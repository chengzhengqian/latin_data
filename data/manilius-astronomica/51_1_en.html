<sup>270</sup>Nor is it enough to know the special shapes of the signs and the individual ordinances which the stars impose on men at their birth; they also affect our destinies through their agreements with each other, for they rejoice in alliances and cooperate with one another according to their natures and locations. Where the circle of the zodiac’s rightward wheel<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL469_105_a" id="target_note_LCL469_105_a">

</a> a line runs out into three equal lengths and joins itself at limits which are mutually extreme; the signs which the line strikes are called trigonal, because an angle is thrice formed and is assigned to three signs separated from each other by three intervening signs. The Ram beholds at equal distance the two signs of the Lion and the Archer rising on opposite sides of him; the signs of the Virgin and the Bull are in harmony with Capricorn; by the same principle the other trigonal signs which still remain are framed in the heavens in a like number of configurations<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL469_105_ca" id="target_note_LCL469_105_ca">

</a> But the signs which are separated by quarters of the circle and are situated upon a figure with equal sides, the positions of which a square rule draws, these signs are called quadrate. Capricorn views Libra, whilst the Ram sees Capricorn ahead and is in turn beheld at an equal distance by the Crab; and the Crab is perceived by Libra’s stars as it follows on the left: for preceding signs are reckoned as right signs. Even thus may one divide all the signs into groups of as many parts, and out of the twelve signs
