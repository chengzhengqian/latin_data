Fishes in the Crab’s remotest stars. But the Lion, mindful of his partner under the trigon’s law,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL469_249_a" id="target_note_LCL469_249_a">

</a> welcomes the Ram as leader,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL469_249_b" id="target_note_LCL469_249_b">

</a>; the third decan passes under the dominion of the Twins: by his hexagonal line the Lion reaches these too.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL469_249_d" id="target_note_LCL469_249_d">

</a> Erigone bestows especial honour on the Crab, to whom she gives first decan; the neighbouring one she leaves to you, her neighbour, O Lion of Nemea; one decan belongs to herself, which, since tenure of it was disdained by the others,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL469_249_e" id="target_note_LCL469_249_e">

</a> was granted to her to possess. The Balance has the pleasure of a precedent, and imitates the Ram, who though at the opposite season agrees with it in fixing equal hours of day and night: the Ram regulates the scales of spring, while the Balance matches autumn’s nights with autumn’s days. It yields its first decan to none, and hands the adjoining one to the sign which follows it<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL469_249_f" id="target_note_LCL469_249_f">

</a>; the last third belongs to the Centaur. The Scorpion has installed Capricorn in the first decan; has made the man named after water the lord of the second; and has willed that its last degrees be subject to the Fishes. Now he who with bow-string tensed ever threatens to let fly his shaft surrenders his first degrees to the Ram in accordance with the trigon’s pact, the midmost to the Bull, and the last to the Twins. Capricorn risks not the charge of base ingratitude but discharges his obligation to the Crab: welcomed himself to the Crab’s domain, he welcomes the Crab to his, and presents him with his initial portion; the bordering realm is reckoned as the Lion’s, and the endmost degrees as the Maid’s. He that rejoices in the never-ending
stream that pours from his urn transfers control of the first rights over himself to the Balance,
