season brings frost and ice and a countryside white with snow, the other thirst and sweat and an earth with hillsides parched; and the chill wintry night rivals in length the summer’s day. Thus nature wages warfare and the year is split in faction; so wonder not at the signs so situate doing battle. But the Ram’s sign and Libra’s do not engage in total combat: for though in point of season spring differs from autumn (the one fills the earth with fruit, the other with flowers), yet it enjoys a like principle, seeing that day is levelled with night in each. And the seasons, which are harmonious in their likeness of texture and, as links joining winter and summer, maintain with the same tenor on either side days of identical blend, bring it about that the constellations refrain from clashing in violent warfare. Such is the scheme to be found in confronting signs.</p>

It is to mark well the tutelary deities appointed to the signs and the signs which Nature assigned to each god, when she gave to the great virtues the persons of the gods and under sacred names established various powers, in order that a living presence might lend majesty to abstract qualities.
