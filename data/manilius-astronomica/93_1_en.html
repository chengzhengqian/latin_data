these circles rise overhead vertically and sink vertically into the earth, and their risings through individual arcs take uniform periods, and due to the perfect bisection of the Earth the sky is half hidden and half visible.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL469_189_a" id="target_note_LCL469_189_a">

</a> Now when you move from this part of the world, the farther your footsteps take you towards the pole as you stride over the curved slopes of the Earth, which nature has shaped with even surface into a rounded sphere and suspended right in the middle of the universe—when, then, you climb the Earth’s arc and, as you climb, at the same time move down, one part of the Earth will recede and another will take its place. But in proportion as you tilt the Earth, so will the axis of the rotating heavens incline, and the signs which had just now risen in a vertical arc will now be drawn into the air over an inclined track, and the baldric of signs which had just now moved from side to side across heaven will now move in an oblique orbit, since its location remains constant, whilst ours changes. It logically follows that in such a place the times of orbits above the horizon also fluctuate and cause days of variable duration, for in their tilted arrangement slanted star-groups describe niggardly courses, and one sign sets nearer, another farther away than others. The length of visibility is in inverse proportion to distance away: signs that rise nearest to us are seen traversing large arcs of the sky; those that shine farthest away swiftly sink into the darkness. And the nearer one approaches the chill Bears, so much the more do the winter signs<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL469_189_b" id="target_note_LCL469_189_b">
