<sup>297</sup>But if anyone is content with reckoning squares in the belief that the sky is divided into arcs of four signs or with constructing a trigon with arcs of five signs, hoping thus to determine the signs’ powers in alliance and the bonds of friendship between those born under them and discover the federations of heaven in kindred stars, that man will be deceived. For, even supposing that there were sets of five signs on every side, men who are born under such trine signs as are positioned at every fifth place will nevertheless be unable to feel the influences of the trigon; though the signs keep the name of trigon, they have forfeited its dowry by their position and are in revolt against the true numbers. For since in the zodiac there are three hundred and three score degrees traversed by the fiery Sun, a third of that number makes up one side of a trigon inscribed in the zodiac to divide it into three equal parts. However, the line does not give this numerical total, if sign is measured from sign and not degree from degree; for although you have two star-groups with three between,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL469_107_b" id="target_note_LCL469_107_b">

</a> yet if you care to join to each other the last point of the left sign and the first of the preceding and mark the total, they will duly measure thrice fifty degrees<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL469_107_ca" id="target_note_LCL469_107_ca">
<sup>c</sup>
</a>; the number will be too great for the form of a trigon and will trespass upon the territory of the following line.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL469_107_d" id="target_note_LCL469_107_d">
