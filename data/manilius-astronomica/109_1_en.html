<span class="italic">is in his fourth book that Manilius spreads his wings most widely, for here every aspect of his teaching and every facet of his genius are attractively illustrated. At the beginning, as at the end, we hear the indignant voice of the apostle of Stoicism. There follows, with a change to the poetâ€™s lighter style, an exposition of the characteristics and influences of the signs of the zodiac</span> (<span class="italic">a foretaste of that treatment of the extra-zodiacal signs which will occupy most of the last book</span>). <span class="italic">The next two chapters, on decans and injurious degrees, present us with another glimpse of the versifier of astrological and mathematical tables. A somewhat cursory interlude on the rising of individual degrees of the ecliptic forms the transition to the chief subject of the latter portion of the book, a geographical survey and an account of the dominion of the zodiac over the various parts of the world. Ecliptic signs restore to us the philosophical poet, who takes for his peroration the theme of man as microcosm and image of the divine.</span>
