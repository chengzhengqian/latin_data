<span class="italic">not without fascination for virtuoso versifiers, for it is something of a tour de force, the third book is the least poetical of the five, exemplifying for the most part Manilius’s skill in rendering numbers and arithmetical calculations in hexameters. The introduction takes the form of a priamel enumerating the themes of other poets and concluding with the problems of the astrological bard. Manilius resumes his task with an exposition of the twelve athla, which in turn leads to the main subject of the book: the determination of the degree of the ecliptic which is rising above the horizon at the moment of a nativity. This, the most important operation in the casting of a horoscope, causes today’s astrologer no trouble, but before the advent of clocks, atlases, and standard time account had to be taken of the varying lengths of daylight and darkness in different latitudes and different times of the year. Having equipped us with the necessary rules for dealing with the problem, our instructor continues to render mathematical tables in verse-form by introducing us to chronocrators and to the length of life ordained for each of us by the stars. A final chapter, on tropic signs, if lacking in astrological significance, provides a more poetic note on which to close.</span>
