called trigonal, they do not preserve the correct degrees of a trigon. The same fallacy will cause deception in the case of quadrate signs: since, of the circleâ€™s total number, thrice ten degrees for every sign go to make up a square, it therefore follows that, if from the first point of a preceding sign a line is drawn to the last point of the quadrate sign behind, it makes twice sixty degrees<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL469_109_a" id="target_note_LCL469_109_a">

</a>; but if the last point of the former and the first of that following are connected, should you go over and count the number shared by the two intervening signs, it will double thirty degrees, and a third part of the requisite total will be missing.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL469_109_ba" id="target_note_LCL469_109_ba">

</a> And though a man compute a fourth sign from a fourth, the degrees in themselves will cause the wreck of a whole sign. It is therefore not enough to count trigons by signs or to expect a true square from signs at intervals of four. If perchance you wish to construct the figure of a square, or when you are about to draw the sides of an equilateral triangle, the sum of a hundred degrees needs in the latter case increase of a fifth, in the former suffers loss of a tenth.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL469_109_c" id="target_note_LCL469_109_c">

</a> Thus does the count tally. And whatever points joined in a series of four the angle favours, and whatever points the straight line marks in its threefold track when it leaves the winding detour of the circumference, upon these has nature bestowed federation and common law, mutual goodwill and rights of friendship with each other. Therefore not every geniture enjoys the common
