<span class="italic">last book of the Astronomica is the most artistic, and best illustrates the poet’s ingenious rhetoric. The versification of arithmetic or geometry or bare astrological doctrine is here avoided; and for the most part the book consists of witty and colourful portraits of the different types of person produced by the influences of the extra-zodiacal constellations. After several hundred lines Manilius, perhaps taking a lead from Virgil in the last book of the Georgics, abandons the proportions of his scheme to narrate the story of Perseus and Andromeda; comparison with Ovid’s treatment of the myth, however, redounds to our poet’s disadvantage and reveals how much the insistence on verbal point has deprived his composition of the power to engage our feelings. Towards the end of the work some common ancestor of our manuscripts has evidently suffered the loss of several pages, a loss which leaves in some doubt whether or no Manilius dealt, as he had promised, with planetary influences. The last topic to be handled is the magnitudes of the stars, not a matter of astrological significance, but one which enables the poet to conclude with an imaginative description of the republic of the sky.</span>
