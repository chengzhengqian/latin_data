Were their risings not near neighbour to their sinkings and the duration of the kindled flames not so short, a second daytime would exist by night, and the Sun would return to find the whole world fast asleep. Moreover, since all the drier exhalation from the earth is spread abroad and catches fire in no uniform manner, it is also in different shapes that we see those kindled lights which spring to life and shatter the darkness. For sometimes, as though long tresses were flowing down from a person’s head, the flame flies in the guise of hair, and the slender fire lets loose its streaming locks in brilliant rays; and now the tresses are scattered and this former appearance ends, succeeded by a tuft in the likeness of a fiery beard.
