</a> immediately behind the summit of bright heaven, and (not to be outdone by its neighbour) of braver hope, surges ever higher, being ambitious for the prize and triumphant over the earlier temples: consummation attends the topmost abode, and no movement save for the worse can it make, nor is aught left for it to aspire to.

This seat the Greeks call Daemonie<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL469_153_d" id="target_note_LCL469_153_d">

</a>: a rendering of the name in Roman speech is wanting. Lay carefully in your mind the abode and the divinity and appellation of the puissant abode, so that hereafter the knowledge may be put to great use. Here largely abide the changes in our health and the warfare waged by the unseen weapons
