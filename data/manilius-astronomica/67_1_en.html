to alliances knit together by feelings of the heart; and just as the stars themselves come together across the vast space between, so they unite us over distances greater than those which separate kin. These signs, which have power to join heart to heart, are considered superior to those which not uncommonly forswear their ties of blood. Adjacent signs aid neighbours, alternate signs aid guests. Thus the principle<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL469_137_a" id="target_note_LCL469_137_a">

</a> of the signs will be preserved. You must apportion to the signs the divisions of other signs which belong to them, and to these divisions their proper signs; for no sign ministers exclusively to itself<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL469_137_b" id="target_note_LCL469_137_b">

<sup>693</sup>Pray examine now a matter trivial in appearance, yet one of great moment, which does not permit description of itself save by a Greek word. I speak of the dodecatemories, of which the name proclaims the principle. The signs each consist of thirty degrees, and every total is further divided by twice six; the calculation therefore shows that in each division there are two and a half degrees. Here, then, is the dodecatemory, consisting of this territory; a dozen such divisions occur in all the signs. The great builder of heaven bestowed these divisions upon the equal number of shining signs, that the constellations might be associated in a system of giving and
