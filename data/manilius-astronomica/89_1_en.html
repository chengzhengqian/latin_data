into signs, until it reaches the precise time of birth: the sign wherein it halts is said to be the rising sign. But the circle of signs lies in an oblique belt, and some signs rise with slanting limbs, whilst others have on rising a more upright posture, according as a sign is either nearer to the equinoctial points or farther off. Cancer is loth to end the day, winter<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL469_181_a" id="target_note_LCL469_181_a">

</a> to renew it; the Sun’s heavenly orbit is as long in the former case as it is brief in the latter; Libra and Aries make equal night and day. Thus the middle signs are at variance with the end ones, and the lowest with the highest.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL469_181_b" id="target_note_LCL469_181_b">

</a> Nor do the hours of night alter any less than those of day but the same variation exists, though in opposite months. Who could believe that, with such uneven periods and such changeable limits of day and darkness, all the signs rise into the sky under a uniform law of heaven? Moreover, the length of an hour is a variable quantity, nor is any hour followed<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL469_181_c" id="target_note_LCL469_181_c">

</a> by another of the same length, but just as the duration of days varies, so also their parts increase and again decrease; and yet, under whatever sign a day’s course is run,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL469_181_d" id="target_note_LCL469_181_d">

</a> it has at any moment six signs above the earth and six below. It follows that the signs cannot all rise in a period of two hours, since owing to the discrepancy between the hours their duration is not uniform, if indeed twelve hours are contained between each dawn and dusk, a number which ordinary reckoning demands but strict application does not permit.</p>
