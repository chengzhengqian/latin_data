</a> The path of these circles is the same as the sky’s, and they wheel along the same orbit; they match their risings and settings uniformly, since, curved along the spin of the whole sphere, they trace lines which follow the rotation of high heaven, ever preserving equidistant intervals from each other, the boundaries for all time assigned them, and their appointed stations.</p>

<sup>603</sup>There are two circles,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL469_53_b" id="target_note_LCL469_53_b">

</a> placed crosswise to each other, which are drawn from one pole and received by the other: they cut all the circles mentioned above and cut each other, converging at the two poles of heaven; thence they traverse the sky and are drawn straight to the pole. They mark the seasons of the year and the division of heaven along the zodiac into four portions of equal months.
