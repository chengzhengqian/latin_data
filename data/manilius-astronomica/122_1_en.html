is ever hedged about with deep darkness, and truth is hidden and wrapped in much complexity. Heaven is reached by no brief effort and does not favour short cuts; but the shape of one sign is placed in front of and conceals others, and dissimulates and hides its real influences and gifts. This obscurity must be dispelled not by the eyes but by profundity of intellect,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL469_247_a" id="target_note_LCL469_247_a">

The scheme works differently in the sign of the Bull, for he is not reckoned under any of his decans: he bestows the first on the Crab, the middle on the Lion, and the last on the Maid.
