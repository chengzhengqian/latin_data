are mostly ascribed ties of kinship, ties of friendship to trigonal signs. And the reason is plain; for in every third place<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL469_135_a" id="target_note_LCL469_135_a">

</a> right round the zodiac nature has set a sign of similar character. Four at equal intervals mark out the heavens, and in them God himself has created joining-points of the year: the Ram brings spring, the Crab the summer’s corn, the Balance the vintage, and the Goat-fish,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL469_135_b" id="target_note_LCL469_135_b">

</a> born to endure the cold, brings winter. Moreover those signs which possess a combination of two figures occupy every third place: thus may you see the Fishes twain, the two young men, the Maid of twofold aspect,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL469_135_c" id="target_note_LCL469_135_c">

</a> and the Centaur’s two bodies wrought in a single woof. Likewise the single signs also enjoy the figure of a square; for the Bull has no partner, nor has the fierce Lion another at his side; the mateless Scorpion has no one to fear, and the Waterman is counted as of single sign. Consequently the signs situate in quadrate positions display a like condition of number or season and remain bound by such federation as though by ties of blood. For this reason the quadrate signs indicate connections by marriage, assist the near degrees of kinship, and stamp their children with identical features, when they move through the cardinal points, incurring the while variation of their natural <span class="italic">powers owing to the sky’s forward rotation</span>; although they divide the circle into four parts and form quadrate signs, they are not considered as falling under the law of the square: the numerical association counts for less than that of cardinal point. The line which passes by three signs and creates trigonal constellations is longer and covers a greater distance. These constellations conduct us to friendships that rival the connections and ties of blood and
