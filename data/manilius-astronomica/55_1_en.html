Signs separated by one intervening sign are concealed in a curved recess; and so, though they follow the one in front, they escape its slanting gaze, since, lying at an angle too obtuse, they are only to be seen with sidelong glance and are hidden from their neighbour: sight strikes more surely straight ahead. And because their line comes close to the celestial vault, since in its circuit it only passes over one sign at a time, their sight of each other takes place at a great distance from us, ranging over the heights of heaven, and the influences it radiates from afar are faint when they reach the earth. However federation exists among them by virtue of their affinity, for the signs that are connected are not of unlike sex, but masculine respond to male, whilst the remainder are of female sex and form among themselves a heavenly fellowship. Thus is it that, though the signs of hexagons are alternate, their nature is similar, and as kindred stars they acknowledge the ties of sex.</p>

Their attentions are bestowed on distant signs which they can see. Again they are signs of opposite sex, linked male to female right round the circle, and each in turn is for ever beset by its neighbours.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL469_113_a" id="target_note_LCL469_113_a">
