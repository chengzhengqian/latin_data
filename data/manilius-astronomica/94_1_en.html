take away as many days. Thus but a brief stay is left for the days, and with the diminution of their hours it is soon spent and gradually disappears altogether, as the stars flee in space. And as by degrees the time is snatched away, more signs will become invisible, concealed by the intervening curve of the Earth: they will abduct the Sun as well and weave a web of unbroken darkness, until the year is weakened by the loss of whole months. But if nature were to let you walk beneath the summit of heaven, which the cold pole sustains with inflexible support, over perpetual snow and a frozen earth which gazes up at the figure of Lycaonâ€™s daughter<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL469_191_a" id="target_note_LCL469_191_a">

At that spot six signs only, lying in an oblique semicircle, will you ever be able to see; their inclined curve will never disappear from sight but will rotate with the rounded sky. Everywhere here a single day will last six months, a day which will keep a half year in continuous light, for in all this time, during which his course will take him through six signs, Phoebus will never set but will rotate in circling flight around the erect heavens. But when he plunges beneath the equator, setting his car on a downward course for the southern signs, and speeding on the descent gives free rein to his steed, through as many months shall a single night prolong darkness beneath the summit of heaven. For whoever looks out from the pole sees half of the whole sphere of the rounded heavens, whilst the lower is hidden; for the direct line of vision does not encompass the sky, but extends only as far as the extremity of its bulge.
