the Crab’s extreme sign, wherein Phoebus completes the lingering of his light and slowly swings his rays through long curves, adopts from the heat of midsummer the name of summer tropic, acquiring the title of the season; with its warmth it marks out the turning-point and northerly limit of the Sun’s winged career, and is five degrees distant from the northern circle. A third circle,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL469_51_a" id="target_note_LCL469_51_a">

</a> set in the midmost region of the sky, girds with a huge ring the full circuit of heaven and sees a pole on either side; here with his light the Sun matches night and day in hours of equal number as he passes through the tempered seasons of spring and autumn and divides the middle of heaven with impartial boundary; this circle withdraws its track four degrees away from that of the summer solstice. Next after this a boundary named the winter tropic<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL469_51_b" id="target_note_LCL469_51_b">

</a> marks the furthest station of the retreating Sun, when, as he describes his briefest arc, he gives us scant bounty with the slanting fires of his rays, although in the lands over which he hangs time halts, light tarries long, and, prolonged by the glowing heat, the day scarce comes to an end; this boundary is removed from the last by twice two degrees of the circumference. After these one circle remains<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL469_51_c" id="target_note_LCL469_51_c">
