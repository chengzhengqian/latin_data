Thus, while he rides through the six submerged signs, Phoebus shuns the gaze of the observer on top of the Earth and at one and the same time steals daylight from the signs and leaves them darkness, until, as many months spent as before his departure, he comes back and rises towards the two Bears. Such a place twice separates the year into night and day, once in each hemisphere of the divided Earth.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL469_193_a" id="target_note_LCL469_193_a">

</a> since I have described the fluctuation with which the times of day and night vary and the reasons for the fluctuation, learn now how many hours the signs take to rise and set in any given place, in order that you can compute the precise moment when each of a sign’s degrees is rising. Then the horoscope will not be in error, falsified by inaccurate reckoning. The information is in all cases to be found by using a general principle, since, inasmuch as the individual signs differ with such great fluctuation, they cannot be recorded with every conceivable calculation of their periods and degrees. Let each one take the path laid down by me, and, following it for himself, trace that path with his own footsteps; let him owe the method to me. Whatever be the latitude of the Earth in which anyone desires this information, let him determine to their true number of hours the periods of light and darkness on the longest day which at Cancer’s sign is interposed between the least portions of darkness<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL469_193_c" id="target_note_LCL469_193_c">

</a>; and the measurement of night’s darkness is likewise to be divided into as many parts, so that the time of one portion is to be assigned to the Bull’s rising when his hind-foremost constellation is
