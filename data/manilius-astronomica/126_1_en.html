</a> by which you must determine the character of men at birth. But it is not enough to learn of signs that hold sway in the decans of other signs, and which signs are thus installed in each; you must be sure to notice individual degrees which are themselves either numbed with ice or scorched by fire and some which, though free from either of these defects, are nevertheless sterile, being marred by excessive or insufficient moisture.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL469_255_c" id="target_note_LCL469_255_c">

</a> For all the signs that rise possess a mixture of influences and a variety of texture. Nothing is uniform. Look at the stretches of land and sea, and rivers that course past banks of varying scenery: failings abound everywhere, and imperfection is found next to excellence. Thus barren soil appears in the midst of rich fields and, with hardly any indication of discontinuity, abruptly breaks the natural order; and what but lately was a haven of the sea now becomes a yawning maelstrom, and the charm of the waters we admired vanishes in a moment; the same river flows now over rocks and now through plains and, as it creates or looks for a path, runs forward or doubles back on its tracks. So too in the sky do the degrees of the signs display diversity: just as sign is at variance with sign, so it is at variance with itself, and but a minute shift causes it to withhold its influences and salutary effects: whatever is brought forth in these degrees is born to a life of frustration or perishes or experiences benefits
