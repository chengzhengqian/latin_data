that the stars poised in heaven fall not upon Earth but take fixed periods of time to accomplish their orbits: all this is not the result of chance, but the plan of a God most high.</p>
<p>
<sup>532</sup>These then are the constellations which decorate the sky with even spread, their fires panelling the ceiling of heaven with various designs. Higher than these is there nothing, for they are the roof of the universe; they are the limits within which the common abode of nature is content to be held, embracing the sea and lands that lie beneath. They all move on a consistent course, coming into view and setting where heaven ever sinks and, turning, reappears. There exist other stars, which strive against the contrary movement of the sky<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL469_47_a" id="target_note_LCL469_47_a">

</a> and in their swift orbits are poised between heaven and earth: Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, and the Sun, and beneath them Mercury performing its flight between Venus and the Moon.</p>

<sup>539</sup>How great is the space occupied by the vault of the heavens and how great the territory within which the twelve signs of the zodiac move, we learn from reason, reason that no barriers or huge masses or dark recesses withstand; all things yield to reason, and it can penetrate the sky itself. Now the distance of the signs from land and sea is equal to the extent of two signs: for, where a circle is cut through the middle, the line formed amounts to a third of the circumference, a line so dividing the whole as to leave a small difference.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL469_47_ba" id="target_note_LCL469_47_ba">

</a> Therefore the highest point of heaven is twice two signs distant from the lowest, a distance, that is, of one third of the twelve

The poet speaks of units of “two signs” in this passage because such a unit is the length both of the radius of a circle and of each side of a hexagon inscribed therein (Euclid, <span class="italic">Elem.</span> 4. 15).</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL469_47_ba').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
