feeling of its trigonal signs, nor do signs which happen to be quadrate necessarily preserve community of interests with each other.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL469_111_a" id="target_note_LCL469_111_a">

</a> For it makes a difference whether the line uses up the exact toll of its degrees or rejects the limit to the circumference’s total by constructing on each side, in the one case three lines, in the other four, which the law of numbers sometimes forces to proceed into more signs than are specified by the number of degrees in the zodiac.</p>
<p>
<sup>352</sup>But in the zodiac the trigon’s power is far greater than that of those signs to which, reckoned as fourth from each other, is ascribed the title of quadrate. The side of the quadrate signs is higher, and their perimeter farther removed from us, whilst the side of trigons travels closer and draws away from heaven: their vision draws nearer to Earth and sends down to our atmosphere an air tempered by their influences.</p>

<sup>358</sup>Weak is the connection between alternate signs, nor do they maintain with unfailing constancy the federation between each other, because the line is reluctant to bend in its circuit of short chords. A track is formed which passes by one constellation at a time, whilst the angle lodges at the alternate signs, the line making six changes of direction in its curve round the circle: it therefore leaves the Bull for the Crab, then after touching the Virgin enters Scorpion, thence reaches you, chill Capricorn, from you the two Fishes and the stars of the Bull averse, and finishes the circle where it began. The path of a second line lies through the signs that the first missed and is drawn in such a way that you pass by each of the signs I mentioned, so that its circle resembles the former in having as many chords.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL469_111_b" id="target_note_LCL469_111_b">
