</a> trigon, a trigon completed by the Twins and the Waterman pouring his stream. And a twofold reason compels us to admit the truth of this: because the signs shine in diametric opposition, three against three, and because of the eternal state of war between man and beast.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL469_125_b" id="target_note_LCL469_125_b">

</a> And the beasts give way because intelligence prevails over brute strength. As one vanquished shines the Lion among the stars; it was the theft of his golden fleece that gave the Ram his place in heaven; to part of himself the Centaur gives way on account of his rear, to such an extent is manliness restricted to man. Why should I wonder then that men born under these signs are no match for Libra’s trigon?</p>

</a> the only reason which imparts enmities to men at birth and begets a race for mutual hatred and hostility; but alternate signs mostly abide in a state of antagonism, being rooted with evil sidelong stares and because signs<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL469_125_d" id="target_note_LCL469_125_d">

</a> alternate to whatever signs are diametrically opposed and, separated by five, exchange confronting looks belong to the trigons of each; so one must not wonder if signs deny peace to those stars which possess trigonal relationship with their confronting signs.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL469_125_e" id="target_note_LCL469_125_e">

</a> A simpler reason is also to be traced in the zodiac; for to all the shining signs endowed with human form those of the beasts are ever hostile and ever by them vanquished. Nevertheless, there are individual signs
