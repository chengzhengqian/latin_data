<h3><span class="ac">SUMMARY OF BOOK XXXIII</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">As proconsul Titus Quinctius Flamininus brought the war with Philip to an end when he defeated him in pitched battle at Cynoscephalae in Thessaly. The proconsulâ€™s brother, Lucius Quinctius Flamininus, accepted the surrender of the Acarnanians after capturing the city of Leucas, which is the capital of the Acarnanians. Peace was given to Philip at his request after Greece was liberated. Attalus was transported from Thebes to Pergamum because of his sudden illness and died there. The praetor Gaius Sempronius Tuditanus was killed by the Celtiberians along with his army. The consuls Lucius Furius Purpurio and Claudius Marcellus crushed the Boii and the Insubrian Gauls. Marcellus celebrated a triumph. Hannibal had tried in vain to foment war and for this was betrayed to the Romans in letters sent by the leaders of a faction opposed to him. Out of fear of the Romans, who had sent delegates to the senate of Carthage about him, he fled and came to Antiochus, the king of Syria, who was preparing for war with the Romans.</p>
