Philip’s fortunes were waning everywhere simultaneously, and it was just at that time that the Rhodians also intended reclaiming from him an area of the mainland called the Peraea,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL295_335_51" id="target_note_LCL295_335_51"><sup>51</sup></a> which had belonged to their forefathers. For that they sent out the praetor Pausistratus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL295_335_52a" id="target_note_LCL295_335_52a"><sup>52</sup></a> in command of 800 Achaean infantry and some 1,800 auxiliary troops brought together from different races—Gauls, Mniesutae, Pisuetae, Tarmiani, and Theraei from the Peraea, and Laudiceni from Asia. With these troops Pausistratus seized Tendeba (which was very strategically situated in the territory of Stratonicea) without the knowledge of the king’s forces stationed at Thera.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL295_335_53" id="target_note_LCL295_335_53"><sup>53</sup></a> He was joined at the opportune moment by an auxiliary force raised for the operation: 1,000 Achaean infantry and 100 cavalry, all under the command of Theoxenus. To recover this fortified town, the king’s prefect Dinocrates first moved his camp toward Tendeba itself, and from there to a second stronghold (they call it Astragon), also in Stratonicean territory. Then, after recalling to that place all the widely scattered Macedonian garrisons, as well as the Thessalian auxiliaries from Stratonicea itself, he proceeded to Alabanda,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL295_335_54" id="target_note_LCL295_335_54"><sup>54</sup></a> where his enemy was located. The Rhodians did not refuse the fight. And so, with their camps established close to each other, the two sides immediately came forward for battle.</p>
