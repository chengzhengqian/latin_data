At that time power in Carthage lay with the order of judges, mainly because the same judges had lifetime tenure of office.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL295_413_162" id="target_note_LCL295_413_162"><sup>162</sup></a> Everybody’s property, reputation, and life rested in these men’s hands. Anyone falling foul of a single member of that order had them all against him, and there was never an accuser lacking before such unsympathetic judges. While these men were enjoying their autocratic rule—for they did not exercise their exceptional powers as citizens should—Hannibal, who had been elected praetor,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL295_413_163" id="target_note_LCL295_413_163"><sup>163</sup></a> ordered a quaestor<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL295_413_164" id="target_note_LCL295_413_164"><sup>164</sup></a> to be summoned to him.

The appreciation that this move won for him with the masses was on a par with the offense he gave to most of the nobility.
