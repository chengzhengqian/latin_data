The lower reaches of the city are flat, lying beside the sea by which Leucadia is divided from Acarnania. At this point it is vulnerable to attack both from land and sea as the shallow waters here resemble a pool more than a sea, while the plain is entirely made up of soft earth and is easy to dig. As a result the walls began to collapse at several points simultaneously, either undermined or else knocked down by the ram. But if the city itself was an easy proposition for its assailants, the spirit of the enemy was indomitable. Day and night </p>
<p class="noindent">they applied themselves to rebuilding the shattered portions of the wall, to blocking gaps left where it had collapsed, to joining battle with vigor, and to protecting their walls with their weapons rather than themselves with their ramparts. In fact, they would have drawn out the siege longer than the Romans expected had not some exiles of Italian stock who were living in Leucas come down from the citadel and admitted their soldiers. Even then the Leucadians, who had drawn up their battle line in the forum, held the Romans for some time in pitched battle, rushing down with a great commotion from their higher position. In the meantime the fortifications were taken by scaling ladders at several points, and the Romans clambered into the city over stones strewn on the ground and over the fallen walls, while by now the legate himself, at the head of a large column of men, had surrounded the still resisting Leucadians. Then some were cut down, encircled by their foes; others threw down their arms and surrendered to the victor. A few days later, on hearing of the battle that had been fought at Cynoscephalae, all the peoples of Acarnania capitulated to the legate.</p>

Livy is clearly wrong if he is saying that it was a peninsula in 197 but an island in his day. He has probably been careless in transmitting the traditional version, which he presumably found in Polybius.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL295_333_50').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
