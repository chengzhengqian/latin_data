All these troops, apart from the Macedonians, could only with difficulty be brought together and put into formation, and they failed to withstand the initial assault of their enemy. The Macedonians had assembled for the fight in by far the greatest numbers, and they long kept the prospect of victory for either side in doubt. Finally, left unprotected when the others fled, and with two enemy battle lines bearing down on them from different directions—the light infantry from the flank, the shield-bearers and peltasts from the front—they, too, the battle now lost, at first gave ground and then, coming under pressure, took to their heels. Most discarded their weapons and with no hope left of holding on to the camp headed for Corinth.</p>

Returning to camp out of formation, and totally unaware of what had happened, some of them drifted into the outposts of their enemy, assuming that they were their own; others, surmising from the turmoil what had actually transpired, took flight and became so dispersed that they were waylaid even by the local peasants as they wandered here and there.
