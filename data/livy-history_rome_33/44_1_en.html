<p>He was to give the Roman people 1,000 talents, half immediately and half in installments over ten years. (Valerius Antias records that the king was subjected to an annual tribute of 4,000 pounds of silver for ten years, Claudius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL295_373_114" id="target_note_LCL295_373_114"><sup>114</sup></a> that it was 4,200 pounds over thirty years, plus 20,000 payable immediately. Claudius also mentions a clause expressly forbidding him to go to war with Eumenes, son of Attalus, the new king of Pergamum at that time).<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL295_373_115" id="target_note_LCL295_373_115"><sup>115</sup></a></p>

Why, they asked, were some cities being passed over to the Romans without being specified by name when others were actually named and told to accept their independence without being handed over in this way? Obviously it was because the cities that lay in Asia, safer by virtue of their very remoteness, were to be liberated, while those in Greece were to be taken over without even being designated by name—Corinth, Chalcis, and Oreus, along with Eretria and Demetrias.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL295_373_118" id="target_note_LCL295_373_118"><sup>118</sup></a></p>
