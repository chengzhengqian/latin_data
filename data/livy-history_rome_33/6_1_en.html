They would cut down trees that were too big and had too many branches for a soldier to be able to carry them together with his weapons, and when they had formed a circle of these around their camp breaking down the palisade made of them was easy. This was because the trunks of the large trees rose from the ground at wide intervals, and their numerous sturdy branches enabled one to get a firm hold of them with the hand. Thus two, or at most three, young men would with some effort pull up one of the trees, and when it was torn out an open space like a doorway was immediately created, with nothing readily available to block it. The Romans, however, cut stakes that are light and for the most part forked, bearing three or, at most, four branches, so that a soldier can easily carry a number at a time, his weapons hanging behind his back.
