Achaeans and Athenians arrived on the scene. The intercession of the Achaeans carried more weight because they had already decided to fight alongside the Romans<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL295_371_111" id="target_note_LCL295_371_111"><sup>111</sup></a> should they fail to secure a peace for the Boeotians. It was through the Achaeans that the Boeotians were given the chance to meet and speak to the Roman commander, and they were ordered to hand over the guilty and pay a sum of thirty talents as a fine, after which they were granted peace and the siege was raised.</p>

<p>All Greek city-states, in Europe and Asia alike, were to have their independence and their own laws.</p>
<p>In the case of those states that had been under Philip’s control, Philip was to withdraw his garrisons from them and hand them over to the Romans free of his troops before the time of the Isthmian Games.</p>
<p>Philip was also to withdraw his garrisons from the following cities in Asia: Euromus, Pedasa, Bargyliae, Iasus, Myrina, Abydus, Thasos and Perinthus, since it was decided that these, too, should be free. As for the freedom of the people of Cius, Quinctius was to write to Prusias, king of Bithynia, to communicate the decision of the senate and the ten commissioners.</p>
<p>Philip was to return prisoners of war and deserters to the Romans, and surrender all his decked ships apart from five and his one royal galley of almost unmaneuverable proportions, propelled by sixteen banks of oars.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL295_371_113a" id="target_note_LCL295_371_113a"><sup>113</sup></a></p>
