companions fled, there was a hue and cry, and pandemonium broke out as men with torches ran to and fro throughout the city. The assassins slipped away through the nearest gate.</p>
<p>At dawn there was an assembly in the theater,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL295_365_106" id="target_note_LCL295_365_106"><sup>106</sup></a> as well attended as if it had been convened by prior edict or called by a herald. In public, people angrily claimed that Brachylles had been killed by his retinue and the perverts in it, but in their hearts they had Zeuxippus singled out as the man responsible for the murder. For the moment they decided that those who had been with Brachylles should be arrested and interrogated. While the search for them was in progress, Zeuxippus coolly marched into the assembly to deflect incrimination from himself. People were wrong, he said, to believe such a heinous murder to be linked with these degenerates, and he produced many plausible arguments to support his case. With these he convinced some people that if he had a guilty conscience he would never have presented himself to the crowd or made mention of the murder when no one was pressing him to do so. Others, however, had no doubt that brazenly exposing himself to the charge was simply a way of averting suspicion.</p>
<p>Shortly afterward the innocent companions were tortured. They knew nothing but, taking as proof what everybody was thinking, they named Zeuxippus and Pisistratus but provided no further evidence to suggest they actually knew anything. Even so Zeuxippus fled by night to Tanagra<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL295_365_107" id="target_note_LCL295_365_107"><sup>107</sup></a> with a certain Stratonidas, more from fear of his own conscience than of the evidence supplied by men with no knowledge of the affair. Pisistratus remained in Thebes, with scant regard for the informers. </p>
