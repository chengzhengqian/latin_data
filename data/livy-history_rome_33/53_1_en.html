<p>The Ligurians were the army’s next objective. The Boii now followed the Roman column, taking pathways hidden from view with the idea of making a surprise attack—the column would be carelessly organized, they assumed, because they themselves would be thought to be a long way off. Failing to overtake the Romans, they suddenly crossed the Po in boats and conducted raids on the Laevi and Libui,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL295_391_134" id="target_note_LCL295_391_134"><sup>134</sup></a> and as they were returning along the borders of Ligurian territory, carrying their spoils from the fields, they ran into the Roman column. The battle that ensued was more spirited and ferocious than if the two sides had been prepared for the confrontation with time and place for the engagement arranged. Here the potency of anger as a stimulant to courage was made apparent: the Romans craved bloodshed more than victory, and fought so aggressively that they scarcely left the enemy any survivor to report the debacle.</p>
<p>When the consuls’ dispatch reached Rome, a three-day period of supplication<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL295_391_135" id="target_note_LCL295_391_135"><sup>135</sup></a> was decreed in thanks for this success. Shortly afterward the consul Marcellus arrived in Rome and was awarded a triumph by a large majority in the senate. During his term of office, Marcellus celebrated a triumph over the Insubres and Comenses, but left to his colleague the prospect of a triumph over the Boii since he personally had suffered defeat against that people but had gained victory cooperating with the colleague. Large quantities of enemy spoils and many military standards were carried along on captured wagons. In the procession, 320,000 bronze coins were transported, and 234,000 pieces of silver stamped with the <span class="italic">biga.</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL295_391_136" id="target_note_LCL295_391_136"><sup>136</sup></a> Infantrymen were granted eighty bronze <span class="italic">asses</span> apiece, a cavalryman and a centurion three times that amount.</p>
