Time and again Quinctius emphasized that they had to free Greece as a whole if they wished to make the Aetolians hold their tongues, inspire in everyone genuine affection and respect for the Roman race, and convince people that they had crossed the sea to liberate Greece rather than merely transfer power over it from Philip to themselves.
