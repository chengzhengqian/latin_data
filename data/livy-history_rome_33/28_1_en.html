fields, hungry for booty. Those who had the opportunity to flee returned to their own lands without even risking a fight. Philip retired to Thessalonica, the confidence of his people restored by that single campaign, so different from his fortunes elsewhere.</p>
<p>The timely ending of the war with the Carthaginians,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL295_341_61" id="target_note_LCL295_341_61"><sup>61</sup></a> which saved the Romans from having to fight them and Philip at the same time, was not as opportune as Philip’s defeat at a point when Antiochus was already fomenting war from his base in Syria. Apart from the fact that it was easier for Rome to fight these enemies separately than if the two had joined forces, there was also in that same period an armed uprising and great upheaval in Spain.</p>
<p>The previous summer, Antiochus had wrested from Ptolemy’s control and brought into his own power all the city-states in Coele Syria,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL295_341_62" id="target_note_LCL295_341_62"><sup>62</sup></a> and had then retired to Antioch<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL295_341_63a" id="target_note_LCL295_341_63a"><sup>63</sup></a> for the winter, which proved no less active a season for him than the summer had been. Exploiting all the resources of his kingdom, he had amassed huge land and sea forces; and at the beginning of spring<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL295_341_64" id="target_note_LCL295_341_64"><sup>64</sup></a> he sent ahead his two sons, Ardyes and Mithridates, overland with an army, ordering them to wait for him at Sardis. He then set out himself with a fleet of 100 ships with decks, plus 200 lighter vessels, Cyprian cutters and pinnaces. His aim was to strike at the cities under Ptolemy’s control all along the coast of Cilicia, Lycia, and Caria, and at the same time to assist Philip (for the war against Philip was not yet finished) with his army and ships.</p>
