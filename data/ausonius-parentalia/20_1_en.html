<p><span class="sc">Urbica</span>, famed both for illustrious birth and old-time virtues, and renowned as Censor’s wife, rich as was the store of your natural qualities, you have added those besides which your spouse taught you, and your father and your mother—those qualities which Tanaquil<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL096_94_1" id="target_note_LCL096_94_1"><sup>1</sup></a> possessed, and Theano the Pythagorean,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL096_95_2" id="target_note_LCL096_95_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and those which perished without copy when your husband died. And had Fate suffered you so to exchange, Censor would still be living in these our days. Yet not for long did you suffer grief in your widowed state, but welcomed death and straightway followed your husband to the shades. Now I, Ausonius, your fellow parent-in-law, with my son-in-law<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL096_95_3" id="target_note_LCL096_95_3"><sup>3</sup></a> and his children, bring you your yearly due with sad lament.</p>
