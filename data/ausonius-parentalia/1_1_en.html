<p><span class="sc">I know</span> that it is the fate of my poor poems to be read with a feeling of weariness: that is indeed what they deserve. But some are recommended by their subject-matter; and at times, perhaps, the explanatory heading alone so attracts the reader that, allured by its gaiety, he cheerfully puts up with its insipidness. This little volume is neither cheerful as regards its subject, nor attractive in title. It is endued with that mournful affection with which I commemorate in sorrowing love the loss of my dear ones. The book is headed <span class="italic">Parentalia,</span> after the solemn day<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL096_57_2" id="target_note_LCL096_57_2"><sup>2</sup></a> so called in ancient times, being indeed appointed so long ago as the times of Numa for offerings to departed relatives. The loving respect of the living has, indeed, no more sacred office it can perform than to call to mind with due reverence those who are lost to us.</p>
