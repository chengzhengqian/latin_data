<p><span class="sc">My</span> aunt Veneria also died an early death, and to her I now chant these short, measured lines. May her poor ashes rest in peace and repose from toil, and swift be her passage to the silent realms of Erebus.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Little</span> Idalia, too, is gone, who received the title of the Paphian queen, and herself won Venus’ beauty; who by birth was well-nigh my sister. For this was the child of my aunt, whom my dirge now honours with the loving homage of a mournful strain.</p>

<h2><span class="ac"><span class="sc">XXIX.—Aemilia Melania, my Sister</span></span></h2>
<p><span class="sc">Though</span> I scarce knew you, Aemilia, my sister, receive this lament which my sad strains owe to your ashes. When we were infants almost of one age we shared one cradle, though you were the elder by one year. But Lachesis, too jealous, hurried on your final hour and sent you to the shades—an untimely death. Since, therefore, you are gone before me, take my farewell and do honour to our parents’ shades—his who in riper, and hers who in earlier years is come to rejoin you.</p>
