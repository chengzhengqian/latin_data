I tear my grey hairs mocked by my widowed life, and the more I live in loneliness, the more I live in heaviness. That my house is still and silent, and that my bed is cold, that I share not my ills with any, my good with any—these things feed my wound. I grieve, if one man has a worthy wife; and yet again I grieve if another has a bad: for pattern, you are ever present with me. Howe’er it be, you come to torture me: if one be bad, because you were not like her; or if one be good, because you were like her. I mourn not for useless wealth or unsubstantial joys, but because in your youth you were torn from me, your youthful lord. Cheerful, modest, staid, famed for high birth as famed for beauty, you were the grief and glory of Ausonius your spouse. For ere you could complete your eight and twentieth December, you deserted our two children, the pledges of our love. They by God’s mercy, and as you ever prayed, flourish amid an abundance of such goods as you desired for them. And still I pray that they may prosper, and that at last my dust may bring the news to your ashes that they are living yet.</p>

<h2><span class="ac"><span class="sc">X.—Ausonius, my Son, a Little Child</span></span></h2>
<p>I <span class="sc">will</span> not leave you unwept, my son, nor rob you of the complaint due to your memory—you, my first-born child, and called by my name. Just as you were practising to transform your babbling into the first words of childhood and were of ripe natural gifts we had to mourn for your decease. You on your great-grandfather’s bosom lie sharing one common grave, lest you should suffer the reproach of your one lone tomb.</p>
