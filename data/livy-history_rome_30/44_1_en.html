Everything could be seen from Carthage; and so from all parts of the city people ran to the market-place. The magistrates summoned the senate; the people before the entrance of the Senate House protested against letting go so much booty out of their sight and reach. While some objected, pleading the sanctity of peace negotiations, others that of the armistice—for its term had not yet expired—the meeting of the senate was all but merged with that of the people. It was agreed that Hasdrubal should sail over to Aegimurus with his fleet of fifty ships, and then gather up the Roman ships scattered along the shore and in the harbours.

At once he sent Lucius Baebius, Lucius Sergius and Lucius Fabius as envoys to Carthage.
