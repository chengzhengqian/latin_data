of that hill, and spent the day in light engagements, advancing against the enemy’s outposts and challenging them. And on the next two days by irregular charges, now from one side and now from the other by turns, they accomplished nothing worthy of mention. On the fourth day both went down into battle-line. The Roman placed his <span class="italic">principes</span> behind the front line maniples, made up of the <span class="italic">hastati</span>, and as reserves the <span class="italic">triarii.</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL381_391_2" id="target_note_LCL381_391_2"><sup>2</sup></a> The Italic cavalry he posted on the right wing, on the left the Numidians and Masinissa. Syphax and Hasdrubal opposed the Numidians to the Italic cavalry, the Carthaginians to Masinissa, and then placed the Celtiberians in the centre of the battle-line facing the maniples<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL381_391_3" id="target_note_LCL381_391_3"><sup>3</sup></a> of the legions.
