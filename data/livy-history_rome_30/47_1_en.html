<p>The year was marked by a great conflagration in which the Clivus Publicius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL381_459_2" id="target_note_LCL381_459_2"><sup>2</sup></a> was burned to the ground, and by floods, but also by the low price of grain, because not only was all Italy open by reason of peace, but also a great quantity of grain had been sent from Spain; and Marcus Valerius Falto and Marcus Fabius Buteo, the curule aediles, distributed this to the populace by precincts at four <span class="italic">asses</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL381_459_3" id="target_note_LCL381_459_3"><sup>3</sup></a> a peck.</p>

Nevertheless Fabius has been accounted a man of caution rather than of action. And while one may question whether he was the “Delayer” by nature, or because that was especially suited to the war then in progress, still nothing is more certain than that one man by delaying restored our state,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL381_459_6" id="target_note_LCL381_459_6"><sup>6</sup></a> as Ennius says.
