<p>XXIV. About that time Gnaeus Servilius, the <span class="marginNote right"><span class="sc">b.c.</span> 203</span>consul, who had no doubt that to him belonged the glory of giving peace to Italy, as if in pursuit of a Hannibal whom he had driven out himself, crossed over to Sicily, intending to cross from there to Africa. When this was noised abroad at Rome, at first the senators had voted that the praetor<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL381_451_1" id="target_note_LCL381_451_1"><sup>1</sup></a> should write to the consul that the senate thought it proper for him to return to Italy.

Gnaeus Octavius, crossing over from Sicily with two hundred transports and thirty war-ships, was not so fortunate. When he had almost come in sight of Africa after a favourable passage, the wind at first failed him; then shifting into a southwester, it damaged and scattered the ships far and wide.
