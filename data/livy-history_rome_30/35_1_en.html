brought up Gauls from his reserves to face the fresh <span class="marginNote right"><span class="sc">b.c.</span> 203</span>legion. After these had been routed with no great effort, the <span class="italic">hastati</span> of the eleventh legion massed together and attacked the elephants, which by this time were bringing disorder even to the infantry line. When the legionaries had hurled javelins against them in their close order, scarcely one missile being without effect, they drove all the elephants back into their own battle-line. Four of them, hampered by wounds, fell to the ground. Then for the first time the enemy’s line was driven back, since all the cavalry, on seeing the elephants in flight, dashed out to increase the panic and confusion. But so long as Mago stood before the standards, his men as they slowly retired kept their ranks and continued to fight. After they saw him falling with his thigh pierced, and then borne almost lifeless from the battlefield, at once they all took to flight. About five thousand of the enemy were slain that day and twenty-two military standards were captured. Nor was it a bloodless victory for the Romans. Two thousand three hundred were lost from the army of the praetor, much the larger part of them from the twelfth legion; from it also two tribunes of the soldiers, Marcus Cosconius and Marcus Maevius. Of the thirteenth legion also, which had taken part in the last phase of the battle, Gaius Helvius, tribune of the soldiers, fell while rallying the men. And about twenty-two knights of the upper class were trampled by the elephants and perished together with a number of centurions. Also the engagement would have lasted even longer, had not victory been conceded because of the general’s wound.</p>
