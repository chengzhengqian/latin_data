upon Hannibal’s passage into Italy they remembered <span class="marginNote right"><span class="sc">b.c.</span> 203</span>what alarm and panic there had been. Since that time what disasters, what sorrows had befallen them! The enemy’s camp had been visible from the walls of the city; what prayers had been said by individuals and by the entire people! How often in their deliberations had men been heard to say, as they lifted their hands to heaven, Would the day ever come when they should see Italy cleared of the enemy and prospering in a blessed peace! At last, they said, but not before the sixteenth year, the gods had granted that prayer; and yet there was no one to propose a vote of thanks to the gods; so true was it that men did not gratefully receive a blessing upon its coming, much less duly remember it when past. Upon that shouts came from every part of the Senate House that Publius Aelius, the praetor, should bring up the question. And it was voted that for five days thanks should be offered at all the <span class="italic">pulvinaria,</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL381_445_1" id="target_note_LCL381_445_1"><sup>1</sup></a> also that a hundred and twenty full-grown
victims should be sacrificed.</p>
<p>After Laelius and the envoys of Masinissa had been dismissed, word came that the Carthaginian envoys, on their way to the senate to sue for peace, had been seen at Puteoli and would proceed thence by land. Whereupon it was decided that Gaius Laelius should be recalled,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL381_445_2" id="target_note_LCL381_445_2"><sup>2</sup></a> in order that the discussion of peace might be in his presence. Quintus Fulvius Gillo, Scipio’s lieutenant, conducted the Carthaginians to Rome. Being forbidden to enter the city, they were entertained in the Villa Publica and a hearing in the senate was granted them in the Temple of Bellona.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL381_445_3a" id="target_note_LCL381_445_3a"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
