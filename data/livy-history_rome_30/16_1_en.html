surprise. For how could an easily manœuvred fleet, <span class="marginNote right"><span class="sc">b.c.</span> 203</span>properly rigged with ship’s gear and armed, have been resisted by ships carrying artillery and engines, and either converted now into transports or lying so close to the walls as to make scaling possible as if from an embankment and drawbridges?</p>
<p>Consequently Scipio, on reaching the place, gave those war-ships<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL381_397_1" id="target_note_LCL381_397_1"><sup>1</sup></a> which might have defended the others a place in the rear line near the land, contrary to the usual practice in a naval battle. On the other hand he placed four lines of transports as a bulwark against the enemy. To prevent the lines from being broken in the confusion of the battle he also held these transports together by placing masts and yards crosswise from ship to ship and lashing them with stout ropes as if by a single cable. In addition he laid down planks above to make a gangway the whole length of the line of ships; and beneath these bridges he left openings where scouting vessels could dash out against the enemy and return in safety. These preparations having been hastily completed as best the circumstances permitted, about a thousand picked fighting men were placed on board the transports. A vast number of weapons, chiefly missiles, were assembled, that they might be sufficient for a battle no matter how long-continued. Thus equipped and alert they were awaiting the approach of the enemy.</p>
