Not unlike were the feelings of the Carthaginians, who at one moment, when they thought of Hannibal and the greatness of his achievements, regretted having sued for peace, at another moment, on reflecting that they had been twice defeated in battle,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL381_469_1" id="target_note_LCL381_469_1"><sup>1</sup></a> that Syphax had been captured, that they had been driven out of Spain, driven out of Italy, and all this accomplished by the courage and strategy of Scipio alone, they dreaded him as a predestined commander, born to work their destruction.</p>

That this was the case no one can believe after comparing the passage Livy must have had before him, or tried to recall, as he wrote our sentence. For Polybius’ “after a few days” (v. 3) makes no connection with the landing, but merely with the receipt of an urgent message from Carthage. That may have come to him many months—even a year—after disembarkation. Hannibal would be the last to shorten the long preparation indispensable to the making of an army out of his heterogeneous forces.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL381_469_3a').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL381_469_4b"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL381_469_4b" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">4</sup>there as proconsul); Vitruvius VIII. iii. 24.
