<h3><span class="ac">Summary of Book XXX</span></h3>
<p>Scipio in Africa defeated the Carthaginians and the same Syphax, King of Numidia, and Hasdrubal in a number of battles with the aid of Masinissa. He took by assault two camps of the enemy, in which forty thousand men were wiped out by sword and fire. He captured Syphax by the help of Gaius Laelius and Masinissa. Masinissa, having captured Sophoniba, wife of Syphax and daughter of Hasdrubal, at once fell in love and after marrying her had her to wife. When rebuked by Scipio he sent her poison, and upon drinking it she died. The consequence of Scipio’s many victories was that the Carthaginians, driven to despair, recalled Hannibal to the defence of the state. And he, withdrawing from Italy in the sixteenth year, crossed over to Africa and endeavoured by a conference to make peace with Scipio; and as there was no agreement on the peace terms, he was vanquished in battle. The Carthaginians sued for peace and it was granted them. When Gisgo argued against a peace, Hannibal with his own hand dragged him down. Then after apologizing for the rashness of his act, he himself argued in favour of peace. Masinissa’s kingdom was restored to him. Returning to the city Scipio celebrated a most splendid and distinguished triumph, followed by Quintus Terentius Culleo, a senator, wearing a liberty cap. Whether Scipio Africanus received that cognomen first from his popularity with the soldiers or from fickle favour of the people is not known. Certainly he was the first commander-in-chief to be distinguished by the name of a nation he had conquered. Mago was wounded in a war in which he had come in conflict with Romans in the land of the Insubrians, and while returning to Africa, having been recalled by envoys, he died of his wound.</p>
