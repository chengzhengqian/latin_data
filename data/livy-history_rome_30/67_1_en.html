Over twenty thousand of the Carthaginians and their allies were slain on that day. About the same number were captured, together with one hundred and thirty-two military standards and eleven elephants. Of the victors about fifteen hundred fell.</p>
<p>Hannibal, escaping with a few horsemen in the midst of the confusion, fled to Hadrumetum,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL381_499_1a" id="target_note_LCL381_499_1a"><sup>1</sup></a> having tried every expedient both before the battle and during the engagement before he withdrew from the fray. And even by Scipio’s admission and that of all the military experts he had achieved this distinction, that he had drawn up his line that day with extraordinary skill: the elephants in the very front, that their haphazard charge and irresistible strength might prevent the Romans from following their standards and keeping their ranks, upon which tactics they based most of their hopes; then the auxiliaries in front of the line of Carthaginians, that men who were brought together from the offscouring of all nations and held not by loyalty but by their pay might have no way of escape open to them; that at the same time, as they met the first fiery attack of the enemy, they might exhaust them, and if they could do no more, might blunt the enemy’s swords

Both claim that he covered the distance in two days and two nights. In reality Zama Regia is about 90 miles due west of Hadrumetum. Naraggara would be ca. 170 Roman miles from that seaport, if the shorter and less rugged southerly route was taken. Every probability, however, favours the supposition that the battle was fought much nearer to Sicca Veneria, and not more than 120 miles from Hadrumetum; cf. p. 547 ff.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL381_499_1a').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
