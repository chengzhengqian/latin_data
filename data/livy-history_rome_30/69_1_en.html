Scipio sailed near in order to view the situation of Carthage, not so much for the purpose of an immediate reconnaissance as to humiliate the enemy, and returned to Utica, recalling Octavius also to the same place.</p>
<p>While proceeding from there to Tynes they received news that Vermina,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL381_503_2" id="target_note_LCL381_503_2"><sup>2</sup></a> the son of Syphax, commanding more cavalry than infantry was coming to the help of the Carthaginians.

The prince himself in the midst of the confusion escaped with a few men. Then camp was pitched near Tynes on the same site as before, and thirty envoys from Carthage came to Scipio.</p>
