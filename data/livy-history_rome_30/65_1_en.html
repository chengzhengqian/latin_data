Consequently by the first attack the Romans at once dislodged the enemy’s line. Then beating them back with their shoulders and the bosses of their shields,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL381_495_1a" id="target_note_LCL381_495_1a"><sup>1</sup></a> being now in close contact with men forced from their position, they made considerable progress, as no one offered any resistance, while as soon as they saw that the enemy’s line had given way, even the rear line pressed upon the first, a circumstance which of itself gave them great force in repulsing the enemy. Among the enemy so far was their second line, the Africans and Carthaginians, from supporting the auxiliaries as they gave way, that on the contrary they even drew back for fear the enemy, by slaying the men of the first line if these stoutly resisted, should reach themselves. Accordingly the auxiliaries suddenly retreated and facing their own men, some found refuge in the second line, others, having been refused aid shortly before, and also admission now to the ranks, slashed at those who would not make place for them. And by this time there were almost two battles in one, since the Carthaginians were forced to engage with the enemy and at the same time with their own men. Nevertheless even so they did not admit the panic-stricken, angry men into the line, but closing up their ranks, they forced them out upon the wings and into the empty plain on this side and that outside of the battle, in order not to contaminate their own line, still intact and fresh, with soldiers alarmed by the flight and their wounds.</p>
