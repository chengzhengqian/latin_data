Then when Roman infantry<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL381_405_2" id="target_note_LCL381_405_2"><sup>2</sup></a> by a sudden movement into the openings made for them by troops of their own cavalry had steadied the battle-line
and checked the wild charge of the enemy, the barbarians at first gave their horses less rein, then were at a standstill and all but confounded by the strange tactics. Finally they not only gave way before the infantry but did not withstand the cavalry either, who were emboldened by the protection of infantry.

The slaughter in that battle was not in proportion to the scale of the victory, since only a cavalry battle had been fought. Not more than five thousand men were slain; less than half of that number were captured in an attack upon the camp, to which very many men, losing heart with the loss of their king, had retreated.</p>
