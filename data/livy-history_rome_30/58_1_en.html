<p>“It belongs, to be sure, to the giver of peace, not to the suitor, to name the terms. But possibly we may not be unworthy to impose a penalty upon ourselves. We do not reject the condition that all the possessions for which we went to war shall be yours—Sicily, Sardinia,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL381_481_1" id="target_note_LCL381_481_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Spain, and any islands existing in all the sea between Africa and Italy.
