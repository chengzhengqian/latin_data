emperor, harping upon the dreaded name of Procopius,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL315_535_1" id="target_note_LCL315_535_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and declaring that if he returned<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL315_535_2" id="target_note_LCL315_535_2"><sup>2</sup></a> on learning of the death of Julian, he would with the fresh troops under his command easily and without opposition make himself emperor.</p>

Jovian, inflamed by these dangerous hints too continually repeated, without delay surrendered all that was asked, except that with difficulty he succeeded in bringing it about that Nisibis and Singara should pass into control of the Persians without their inhabitants, and that the Romans in the fortresses that were to be taken from us should be allowed to return to our protection.</p>
