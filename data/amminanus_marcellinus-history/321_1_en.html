decrees determined for the future by the law of the fates, which the Greeks call τεθειμένα;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL315_95_1" id="target_note_LCL315_95_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and therefore the ancient theologians gave her a share in the bed and throne of Jupiter, the life-giving power.</p>
<p>9. Auguries and auspices are not gained from the will of the fowls of the air which have no knowledge of future events (for that not even a fool will maintain), but a god so directs the flight of birds that the sound of their bills or the passing flight of their wings in disturbed or in gentle passage foretells future events. For the goodness of the deity, either because men deserve it, or moved by his affection for them, loves by these arts also to reveal impending events.</p>
<p>10. Those, too, who give attention to the prophetic entrails of beasts, which are wont to assume innumerable forms, know of impending events. And the teacher of this branch of learning is one named Tages, who (as the story goes) was seen suddenly to spring from the earth in the regions of Etruria.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL315_95_2" id="target_note_LCL315_95_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>11. Future events are further revealed when men’s hearts are in commotion, but speak divine words. For (as the natural philosophers say) the Sun, the soul of the universe, sending out our minds from himself after the manner of sparks, when he has fired men mightily, makes them aware of the future. And it is for this reason that the Sibyls often say that they are burning, since they are fired by the mighty power of the flames. Besides these, the loud sounds of voices give many signs, as well as the phenomena which meet our eyes, thunder even and lightning, and the gleam of a star’s train of light.</p>
