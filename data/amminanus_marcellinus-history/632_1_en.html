most suited the wish<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL331_63_1" id="target_note_LCL331_63_1"><sup>1</sup></a> of the citizens of Rome; and the fame of this illustrious ruler increased because of his many salutary measures.</p>
<p>10. For he removed all the Maeniana,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL331_63_2" id="target_note_LCL331_63_2"><sup>2</sup></a> the building of which in Rome was forbidden by early laws also, and he separated from the sacred buildings the walls of private houses, which had been irreverently built against them. He established standard weights in every quarter of the city, since otherwise the greed of many, who rigged up their balances after their own inclination, could not be dealt with. And in the examination of legal cases he deserved above all others the distinction which Cicero mentions in the commendation of Brutus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL331_63_3" id="target_note_LCL331_63_3"><sup>3</sup></a> that although he did nothing to gain favour, yet everything that he did was looked upon with favour.</p>

band equipped for plundering, secretly made his way into Mogontiacus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL331_63_5" id="target_note_LCL331_63_5"><sup>5</sup></a> which had no garrison.</p>
<p>2. And since he chanced to find that a festival of the Christian religion<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL331_63_6" id="target_note_LCL331_63_6"><sup>6</sup></a> was being celebrated, he was not hindered in carrying off defenceless men
