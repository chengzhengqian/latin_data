Thrace; these disasters can briefly be set forth, when I come also to that part of my narrative.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL331_313_1" id="target_note_LCL331_313_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>9. This is what happened in the eastern regions. During the course of these events the eternal power<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">373</span><span class="br"></span>
of Justice, the judge, sometimes tardy, but always strict, of right or wrong actions, avenged the disasters in Africa and the still unsatisfied and wandering shades of the envoys of Tripolis,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL331_313_2" id="target_note_LCL331_313_2"><sup>2</sup></a> in the following manner.</p>
<p>10. Remigius, who (as we have said<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL331_313_3" id="target_note_LCL331_313_3"><sup>3</sup></a>) favoured the general Romanus in his oppression of the provinces, after Leo had been appointed chief marshal of the court in his place, was now resting from public duties and gave himself up to rural life in his native place near Mayence.</p>
<p>11. While he was there passing a care-free life, Maximums,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL331_313_4" id="target_note_LCL331_313_4"><sup>4</sup></a> the praetorian prefect, scorning him, now that he turned back to a life of leisure, and being wont to overrun all things like a dire pestilence, aspired to injure him in every possible manner. And in his desire to discover more secrets, he seized Caesarius, who had formerly been in the service of Remigius and later a secretary of the emperor, and tried by cruel tortures to learn what Remigius had done, and how much he had received for aiding the criminal acts of Romanus.</p>
<p>12. When Remigius (who, as has been said, was in retirement) learned of this, either driven by the consciousness of guilt or because the dread of false charges overcame his reason, he strangled himself, and so died.</p>
