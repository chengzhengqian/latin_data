a whole train of executioners to enter, and amid the gloomy clanking of chains had the slaves, who were already drooping through long continued filth and neglect, tortured to the very verge of death, to give evidence to endanger their master’s life: a thing which our merciful laws forbade to be done in a trial for fornication.</p>
<p>56. Finally, when tortures already almost mortal had extorted from a maid-servant a few ambiguous words, without fully examining the trustworthiness of the testimony, he ordered Aginatius to be led off to execution, hastily and without a hearing, although with loud cries he called upon the emperors’ names. Accordingly he was hoisted up<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL331_121_1" id="target_note_LCL331_121_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and put to death; and Anepsia was executed on a like sentence. While Maximinus was thus busied in person when he was in Rome and through his emissaries when he acted from a distance, the Eternal City wept bitterly for its dead.</p>
<p>57. But the final curses of his victims did not sleep. For, under Gratian, as shall be told later at the proper time,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL331_121_3" id="target_note_LCL331_121_3"><sup>3</sup></a> not only did this same Maximinus, because of his intolerable arrogance, fall victim to the executioner’s sword, but Simplicius
also was beheaded in Illyricum. Doryphorianus,
too, was charged with a capital crime and thrown into the prison called Tullianum,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL331_121_4" id="target_note_LCL331_121_4"><sup>4</sup></a> but Gratian, at the suggestion of his mother, had him taken from there, and on his return home put him to death with tremendous tortures. But let us return to the point from which we made this digression. This, if I may say so, was the state of affairs in Rome.</p>
