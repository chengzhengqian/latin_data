emperors<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL331_101_1" id="target_note_LCL331_101_1"><sup>1</sup></a> milder towards him; and at the end of the document were read some reproaches of Valentinian as avaricious and cruel.</p>
<p>21. When the emperor learned this from the report of the judges, who gave what had been done a harsh interpretation, he issued orders that the affair should be investigated with excessive strictness. And since Frontinus, an adviser<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL331_101_2" id="target_note_LCL331_101_2"><sup>2</sup></a> of the said Hymetius, was charged with having drawn up the form of prayer that was made, he was mangled with rods, and having confessed his guilt, was exiled to Britain; but Amantius was later found guilty of a capital crime and executed.</p>
<p>22. After this course of events Hymetius was taken to the town of Ocriculum,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL331_101_3" id="target_note_LCL331_101_3"><sup>3</sup></a> to be heard by Ampelius, prefect of the city,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL331_101_4" id="target_note_LCL331_101_4"><sup>4</sup></a> and Maximums, the deputy-prefect; and when it was evident that he would immediately be condemned to death, he boldly appealed to the emperor’s protection, when the opportunity was given him, and, defended under the refuge of that name, saved his life.</p>
<p>23. When the emperor was consulted<span class="marginNote right">368 ff.</span>
about this matter, he referred the business to the senate. And when they had weighed the case in the scales of justice and learned the truth and had exiled the accused to Boae,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL331_101_5" id="target_note_LCL331_101_5"><sup>5</sup></a> a place in Dalmatia, they could hardly bear the wrath of the emperor, who was greatly incensed on learning that a man whom he had intended to be condemned to death had been punished with a milder sentence.</p>
