the garrison at Nicaea and learning of the betrayal of the usurper by the soldiers and his consequent death, at the fearful hour of midnight unexpectedly attacked Serenianus, who was imprisoned within the palace,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL315_641_1" id="target_note_LCL315_641_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and killed him; and his death saved the lives of many.</p>
<p>2. For if this man of rude nature, burning with a cruel desire to hurt, had survived the victory, being dear to Valens because of their likeness of character and their common fatherland, and well aware of the secret wishes of a prince inclined to cruelty, he would have caused the death of many innocent people.</p>
<p>3. After killing Serenianus, Marcellus quickly got possession of Chalcedon, and, supported by the cheers of a few, whom their worthlessness and desperation drove to crime, seized the shadow of a fatal principate. He was deceived by two ideas, first because the kings of the Goths, who had now been conciliated, had sent three thousand men<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL315_641_2" id="target_note_LCL315_641_2"><sup>2</sup></a> to the aid of Procopius, led by his show of relationship to Constantius, and Marcellus thought that these men could for a small sum be brought over to his side; and secondly, because he had not yet learned what had happened in Illyricum.</p>
<p>4. In the midst of this great confusion Aequitius, who had learned from trustworthy sources that the whole burden of the war had been transferred to Asia, marched through the pass of Succi and with all his might tried to open Philippopolis, formerly Eumolpias,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL315_641_3" id="target_note_LCL315_641_3"><sup>3</sup></a> which had been closed by the enemyâ€™s garrison; for that city was very favourably situated and, if left in his rear, could hinder his attempt, if he should be compelled to hasten to Haemimontus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL315_641_4" id="target_note_LCL315_641_4"><sup>4</sup></a>
