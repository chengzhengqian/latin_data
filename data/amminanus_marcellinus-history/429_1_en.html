<h3><span class="bold">1.</span> <span class="italic">Julianus Augustus vainly tries to restore the temple at Jerusalem, which had been destroyed long before.</span></h3>
<p>1. These were the events of that year, to pass over minor details. But Julian, who had already been consul three times, assumed the chief magistracy for the fourth time, taking as his colleague in the office Sallustius, prefect of Gaul.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL315_311_1" id="target_note_LCL315_311_1"><sup>1</sup></a> And for a private citizen to be associated with the reigning emperor seemed an innovation which no one recalled to have been made since Diocletian and Aristobulus.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL315_311_2" id="target_note_LCL315_311_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
