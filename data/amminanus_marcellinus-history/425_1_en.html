Serapeum, which, though feeble words merely belittle it, yet is so adorned with extensive columned halls, with almost breathing statues, and a great number of other works of art, that next to the Capitolium, with which revered Rome elevates herself to eternity, the whole world beholds nothing more magnificent.</p>
<p>13. In this were invaluable libraries, and the unanimous testimony of ancient records declares that 700,000 books, brought together by the unremitting energy of the Ptolemaic kings, were burned in the Alexandrine war, when the city was sacked under the dictator Caesar.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL315_303_1a" id="target_note_LCL315_303_1a"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>14. At a distance of twelve miles from Alexandria is Canopus, which, according to the statements of ancient writers, got its name from the burial there of Menelaüs’ steersman.

The former was founded by Ptolemy Soter (322–283 <span class="sc">b.c.</span>) and in the time of Callimachus
contained 490,000 volumes; the Serapeum, founded by Ptolemy Philadelphus (285–247 <span class="sc">b.c.</span>), contained 42,800. At the time of the battle of Pharsalia the total number was 532,800 and it may have reached 700,000 by the time of the Alexandrine war. Antony gave Cleopatra 200,000 volumes that had been collected in Pergamum. The damage done by Caesar has been greatly exaggerated. Strabo, who visited Alexandria twenty-three years later, found the Museum intact.
