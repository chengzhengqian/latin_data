<p>6. Later, in the affair of a certain Maxentius of Pannonia, when the judge had rightly commanded a speedy execution, the emperor ordered the death of the decurions of three towns; but Eupraxius, who was then quaestor, intervened, saying: “Act more mercifully, most dutiful emperor, for these men whom you order to be put to death as criminals the Christian religion will honour as martyrs (that is to say, as beloved of God).”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL331_49_1" id="target_note_LCL331_49_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>7. Eupraxius’ helpful self-confidence was imitated by the prefect Florentius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL331_49_2" id="target_note_LCL331_49_2"><sup>2</sup></a> when he heard that, because of some pardonable offence, the emperor had flown into a passion and ordered the execution likewise of three decurions in each of a number of cities; for he said: “What is to be done, then, if any town does not have so many decurions?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL331_49_3" id="target_note_LCL331_49_3"><sup>3</sup></a> To the rest this also should be added,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL331_49_4a" id="target_note_LCL331_49_4a"><sup>4</sup></a> that they shall be killed, when the town has them.”</p>
<p>8. To this ruthlessness was added another thing, dreadful to do or even to tell of, namely, that if anyone came before him to avoid being tried before some powerful enemy, and asked that another judge be assigned him, the request was denied and the man was sent back to the person whom he feared, however many just reasons for the change he might present. Still another horrible thing was talked about; for when he learned that any debtor<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL331_49_5" id="target_note_LCL331_49_5"><sup>5</sup></a> could pay nothing because of the pressure of want, the emperor ruled that he ought to be put to death.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL331_49_6" id="target_note_LCL331_49_6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
