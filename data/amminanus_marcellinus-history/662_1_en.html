<h3><span class="bold">2</span>. <span class="italic">Valentinian Augustus fortifies the entire Gallic bank of the Rhine with fortresses, castles, and towers. The Alamanni kill some Romans who were building a fortification on the far side of the Rhine, Maratocuprenian freebooters, by order of Valens Augustus, were destroyed in Syria with their children and their village.</span></h3>
<p>1. But Valentinian, meditating important and<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">369</span><span class="br"></span>
useful plans, fortified the entire Rhine from the beginnings of Raetia as far as the strait of the Ocean<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL331_123_1" id="target_note_LCL331_123_1"><sup>1</sup></a> with great earthworks, erecting lofty fortresses and castles, and towers at frequent intervals, in suitable and convenient places as far as the whole length of Gaul extends; in some places also works were constructed even on the farther bank of the river,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL331_123_2" id="target_note_LCL331_123_2"><sup>2</sup></a> which flows by the lands of the savages.</p>

<p>3. For during many days beams of oak were bound together<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL331_123_4" id="target_note_LCL331_123_4"><sup>4</sup></a> and placed in the bed of the river; but although they were fastened again and again by great piles driven close to them on both sides, they were forced from their place by the rising waters, and finally were swept away by the force of the current and lost.</p>
<p>4. Yet finally the day was won by the efficient supervision of the emperor
