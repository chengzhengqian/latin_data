Their climate is agreeable and healthful, the sky is clear, the winds gentle and very pleasant. There is an abundance of well-lighted woods, the trees of which produce a substance which they work with frequent sprinkling, like a kind of fleece; then from the wool-like material, mixed with water, they draw out very fine threads, spin the yarn, and make sericum,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL315_387_1" id="target_note_LCL315_387_1"><sup>1</sup></a> formerly for the use of the nobility, but nowadays available even to the lowest without any distinction.</p>

Moreover, this same Aria has many cities, among which the following are renowned: Vitaxa Sarmatina, Sotira, Nisibis, and Alexandria, from which the voyage to the Caspian Sea is reckoned as fifteen hundred stadia.</p>
