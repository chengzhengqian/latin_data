with people of the court, as has been said, and through his very worthlessness easy to be hired to commit any and every crime, he accused that admirable pair of consuls, the two brothers Eusebius and Hypatius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL331_221_1" id="target_note_LCL331_221_1"><sup>1</sup></a> (connections by marriage of the late emperor Constantius) of having aspired to a desire for a higher fortune, and of having made inquiries and formed plans about the sovereignty; and he added to the path<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL331_221_2" id="target_note_LCL331_221_2"><sup>2</sup></a> which he had falsely devised for his fabrication that royal robes had even been made ready for Eusebius.</p>
<p>10. Eagerly drinking this in, the menacing madman,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL331_221_3" id="target_note_LCL331_221_3"><sup>3</sup></a> to whom nothing ought to have been permitted, since he thought that everything, even what was unjust, was allowed him,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL331_221_4" id="target_note_LCL331_221_4"><sup>4</sup></a> inexorably summoned from the farthest boundaries of the empire all those whom the accuser, exempt from the laws, with profound assurance had insisted ought to be brought before him, and ordered a calumnious trial to be set on foot.</p>
<p>11. And when in muchknotted
bonds of constriction justice had long been trodden down and tied tightly, and the wretched scoundrel persisted in his strings of assertions, severe tortures could force no confession, but showed that these distinguished men were far removed even from any knowledge of anything of the kind. Nevertheless, the calumniator was as highly honoured as before, while the accused were punished with exile and with fines; but shortly afterwards they were recalled, had their fines remitted, and were restored to their former rank and honour unimpaired.</p>
