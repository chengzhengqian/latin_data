Regulus and her children were supported. And the daughter of Scipio<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL300_43_1" id="target_note_LCL300_43_1"><sup>1</sup></a> received her dowry from the public treasury, since the nobles blushed to look upon the beauty of this marriageable maiden long unsought because of the absence of a father of modest means.</p>
<p>12. But now-a-days, if as a stranger<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL300_43_2" id="target_note_LCL300_43_2"><sup>2</sup></a> of good position you enter for the first time to pay your respects to some man who is well-to-do<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL300_43_3" id="target_note_LCL300_43_3"><sup>3</sup></a> and therefore puffed up, at first you will be greeted as if you were an eagerly expected friend, and after being asked many questions and forced to lie, you will wonder, since the man never saw you before, that a great personage should pay such marked attention to your humble self as to make you regret, because of such special kindness, that you did not see Rome ten years earlier.</p>

When, encouraged by this affability, you make the same call on the following day, you will hang about unknown and unexpected, while the man who the day before urged you to call again counts up his clients, wondering who you are or whence you came. But when you are at last recognized and admitted to his friendship, if you devote yourself to calling upon him for three years without interruption, then are away for the same number of days, and return to go through with a similar course, you will not be asked where you were, and unless you abandon the quest in sorrow, you will waste your whole life to no purpose in paying court to the blockhead.</p>
