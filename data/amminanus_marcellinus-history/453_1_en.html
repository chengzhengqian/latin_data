Assyria. There, besides a great abundance of berries and common fruits, bitumen is found near the lake called Sosingites, in whose bed the Tigris is swallowed up, and then, after flowing under ground, and traversing a long distance,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL315_359_1" id="target_note_LCL315_359_1"><sup>1</sup></a> appears again.</p>

And from this also a noxious vapour with a penetrating stench came forth and was destructive to whatever came near it, excepting only eunuchs; and the reason for this may be left to natural philosophers to determine.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL315_359_4" id="target_note_LCL315_359_4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
