Theodosius, he humbly begged that the general would order Masilla, a chief of the Mazices, to appear before him.</p>
<p>52. When Masilla had been sent to Theodosius, as he had asked, the king through him, in a secret interview, urged the general, who by his own nature was inclined to resolution, that in order to provide himself with the means of accomplishing his desires, he should vigorously assail his fellowcountrymen,
and by constant fighting reduce them to fear; he said that they were indeed inclined to favour the public enemy, but were wearied by their many losses.</p>
<p>53. Theodosius did as he was advised, and so wore out the Isaflenses by frequent contests, that they were falling like cattle; and Firmus himself secretly escaped, intending to hide in remote and lasting retreats; but while he was there planning flight, he was taken prisoner by Igmazen and kept in custody.</p>
<p>54. And since he had learned through Masilla of the secret negotiations, he saw that in his extremity only one remedy was left, and decided by a voluntary death to spurn with his foot the desire to live. Accordingly, having purposely filled his guards with wine and made them drunk, and in the silence of the night they were buried in sound sleep, he himself, kept awake by fear of the trouble which hung over him, with noiseless steps<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL331_279_1" id="target_note_LCL331_279_1"><sup>1</sup></a> left his bed, by creeping on hands and knees<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL331_279_1" id="target_note_LCL331_279_1"><sup>1</sup></a> got himself some distance off, and finding a rope which he had procured for the calamity of ending his life, he hung it from a nail fastened in the wall, and putting his neck in it breathed his last without the torments of a painful death.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL331_279_2" id="target_note_LCL331_279_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
