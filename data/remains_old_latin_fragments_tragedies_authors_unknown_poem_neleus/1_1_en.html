<p>from Iolcus by Pelias, met with adventures which appear to be outside the plot of the<span class="italic"> Carmen</span>; for the <span class="italic">carmen</span> was probably modelled on the lost play <span class="italic">Tyro</span> of Sophocles. The story of Tyro and her sons would interest the Romans even of Livius’
time because it was a sort of parallel to the exposure of Romulus and Remus, the sons of Rhea Sylvia by Mars, their survival, and the restoration by them of their deposed grandfather Numitor. Of the surviving fragments given below, 1, 2, and 3 are probably words spoken by Tyro in describing her sufferings at the hands of Sidero; in 4 one of the two brothers maintains that they must help their mother; 5 expresses a commonplace. On the whole subject, see H. de la Ville de Mirmont, <span class="italic">Études sur l’ancienne poésie latine,</span> pp. 205 ff. I have added also two frs. which are quoted from ancient poetry.</p>
