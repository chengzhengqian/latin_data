<p>But lo! Gradivus coming from his Getic caverns and trailing a huge cloud over the northern seas beholds in amazement the Minyans in the Aeaean city and the old king entreated and the fleece vouchsafed to the Thessalian youth. Swiftly he hastens to the starry palace of his sire on high, and with bitter complaint calls Jove to witness: “What end is there, great king, to faction? Now are we gods plotting mutual destruction for naught but human glory, and all this pleases thee, who drivest not the insensate Pallas from heaven nor settest thy law against a woman’s daring.

What Mars suspects is a compact, engineered by Minerva, between Aeetes and Jason, by which, in return for his help against Perses, Jason shall have the fleece. This, to Mars, is underhand work; he says he is perfectly capable of repulsing Perses and the Minyans as well. Straightforward hostility (cf. “palam” in 630) he does not mind; he suggests a single combat between himself and Minerva.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL286_291_2a').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
