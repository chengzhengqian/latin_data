Then he bids the rowers stop and here first make fast the cables, as though he had entered Pagasae and his native stream. Himself duly bearing in a heavy bowl the sacred offering of wine calls to the shade and thus speaks at the altar: â€œPhrixus, I pray thee, by our kindred Wood and kindred labours, guide thou my enterprise and protect me in these lands who have endured so many seas, so many hurrying northern stars. Be favourable, Phrixus, and in kindly mood remember thy native land. Do thou too now, who wert vainly laid in an empty tomb,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL286_259_1" id="target_note_LCL286_259_1"><sup>1</sup></a> give mark of approval, goddess of the sea, and aid the cause of thy kinsfolk.

You too, ye woods and shores of hospitable Colchis, reveal where the rich pelt glitters on the sacred tree. Then do thou, O Phasis, offspring of fecund Jove, born in the snowy region of the Arcadian nymph, do thou but accept with tranquil stream the bark of Pallas, neither gifts nor shrines shall be lacking to thee in my land; an effigy awaits thee, O Phasis, that whoso beholds may reverence, as mighty as great Enipeus
