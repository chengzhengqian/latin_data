wearies heaven above and Tartarus beneath with her complaints; she beats upon the ground, and murmuring into her clutching hands calls on the Queen of Night and Dis to bring her aid by granting death, and to send him who is the cause of all her madness down with her to destruction; and now she fiercely demands Pelias, who vented his wrath so murderously upon the youth; often again she is resolved to promise her skill to the unhappy man, then again refuses, and is determined rather to perish with him; and she cries that never will she yield to so base a passion nor proffer powerful aid to one she knows not; and on her bed she stays outstretched, when once again she seemed to be summoned, and the doors grated as their hinges moved.</p>
<p>When therefore she felt that she was being utterly vanquished by some strange power, and that all shame’s former promptings were torn away, then sought she her secret bower to find the mightiest aid she knew for the captain of the Haemonian ship. And when from afar the chambers breathing magic spells burst open and the grim doors flew wide, and she gazed at all that she had torn from the ocean-bed or from the shades below, or drawn down from the blood-red visage of the moon, “Wilt thou pursue,” she said, “or submit to aught that is shameful, when thou hast so many means of death and quick escape from a deed so wicked?”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL286_385_1" id="target_note_LCL286_385_1"><sup>1</sup></a> So saying, she gazes with full force of her vision, but all in vain, upon the swiftest of her poisons, and lingers over it, and would fain summon up her wrath upon death’s brink.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL286_385_2" id="target_note_LCL286_385_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Ah! daylight all too sweet, and dearer yet in the very hour of death!
