wands that dripped with Eastern blood.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL286_251_1" id="target_note_LCL286_251_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Him do ye still remember, ye waters, how after returning from his wars and from breaking the Red Seaâ€™s farthest barriers, here did he arouse his sluggish votaries and their cymbals and bind his moist horns with wreaths of vine-leaves, in such mood as the Theban Maenad and unhappy Cithaeron would fain have seen.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL286_251_2" id="target_note_LCL286_251_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>But meantime Fame irrepressible has flown already through the farthest regions of the world below, and filled the ghosts with the high praises of their sons, telling that sea is now added to sea, and that now the Cyanean rocks lie open. They burn to raise their eager faces, all whom love of kindred or jealous valour still doth stir. Their destinies abide unchanged: one only, whose grave was on that shore, send they to view the beloved band. Sthenelus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL286_251_3a" id="target_note_LCL286_251_3a"><sup>3</sup></a> goes forth: as he was when the martial Amazon beheld him and when Alcides buried his comrade, clad in his own armour, even so flashed he forth as he rose from his funeral mound upon the strand; so glistened the waves, as though the mighty sun were lifting his orb into the sky or heaven were crashing cloud on cloud. Scarce beheld they the vision, when straightway night rapt it away in sombre shade. In grief the spirit sought the deep void again. While Mopsus marvels at the omen, he sees the barrow far away at the limit of the strand, and veiling his head pours wine and calls upon the ghost. Moreover, the Odrysian chief begins in order due the chant that shall appease the spirit they have seen, and strikes his echoing lyre, singing the while, and bequeaths a name to the sands.</p>
