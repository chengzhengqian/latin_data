hides her father, while she must seek escape for him, poor wretch, by other means. She beheld a ship outworn with the toils of the savage sea, long since offered up to Thetis and to Glaucus, which passing time had scorched with its suns and the moon with her hoarfrosts had worn. Hither with all speed through the darkness and silence of midnight she haled her father from the woods, and thus in sorrow spake: “What a land, my father, what homes lately so prosperous, dost thou leave, spoiled of their manhood! Oh horrible pollution! Oh the ruin wrought in one bitter night! How can I trust thee to so frail a ship, father dear? How can I keep thee here amid these great dangers? Alas, I am paying at length for my crime of cunning! Hear my prayer, goddess, thou who now drivest thy slumbrous car across the ocean. I ask no subject peoples for my father, no bounteous land, no throne; only grant that he go forth from his home and country. When shall I be borne through the midst of the city, happy that my father’s life was saved? When shall I see tears and lamentations in this land?”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL286_95_1" id="target_note_LCL286_95_1"><sup>1</sup></a> She finished; he in fear escapes in the oarless ship afar, and reaches the dwelling of the Tauri and Diana’s savage shrine. Here didst thou, goddess, put a sword in his hand, and didst appoint him warden of thy cheerless altar; but thou madest no long sojourn in that bloodstained land. Already there summon thee the glade of Egeria, lord Jupiter at Alba, and Aricia stern to her king alone.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL286_95_2a" id="target_note_LCL286_95_2a"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

The priest of the shrine of Diana was called the “rex Nemorensis,” and seems to have been a runaway slave who must slay his predecessor before he could be priest himself. The runaways found asylum there.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL286_95_2a').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
