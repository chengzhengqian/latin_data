awful fate. Then with his comrades he makes for the left coast<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL286_441_1" id="target_note_LCL286_441_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and the fronting shore of Peuce far away (for a double bend of Danube sunders the islet from the land); here in their anchorage have long been waiting the Minyae and the ship of Pagasae, there the Aeetian hero leads up his fleet to besiege the Thessalian camp, eager to fight. Yet no chance of battle is given him; night and day the waters seethe with mighty billows between them, till Juno’s schemes work themselves out and her anxious care set some ending to the war.</p>
<p>But the Minyae, as they ponder the issue of so bitter a fight, all assail and weary the son of Aeson with protests and entreaties. Why does he expose them, entrapped thus, for a foreign woman’s sake? why compel them to court such perils? Let him regard the more numerous lives, the nobler destinies of so many comrades who are following him over the sea, not through promptings of frenzy or unhallowed desire, but through gallantry alone. Or have they come that one only may indulge the joys of wedlock and stolen nuptials? A fitting time, indeed! For the Greeks the fleece were enough, and to be able to end the war by giving up the maiden. Let him suffer each to seek his home, nor let this Fury<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL286_441_2" id="target_note_LCL286_441_2"><sup>2</sup></a> first pit Europe against Asia in bloody war. For this was what the Fates decreed, as Mopsus sang in supplication and fear, that quarrel should rather pass to their latest offspring and another ravisher<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL286_441_3" id="target_note_LCL286_441_3"><sup>3</sup></a> expiate so dire a conflagration.</p>
