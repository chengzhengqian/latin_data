trust your own tale—your king has flung upon the waves and forbidden to return, that he may possess, forsooth, the gold of the Aeolian ram! Ere that shall my own Caucasus descend, its shadowy forests felled, and over the seas track out the Haemonian robbers; ere that <span class="italic">shall I see return living from the deep</span> that Helle whose image I have bidden be set up adorned with funeral chaplets.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL286_365_1" id="target_note_LCL286_365_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Yet if otherwise thou refusest to depart from this land, if shame of a fruitless homecoming moves thee and if aught more than its crew lies hidden<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL286_365_2" id="target_note_LCL286_365_2"><sup>2</sup></a> in that one ship, I will not withhold what ye demand: only do thou first perform what I bid thee. Before the city there lies the plain of Mars, rough with neglect through many years, and fiery bulls there are, slow sometimes to recognise even me when the ploughshare bites the ground. These more and more have my increasing years now suffered to grow wild and unruly, and a prouder flame than of wont shoots from their bellowing mouths. Succeed then, valiant stranger, to my renown, and till my fields once more. The seed which once I sowed will not be lacking, nor the harvest which I encountered alone. One night will suffice for thy decision, alone with thy gods consider my behest; and if there be aught in that wooden hulk of thine, thou wilt undertake the rustic toil I told thee of. For myself, I know not yet whether I would have thee straightway enwrapped in flame and darkness, or rather see thee endure a while till the plain be upturned and the seeds sown and warriors come forth from the teeth of Cadmus’ snake and the fallows flower with armed men.”</p>
