doubting Centors and the Choatrae feared for horrid magic; all honour the gods with savage rites, all have skill to work portents; now do they hold the leaves of spring in check, now suddenly thaw Maeotis beneath trembling waggons. Mightiest among them in Stygian arts Coastes comes: not love of war excites him, but the fame of the Cytaean maid and Medea breathing poisons to match his own; glad is the Avernian lake, glad the ferryman that night is now untroubled, and Latonia that she can ride in a safe heaven.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL286_313_1" id="target_note_LCL286_313_1"><sup>1</sup></a> There also marched the Balloniti, whose bow-tips twain give speed that matches wings,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL286_313_2a" id="target_note_LCL286_313_2a"><sup>2</sup></a> and the Moesian changing nimbly from steed to companion steed, and the Sarmatian who puts a rein upon his huge lance. Boreas drives not so many billows from ocean’s bounds, nor so answers his brothers from opposing waves:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL286_313_3" id="target_note_LCL286_313_3"><sup>3</sup></a> not so loud is the clamour of birds about the rivers, as is then the blare of trumpets that ascends to heaven, filling with frenzy the mingled myriads, numerous as leaves or flowers in the opening year. The plain itself groans beneath the beat of wheels, and the ground trembles and quakes at the shock, as when Jupiter strikes Phlegra with his angry brand and hurls back Typhon to the deepest recesses of the earth.</p>
<p>Upon the other side Absyrtus in his father’s armour holds first place, and the suitor prince, and mighty kings amid their thousands. But around Aesonides stand the Danaan heroes and Pallas herself
