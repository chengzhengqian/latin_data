<h2><span class="italic">Brutus</span></h2>
<p>by night. When Lucretia had told her story and killed herself, Brutus threw off his pretended stupidity, and agreed to help Collatinus in avenging her. Under Brutus’ guidance the people of Collatia resolved to renounce Tarquin and all his house. Lucretia’s body was escorted to Rome; Brutus, who was <span class="italic">tribunus celerum,</span> told the people of the outrage, and Tarquin and his family were banished. Brutus returned to Ardea, and gained the support of the army, but Tarquin found Rome closed against him. Brutus and Collatinus became the first consuls at Rome, where a republic was now set up.</p>

<p><span class="italic">King Tarquin’s dream:</span></p>
<p>Cicero: What manner of dream was that of Tarquin the. Proud? He himself speaks of it in Accius’ <span class="italic">Brutus</span>—</p>

<p>When now at night’s onset I duly gave my body to rest, soothing weary limbs with sleep, I saw a vision in a dream—a shepherd drove towards me a woolly flock of surpassing beauty; two brother-rams were chosen from among them, and I sacrificed the nobler of the two. Then its own brother butted with its horns, and rammed at me, and with that blow I was brought to a fall; then thrown on the ground and sorely hurt, as I lay on my back I saw in the sky a thing most mighty and most wonderful—the sun’s flame-beaming orb melted away to the right hand in a new course.</p>
