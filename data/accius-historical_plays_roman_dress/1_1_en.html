<p>the Apennines, pursued by the Roman consuls. The two armies met near Sentinum in 295; Fabius on the right wing steadily drove back the Samnites, but on the left the warchariots of the Gauls scattered the Roman cavalry. Decius Mus, mindful of his father’s sacrifice, devoted himself and the hosts of the enemy to the powers below and was himself killed by the Gauls. But his soldiers recovered themselves, and, with the aid of reserves sent up by Fabius, the battle was saved. The Samnites and the Gauls were now routed by Rome’s Campanian cavalry, Gellius was slain, and victory remained with the Romans.</p>
