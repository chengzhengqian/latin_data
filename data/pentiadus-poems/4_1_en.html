Tempe are fragrant with flowers beyond all count. Mid hollow rocks resounds Echo to the lowing herd: the note reverberated by the heights mid hollow rocks resounds. Wine-filled clusters<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL434_549_a" id="target_note_LCL434_549_a">

</a> swell, linked among their neighbour elms: mid married leafage wine-filled clusters swell. The familiar roof-timber already at daybreak is being smeared with mud by the twittering swallow; as she repairs her nest, she smears the familiar roof-timber. Under the green plane-tree sleep takes pleasure in the shade: and garlands are a-twining under the green plane-tree. Then too ’twere sweet to die: then run, ye threads of destiny, back on the spindles:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL434_549_b" id="target_note_LCL434_549_b">

<p>The youth who had a river for sire<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL434_549_c" id="target_note_LCL434_549_c">

</a> was ever fond of fountains: the waters won praise from him who had a river for sire. The youth beholds himself as he seeks his sire in the river; in the translucent pool the youth beholds himself. When a Dryad is fired with passion, the youth flouts such love: he deems it ne’er an honour that a Dryad is fired with passion. He stands astonished; halts and falls in love, questions, nods, gazes all aflame; now coaxing, now reproaching, he stands astonished; halts and falls in love. And what he loves, himself he makes<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL434_549_d" id="target_note_LCL434_549_d">

</a> in look, entreaty, eye and tears; prints kisses on the fountain, and what he loves, himself he makes.</p>
