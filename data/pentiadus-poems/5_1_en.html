<p>This is he who trusted overmuch in the pools which were his kin—the youth Narcissus, worthy of no counterfeit love. You behold him making again from the moist meadow for the river-banks in hope of beholding the waters which wrought his doom.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL434_551_b" id="target_note_LCL434_551_b">
