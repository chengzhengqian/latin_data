<span class="line">Extinguished is the blazing sun, the rhythm of the planets stilled.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Our skies shall roll away, the radiance of the moon shall die;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Uplands shall he lay low, and valleys raise aloft.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Upheaval leaves to men no eminence or height.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">In one flat plain the mountains lie, and all the seas</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Of azure now shall cease; earth too shall vanish, cracked.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">So shall all springs by fire, all streams alike be quenched.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Still shall a trumpet then with mournful blast resound</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">On high, bewailing wretched deeds and varied toils.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">The vast abyss of Tartaros appears, as earth yawns wide.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
