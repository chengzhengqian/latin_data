universe is located, tiny though it is in comparison with the infinite space of which we have spoken? My opinion is that they will stop short of such empty bombast.</p>
<p>We may assume, then, that they declare that there is a single universe of huge material bulk, yet finite, limited to its own place in space, and created by the action of God. Well, when the question arises about the infinite ages of time before the creation of the universe and why God has remained inactive and inoperative during them, they may give themselves the same answer that they give when asked about the infinite spaces outside the universe and why God remains inactive and inoperative in them. Now it is no necessary conclusion that God acted at random rather than by divine reason when he established the universe in no other place than where it is, though the place he chose had no special claim to be preferred over an infinite number of others which extended in every direction and though we must admit that no human reason can grasp the divine reason that dictated such action. But it is equally illogical to suppose that God was moved by a random whim to establish the universe at that particular time rather than earlier, although it is true that earlier periods of time had been elapsing, all in the same manner, throughout the infinite extent of the past and no difference can be found that might cause one time to be chosen rather than another. But they may say that it is idle for man to contemplate infinite regions of space, since there is no place outside the universe. Our reply to them is that by the same token it is idle for man to contemplate bygone eras
