for punishment, in that case, there would be higher and lighter bodies for the lesser sinners and lower and heavier bodies for those whose sins were greater. Demons, rather than men, good men among them, should have earthen bodies, than which nothing is lower and heavier, for nothing is more wicked than demons. Actually, however, in order to make us see that souls are not to be rated good or bad by the kinds of bodies that they have, the worst demon has an aerial body, whereas a man has a body of clay,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_519_1" id="target_note_LCL413_519_1"><sup>1</sup></a> although man, wicked as he is, is even now far from equal to the demon in the amount and virulence of his will to evil; before he sinned there could be no doubt of this.</p>
<p>But what could be more foolish than to say that the sun is the only sun in the only world, not because God the artificer took thought to adorn his world with beauty or even to further the well-being of the physical world, but rather that it came out so just because one and only one soul had sinned to such a degree that it deserved to be imprisoned in such a body as this? According to this theory, if it had happened that not one but two, nay, not two but ten or a hundred souls, had sinned in the same way and to the same degree, our world would possess one hundred suns. That this did not take place was due, they think, not to the amazing foresight of a Creator who was intent on the health and adornment of physical beings and things, but to the mere chance that one sinning soul arrived at precisely such distance that it alone was duly awarded such a body. Surely it is not the straying of souls, of which they speak without knowing what they are speaking
