Each man will the more speedily and easily avoid the sin of falling into this heresy, the deeper he is able to penetrate into the meaning of God’s words delivered by the angel when he dispatched Moses to the children of Israel: “I am he that is.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_11_1" id="target_note_LCL414_11_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>For, since God is the summit of being, that is to say, he <span class="italic">is</span> supremely and is therefore unchangeable, he granted being to the objects that he created out of nothing, but not the supreme kind of being such as belongs to him. He also granted a larger measure of being to some but less of it to others and so ordered natural entities according to a system of degrees of being. The word ‘being’ (<span class="italic">essentia</span>) bears the same relation to the verb ‘to be’ (<span class="italic">esse</span>) as the noun ‘wisdom’ (<span class="italic">sapientia</span>) to the verb ‘to be wise’ (<span class="italic">sapere</span>).

And that is why there is no natural entity contrary to the nature that <span class="italic">is</span> supremely and to whose agency are due all things that are, unless it be an entity that has no being.
