Indeed, if our only reason for living in this body is to suffer punishment, how can Plato also say that the world could not have been made supremely beautiful and good except by being filled with all kinds of animate beings, that is both immortal and mortal?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_127_1" id="target_note_LCL414_127_1"><sup>1</sup></a> On the other hand, if our creation even as mortals is a divine gift, how can the return to these bodies, that is, to God’s good works, be a punishment?
