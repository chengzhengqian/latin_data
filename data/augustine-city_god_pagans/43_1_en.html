But if you cannot, because she is not in attendance before you to be punished, why do you praise with such eloquence the murderess of an innocent and chaste woman? You certainly cannot defend her at all before those judges of the lower world of whom your poets are continually harping, for she is, of course, numbered among those</p>

If this is the case and the story that there were two and only one committed adultery is false, and both committed adultery instead, one in open attack and the other secretly consenting, then she did not kill herself innocently, and therefore the learned defenders can say she is not in the lower world among those “who guiltless laid fatal hands upon themselves.” But then the case is reduced to a dilemma: if the murder is less heinous,
