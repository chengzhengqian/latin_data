universe by itself is not a god, but rather the soul by itself, or body and soul together—viewed in such a way, however, that its being god is due not to its body but to its mind. Then if Janus is the universe, and Janus is a god, will they have to say that Jupiter, in order to be counted as a god, is some part of Janus?</p>
<p>Their custom is rather to assign the universe to Jupiter, whence the saying of the poet: “Of Jupiter all things are full.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL412_411_1" id="target_note_LCL412_411_1"><sup>1</sup></a> It follows that, if Jupiter is to be a god, and especially the king of the gods, they must regard him as nought else but the world, so that he may reign over the other gods, which are portions of him, according to their doctrine. In accord with this view Varro also, in a book separate from these, which he wrote, <span class="italic">On the Worship of the Gods</span>, explains certain verses of Valerius Soranus. The verses run as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">Jupiter, mighty Father of kings and of gods and of</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">all things,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Mother as well of the gods, one God comprising</span><span class="linebreak"></span>

<p class="noindent">The explanation given in the book mentioned is this: the one who emits seed is called male, and the one who receives it, female; Jupiter is the universe, and both emits all seeds and receives them into himself. Hence it is with good reason, Varro says, that

The fragments of this essay have been repeatedly edited, most recently by B. Cardauns, <span class="italic">Varros Logistoricus über die Götterverehrung</span> (Diss. Köln, 1958). This passage appears as fragment 2 in Cardauns. Fragments 3 and 4 are taken from chapters 34 and 35 below, pp. 497–499. Quintus Valerius Soranus, while serving as tribune of the people in 82 <span class="sc">b.c.</span>, fled before the victorious Sulla and was killed by Pompey in Sicily. Cicero describes him as a neighbour
and acquaintance, more distinguished for his literary studies than for eloquence. Varro often cites his works, both prose and verse. The two hexameters here quoted seem to be a free translation from an Orphic hymn to Zeus, and set forth a doctrine agreeable also to the Stoic theology (0.
