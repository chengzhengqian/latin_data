outside with respect to them will certainly not be unknown to them. For if the prophets had the power to know these things when they had not yet occurred through the presence, to however slight a degree, of God in their mortal minds, how shall the immortal saints fail to know these things after they have already occurred, when God shall be all in all?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL416_393_1" id="target_note_LCL416_393_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>The seed, then, and the name of the saints will remain in that blessedness, the seed, that is, about which John says: “And his seed remains in him,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL416_393_2" id="target_note_LCL416_393_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and the name about which it was said through Isaiah himself: “I will give them an everlasting name.” “For them month shall follow month, and Sabbath shall follow Sabbath,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL416_393_3" id="target_note_LCL416_393_3"><sup>3</sup></a> as if he said “moon after moon and rest after rest.” They will themselves be both seed and name when they pass from these old shadows of time into those new lights of eternity. In the punishment of the wicked the unquenchable fire and the ever-living worm are differently explained by different persons. In fact, some refer both to the body, others refer both to the soul; still others refer the fire to the body in the literal sense, and the worm to the soul in the figurative sense, an interpretation which seems more plausible. But there is no time now to discuss this difference; for we have undertaken to deal in this book only with the last judgement by which the good and the wicked are to be separated; their actual rewards and punishments must be more carefully discussed elsewhere.</p>
