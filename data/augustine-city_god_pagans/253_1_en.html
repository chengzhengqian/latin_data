<p>As for the superfluous doctrines there need be no great controversy, for, as the jurists are wont to say, “Superfluous things do no harm.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL412_101_1" id="target_note_LCL412_101_1"><sup>1</sup></a> But what are the doctrines that are harmful when made known to the crowd? It is such statements as these, he says: “That Hercules, Aesculapius, Castor, and Pollux are not gods, for it is related by the learned that they were men and passed on from the mortal state.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL412_101_2a" id="target_note_LCL412_101_2a"><sup>2</sup></a> And what more? “That the city-states do not have the true images of those who are really gods, because the true God has neither sex nor age nor well-defined bodily parts.” It is these doctrines that the pontiff would not let the people know, for he does not think that they are false. He therefore considers mistaken religious views to be for the advantage of a city. Nor does Varro himself hesitate to say the same in his books on divine affairs.
