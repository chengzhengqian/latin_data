rational in intelligence does not make them superior to us, for so are we; that they are eternal in time, what does that profit them, if they are not blessed? Better temporary felicity than everlasting misery. In that they are affected by emotion, how is that a proof of their superiority to us, since we too are so affected, but would not be were we not unhappy? In that they are aerial in body, of what account is that, since a soul of whatever kind is to be preferred to any body? And therefore religious worship, which ought to come from the mind, can never be due to what is inferior to the mind. Moreover if, among the qualities he attributes to demons, Apuleius had included virtue, wisdom and felicity, and had added that they share these qualities for ever with the gods, then certainly he would be telling us of something desirable and highly valuable. But, even so, this would still be no reason why we ought to worship them as we worship God. Rather we ought to worship God himself, from whom we should know that they had received these gifts. How much less worthy, in fact, of divine honour are these aerial creatures, whose reason merely enables them to be unhappy, whose minds, by being subject to emotion, actually make them unhappy, whose immortality means only that they will never be able to put an end to their unhappiness!</p>
