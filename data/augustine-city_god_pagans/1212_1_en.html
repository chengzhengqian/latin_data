<p>Another case in the same book we examined earlier, when we were dealing with the sterile woman who bore seven children.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL415_345_1" id="target_note_LCL415_345_1"><sup>1</sup></a> By those who know that Christ is the wisdom of God this is usually interpreted at first hearing as referring to nothing else than Christ and the church: “Wisdom has built her house and erected seven columns to support it; she has sacrificed her victims, mixed her wine in the mixing bowl and made ready her table.
