royal power was expelled! They did not, to be sure, complete their year, for Junius Brutus thrust from the city in disgrace his colleague, Lucius Tarquinius Collatinus. Shortly afterward he himself fell in battle at the hands of an enemy, giving as well as receiving wounds, having first slain by his own hands his sons and the brothers of his wife, because he had learned of their conspiring with others to restore Tarquin.</p>
<p>This deed Virgil afterwards mentions with approval, yet instantly shudders at it in the kindness of his heart. Having said,</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">And when a father finds his sons devising wars</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Once more, to save bright freedom, he himself</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Will summon them to execution,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL411_331_1" id="target_note_LCL411_331_1"><sup>1</sup></a></span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">he immediately exclaims,</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">Unhappy he, no matter though his deed</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Be celebrated in the days to come.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">He means, let men to come judge these deeds in any way they will, that is, let them praise and extol the slayer of his sons, yet he is unhappy. And then, as if to console the unhappy man, he adds,</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">Love of country wins, and boundless appetite for</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">praise.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">In the case of this Brutus, who slew his sons and also his enemy, the son of Tarquin, whom, however, he could not himself survive, receiving a blow in return, but rather was survived by Tarquin himself, does not the innocence of his colleague Collatinus appear to have been vindicated, who, though a good citizen, suffered, when this Tarquin was expelled, the same punishment as the tyrannical Tarquin?</p>
