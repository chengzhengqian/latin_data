blessed Mediator, on the other hand, intervened for the express purpose, after he had played his part in mortality, both of giving to the dead the immortality that he had made visible in his own resurrection, and of giving to the miserable that blessedness of which he himself had never taken leave.</p>
<p>So there is an evil mediator who separates friends and a good Mediator who reconciles enemies. And the reason why there are many mediators who separate is that the multitude of the blessed derives its blessed state from participation in one God. Being deprived of this participation and consequently miserable, the multitude of bad angels, who oppose themselves as a hindrance to blessedness rather than interpose themselves as a help towards attaining it, by their very number deafen us with their noise, as it were,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_209_1" id="target_note_LCL413_209_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and block our access to the unique goodness that is the source of bliss. To attain this end, there was no need of many mediators; one alone was enough—one to partake of whom would make us blessed, the uncreated Word of God, through whom all things were created.</p>
<p>That is not to say that he is the Mediator because he is the Word, for the Word, being, as he is, superlatively immortal and superlatively blessed, is far above miserable mortals. Rather he is Mediator by virtue of being man. This is, no doubt, precisely how he makes it plain that to attain the not merely blessed, but bliss-creating final good, we need not seek other mediators by whose aid we might suppose that we must toil upward and reach the goal step by step. We do not need them because a God who is blessed and bliss-creating has become a participator
