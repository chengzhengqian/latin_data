For him there were two requirements. He must not fail to become mortal, yet must not stay permanently mortal. Note that he became mortal, not by any weakening of the divinity of the Word, but by taking upon himself the weakness of the flesh. Yet even in the very flesh he did not remain mortal, since he brought it back to life from the dead, for this is the particular benefit of his mediation, that those for whose liberation he was made Mediator should themselves, like him, no longer remain subject to perpetual death even of the flesh. Accordingly, the Mediator between us and God necessarily had both a temporary mortality and a permanent bliss. His temporary condition made him resemble those destined to die; his permanent condition was the goal to which he transferred them from the company of the dead.</p>
