Let us assume that Jupiter is now the soul of this material world, filling and moving this entire mass which is composed and compacted of the four elements, or as many as they like; or assume now again that he yields parts of it to his sister and his brothers. Now let him be the aether, that he may embrace from above Juno, the air spread below; now let him be the whole sky, including the air, and impregnate with life-giving rain and seed the earth, who is called at the same time his wife and his mother, for this is no disgrace in divine affairs. And now—not to speak of all his work in detail—let him be the one god to whom many think the greatest of poets refers when he says:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">For through all the god doth pass,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">All lands, and tracts of sea, and depths of sky.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL412_45_1" id="target_note_LCL412_45_1"><sup>1</sup></a></span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">Let him be Jupiter in aether, Juno in air, Neptune in the sea, and also Salacia in the lower parts of the sea, Pluto in the earth, Proserpina in the lower earth, Vesta in the household hearth, Vulcan in the workman’s forge; among heavenly bodies let him be sun, moon and stars; let him be Apollo among diviners, Mercury in commerce; in Janus let him be the opener, in Terminus the closer of action;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL412_45_2a" id="target_note_LCL412_45_2a"><sup>2</sup></a> let him be Saturn in time, Mars and Bellona in war, Liber in the vineyards, Ceres in the grain fields, Diana in the woods and Minerva in mental endowments.</p>
<p>And finally, let us assume his presence also in that throng of plebeian gods, if I may so describe them.
