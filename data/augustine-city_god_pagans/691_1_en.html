of the things that they have and may be converted and changed to take on other conditions or qualities; for example a jar may be emptied of the liquid that fills it, the body may lose its colour, the air may become dark or cold and the soul may lose its wisdom. True, there is an incorruptible body, such as is promised to the saints in the resurrection, and this body cannot, I grant, lose the quality of incorruption which it has, yet its bodily substance persists, and so it is not the same thing as the incorruptibility itself. For that quality exists entire in all the individual parts of the body, nor is it more in one part or less in another, for no one part is more incorruptible than another. The body itself is, however, greater in the whole than in the part; yet, though one part of it is larger and another smaller, the part which is larger is no more incorruptible than that which is smaller. Therefore the body, which is not present in its entirety in each of its parts, is one thing, while incorruptibility is another, being present in its entirety in every part of the body, since every part of the incorruptible body, even if it be unequal to all other parts, is equally incorruptible. For, to give an instance, though the finger is smaller than the whole hand, the hand is not on that account more incorruptible than the finger. So although hand and finger are unequal, yet the hand and the finger are equal in their incorruptibility. It follows that, although incorruptibility is inseparable from an incorruptible body, yet the substance by virtue of which it is described as body is one thing, the quality by which it is called incorruptible is another. That is why, in spite of this inseparability, the body is not what it has.</p>
