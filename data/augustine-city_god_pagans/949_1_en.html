good but also of the evil. Hence, although the evil angel had been condemned to such obduracy in retribution for his first evil will that he could no longer have a good will, why should God not have made good use of him and allowed him to tempt the first human being, who had been created upright, that is, with a good will? For man had been so constituted that if as a good human being he trusted in God’s help, he would defeat the evil angel, but if in proud self-satisfaction he abandoned God, his creator and helper, he would be defeated; and thus with a right will that was divinely helped he would earn a good recompense, but with a wrong will that abandoned God, an evil recompense.</p>
<p>Even to trust in the help of God was impossible without the help of God, though this did not prevent man from having it in his power to fall back from the benefits of divine grace through self-satisfaction. For just as it is not in our power to live in this flesh without the help of food, yet it is in our power not to live in it at all, as we see in the case of those who commit suicide, so it was not in man’s power to live a good life without God’s help even in paradise, although it was in his power to live an evil life; but in this case his happiness would not endure and a very just punishment would follow. Therefore, since God was not unaware of this imminent fall of man, why should he not have allowed him to be tempted by the spiteful and envious angel? He was indeed perfectly well aware that man would be defeated, but he equally well foresaw that this selfsame devil was destined to be defeated by man’s seed with the help of divine grace to the greater glory of the saints.</p>
