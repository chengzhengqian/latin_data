the desire for godliness and righteousness will be as impossible to lose as the desire for happiness. For surely in sinning we retained neither godliness nor happiness, but though we lost happiness we did not lose the desire for happiness. Surely, though God himself is unable to sin, no one should for that reason say that he does not have free-will.</p>
<p>Thus the free-will of that city will be one will present in all, and inseparably fixed in each individual. It will be freed from every evil and filled with every good, enjoying incessantly the delight of eternal joys; it will forget past sins and punishments, but still will not for that reason forget its liberation and so be ungrateful to its liberator. As far as its rational knowledge is concerned, it also remembers its past evils, but as for actually feeling them, they are completely forgotten. A skilled physician knows almost all the diseases of the body as they are known in medical science, but he is ignorant of most as they are felt in the body, for he has not suffered them himself. So there are two kinds of knowledge of evilsâ€”one
whereby they are not hidden from the grasp of the mind, the other whereby they stick in the feelings of a man who experiences them, for all vices are known in one way through instruction in wisdom, in another through the sinful life of one who is not wise. So also there are two kinds of forgetfulness of evils, for the well-educated, learned man forgets them in one way, and the man who has experienced and suffered them in another. The former forgets if he neglects his learning, the latter if he is free from distress. It is according to this second kind of forgetfulness that the saints will forget past evils, for they will be so
