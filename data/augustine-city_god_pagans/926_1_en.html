right, so to speak, and not in full subjection to our will, should be called pudenda or shameful parts as they were not before man sinned; for we read in Scripture: “They were naked, and not embarrassed.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_357_1" id="target_note_LCL414_357_1"><sup>1</sup></a> And the reason for this is not that they were unaware of their nakedness, but that their nakedness was not yet base because lust did not yet arouse those members apart from their will, and the flesh did not yet bear witness, so to speak, through its own disobedience against the disobedience of man.</p>
<p>For the first human beings had not been created blind, as the ignorant multitude think, since Adam saw the animals upon which he bestowed names,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_357_2" id="target_note_LCL414_357_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and of Eve we read: “The woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was a delight for the eyes to behold.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_357_3" id="target_note_LCL414_357_3"><sup>3</sup></a> Accordingly, their eyes were not closed, but they were not open, that is, attentive so as to recognize what a boon the cloak of grace afforded them, in that their bodily members did not know how to oppose their will. When this grace was lost and punishment in kind for their disobedience was inflicted, there came to be in the action of the body a certain shameless novelty, and thereafter nudity was indecent. It drew their attention and made them embarrassed.</p>
<p>This is why Scripture says of them, after they had violated God’s command in open transgression: “And the eyes of both were opened, and they discovered that they were naked, and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_357_4" id="target_note_LCL414_357_4"><sup>4</sup></a>
