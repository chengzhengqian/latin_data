and luxury, their greed and detestable iniquities, their sins against religion, God, precisely as he prophetically threatened, now shatters land after land? Or one whose life among them is what among such men it should be?</p>
<p>For, as a rule, we hypocritically fail in our duty of instructing them and warning them, or even on some occasions of denouncing and rebuking them, either when we weary of the effort or when we are too courteous to affront their dignity or when we fight shy of feuds that might obstruct or impair our success in the present world, whether it be that an eager heart so covets some gain, or a faint heart boggles at some loss. Therefore, although the good do not accept the life of the wicked and therefore do not incur with them the condemnation that is prepared for such men when this life is ended, nevertheless, this indulgence toward their damnable sins, motivated by fear, justifies, despite the light and venial character of their own sins, their chastisement with the wicked in this life, though they by no means receive eternal punishment. It is only right that they should taste bitterness in this life, when they feel the scourge of God in company with the pagans, for it was through love of its sweets that they would not be bitter to them in their sins.</p>
<p>Note that if anyone abstains from denouncing or rebuking evildoers because he seeks a more favourable occasion or fears for the sinners themselves, lest the result be to make them worse, or lest they hinder others who are weak and should be guided to a good and pious life, using pressure to turn them from the faith, this is not regarded as the pleading of self-indulgence but as the prompting of Christian love.</p>
