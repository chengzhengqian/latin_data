because they were present in the form in which they were found; whereas death and hell “gave them back,” because they restored them to the life whence they had departed. And perhaps it was not without reason that it seemed insufficient to say either “death” or “hell,” and both were mentioned: death, because of the good, who could suffer only death, and not hell also; hell, because of the wicked, who suffer punishment also in hell. For if it seems not absurd to believe that the ancient saints who held a faith in Christ when his coming was still in the future dwelt in regions very remote from the torments of the wicked, yet nevertheless in the lower world, until Christ’s blood and his descent into these regions should deliver them from it, then surely the good and the faithful, now redeemed by the shedding of that ransoming blood, know nothing at all of that lower world, as they wait for restoration to the body and the good things that they deserve.</p>
