with, although the human soul is correctly said to be immortal, yet it too. is subject to its own sort of death. For when the soul is termed immortal, the meaning is that it does not cease to have life and feeling in some degree no matter how slight. On the other hand, when the body is termed mortal, the meaning is that it may be abandoned by life completely and has no life of its own at all. Consequently, it is the death of a soul when God abandons it, just as it is the death of a body when its soul abandons it. Hence the death of both combined, that is, of the whole human being, occurs when a soul abandoned by God abandons a body. For under these circumstances neither does the soul derive life from God nor the body life from the soul.</p>

In connexion with that final and everlasting punishment, a subject on which I must discourse more fully in its proper place,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_137_3" id="target_note_LCL414_137_3"><sup>3</sup></a> we can, it is true, rightly speak of the death of the soul because it derives no life from God.
