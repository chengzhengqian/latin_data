appetite for fables that insult the gods? Or did they want Plato’s verdict, whereby he refused to allow the gods to be libelled by the impious licence of poets as guilty of imaginary crimes, to remain unknown to the gods, while they themselves were neither ashamed nor afraid to reveal their own depraved taste which makes them relish stage plays wherein these shameful actions of the gods are depicted?</p>
<p>Of these four alternatives which I have put forward under the form of questions, let them choose which they please; but, whichever they choose, let them mark well how evil is their opinion of the good gods.</p>
<p>If they choose the first, they will have to admit that the good gods were not permitted to associate with Plato, who was good, since he strove to prevent their being insulted, and that they associated with demons who were evil, since they rejoiced to see them insulted; the reason was that the good gods did not get to know a good man who was situated so far from them, except through evil demons, whom, in spite of their proximity, they could not know either.</p>
<p>But if they choose the second alternative and admit that the demons have kept the gods in ignorance of both the law of Plato which displays a high sense of religion and the demons’ own sacrilegious pleasure, what is there in human affairs that the gods can usefully learn through demons as intermediaries, when they do not know what measures are taken by the religious scruples of honourable men to protect the honour of the good gods against the licence of the evil demons?</p>
