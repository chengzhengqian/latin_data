<span class="label"><span class="italic">The prophecy of Malachi, declaring the last judgement and the cleansing which some persons are to undergo by means of purifying punishments.</span></span>
<p><span class="sc">The</span> prophet Malachiel or Malachi, who is also called “Angel,” and is by some (as Jerome<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL416_415_1" id="target_note_LCL416_415_1"><sup>1</sup></a> says the Hebrews think) believed to be Ezra the priest, others of whose writings have been received into the canon, prophesies the last judgement, saying: “Behold, he comes, says the Lord almighty, and who shall withstand the day of his coming, or who can endure to look upon him? For he comes as a refiner’s fire and as a fuller’s herb; and he shall sit, refining and purifying as it were silver and gold, and he shall purify the sons of Levi, and shall pour them forth like gold and silver. And they shall offer to the Lord sacrifices in righteousness, and the sacrifice of Judah and Jerusalem shall be pleasing to the Lord, as in the days of old, and as in former years. And I will come to you in judgement, and I will be a swift witness against sorcerers and against adulterers and against those who swear falsely by my name, and against those who cheat hirelings of their wages and those who by their power oppress widows and afflict orphans and pervert judgement against the stranger, and who fear me not, says the Lord almighty; for I am the Lord your God, and I change not.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL416_415_2" id="target_note_LCL416_415_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>From these words it appears quite clearly that in that judgement there are to be some who shall suffer purgatorial punishments; for what else is the meaning of the words: “Who shall withstand the day of his coming, or who can endure to look upon him?
