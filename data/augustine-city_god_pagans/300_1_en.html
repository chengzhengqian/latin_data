heart on an important command, an army and a new war in which he might win distinction by his valour. Thus it came to be the dearest wish with men eminent for virtue that Bellona should arouse unhappy nations to war and inflict her bloody scourge upon them in order that they personally might find occasion to give lustre to their valour. Such, forsooth, was the result of that famous eagerness for praise and passion for glory. In this way their love of liberty at first, and later their love of dominion as well, as well as their passion for praise and glory, led to many great deeds. Their famous poet bears witness to both when he says:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">And when Porsena ordered that Tarquin, the king</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">they had banished,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Be restored to his throne, and was holding the city</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">besieged,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Then did the sons of Aeneas seize arms in defence</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">of their freedom.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL412_195_1" id="target_note_LCL412_195_1"><sup>1</sup></a></span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">So great a thing was it then in their eyes either to die bravely or to live as free men.</p>
<p>But once they had freedom, so great was the passion for glory which arose that liberty seemed too little by itself unless they were also seeking dominion over others. And men set great store by the achievements which our poet puts into the mouth of Jupiter as a promise:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">Even the envious Juno</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Who now vexes the sea and the lands and the sky</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">with her terror,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Shall for the better change her intent, and with me</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">be protectress</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p></blockquote>
