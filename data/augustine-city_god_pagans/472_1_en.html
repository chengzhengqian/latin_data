Now the representation that appears to that sort of mental scrutiny is no longer a body but only the likeness of a body, and the faculty by which this likeness of a body is seen within the soul is neither a body nor the likeness of a body. Moreover, the faculty that sees and judges whether the likeness is beautiful or ugly is assuredly superior to the actual likeness on which such a judgement is passed. Now that faculty is the human mind and the substance of a rational soul, and it is certainly not material, if even the likeness of a body, when seen and judged in the mind of one who is engaged in thinking, is not itself material. It is, then, neither earth nor water nor air nor fire, of which four materials, or elements as they are called, we see the material universe to have been composed. Furthermore, if our mind is not material, how can God, the mind’s creator, be material?</p>
<p>So, as we have said, these philosophers must make way for the Platonists, and so must those who blushed to say that God is material, yet nevertheless held that our minds are of the same substance as God.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_29_1" id="target_note_LCL413_29_1"><sup>1</sup></a> So blind were they to the soul’s great variability, which it is impious to attribute to the divine nature. But they say that it is the body that changes the substance of the soul, which in itself is unchangeable. They might as well say that it is some body that wounds the flesh, which in itself is invulnerable. In fact what is unchangeable can be altered by nothing, and in so far as a thing can be altered by a body, it can be altered by something, and therefore cannot properly be described as unchangeable.</p>
