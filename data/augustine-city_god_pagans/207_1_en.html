<p>And how little I said about events in Rome itself, and in its Empire! I did not even tell the whole story of it as far as the time of Augustus Caesar. What a story it would be if I had wished to relate and emphasize, not those evils which men do to each other, such as the devastation and destruction wrought by men in their wars, but by those afflictions which befall the earth from the elements of the universe itself! Apuleius in one place briefly touches on these, in his treatise <span class="italic">On the Universe</span>, where he says that all things on earth have their changes, reversals and annihilations. For indeed, to use his own words, “in violent earthquakes the ground has burst open and swallowed cities with their inhabitants.

Cities have been overthrown by wind and storm. Fires have flashed from the clouds, by which regions of the East were consumed and perished; in the western lands there were springs and floods that wrought the same destruction. Once, for instance, craters erupted from the peaks of Aetna in a godsent conflagration, and rivers of flame ran down the slopes like a torrent.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL412_9_1a" id="target_note_LCL412_9_1a"><sup>1</sup></a> If I had wanted to collect historical incidents of this sort from every possible source, when should I have finished the task? And these things happened in former times, before the name of Christ had suppressed any rites of theirs, vain and ruinous as they are to true salvation.</p>

treatise with the same title.
