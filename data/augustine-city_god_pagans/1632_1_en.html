Gervasius could be seen. Though these bodies were hidden and completely unknown, they were revealed in a dream to the bishop, Ambrose, and so discovered. It was then that the blind man threw off the ancient darkness from his eyes and saw the light of day.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL417_213_1" id="target_note_LCL417_213_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>And at Carthage, who except a very few learned of the healing of Innocentius, an ex-advocate of the deputy prefecture? I was present at the time and saw it with my own eyes. When my brother Alypius and I came from overseas, when we were not yet priests but were already serving God, Innocentius had received us as guests, for he with his whole household was very devout, and we were living with him for a time. The doctors were treating him for fistulas which were numerous and complicated in the lowest part of his body behind.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL417_213_2a" id="target_note_LCL417_213_2a"><sup>2</sup></a> They had already operated, and were continuing treatment with remedies known to their profession. In the operation he had suffered sharp and long-continued pain. But the doctors had overlooked one of the many ulcerous recesses, one so deeply hidden that they did not touch it, though it should have been lanced with the others. Finally, all the ulcers which

I quote extracts from his letter to me:
“A fistula, as we now define it, is an abnormal tube-like passage connecting one hollow viscus organ with another, or a hollow viscus with the outside of the body. . . . From the context it can reasonably be assumed that this was a case of rectal abscess. Characteristically, a rectal abscess forms in this region as a result of an infection from within the rectum and then is either surgically drained to the outside or ruptures spontaneously, leaving behind a fistulous tract. If treatment is inadequate or too long postponed, other abscesses and fistulas are formed by extension of the original process....<span class="linebreak"></span>
“It is most important in the surgical repair of fistula to remove the entire tract or tracts, particularly the internal opening. Interestingly enough, the case history that you cite could well serve as an example of an overlooked tract or an incomplete operation in our teaching of today.”</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL417_213_2a').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
