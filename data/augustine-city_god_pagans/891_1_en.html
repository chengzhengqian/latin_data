wish? When our sympathy, however, is indicated by a pursuit of the things that we wish, it is called desire, but when it is indicated by an enjoyment of these things that we wish, it is called joy. Similarly, when we disagree with that which we do not wish to happen, such an act of will is fear, but when we disagree with that which happens to us against our will, such an act of will is grief. And generally, even as a man’s will is attracted or repelled in accordance with the diverse character of the objects that are pursued or avoided, so it shifts and turns into emotions of one sort or the other.</p>
