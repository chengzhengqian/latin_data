<span class="label"><span class="italic">On the advantages and disadvantages which often afflict the good and evil alike.</span></span>
<p><span class="sc">Someone</span> will say: “Why, then, did this loving-kindness
reach even to the wicked and ungrateful?” What do we suppose, except that it was a gift of him who daily “makes his sun to rise on the good and on the evil and sends his rain upon the just and upon the unjust”?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL411_35_1" id="target_note_LCL411_35_1"><sup>1</sup></a> For although some individuals among them reflecting on this, repent of their irreligion
and reform their ways, others, on the other hand, despising, as the Apostle says, “the riches of God’s goodness and his forbearance by reason of their hardness of heart and their impenitent heart” treasure up “for themselves wrath against the day of wrath and of revelation of the righteous judgement of God, who will repay each man according to his works.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL411_35_2" id="target_note_LCL411_35_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Yet the patience of God invites the wicked to repentance, as the scourge of God instructs the good in patience. So, too, the mercy of God embraces the good to cherish them, just as the severity of God lays hold on the wicked to punish them. The divine providence, to be sure, has seen fit to hold in reserve for the righteous some good things that will not be enjoyed by the unrighteous, and for the irreligious, excruciating pains that the good will not suffer. The good things, however, and the evil things of this world are by his will common to both, that he may restrain us from too eager pursuit of goods such as we see enjoyed also by the wicked, and from cowardly avoidance of evils such as good men too as a rule experience.</p>
<p>It is also very important how we take what befalls
