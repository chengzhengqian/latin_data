they are better known to the people and enjoy a greater public worship? If it is because they are charged with higher functions in the world, we ought not to have found them among that plebeian crowd of deities who are assigned trifling little jobs. Yet it is Janus himself who appears first of all at the moment of conception, the moment when all the tasks begin which are minutely divided among minute deities—it is he who opens the way for receiving the seed. Saturn is there too, just because there is seed. Liber, who liberates the male from the seed he expels, is there, and Libera, whom they choose to identify with Venus, is there to confer the same benefit on the woman, that she also may be liberated by the emission of seed. All these deities are among the ones who are called select. But the goddess Mena, who presides over the menstrual flow, is there too, and although she is a daughter of Jupiter, she is still without renown. And this office of governing menstrual flow is also assigned to Juno herself by the same writer, in his book on the select gods. She is even the queen among the select gods, yet here, as Juno Lucina, she presides over the same blood, along with Mena, her step-daughter. Also present are two extremely obscure gods, Vitumnus and Sentinus, of whom one bestows life (<span class="italic">vita</span>) and the other sensation (<span class="italic">sensus</span>) on the foetus.
