But the Latins have not presumed to render it by the word ‘secular’ for fear of gravely distorting its meaning. In truth, many things are called secular that occur in this age in such a fashion that they pass away even in a short time. But what is described as <span class="italic">aiōnion</span> either has no end or endures to the end of this age.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL415_131_1" id="target_note_LCL415_131_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

Since Augustine’s Latin Bible at this point spoke of ‘eternal possession,’ Augustine now appeals to the Greek, and the ambiguous meaning of <span class="italic">aionion.</span> This would hardly solve the difficulty for one who was puzzled about the fulfilment of the promise. The mention of future fulfilment might suggest Zionism or Chiliasm.

This is a favourite text with Augustine to prove his doctrine of original sin. The argument is borrowed from Cyprian (see Augustine, <span class="italic">Against Julian</span> 2.6.18), and constantly insisted on in the anti-Pelagian writings (see, for example, <span class="italic">PL</span> 44, 402, 450, 685, 720, 810; <span class="italic">PL</span> 45, 1053, 1073, 1174, 1192, 1194, etc). For the word <span class="italic">testamentum</span> there is no satisfactory translation, except in so far as Biblical usage has given a special meaning to the word ‘covenant.’ The usual meaning is ‘last will, testament,’ a meaning shared by the Greek <span class="italic">diatheke.</span> But both of these are used to translate the Hebrew <span class="italic">berith</span>, which is either a covenant between men or between God and man. In the latter case it is neither an ordinary covenant or agreement between parties who are equal before the law, nor is it an ordinary testament, which takes effect only upon the death of the testator. It is rather a declaration of the will and purpose of God; in one way it thus resembles an ordinary ‘will,’ and the choice of <span class="italic">diatheke</span>,<span class="italic">testamentum</span> by the translators is explained. It may include conditions, threats, promises, etc., and any one of these may be referred as a testamentum (e.g., the command regarding the forbidden fruit, the decree of death on all men, the ordinance of circumcision). There were many <span class="italic">testamenta</span>, but for Christians the ‘new covenant’ was that given by Christ, and all that preceded was ‘old,’ and so finally the books which recorded the covenants were called ‘Old Testament’ and ‘New.’ See <span class="italic">diatheke</span> in Arndt and Gingrich, <span class="italic">Lexicon</span>, and works there cited.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL415_131_2a').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
