itself as the highest good of man, in order to make the former ashamed, are accustomed to paint a certain picture in words.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL412_247_1a" id="target_note_LCL412_247_1a"><sup>1</sup></a> They depict Pleasure as sitting on a royal throne, like some dainty queen, with the virtues serving as handmaids, watching for her nod, so as to do whatever she orders. She orders Prudence to inquire carefully how Pleasure may reign and be safe. She orders Justice to bestow such benefits as she can, in order to gain the friendships necessary for physical satisfaction, and to wrong no one, lest, if laws are broken, Pleasure be not able to live untroubled. If there should be some bodily pain that does not drive the victim to suicide, she orders Fortitude to keep her mistress (that is, Pleasure) steadfastly in view, and to soften the pangs of present pain by the recollection of former delights. She orders Temperance to take just so much food, even if some kinds are tempting, for fear that some harmful result of excess should interfere with health, and Pleasure—which the Epicureans think is also very largely a matter of physical health—should be seriously hindered. Thus the virtues, with all their glory and honour, will be the slaves of Pleasure, as of some domineering and vulgar woman. They say that there is nothing more disgraceful and perverted than this picture, nothing that the eyes of good men are less able to endure; and they speak the truth.</p>
<p>But if another picture also were painted, where the virtues are in the service of human glory, I do not think that it would have the beauty that it should.
