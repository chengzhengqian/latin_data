<span class="label"><span class="italic">That the mystery of Christâ€™s redemption was never lacking in past times, but was always declared by various signs.</span></span>
<p><span class="sc">This</span> mystery of eternal life was announced from the very beginning of the human race, through certain signs and symbols suited to the times, to those who were to know it, through the ministry of angels. Then the Hebrew people were gathered into a single commonwealth to carry on the mystery. To them it was foretold, sometimes by men who spoke with knowledge, sometimes by men in ignorance, that events would come to pass as they have from the coming of Christ up till now, and as they are still going on. The same Hebrew people have since been scattered among the nations to spread the witness of their Scriptures, which foretold the eternal salvation that was to come in Christ. For not only all the prophecies which are stated in words, not only the precepts for living which go to form morality and religion and are found in those writings, but also the worship, the priestly offices, the tabernacle or temple, the altars, sacrifices, ceremonies, feast days and whatever else belongs to the service due to God that is properly called <span class="italic">latreia</span> in Greek, are prophecies. They all symbolized and foretold a series of events leading up to eternal life for the faithful in Christ. These prophecies we either believe to have been fulfilled, or we see them in process of fulfilment, or we confidently look to see them fulfilled.</p>
