can be overlooked, for it is common enough to have a single thing called by two names.</p>
<p>Why the different temples, different altars, different rites? The reason, they say, is that happiness (<span class="italic">felicitas</span>) is what good men have earned by their good works, while the fortune that is called good happens by luck both to good men and to bad, without any scrutiny of their deeds, and is in fact called Fortuna for that reason. Then how is she really good, if she comes both to good men and bad with no consideration of justice? Moreover, why do men worship her, if she is blind, and runs into people at random, no matter who, so that she commonly passes by those who worship her and attaches herself to those who scorn her? Or if her worshippers do accomplish anything, so as to be seen and loved by her, then she is taking account of their merits, and does not come by accident. Now where is the definition of Fortuna? How is it that she has even got her name from fortuitous events? For it is no good worshipping her if she is mere luck (<span class="italic">fortuna</span>), but if she singles out her worshippers to help them, she is not mere luck, or Fortuna. Or does Jupiter send her, too, where he pleases? Then let him alone be worshipped, since Fortuna cannot oppose him when he gives orders and sends her where he pleases. Or at least, if any are to worship her, let it be bad men who refuse to possess the merit by which the favour of the goddess Felicitas might be won.</p>
