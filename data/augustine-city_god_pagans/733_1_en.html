<span class="label"><span class="italic">On the perfect number six, the first number which is the sum of its factors.</span></span>
<p>Now the reason why Scripture records that the creation was made perfect in six days, with the same day repeated six times, is that six is a perfect number, not that any interval of time was necessary for God, as if he could not have simultaneously created all things, which would thenceforth by regular movements mark the successive units of time. No, the number six is brought in to symbolize the perfection of his works. Six, be it noted, is the first number that is the exact sum of its factors, that is to say, its sixth, its third and its half, that is, of one, two and three, which when added together make six.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_551_1" id="target_note_LCL413_551_1"><sup>1</sup></a> In studying numbers in this way, factors or parts must be understood as aliquot parts like a half, a third, a fourth, and so on, which have a whole number as denominator. For example, though four is a part of nine, that does not mean that we can demonstrate what part of nine it is. The number one, however, can be so denominated, for it is a ninth, and so can three, for it is a third. However, these two aliquot parts, the ninth and the third, that is one and three, are far from making up when added the complete number nine. In the same way four is part of ten, but it cannot be named by its denominator; one however can be so
