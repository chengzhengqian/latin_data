<p>Compare now Platoâ€™s humanity in banishing poets from the city, to prevent the deception of the citizens, and the godliness of gods that demanded plays in their own honour. Plato, though without success, strove to persuade the light-minded and lascivious Greeks not even to write the plays; the gods, however, commanded and extorted from the grave and chaste Romans even the performance of the plays. Moreover, they chose not only to have them performed, but also to have them dedicated to themselves, consecrated to themselves, exhibited in their solemn rites.</p>
<p>To which, then, would it be more becoming for a city to decree divine honours, to Plato, who forbade these shameful and unspeakable performances, or to the evil spirits, who took pleasure in deceiving thereby men who refused to believe the truth that Plato urged upon them? Labeo held that this Plato should be commemorated among the demigods, like Hercules, like Romulus. Moreover, he ranks demigods above heroes, though he places both among divinities. None the less I do not doubt that this man, whom he calls a demigod, should be ranked not only above the heroes but also above the gods themselves.</p>
<p>The laws of the Romans are close to the dialogues of Plato in that, while Plato rejects all poetic fictions, the Roman laws prohibit any railing by the poets, at least against men. He excludes poets from dwelling in his city; they at least exclude actors of poetic dramas from fellowship with citizens, and if they were courageous enough to challenge the gods who demand the performances, they would perhaps banish them altogether. Hardly, then, could the Romans have received laws for the inculcation of good morals
