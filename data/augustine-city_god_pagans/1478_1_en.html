without absurdity believed to refer to the Roman empire, as if it were said, “Only let him who now reigns, reign until he is taken out of the way,” that is, removed. “And then shall that wicked one be revealed”: no one doubts that Antichrist is meant. But others think that the words, “you know what restrains him” and “the secret power of lawlessness” refer only to the wicked and the impostors who are in the church, until they become so numerous as to provide Antichrist with a great people, and this is the “secret power of lawlessness,” because it seems to be concealed. Moreover, they think that the Apostle is exhorting the faithful to persevere tenaciously in the faith that they hold, when he says: “Only let him who now holds continue to hold<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL416_363_1a" id="target_note_LCL416_363_1a"><sup>1</sup></a> until he is taken out of the way,” that is, until there departs from the church the secret power of lawlessness which is now concealed. For they think that what the evangelist John says in an epistle of his refers to this same “secret power”: “Children, it is the last hour; and as you have heard that Antichrist shall come, even now are there many become antichrists, whereby we know that it is the last hour. They went forth from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would surely have remained with us.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL416_363_2" id="target_note_LCL416_363_2"><sup>2</sup></a> So just as there went forth from the church many heretics, whom John calls “many antichrists,” in that hour before the end which he calls “the last hour,” so shall all then go forth who belong not to Christ but to that last Antichrist, and he shall then be revealed.</p>
