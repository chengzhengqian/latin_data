devotedly men worship Jove, the more severely they should have punished those who dared to say such things about him. But as it is, they not only were not angry at those who invented these tales, but rather feared that the very gods would be angry with them, in order to make them act out these fictions in the theatres.</p>
<p>In these times Latona gave birth to Apollo, not the one whose oracles we said above were commonly consulted, but the one who served Admetus, together with Hercules. And yet he is so firmly believed to be a god that the great majority, and indeed almost all, think that he was one and the same Apollo. At that time also father Liber waged wars in India, and had many women in his army who were called Bacchae, less distinguished for valour than for madness. Some indeed write that this Liber was conquered and bound; some that he was killed in battle by Perseus, and they do not fail to mention the place of his burial. And yet in his name, as in that of a god, Bacchanalian religious rites, or rather sacrileges, were instituted by foul demons, and even after many years the senate was so ashamed of their mad indecency that they prohibited their celebration in the city of Rome. In those times, after Perseus and his wife Andromeda died, men were so convinced that both had been received in heaven that they were not kept by shame or fear from using stars to mark out likenesses of them, and to give these constellations their names.</p>
