<span class="label"><span class="italic">How far from boasting Christians should be, if they have done anything for love of their eternal country, seeing that the Romans did such deeds for glory among men, and for an earthly city.</span></span>
<p>How, then, is it any great thing to despise all the allurements of this world, however sweet they be, for the sake of that eternal and heavenly country, if Brutus was able even to kill his sons for this temporal and earthly country? That is a thing that the heavenly country compels no one to do. Surely it is harder to kill sons than to do what the heavenly country requires, that is, either to give to the poor the wealth that it had been thought right to accumulate and preserve for those sons, or, if a trial should come that requires it for the sake of righteousness, to abandon it. For neither we nor our children are made happy by earthly riches, since they are bound either to be lost while we are living or to be acquired after our death by persons unknown and perhaps unwelcome. It is God that makes us happy, and he is the true wealth of our souls. As for Brutus, because he killed his sons, even the poet who praises him bears witness to his unhappiness; for he says</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">And when of new wars his sons are the authors,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Then for fair libertyâ€™s sake shall their sire to dire</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">punishment call them,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Sire unblest, no matter how great be his praise</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">through the ages.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p></blockquote>
