to be water? And as for the deeper earth, what else can it be except earth, however great the diversity that marks it?</p>
<p>And now, lo and behold, the whole physical universe is complete with these three or four elements. Where will Minerva be? What will she occupy? What will she fill? For she has her place in the Capitol along with Jupiter and Juno, though she is not the daughter of both. Or if they say that Minerva occupies the upper part of the aether, and that on this basis the poets have invented the story that she was born from the head of Jupiter, then why isn’t she rather than Juno considered the queen of the gods, since she is higher than Jupiter? Is it because it was improper to put a daughter above her father? Why was this just rule not observed in the case of Jupiter himself in his relation to Saturn? Is it because Saturn was vanquished? Then did they fight each other? “Hush,” they say, “such babbling belongs only to fables.” Very well, let us not believe the fables, but adopt better notions about the gods. Why, then, did they not give the father of Jupiter a place of honour at least equal to his son’s, if not higher? That is because Saturn, they say, is the duration of time.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL412_39_1a" id="target_note_LCL412_39_1a"><sup>1</sup></a> Therefore those who worship Saturn worship Time, and they imply that Jupiter, the king of the gods, is born from Time.

Thus Cicero says: “Saturn’s Greek name is Cronos, which is the same as <span class="italic">chronos,</span> a space of time. The Latin designation ‘Saturn’, on the other hand, is due to the fact that he is ‘saturated’ or ‘satiated’ with years” (<span class="italic">On the Nature of the Gods</span> 2.25.64). Kronos seems to be pre-Hellenic and Saturn pre-Roman, of Etruscan origin, and very early identified with Kronos.
