is to understand this commandment, “Thou shalt not kill,” as meaning man alone, that is, “neither another nor thyself,” for in fact he who kills himself kills what is no other than a man.</p>

<p><span class="sc">This</span> very same divine law, to be sure, made certain exceptions to the rule that it is not lawful to kill a human being. The exceptions include only such persons as God commands to be put to death, either by an enacted law or by special decree applicable to a single person at the given time—but note that the man who is bound to this service under orders, as a sword is bound to be the tool of him who employs it, is not himself the slayer, and consequently there is no breach of this commandment, which says, “Thou shalt not kill,” in the case of those who by God’s authorization have waged wars, or, who, representing in their person the power of the state, have put criminals to death in accordance with God’s law, being vested, that is, with the imperial prerogative of altogether righteous reason. Abraham too not only was not blamed for cruelty, but was even praised for piety, because he resolved to slay his son, not with criminal motives but in obedience to God. And it is properly a question whether we should regard it as equivalent to a command of God when Jephthah slew his daughter who ran to meet him after he had vowed to sacrifice to God the first victim that met him as he returned victorious from battle.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL411_95_1" id="target_note_LCL411_95_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Nor is Samson
