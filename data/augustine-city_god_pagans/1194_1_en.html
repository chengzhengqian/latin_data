And the son of iniquity did indeed humiliate them, namely the alien enemy, throughout the successive periods in which we read that peace alternated with wars, and during this time we find that there were longer periods of peace than under Solomon, who reigned forty years. For instance, under the judge named Ehud there were eighty years of peace.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL415_309_2" id="target_note_LCL415_309_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Far be it from us, then, to believe that Solomon’s times were predicted in this promise, much less then those of any other king. For none of the others ruled with as much peace as he, and yet that nation never at any time held the kingdom so firmly as not to fear being subdued by their enemies, since in the great vicissitudes of human affairs such security has never been granted to any people that they need not fear hostile attacks on this life. That place, therefore, which is promised as so peaceful and safe a habitation, is eternal and is destined for eternal souls in the free mother Jerusalem, where they will be truly the people of Israel, for the name Israel is in our language ‘Seeing God.’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL415_309_3" id="target_note_LCL415_309_3"><sup>3</sup></a> In the earnest desire for this reward men must lead godly lives, by faith, during this woeful pilgrimage.</p>
