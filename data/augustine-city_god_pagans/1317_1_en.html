time when, on the rebuilding of the temple after the captivity in Babylon, they hoped to become better. No doubt that carnal people interpreted in that way the prophecy of the prophet Haggai when he said: “Greater shall be the glory of this latter house than of the former.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL416_41_1" id="target_note_LCL416_41_1"><sup>1</sup></a> That he referred to the New Testament he had made plainly evident a little above, where he says, clearly promising Christ: “And I will move all peoples, and he whom all peoples desire shall come.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL416_41_2" id="target_note_LCL416_41_2"><sup>2</sup></a> In this passage the seventy translators, in another sense more fitting to the body than to the head (that is, to the church rather than to Christ), used by their prophetic privilege the words: “The things shall come that are chosen by the Lord from all peoples”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL416_41_3" id="target_note_LCL416_41_3"><sup>3</sup></a> (that is, men), about whom Jesus himself said in the gospel: “Many are called, but few are chosen.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL416_41_4" id="target_note_LCL416_41_4"><sup>4</sup></a> For of such chosen ones of the peoples, “living stones,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL416_41_5" id="target_note_LCL416_41_5"><sup>5</sup></a> there is built through the New Testament a house of God far more glorious than that temple which was built by King Solomon and restored after the captivity. Here, then, we see the reason why that people had no prophets from that time on, and was afflicted by many disasters and by foreign kings and by the Romans themselves, namely, lest it should suppose that this prophecy of Haggai had been fulfilled by that restoration of the temple.</p>
<p>For not long afterwards, on the arrival of Alexander, it was subjugated, though not at all ravaged, since they did not dare to resist him, and consequently found him mild of mood when they welcomed him after yielding most readily; yet the glory of that house was not so great as it had been when governed
