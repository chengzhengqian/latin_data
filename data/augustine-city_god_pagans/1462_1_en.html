martyrs, after surmounting all their pains and ending all their labours, when they laid down their mortal members, did reign with Christ, and do reign, and shall, until the thousand years are ended, so that they may continue to reign when they shall have received their bodies now become immortal.</p>
<p>So during those three years and a half the souls of those who were slain as his witnesses, both those that formerly left their bodies and those that are still to leave them in the last persecution, will reign with him until this mortal age is ended and we pass to that kingdom where there shall be no more death. Wherefore the reign of the saints with Christ shall last more years than the bonds and imprisonment of the devil, because they shall reign with their king, the Son of God, during those three years and a half when the devil is no longer bound. The upshot is, therefore, that when we hear the words: “The priests of God and of Christ shall reign with him for a thousand years, and when the thousand years are ended Satan shall be loosed from his emprisonment,” we are to understand either that the thousand years of the reign of the saints are not ended, but that the bonds and the imprisonment of the devil are ended (so that both parties have their thousand years, that is, all their years, but with their several and appropriate lengths, the reign of the saints being longer, and the bonds of the devil being shorter); or else, since three years and six months is a very brief period, that it is not to be taken into account, either as diminishing the devil’s period of bondage or as increasing the period of the saints’ reign, just as in the case of the four hundred years which I have discussed in the sixteenth book of this work<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL416_331_1" id="target_note_LCL416_331_1"><sup>1</sup></a>: though they
