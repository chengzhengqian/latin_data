matter was previously unknown. For when the Apostle says, “But now knowing God, or rather being known by God,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL417_181_1" id="target_note_LCL417_181_1"><sup>1</sup></a> it is an error to suppose that God then first knew men who were really foreknown before the foundation of the world;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL417_181_2" id="target_note_LCL417_181_2"><sup>2</sup></a> rather he is said then to “know” what he then caused to be known.
