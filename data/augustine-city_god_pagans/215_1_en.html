Now to make war on one’s neighbours and from them to move on against the rest, crushing and subduing peoples who have given no offence, out of mere lust for dominion—what else can this be called except brigandage on a grand scale?</p>

<p><span class="sc">If</span> this Assyrian kingdom was so vast and prolonged with no help from the gods, why is the geographical extension and temporal duration of the Roman rule ascribed to the Roman gods? For whatever is the cause of the one, the same is the cause of the other. But if they argue that Assyrian prosperity also must be ascribed to the help of the gods, I ask, of what gods?

Although in the first book of his <span class="italic">Chronicle</span> Eusebius quotes Berossus and others who had rejected the legends of Ninus and Semiramis, this part of the work was not translated by Jerome, hence presumably unknown to Augustine. So we do not know what “trustworthy accounts” Augustine had to prove that Trogus “lied about some things.”</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL412_25_1a').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
