Father has put in his own power; but you shall receive the power of the Holy Spirit when it comes upon you, and you shall be my witnesses in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria and even to the ends of the earth.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL416_65_1" id="target_note_LCL416_65_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>First the church spread from Jerusalem, and when a great many in Judea and Samaria had believed, other peoples also were visited, as those proclaimed the gospel whom he himself had prepared by his word, like torches, and had kindled by the Holy Spirit. For he had said to them: “Fear not those who slay the body but cannot slay the soul.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL416_65_2" id="target_note_LCL416_65_2"><sup>2</sup></a> And that they might not be frozen with fear, they burned with the fire of love. Finally, the gospel was preached throughout the whole world, not only by those who had seen and heard him both before and after his passion and resurrection but also after their death by their successors amid dreadful persecutions and all manner of tortures and deaths of martyrs. So God himself bore witness by signs and portents and varied examples of his power as well as of the working of the Holy Spirit, in order that the people of the nations, believing in him who was crucified for their redemption, might venerate with Christian love the blood of the martyrs that they had shed with devilish fury, and in order that the very kings by whose laws the church was devastated might for their own healing be subjected to that name which they had cruelly tried to banish from the earth, and might begin to persecute the false gods for whose sake the worshippers of the true God had hitherto been persecuted.</p>
