a new earth, among other allegorical and enigmatic sayings about the blessedness of the saints, from the adequate explanation of which I am held back by my desire to avoid prolixity, says: “As the days of the tree of life shall be the days of my people.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL416_423_1" id="target_note_LCL416_423_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Now who is there who has any acquaintance with sacred Scripture and yet does not know where God planted the tree of life, from whose fruit those first human beings were cut off when their own iniquity cast them out of paradise, and about which was placed a fiery and terrible guard?</p>
<p>But if any one maintains that those “days of the tree of life,” mentioned by the prophet Isaiah, are the present days of the church of Christ, and that Christ himself is prophetically called “the tree of life,” because he is himself the wisdom of God, of which Solomon says: “She is a tree of life to them that embrace her”;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL416_423_2" id="target_note_LCL416_423_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and if one maintains that those first human beings did not spend “years” in the paradise from which they were so soon cast forth that they brought forth no child there, and that therefore that time cannot be meant in the words “as in the days of old, and as in former years,” I pass over that question, lest I become involved in a prolix discussion of every detail. My object is to support certain points only, by the obvious truth of my argument.</p>
<p>For I perceive another meaning, which should prevent us from supposing that it was the return to “days of old and former years” of carnal sacrifices that was promised us by the prophet as a great boon. For the sacrificial victims of the old law were required to be animals of certain kinds, immaculate and without any blemish at all, and symbolized holy men without any sin whatsoever, such as only Christ has ever been.
