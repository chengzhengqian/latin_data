<span class="label"><span class="italic">On the cult-titles of Jupiter, which belong, not to many gods, but to one and the same god.</span></span>
<p><span class="sc">The</span> pagans have called Jupiter by the titles Victor, Invictus, Opitulus, Impulsor, Stator, Centumpeda, Supinalis, Tigillus, Almus, Ruminus, and still others which it would be tedious to enumerate. They have applied all these names to one god for various reasons and because of his various powers. But they have not, though there are so many functions, compelled him to become as many different gods. The functions are that he is victor over all, and invincible, and brings help to the needy, and has the power of impelling, of causing to stand, of stabilizing, and of laying flat; because he maintains and sustains the world like a beam; because he nourishes all things, and nourishes all animals by the breast (<span class="italic">ruma</span>). Among these functions, as we observe, some are important and some unimportant, yet one god is supposed to perform both kinds. In my judgement there is a closer relation between the causes of things and their beginnings, for which they would have one universe identical with two gods, Jupiter and Janus, than there is between maintaining the world and giving the breast to animals. However, there was no necessity for having two gods even for two tasks so different from each other in display of power and dignity; the one god Jupiter was called Tigillus for the one task and Ruminus for the other.</p>
<p>I will not say that it would have been more appropriate for Juno than for Jupiter to furnish the breast
