was more lamentable, more revolting, more galling? Which was worse, the Gallic invasion long ago and the recent invasion of the Goths, or the ferocity of Marius, of Sulla and of other most distinguished men, as if their own eyes were to attack their own limbs? The Gauls, to be sure, slaughtered whatever senators they could find in the city outside the Capitoline citadel, which alone was in any case defended, but at least they sold life in return for gold to those who were established on that hill, though they might still have drained that life by a siege, even if they could not shear it with the sword. The Goths, on the other hand, spared so many senators that the surprising thing is rather that they slew any at all.</p>
<p>Yet Sulla, while Marius still lived, set up his headquarters as victor in that very Capitol, which was safe from the Gauls, in order to issue his bloody orders there, and when Marius took flight and escaped, though destined to return fiercer and more bloody, Sulla in the Capitol, even making a decree of the senate his instrument, deprived many of life and property. Then, in the absence of Sulla, what did the Marian party regard as inviolate, when they did not spare Mucius, a citizen, senator, pontiff, grasping in pitiful embrace the very altar where, as they say, the destiny of Rome resides? And, furthermore, that final proscription list of Sulla, to say nothing of other countless deaths, dispatched more senators than the Goths were able even to plunder.</p>
