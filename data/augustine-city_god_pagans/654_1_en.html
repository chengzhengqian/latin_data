God, and the Word was God. This Word was in the beginning with God. All things were made through him, and without him was nothing made that was made. In him was life, and the life was the light of men; and the light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not lay hold of it.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_393_1" id="target_note_LCL413_393_1"><sup>1</sup></a> This is the beginning of the holy Gospel, called the Gospel according to John. These are the words which, as that saintly old man Simplicianus, who later took his seat as bishop in charge of the church at Milan,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_393_2" id="target_note_LCL413_393_2"><sup>2</sup></a> always told us, a certain Platonist used to say should be inscribed in letters of gold and displayed in the most prominent place in every church.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_393_3a" id="target_note_LCL413_393_3a"><sup>3</sup></a> Yet this is the reason why God the great teacher was held cheap in the eyes of the proud, because: “The Word became flesh and dwelt among us.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_393_4" id="target_note_LCL413_393_4"><sup>4</sup></a> So it is not enough for these unfortunates to be sick. They must even take pride in their sickness and blush to take the medicine that had power to cure them. What they achieve by such tactics is not to rise healed, but to suffer a fall that aggravates their malady.</p>

<p><span class="sc">If</span> it is is thought to be disgraceful to improve upon anything that Plato said, why did Porphyry himself improve upon several of his doctrines, and important ones at that? For nothing is more certain than that

It would appear, to be sure, that Augustine is speaking of a Neoplatonist who became a Christian, but there must have been many such in Milan. Moreover, admiration for Neoplatonic
