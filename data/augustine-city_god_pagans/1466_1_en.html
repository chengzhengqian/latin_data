<p><span class="sc">But</span> who are the dead who were in the sea, and whom the sea gave up? It cannot be that those who die in the sea are not in hell, or that their bodies are preserved in the sea, or, still more absurd, that the sea kept the good who were dead, and hell the wicked. Who could believe this? But some quite reasonably suppose that in this passage the sea stands for this age. When, then, our author wished to indicate that those whom Christ will find here still united with the body are to be judged at the same time as those who are to rise again, he called them dead, both the good, to whom it is said: “For you are dead, and your life is hidden with Christ in God,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL416_339_1" id="target_note_LCL416_339_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and the wicked, of whom it is said: “Let the dead bury their dead.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL416_339_2" id="target_note_LCL416_339_2"><sup>2</sup></a> They may be called dead for the reason, also, that they wear mortal bodies; wherefore the Apostle says: “The body is indeed dead because of sin; but the spirit is life because of righteousness,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL416_339_3" id="target_note_LCL416_339_3"><sup>3</sup></a> thus showing that in a living man who is united with the body there exist both, a body which is dead and a spirit which is life. Yet he did not say that the body is “mortal,” but that it is “dead,” although he refers to the same bodies a little later as “mortal,” as they are more usually called. The sea, then, gave up those who were in it, men who were dead in this sense; that is, the age gave up whoever were in it, because they had not yet died.</p>
