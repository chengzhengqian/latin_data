sitting upon the throne one from before whose face fled the heaven and the earth, but afterwards. For after the completion of the judgement this heaven and this earth will, of course, cease to be, when a new heaven and a new earth shall begin to be. For it is by a change of substance, not by its utter destruction, that this world shall pass away. Wherefore the Apostle says: “For the form of this world is passing away; I want you to be free from anxiety.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL416_335_1" id="target_note_LCL416_335_1"><sup>1</sup></a> It is the form, then, that passes away, not the substance.</p>
<p>Therefore when John had said that he had seen one sitting on a throne, from before whose face fled the heaven and the earth, which will happen hereafter, he continued: “And I beheld the dead, both great and small; and the books were opened; and another book was opened, which is the book of every man’s life; and the dead were judged on the very evidence written in the books, according to their deeds.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL416_335_2" id="target_note_LCL416_335_2"><sup>2</sup></a> He spoke of “books opened,” and also of “a book,” the nature of which he did not fail to indicate, as the book “of every man’s life.” So the first-mentioned books must be understood to be the sacred books, old and new, whose purpose was to show what God had ordered to be done as his commandments; while in the other book, which is the book of every man’s life, it was to be shown which of these commandments each man had obeyed or not obeyed. Now if this book is thought of in material terms, who could estimate its size or length, or how long it would take to read it, since in it would be recorded every act of every man? Will there be present as many angels as men, and will each man hear his own life recited by the angel assigned to him? If so, there will not be one book for all men, but one for each
