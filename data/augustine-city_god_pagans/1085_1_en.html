We must assume this not only because Eusebius in his chronicle reckons from the year of this promise and shows that the exodus from Egypt, when the law was given, took place four hundred and thirty years later, but also because the apostle Paul mentions it.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL415_91_2" id="target_note_LCL415_91_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

The synchronism with Abraham is taken from Eusebius’ chronicle (<span class="italic">GCS</span> 24, 20 ed. Helm). Eusebius, in turn, is dependent
on Castor of Rhodes for the chronology of Oriental, Greek and Roman history, beginning with Ninus and continuing
to 61 <span class="sc">b.c.</span> As for Greek chronology, there were trustworthy records of victors in the quadrennial Olympic games from 776 <span class="sc">b.c.</span> For earlier periods there was myth and legend, and lists of kings whose dates could be filled in, back to the Trojan war and before. Sicyon, near Corinth, was, as Augustine remarks (18.2 p. 369, below), a very small kingdom, but preserved a list of kings which reached back to the time of Assyrian Ninus, about 2000 <span class="sc">b.c.</span>! Thus for Castor, Eusebius, Augustine and the chroniclers which followed during a thousand years, Sicyon achieved the distinction of first place in the chronology of European history. See <span class="italic">OCD</span> under “Castor of Rhodes,” and Jacoby’s collection of fragments, with commentary, there cited. On Ninus and the legendary history of Assyria see 4.6, Volume II, p. 22, and note 1.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL415_91_3a').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
