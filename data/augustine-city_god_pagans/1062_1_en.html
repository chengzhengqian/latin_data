or colour or motion or utterance, or in any faculty, part or quality of his nature whatsoever, let no true believer have any doubt that such an individual is descended from the one man who was first created. Yet there is a clear distinction between what has by nature persisted in the majority, and what is marvellous by its very rarity.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the same explanation that is used to account for monstrous human births among our race can be applied to certain monstrous races also. For God is the creator of all things, and he himself knows at what place and time a given creature should be created, or have been created, selecting in his wisdom the various elements from whose likenesses and diversities he contrives the beautiful fabric of the universe. But one who cannot see the whole clearly is offended by the apparent deformity of a single part, since he does not know with what it conforms or how to classify it. We know instances of men born with more than five digits on their hands and feet. This, to be sure, is too slight to be considered a serious aberration from the norm, yet far be it from any one to suppose in his folly that the Creator made a mistake in the number of human fingers, even though he may not know why God acted as he did. So, even if a greater variation were to arise, he whose works no one has the right to censure knows what he has done.</p>

One, Hippo Regius, where Augustine was bishop, is now Bone in Algeria; the other, Hippo Diarrhytus (or Zaritus), lay more than a hundred miles to the east, and is now the Bite of Bizerte in Tunis. Several of Augustine’s sermons were preached in the latter city, presumably when he was passing through the city <span class="italic">en route</span> to or from Carthage, and was invited by the bishop.
