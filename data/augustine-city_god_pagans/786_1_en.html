For where there is no creature to produce the passage of time by its changing motions, there can be no periods of time at all. Therefore, although angels have always existed, they were created, but it does not follow that, if they have always existed, they are for that reason coeternal with the Creator. For he has always existed in unchanging eternity, whereas they were created. But we say that they have always existed because they have existed at every time. Without them there could have been no periods of time at all.</p>
<p>Moreover, since the course of time involves changeableness, time cannot be coeternal with unchanging eternity.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_77_1" id="target_note_LCL414_77_1"><sup>1</sup></a> And therefore, although the immortality of angels does not pass in time, being neither past as if it no longer were, nor future as if it were not yet, nevertheless their movements, by which periods of time are produced, do pass from future to past, and for that reason they cannot be coeternal with the Creator, in whose movement we cannot say either that there has been that which no longer is or that there will be that which is not yet.</p>
<p>Wherefore, if God has always been Lord, he has always had some creature subject to his lordship—a creature, however, not begotten of him but created by him out of nothing, and not coeternal with him; for he was before it existed, yet at no time was he without it, preceding it not by a transient interval but by an abiding continuity.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_77_2" id="target_note_LCL414_77_2"><sup>2</sup></a> But if I give this answer to those who ask how he was always Creator and always Lord if there was not always some subject creature, or how it is a created being and not rather one coeternal with the Creator if it existed always,
