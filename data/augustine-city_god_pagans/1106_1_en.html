this is by no means the fault of the infant whose soul he said was doomed to perish, nor is it the child himself who has broken God’s covenant, but his elders, who neglected to circumcise him, unless we take into account that even infants, not in consequence of the character of their own life, but because of the common origin of the human race, have all broken God’s covenant by that one act in which all men sinned.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL415_133_1" id="target_note_LCL415_133_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Many covenants, to be sure, are called God’s covenants in addition to the two chief ones, the old and the new, which all may learn by reading them. Now the first covenant, given to the first man, is really this: “On the day that you eat, you shall die the death.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL415_133_2" id="target_note_LCL415_133_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Wherefore it is written in the book called Ecclesiasticus: “All flesh grows old like a garment. For the covenant from the beginning of time is: ‘You shall die the death.’”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL415_133_3" id="target_note_LCL415_133_3"><sup>3</sup></a> Now since a more explicit law was vouchsafed later, and the Apostle says: “But where there is no law, there is no transgression,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL415_133_4" id="target_note_LCL415_133_4"><sup>4</sup></a> how can the words we read in Psalms be true, namely: “I have reckoned all sinners on earth as trangressors”?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL415_133_5" id="target_note_LCL415_133_5"><sup>5</sup></a> Only on the ground that all who are held in bondage by any sin are guilty of transgressing some law.</p>
<p>Wherefore if even infants, as the true faith maintains, are born sinners, not by their own act but by their origin, whence we assert that the grace of remission of sins is necessary for them, then certainly even as they are sinners, so they are also seen to be transgressors of the law that was issued in the garden
