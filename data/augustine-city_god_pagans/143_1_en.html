Sulla was still leader of the better faction, for up to this point his object in fighting was to restore the republic; and as yet these good beginnings of his were unaccompanied by their bad ending. What better thing could the citizens of that city have done, what more honourable, what more loyal, what more consistent with their parental obligation to Rome than to preserve the city for the better Roman faction and to close their gates against the murderer by parricide of his fatherland?</p>
<p>Let the defenders of the gods note how great a destruction this brought upon them. Let us grant that the gods deserted adulterers and abandoned Ilium to the fires of the Greeks that from her ashes a purer Rome might come to birth. Why did they later also desert this city bound by consanguinity to the Romans, who was no rebel against her famous daughter Rome, but preserved most steadfast and dutiful loyalty to Romeâ€™s better faction, and abandon her to destruction, not by the stalwart Greek heroes, but by the foulest representative of Rome? Or if the gods did not approve the cause of Sulla, in whose interest the poor wretches had closed their gates to preserve the city, why did they promise and foretell such successes to that same Sulla? Or do we catch them once more paying court to the fortunate instead of rallying to defend the unfortunate?</p>
<p>Consequently, Troy was not destroyed that other time either because it was deserted by the gods. For the demons, ever on the watch for opportunities to deceive, did all that they had power to do. Yes, when all other idols were destroyed and burned with the town, only that of Minerva, so Livy says, is reported to have stood untouched in the vast ruin
