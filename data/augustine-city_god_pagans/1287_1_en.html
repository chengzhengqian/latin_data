scribe who was named Baruch; however, it is more commonly attributed to Jeremiah.</p>
<p>Again the same prophet says of Christ: “Lo, the days are coming, saith the Lord, when I shall raise up a true scion of David, and he shall reign as king, and shall be wise and shall execute judgment and righteousness on the earth. In those days Judah shall be saved and Israel shall dwell in security; and this is the name by which men shall call him, the Lord our righteous one.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL415_495_1" id="target_note_LCL415_495_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Furthermore, he spoke thus about the calling of the gentiles, which was then destined to take place, and which we see accomplished at the present time: “O Lord my God, my refuge in the time of troubles, the nations shall come to thee from the farthest ends of the earth and shall say: ‘Truly our fathers worshipped false images, and there is no profit in them.’”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL415_495_2" id="target_note_LCL415_495_2"><sup>2</sup></a> But that the Jews by whom he was to be killed were not to recognize him, is indicated by this same prophet in these words: “Heavy is the heart altogether, he is the man, and who knows him?”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL415_495_3" id="target_note_LCL415_495_3"><sup>3</sup></a> A passage that I discussed in the seventeenth book<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL415_495_4" id="target_note_LCL415_495_4"><sup>4</sup></a> about the new covenant, whose mediator is Christ, was also written by this prophet. It is, of course, Jeremiah who says: “Lo, the days are at hand, saith the Lord, when I will make a new covenant for the house of Jacob”, and the remainder of this passage.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL415_495_5" id="target_note_LCL415_495_5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>Now I shall insert here the following prophecies of Christ that come from the prophet Zephaniah, who prophesied at the same time as Jeremiah: “Wait for me, saith the Lord, in the day of my resurrection to come, since it is my decision that I will gather the nations together and assemble the kingdoms.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL415_495_6" id="target_note_LCL415_495_6"><sup>6</sup></a>
