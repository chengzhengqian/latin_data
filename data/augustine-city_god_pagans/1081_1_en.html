order, it says: “And all the earth was of one tongue; and all men had one speech.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL415_83_1" id="target_note_LCL415_83_1"><sup>1</sup></a> How, then, did they live according to their tribes and their languages, if all shared a single one, unless we assume that the narrative, in its recapitulation,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL415_83_2" id="target_note_LCL415_83_2"><sup>2</sup></a> has here returned to events that had already been told? In the same way, therefore, in the present instance, after the Scripture has said: “And the days of Terah in Haran were two hundred and five years, and Terah died in Haran,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL415_83_3" id="target_note_LCL415_83_3"><sup>3</sup></a> it then returns to a point that had been omitted before in order that the account of Terah which had been commenced might first be completed. “And the Lord,” it says, “said to Abram: ‘Depart from your land,’” and so forth.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL415_83_4" id="target_note_LCL415_83_4"><sup>4</sup></a> And after these words of God we read: “And Abram departed as the Lord commanded him, and Lot went with him. Now Abram was seventy-five years old when he departed from Haran.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL415_83_5" id="target_note_LCL415_83_5"><sup>5</sup></a> This happened, therefore, when his father was in the hundred and forty-fifth year of his age, for this was Abraham’s seventy-fifth year. Another solution of this question, however, is that Abraham’s seventy-five years when he departed from Haran were computed from the time of his liberation from the fire of the Chaldeans, not from his birth, as though one should consider him to have been born on the later occasion.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL415_83_6a" id="target_note_LCL415_83_6a"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

The second of these is taken from Jerome’s <span class="italic">Hebrew Questions on Genesis,</span> pp. 19 f. Lagarde, where a Jewish legend is related, based on a translation of the Hebrew as “the fire of the Chaldaeans,” not “Ur of the Chaldaeans.” Abram, it is said, refused to worship the age of seventy (see note 2, pp. 80 f.), Abram may have been the youngest of the three, and enough younger to solve the riddle.
Many of the Biblical difficulties discussed in this book had been dealt with previously in <span class="italic">Questions on the Heptateuch,</span> fire-god, and so was put into a fire, from which he was freed by the help of God. He then departed from the region, and his age was reckoned from that time. Jerome invites his readers to find another explanation of the chronological problem, if they can. Augustine proposes three solutions: (1) the argument from ‘recapitulation’ here offered; (2) the legend about the ‘fire of the Chaldaeans’; and (3) the suggestion that since Terah could not have begotten all three sons at the but Augustine seems now to have reached more settled opinions on a number of them.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL415_83_6a').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
