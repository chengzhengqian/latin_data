that my first five books are an adequate reply. When I had published the first three books and they had come into the hands of many, I heard that certain men were preparing some sort of written reply to them.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL412_275_1a" id="target_note_LCL412_275_1a"><sup>1</sup></a> Then I was told that they had already written the reply but were looking for a time when they could publish it without risk to themselves. I advise these men not to wish for what is not to their advantage. It is easy for anyone who chooses not to remain silent, to think that he has answered my arguments. What is more talkative than folly? The fact that it can, if it chooses, shout louder than truth, does not prove that it has the power of truth.</p>

Then they may see that there are arguments that can be more easily shaken than uprooted by shameless garrulity and a frivolity like that of lampooners and clowns. So let them keep their folly in check and choose rather to be corrected by the prudent than to be praised by the shameless. If they are waiting for a future time, not of freedom to speak the truth, but of licence to revile, I hope that they may not be like the man of whom Cicero speaks.
