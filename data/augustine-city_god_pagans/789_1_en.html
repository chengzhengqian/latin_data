Nor am I deterred from this belief by the arguments of philosophers. Of these the most penetrating is reckoned to be the statement that no infinite things can be comprehended by any knowledge and that, consequently, the conceptions which God has in his mind of all the finite things that he makes are all finite. We must believe, however, so these philosophers continue, that his goodness was never inoperative, lest his activity should be taken to be bounded in time, while behind that there lay an eternity of idleness, as if he had repented of his earlier leisure that was without beginning and for that reason had taken it upon himself to begin working.</p>
<p>Therefore it must needs be, according to their argument, that the same events are always repeated and also always race past with repetition due to recur. Either the world continues to exist while it undergoes change, the world which, though it has always been in existence and had no beginning in time, nevertheless was created, or else its coming-to-be and passing away have also always been and are always to be included in these recurrent cycles. Otherwise, plainly, if it is said that the works of God first began at some point of time, he might be thought to have condemned in a sense as unsatisfactory his earlier inactivity that had no beginning, counting it sluggish and slothful, and to have changed it for that reason.</p>
<p>Suppose, on the other hand, the theory be maintained that God was indeed always engaged in creating things in time, but different things at different times, and thus one day arrived also at the making of man, whom he had never previously made.
