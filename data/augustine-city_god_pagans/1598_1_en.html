who build on the foundation wood, hay, stubble, and that the merit of the good foundation will free them from that fire after a time that is allotted according to their evil deserts, what shall we think of those on the right, who will hear the words: “Come, ye blessed of my Father, possess the kingdom prepared for you,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL417_145_1" id="target_note_LCL417_145_1"><sup>1</sup></a> unless they are the ones who have built upon the foundation gold, silver, precious stones? But into that fire of which it is said, “Yet so as by fire,” both groups must be thrown, if this view is right, both those on the right and those on the left. Both groups surely must be proved in that fire of which it is said: “For the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed in the fire, and the fire will prove each man’s work, of what sort it is.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL417_145_2" id="target_note_LCL417_145_2"><sup>2</sup></a> If, therefore, the fire will prove both (so that, if anyone’s work remain, that is, is not consumed by fire, he shall receive as a reward what he built thereon, while if anyone’s work burns, he will suffer loss), surely this is not that eternal fire. For into it will be sent only those on the left hand, in a final and everlasting damnation, while the other fire tests those on the right. Some of them it tests in such a way as not to burn and consume the building which is found constructed on Christ the foundation. But the opposite is true of others, that is, what they have built burns and hence they suffer loss, but they themselves will be saved, since with surpassing love they keep Christ firmly fixed as their foundation. But if they are to be saved, they will also surely stand at the right hand and hear with the others: “Come ye blessed of my Father, possess the kingdom prepared for you,” not on the left, where those will be who are not saved,
