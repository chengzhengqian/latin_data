loose? So the words seem to compel us to believe that in that time, admittedly brief, no one will be added to the Christian community, but that the devil will fight with those who have been already known as Christians, and that although some of them will be vanquished and will follow him, these do not belong to the predestined number of the sons of God. For not in vain does the same apostle John who wrote this Apocalypse say in his epistle, concerning certain persons: “They went forth from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they surely would have remained with us.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL416_301_1" id="target_note_LCL416_301_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>But what is to become of the little ones? For it is past belief that at that time there will be found no infants born but not yet baptized, children of Christians, or that none will be born during those very days, or that, if there are such, their parents will not somehow bring them to the washing of regeneration.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL416_301_2" id="target_note_LCL416_301_2"><sup>2</sup></a> But if so, how can those goods be taken from the devil, when he is now loosed, since no man enters his house to take his goods unless he first bind him? No, no! We must rather believe that at that time there will be lacking neither some who will fall away from the church nor others who will be added to the church; but surely there will be such courage both on the part of parents in seeking baptism for their little ones and on the part of those who will then for the first time believe, that they will vanquish that strong one, even though he will be unbound, that is, even though he plots with all his wiles and struggles with all his powers, being such as they never were before, yet these will both vigilantly outwit and patiently outlast him, and so his goods will be taken from him even though he will not be bound.</p>
