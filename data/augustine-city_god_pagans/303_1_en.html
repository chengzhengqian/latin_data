since they took as gods the gifts of God. This gives us a clue to the goal of virtue that they chose, and the standard by which the good among them gave judgement, namely honour. For the bad among them had no virtue, although they desired to have honour, and tried to gain it by bad arts, that is, by fraud and deceit.</p>
<p>Cato fares better in the tribute paid to him, for of him it is said: “The less he sought for glory, the more it attached itself to him.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL412_201_1" id="target_note_LCL412_201_1"><sup>1</sup></a> For the glory that the Romans burned to possess, be it noted, is the favourable judgement of men who think well of other men.
