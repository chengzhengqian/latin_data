against the Christian name, because they, too, are, no matter how falsely, called Christians. By this and by similar immoral behaviour and human errors those who wish to live a godly life in Christ suffer persecution, even though no one abuses or torments their bodies; for they suffer this persecution not in their bodies but in their hearts. Whence the message comes: “According to the multitude of my sorrows in my heart” (for he does not say, “in my body”).</p>
<p>Again, since divine promises are thought of as unchangeable, and the Apostle says: “The Lord knows them that are his;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL416_71_1" id="target_note_LCL416_71_1"><sup>1</sup></a> for those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his son.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL416_71_2" id="target_note_LCL416_71_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Therefore none of them can perish. And so it follows in that psalm: “Thy consolations have made glad my soul.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL416_71_3" id="target_note_LCL416_71_3"><sup>3</sup></a> For the very grief that arises in the hearts of the godly who are persecuted by the behaviour of wicked or false Christians profits those who grieve, since it proceeds from a love that does not wish them to perish nor to hinder the salvation of others. Finally, great consolations arise also when they are rescued from error, for such occasions flood the souls of the godly with a delight as great as were the torments that they caused them by their being lost. Such is the course run by the church in this world, in these evil days, a course that began not merely in the time of the bodily presence of Christ and in the time of his apostles but in the time of Abel himself, the first just man slain by his ungodly brother, and extends all the way to the end of this world, a pilgrimage that is bounded by the persecutions of this world and the consolations of God.</p>
