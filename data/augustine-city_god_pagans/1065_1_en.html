where the sun rises when it sets for us, who plant their footprints opposite ours, there is no logical ground for believing this. Its authors do not claim that they have learned it from any historical evidence, but offer it as a sort of logical hypothesis. Their theory is that the earth hangs suspended within the heavenly sphere, so that the lowest and middle points of the world are one and the same. From this they conjecture that the other half of the earth, which lies beneath our portion, cannot lack human occupants. They fail to observe that even if the world is held to be global or rounded in shape,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL415_51_1a" id="target_note_LCL415_51_1a"><sup>1</sup></a> or if some process of reasoning should prove this to be the case, it would still not necessarily follow that the land on the opposite side is not covered by masses of water. Furthermore, even if the land there be exposed, we must not jump to the conclusion that it has human inhabitants. For there is absolutely no falsehood in the Scripture, which gains credence for its account of past events by the fact that its prophecies are fulfilled. And the idea is too absurd to mention that some men might have sailed from our part of the earth to the other and have arrived there by crossing the boundless tracts of ocean, so that the human race might be established there also by descent from the one first man.</p>

The inference was often made that there might be inhabitants on the opposite side of the earth (<span class="italic">antipodae</span>). But the older view of the world as a disk on which the inverted sky rested also survived, and in later times prevailed. The Christian Lactantius, like many Roman writers before him, scoffed at the idea of antipodes, and ascribed the supposed absurdity to the mistaken view of philosophers who declared both the earth and sky to be spherical (<span class="ac"><span class="italic">Divine Institutes</span></span> 3.24). Augus- tine elsewhere (<span class="italic">On Genesis according to the Letter</span> 2.9.20) says that it makes no difference to the Christian which view is correct, provided that no charge of misstatement is made against the Bible.
