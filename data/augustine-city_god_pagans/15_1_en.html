<p>A distinguished Roman, Marcus Marcellus, who took Syracuse, a most splendid city, is reported to have wept in advance of its downfall, and before he shed its blood, to have shed over it his tears.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL411_31_1" id="target_note_LCL411_31_1"><sup>1</sup></a> He took care also to preserve chastity even in an enemy. For before the victor gave orders to enter the city, he issued a directive that no free person should be violated. Nevertheless, the city was sacked according to the practices of war, and nowhere is it read that a general so pure and merciful gave a command that any one who had fled to this temple or that should be given sanctuary. This, if it had occurred, would by no means be passed over in silence, seeing that neither his weeping nor his directive against violation of chastity could be hidden.</p>
<p>Fabius, the conqueror of the city of Tarentum, is praised for having refrained from making booty of the images.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL411_31_2" id="target_note_LCL411_31_2"><sup>2</sup></a> When his secretary had brought up the question of what he wanted done with the statues of the gods, many of which had been captured, he even spiced his restraint with a witticism. He asked what sort they were, and when it was reported that there were many of large size and even some armed, he said, “Let us leave their angry gods to the Taren-tines!”
Since the Roman historical writers were not able to suppress either the weeping of Marcellus or the laughter of Fabius, either the former’s merciful provision for chastity or the latter’s witty restraint, what room is there to believe that it would not be mentioned, if ever the Romans had spared a number of people in deference to any one of their gods, by forbidding either slaughter or enslavement in no matter what temple?</p>
