<span class="label"><span class="italic">On the sons of Joseph whom Jacob blessed by a prophetic crossing of the hands.</span></span>
<p>Now even as the two sons of Isaac, Esau and Jacob, prefigured the two peoples of the Jews and the Christians—although, as regards physical descent, it is not the Jews who are descended from the seed of Esau, but the Idumaeans, nor did the Gentile Christians descend from Jacob, but rather the Jews, for the symbol went no farther than the words
“the elder shall serve the younger”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL415_195_1" id="target_note_LCL415_195_1"><sup>1</sup></a>—so it was also in the case of Joseph’s two sons, for the elder typifies the Jews and the younger the Christians. When Jacob blessed them, laying his right hand on the younger, whom he had at his left, and his left hand on the older, whom he had at his right, it seemed a serious error to their father, and he warned his father, so as to correct his mistake and show which of them was the older. But Jacob would not shift his hands, but said: “I know, son, I know. This one also shall be a people, and he shall be exalted, but his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall become a great number of nations.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL415_195_2" id="target_note_LCL415_195_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Here again he cogently shows the significance of those two promises. For the one becomes “a people” but the other “a great number of nations.” What could be clearer than that the reference in these two promises is to the people of the Israelites, and to the whole world as included in Abraham’s seed, the former according to the flesh and the latter according to the faith?</p>
