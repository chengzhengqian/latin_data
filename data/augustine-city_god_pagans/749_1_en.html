<h3>I</h3>
<span class="label"><span class="italic">On the identical nature of good and bad angels.</span></span>
<p><span class="sc">The</span> subject of man’s creation is now to be discussed. We shall observe here too the emergence of two cities comprising all rational mortals, just as we have already seen the same phenomenon among angels.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_3_1" id="target_note_LCL414_3_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Before I proceed, however, I see that I must make some remarks about the angels too to demonstrate, as best I can, that there is no impropriety or incongruity in speaking of social union between men and angels, so that we are justified in speaking, not of four cities, namely, two of angels and as many of men, but rather of two cities or fellowships—one
of the good and one of the bad, not merely good and bad angels, but good and bad men as well.</p>
<p>It is not permissible to doubt that the contrary pursuits of good and bad angels arose, not from differences in their original natures, since God, the good author and creator of all forms of being, created both classes, but from differences in their acts of will
