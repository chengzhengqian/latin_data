Macedonians and the Romans. Those who wish to know how fitting this interpretation is may read the book of the presbyter Jerome on Daniel, which is written with abundant learning and care. But even he who reads these words only half awake cannot doubt that the kingdom of Antichrist must be suffered in all its cruelty against the church, albeit for only a brief space of time, before the saints shall receive, through the last judgement of God, their everlasting reign. From the enumeration of days in a later passage<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL416_399_1" id="target_note_LCL416_399_1"><sup>1</sup></a> it is clear that “a time and times and half a time” means a year and two years and half a year, or three years and a half, although sometimes in Scripture this idea is expressed in months. For, though “times” in Latin seems to be an inexact expression, the word so rendered is dual in number. The dual is not found in Latin, but it is said to exist in Hebrew, as it does in Greek. Hence “times” here has the meaning “two times.” I admit that I am afraid that we may be mistaken about the ten kings whom Antichrist is to find, it seems, as if they were so many living men, and hence he may come unexpectedly, since there are not so many kings alive in the Roman world. For what if that number ten indicates the whole number of kings after whom he is to come, just as the idea of totality is often expressed by a thousand, or a hundred, or seven, or by sundry other numbers which I need not now specify?</p>
<p>In another passage the same Daniel says: “And there shall be a time of distress such as there never was since there was born a race upon the earth until that time. And in that time shall be preserved all thy people who shall be found written in the book.
