that those who are uninformed suppose them to be divine. For example, in a certain temple loadstones of proper size were placed in the floor and in the vault above, and an iron image was caused to hang in mid air between the two stones, and to those who did not know what was above and below it seemed to be supported by the power of the god.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL417_39_1" id="target_note_LCL417_39_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Something like this, as we have said, may have been brought to pass in that unquenchable lamp of Venus, by a craftsman who made use of the asbestos stone. To such renown were the demons able to exalt the works of the magicians, whom our Scripture calls sorcerers and enchanters, that a noble poet seemed to express the sense of mankind when he said of a certain woman skilled in such arts: “She professes with her charms to free the hearts of those whom she chooses, and in others to implant heavy cares; to stop the water in flowing streams and turn back the stars; she rouses the ghosts of night; you will see the earth rumbling beneath your feet and ash trees coming down from the mountains.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL417_39_2" id="target_note_LCL417_39_2"><sup>2</sup></a> How much more is God able to do things which are incredible to unbelievers, but easy for His power! It is He who created the power inherent in stones and other objects, as well as the ingenuity of the men who use that power in marvellous ways; angelic beings also He created, more powerful than all the living things of earth. All marvels are surpassed by His marvellous power and by His wisdom in working, in commanding, and permitting; his use of all things is as marvellous as was his creation of them.</p>
