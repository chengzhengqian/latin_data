islands, if they could be replenished only from those species that the ark preserved in both sexes? It is indeed credible that they crossed over to the islands by swimming, but only to the nearest ones. But there are certain islands situated so far away from continental lands that it seems impossible for any creatures to have swum to them. But suppose men captured animals and took them with them, and thus established them where they lived, for the sake of hunting? It is not incredible that this may have happened. We must not, however, deny that they could also have been transported by the angels at God’s command or by his permission. But if they sprang from the earth, as when they were first created, when God said: “Let the earth bring forth the living creature,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL415_41_1" id="target_note_LCL415_41_1"><sup>1</sup></a> then it appears much more obvious that all species were in the ark not so much for the sake of renewing animal life as to typify the different races, in order to symbolize the church. It must be so if the earth brought forth many animals on islands to which they could not cross.</p>

The latter (<span class="italic">Natural History</span> 7.2.10–30) gives names for most of these creatures: the Arimaspi with one eye, the forest-dwellers of Abarimon with feet turned backward, the Androgyni who combine the sexes, the shadow cast by their large feet, and the neckless men with eyes in their shoulders. Aulus Gellius, in his <span class="italic">Attic Nights</span> 9.4.6–10, has a similar list, partly derived from Pliny, but including barking men with dogs’ heads who live in the mountains of India. These are called Cynocephali by Augustine,
a term generally applied to baboons, or to the Egyptian god Anubis.
