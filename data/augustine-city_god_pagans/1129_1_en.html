your father and God of Isaac. Be not afraid. I will give to you and your seed the land on which you are sleeping. And your seed shall be like the sands of the earth. It shall be spread out over the sea and into Africa and to the north and to the east. In you and in your seed shall all the tribes of the earth be blessed. For behold, I am with you, guarding you in all your ways wherever you shall go, and I will bring you back into this land, for I will not leave you until I accomplish all that I have told you.’ And Jacob rose up from his sleep and said: ‘Surely the Lord is in this place and I did not know it.’ And he was afraid and said: ‘How awesome is this place! This is none other than the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.’ Then Jacob rose and took the stone that he had put there under his head, and set it up as a memorial and poured oil on the top of it. And Jacob named that place ‘The house of God.’”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL415_179_1" id="target_note_LCL415_179_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>This has prophetic meaning, nor did Jacob pour oil over the stone in idolatrous fashion, as if he were making it a god, for he did not worship that stone or sacrifice to it. But since Christ’s name is derived from <span class="italic">chrism</span>, that is, from anointing, surely there is a symbolism in this that points to a mighty mystery. And truly our Saviour himself is known to have recalled that ladder to our minds in the Gospel, where, when he had said of Nathaniel: “Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom there is no guile,” then because Israel had seen that vision—for Israel is Jacob himself—he continued in the same speech: “Verily, verily, I say to you, you shall see the heaven open and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL415_179_2" id="target_note_LCL415_179_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
