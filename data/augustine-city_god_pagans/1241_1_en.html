not defended his temple, which king Danaüs burned when he invaded those lands in war. Moreover, they were advised by his oracle to institute these contests. But in Attica it was king Erichthonius who first established games in his honour, and not only for him, but also for Minerva. At these olive oil was offered as a prize for the victors because they consider Minerva the discoverer of its fruits, as Liber was of the vine.</p>
<p>During those years Europa is said to have been carried off by Xanthus, king of the Cretans, whom we find others call by another name, and thence sprang Rhadamanthus, Sarpedon and Minos, though the more widely disseminated story makes them the sons of Jove by this same woman. But the worshippers of such gods reckon the account we have given of the Cretan king<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL415_403_1" id="target_note_LCL415_403_1"><sup>1</sup></a> as historical truth, but assign to unsubstantial fiction the story of Jupiter—a theme that moves poets to song, the theatre to applause and people to make holiday. For such fiction is needed to provide themes for the shows in which gods are appeased by tales, however untrue, of their own crimes. In those times Hercules enjoyed fame in Syria; this was presumably another man with the same name, and not the one of whom we spoke earlier. Indeed, in the more esoteric history there are said to have been various men called Father Liber and Hercules. It is this Hercules whose twelve mighty deeds they recount, not including the slaying of the African Antaeus, since that deed belongs to the other Hercules, and they report in their writings his suicide by fire on mount Oeta. For the courage whereby he had often prevailed did not suffice him to withstand suffering that laid him low.</p>
