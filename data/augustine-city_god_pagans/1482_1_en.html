here shall in that brief moment both suffer death and receive immortality, is confirmed by his words: “In Christ shall all men be made alive,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL416_371_1" id="target_note_LCL416_371_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and by his words in another passage, expressly about the resurrection of the body: “That which you sow does not come to life unless it dies.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL416_371_2" id="target_note_LCL416_371_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>How, then, shall those whom Christ shall find alive here come to life in him by immortality, unless they die, since we see that it is for this very reason that it was said: “That which you sow does not come to life unless it dies”? Or if we may not properly speak of human bodies as “sown” unless they are somehow returned at death to the earth (this way of putting it is found in the sentence pronounced by God upon the erring father of the human race: “Earth thou art, and to earth shalt thou return”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL416_371_3" id="target_note_LCL416_371_3"><sup>3</sup></a>), we must admit that those whom he shall find, on his coming, not yet departed from the body are not included in the words either of the Apostle or of Genesis; for, being caught up on high into the clouds, they surely are not sown, since they neither go to the earth nor return to it, whether they experience no death at all or die momentarily in the air.</p>
<p>But another saying of the same Apostle confronts us, addressed to the Corinthians, about the resurrection of the body: “We shall all rise again,” or, as other manuscripts have it: “We shall all sleep.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL416_371_4" id="target_note_LCL416_371_4"><sup>4</sup></a> Since, then, there could be no resurrection unless death preceded it, and we could not understand sleep in this passage as meaning anything but death, how can “all” either sleep or rise again, if so many whom Christ is to find in the body shall neither sleep nor rise again?
