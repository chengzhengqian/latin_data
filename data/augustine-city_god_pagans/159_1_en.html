to the tale of two brothers slain—a third victim on the other side to match the three slain Curiatii, that even Rome who conquered might have no fewer deaths. Then as fruit of the victory, came the destruction of Alba, where, after Ilium, which the Greeks destroyed, and after Lavinium, where Aeneas had established a wandering and fugitive kingdom, those Trojan divinities had occupied a third habitation. But perhaps the gods had in their usual fashion also departed from that town, and so it was destroyed. Obviously “the gods had all departed, leaving shrines and altars abandoned, by whom that empire had been maintained.”</p>
<p>They had departed, sure enough, and, that, note, for the third time in order that Rome might be the fourth to be, oh so prudently, entrusted to their keeping. For not only did Alba lose their favour, where Amulius expelled his brother, but Rome gained it, where Romulus slew his brother in order to reign. But before the destruction of Alba, they say, its population was transferred to Rome to make one city of both. Very well, let that be so. Nevertheless, that city, Ascanius’ kingdom and the third home of the Trojan gods, a mother city, was destroyed by its daughter. Besides, before the survivors of the war could form one pitiful clot of the two peoples, much blood was shed on both sides.</p>
<p>Why should I tell, war by war, of the constant renewal of the same wars under the other kings—of wars that seemed to end in victories, wars that were again and again terminated by great slaughters, and yet, again and again, after treaties of peace between fathers-in-law and sons-in-law, and their stock and posterity, were enacted once more? No small proof
