Such is the teaching of a religion that never deceives nor is deceived, unlike Hermes who is, as it were, “tossed to and fro with every wind of doctrine,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_115_1" id="target_note_LCL413_115_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and, intermingling some truth with his falsehoods, sorrows over the future destruction of a religion which he later admits to be erroneous.</p>

<p><span class="sc">After</span> a long digression Hermes returns to his main point and again discusses the gods made by men in the following words: “But now let what I have said on this subject suffice. Let us return once more to man and to reason, that divine gift thanks to which man has been termed a rational animal. For admirable as are all the things that have been said of man, they are not the most admirable. For arousing greater wonder than all other marvels is the fact that man has been able to discover and manufacture the divine nature.
