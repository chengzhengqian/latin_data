we may not after this life enter a worse state, an eternal state which is not life, but death. For though in this life there are great consolations when cures are wrought by holy objects and holy saints, still even these benefits are not always granted to those who ask, lest religion be sought for their sake. Religion is rather to be sought for the sake of another life, where there will be no evils at all, and to that end even in the midst of these present evils all good men are helped by grace, so that, as they endure them with greater faith, they may find their courage so much the greater. The learned of this world say that philosophy also helps to achieve truth. The gods have given the true philosophy, as Cicero says, to a select few, nor have they given, nor could they have given, says he, any greater gift to men.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL417_315_1" id="target_note_LCL417_315_1"><sup>1</sup></a> To this extent even our opponents are compelled somehow to admit the need of divine grace in finding, not just any philosophy, but the true philosophy. But if the gods give only to a few the true philosophy, which is the one help against the miseries of this life, it is clear enough from this too that mankind has been condemned to endure those miseries as a penalty. Moreover, just as by their admission there is no greater divine gift than this, so we must believe that it is the gift of no other god than that God who is declared the greatest of all, even by the worshippers of many gods.</p>
