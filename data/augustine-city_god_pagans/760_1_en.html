right in thinking that it is this: that, after turning away from him who has supreme being, they turn wholly to themselves who do not have supreme being. What else can we call this defect save pride? For “pride is the start of all sin.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_25_1" id="target_note_LCL414_25_1"><sup>1</sup></a> They chose then not to keep their strength for him,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_25_2" id="target_note_LCL414_25_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and though they would have more being if they clung to him who has supreme being, by preferring themselves to him they preferred that which has less being.</p>
<p>Here we have the first failing, the first weakness, the first defect of that nature which was so created that, though it did not have supreme being, yet it could, in order to possess happiness, rejoice in him who has supreme being. In turning from him it would not, to be sure, lose all its being, yet it would have less being and so would become unhappy. Further, if we should seek for an efficient cause of this evil will, we find none. For what makes the will bad when it is the will itself that makes a deed bad? And therefore an evil will is the efficient cause of an evil deed, but nothing is the efficient cause of an evil will. For if something is the cause, it either has or has not a will; if it has, the will must be definitely either good or bad; if good, no one surely would be foolish enough to say that a good will makes a will bad, since in that case a good will would be the cause of sin, which is the most absurd notion possible.</p>
