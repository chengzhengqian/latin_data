they were our gods, but to worship with them the God who is theirs and ours; nor do they want us to sacrifice to them, but to be with them a sacrifice to God.</p>
<p>So without any doubt on the part of anyone who has laid aside his malignant obstinacy and considers these things, those blessed immortals, all of them, regard us not with ill-will—indeed if they did bear ill-will they would not be blessed—but rather with love, that we too like them may be happy. They show us more favour and help us more when we worship with them the one God, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, than they would if we were to worship them themselves with sacrifices.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Somehow</span> or other, as far as I can see, Porphyry used to blush for his friends the theurgists. For he knew quite well the arguments that I have been using, but he never came out frankly to fight against polytheism. He even said, in fact, that there are angels of two kinds, those who come down to earth to make divine pronouncements to theurgists, and those who live on earth and declare the truth of the Father, his height and his depth. Surely then we cannot be expected to believe that these angels, whose task is to declare the will of the Father, wish us to be subject to any other than to him whose will they report to us? Hence even our Platonist himself quite rightly advises us to imitate them rather than invoke them.
