<p>But whether these words of Plato in reference to the stars<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_191_1" id="target_note_LCL414_191_1"><sup>1</sup></a> are true is another question. For it does not follow that we must grant him that those luminous globes or little disks that shine with physical light over the lands whether by day or by night are animated by souls of their own and that these souls are endowed with understanding and happiness. He emphatically makes this same statement about the universe as a whole, speaking of it as a single living thing of the greatest size that encloses all other living things.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_191_2" id="target_note_LCL414_191_2"><sup>2</sup></a> But, as I said, this is another question, which I have not undertaken to discuss at the moment.</p>
<p>I have thought it best to bring up just this one point against those who plume themselves on being called or being Platonists and whose pride in this name makes them ashamed to be Christians. They fear that, if they share one designation with the common mass, it will detract for the wearers of the Greek cloak<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_191_3" id="target_note_LCL414_191_3"><sup>3</sup></a> from the prestige of their fewness, for they are puffed up in inverse proportion to their number. And so in their quest for something to censure in Christian doctrine they rail at the immortality of the body, as if there were any inconsistency in our seeking happiness for the soul and at the same time requiring it to exist for ever in a body, as if the bonds that bind them must be vexatious. Yet it is their founder and teacher Plato who says that the supreme God granted to the deities who were made by him the boon of never dying, that is, of never being separated from the bodies to which he joined them.</p>
