<span class="label"><span class="italic">Why it was that the Romans assigned separate gods to every object and every activity, but put the temple of Quies outside the gates.</span></span>
<p>I <span class="sc">marvel</span> greatly at another fact. The Romans assigned a special god to every object and to almost every movement. They gave the goddess who was to rouse men to action the name Agenoria, the goddess who was to stimulate men to abnormal activity the name Stimula; the name Murcia to the goddess who was not to move a man abnormally but was to make him <span class="italic">murcidus,</span> as Pomponius says, that is, excessively lazy and inactive; Strenia was the goddess who was to make men strenuous. For all these gods and goddesses they established a regular cult at state expense.

Was this a proof of an unquiet mind? Or did it signify rather that one who persisted in worshipping that throng, who were clearly not gods, but demons, could never know quiet? To this quiet the true Physician calls us when he says: “Learn from me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL412_61_2" id="target_note_LCL412_61_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
