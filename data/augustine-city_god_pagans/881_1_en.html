idolatry, sorcery, enmity, strife, jealousy, anger, dissension, party spirit and envy, surely no one doubts that we have here defects of the mind rather than of the body. For it may happen that a person abstains from bodily pleasures because he worships idols or follows the mistaken doctrine of some sect; and yet even so, though such a person appears to check and curb his carnal desires, he stands convicted, on this same authority of the apostle, of living according to the flesh. In this case, his very abstention from the pleasures of the flesh proves that he is engaged in the damnable works of the flesh.</p>
<p>Does anyone who feels enmity not feel it in his mind? Or does anyone, in speaking to his enemy, real or imagined, say, “You are ill-disposed to me in your flesh,” and not rather, “You are ill-disposed to me in your mind”? In fine, just as anyone who heard of ‘carnalities,’ if I may use this term, would attribute them to man’s carnal nature, so no one doubts that ‘animosities’ have to do with <span class="italic">animus</span> or mind. Why then does the instructor of the Gentiles in faith and truth<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_267_1" id="target_note_LCL414_267_1"><sup>1</sup></a> call all these and similar vices works of the flesh if not because he means the word ‘flesh’ to be understood as meaning ‘man’ by that figure of speech which uses a part to indicate the whole?</p>
