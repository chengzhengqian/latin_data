God, the creator and maker of every soul and every body. It is by participation in him that happiness is found by all who are happy in verity and not in vanity. He made man a rational animal, combining soul and body. When man sinned, God did not permit him to go unpunished, nor yet did he abandon him without mercy. To the good and to the evil he gave being, possessed also by stones; germinative life, possessed also by trees; conscious life, possessed also by animals; and intellectual life, possessed also by angels alone. From him comes all limit, all form, all order; from him comes measure, number and weight; from him comes whatever exists in nature, whatever its kind and whatever its worth; from him come seeds of forms and forms of seeds and movements in seeds and forms. He gave also to flesh a source, beauty, health, fruitfulness in propagation, arrangement of limbs and the saving grace of harmony. To the irrational soul also he gave memory, sensation and appetite; to the rational soul he gave in addition mind, intelligence and will. Neither heaven nor earth, neither angel nor man, not even the inner organs of a tiny and despised animal, not the pin-feather of a bird nor the tiny flower in the meadow nor the leaf on the tree did God leave unprovided with a suitable harmony of parts, a peace, so to speak, between its members. It is impossible to suppose that he would have excluded from the laws of his providence the kingdoms of men and their dominations and servitudes.</p>
