By “in his body” the Apostle meant “throughout the time when he lived in his body.” Nor indeed shall anyone who blasphemes with malign intent and impious thoughts be adjudged innocent on the ground that he did not do this by any bodily action, for he did it during the period in which he occupied his body. In the same way we may fittingly interpret the words we read in a psalm: “For God our king before the ages has wrought salvation in the midst of the earth.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL415_245_1" id="target_note_LCL415_245_1"><sup>1</sup></a> In this statement “our God”
