the guilt of former deeds, not to permit continual sin to be repeated with impunity. Moreover, any who are unwilling to give up their accustomed sins and change for the better cannot be said to do alms at all. For in the saying: “When ye did it not to one of the least of my brethren, ye did it not unto me,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL417_157_1" id="target_note_LCL417_157_1"><sup>1</sup></a> he shows that they were not doing it even when they thought that they were. For if they gave bread to a hungry Christian as to a Christian, surely they would not deny themselves the bread of righteousness, which is Christ himself. For God gives heed not to the recipient of the gift, but to the spirit of the giver. So he who loves Christ in his fellow Christian extends alms to him in the spirit in which one approaches Christ, not in the spirit of desiring to depart from Christ with impunity. For a man deserts Christ in proportion as he loves what Christ disapproves. For what does it benefit anyone that he is baptized, if he is not made righteous?
