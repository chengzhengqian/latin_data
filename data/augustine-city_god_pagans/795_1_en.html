<p>It is then a very profound question to decide which of these two is correct, or whether, besides these two meanings, the phrase ‘ages of ages’ may admit of some other interpretation. But it does not hinder our present discussion to postpone the problem meanwhile without examination, and this holds true whether we should prove capable of arriving at some conclusion of the matter or whether the very consideration of it with closer attention should render us more cautious for fear of making any rash assertion where the subject is so obscure. For our present concern is to refute that cyclic theory according to which the same things must always be repeated at periodic intervals. Yet no matter which of the interpretations mentioned of ‘ages of ages’ is correct, it has no bearing on these cycles. For whether the term ‘ages of ages’ means, not a repetition of the same ages, but a succession of different ages, running on one after the other, with perfectly ordered connexion, while the bliss of delivered souls remains most secure without any return of miseries, or whether the ‘ages of ages’ are eternal, standing in relation to those of time as master to subject, there is no place for those cyclic repetitions, which are utterly refuted by the eternal life of the saints.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_95_2" id="target_note_LCL414_95_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
