Abraham. And Isaac went to Abimelech the king of the Philistines in Gerar. Now the Lord appeared to him and said: ‘Do not go down into Egypt, but live in the land that I shall tell you of, and dwell in this land, and I will be with you and will bless you. For I will give you and your seed all this land, and I will renew my vow that I swore to your father Abraham, and I will make your seed multiply like the stars of heaven, and I will give your seed all this land, and in your seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed, because Abraham your father obeyed my voice and kept my precepts and my commandments and my statutes and my laws.’”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL415_167_1" id="target_note_LCL415_167_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>This patriarch had neither any other wife nor any concubine, but was content for his posterity with the twins who were conceived in a single act of intercourse. He also, indeed, feared trouble because of his wife’s beauty, since he was living among strangers, and he did as his father had done, calling her his sister and not saying that she was his wife. For she was closely related to him both by her father’s and her mother’s blood. But she, too, remained unharmed at the hands of strangers when it became known that she was his wife. Yet we should not rate Isaac higher than his father simply because he did not mate with any woman except this one wife. For doubtless the merits of his father’s faith and obedience were greater than his, so much so that God says that the boons he grants him are granted for his father’s sake. “In your seed,” he says, “shall all the nations of the earth be blessed, because Abraham your father obeyed my voice and kept my precepts and my commandments and my statutes and my laws.”
