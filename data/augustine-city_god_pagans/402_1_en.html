Why then is it said that the beginnings of things belong to him, while the ends belong to another whom they call Terminus? For it is on account of beginnings and ends, they say, that those two gods have two months dedicated to them, outside the ten which run from March to December.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL412_399_3" id="target_note_LCL412_399_3"><sup>3</sup></a> That is, January is dedicated

Some modern scholars have maintained that Janus (<sup>*</sup> Dianus) was originally a sky-god and essentially a double of Jupiter (see Frazer on Ovid, <span class="italic">Fasti</span> 1.89). L. A.
