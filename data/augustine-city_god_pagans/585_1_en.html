understood in its strict sense to refer to the worship of God. Yet this word is also used of obligations dutifully performed towards parents. Moreover, by popular usage the word is frequently used of works of mercy. This has happened, I believe, because God especially enjoins the performance of works of this kind and assures us that they are pleasing to him in place of or in preference to sacrifice. From this fashion of speaking it has come about that God himself is called, <span class="italic">pius.</span> <a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_255_1" id="target_note_LCL413_255_1"><sup>1</sup></a> But the Greeks of course never call him <span class="italic">eusebēs</span> (pious) in their own language, although with them too popular speech appropriates the word <span class="italic">eusebeia</span> (piety) for mercy. Therefore in certain passages of Scripture, to make the distinction clearer, they preferred to employ not <span class="italic">eusebeia,</span> which means “good worship,” but <span class="italic">theosebeia</span>, a compound made up of the Greek words for “worship of God.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_255_2" id="target_note_LCL413_255_2"><sup>2</sup></a> But we are still unable to render either one of these words by a single Latin word.</p>

What the Greeks call <span class="italic">threskeia</span> is called in Latin <span class="italic">religio</span>, but it is the religious duty owed by us to God. What the Greeks call <span class="italic">theosebeia</span> we cannot express in a single word, but we can call it the worship of God. This we say is owed to that God alone who is the true God and makes gods of his worshippers.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_255_3" id="target_note_LCL413_255_3"><sup>3</sup></a> Whoever then the immortal and blessed beings may be who dwell in heavenly habitations, if they do not love us or wish us to be blessed, they are certainly not to be worshipped. But if they do love us and wish us to be blessed, assuredly they wish us to receive our blessedness from the same source as they;
