moral condition of the state at that time, and what it had been before, in Cato’s own verdict. “Do not suppose,” he says, “that our ancestors made the state great from its small beginnings by the use of arms. If that were so, we should have a much fairer state than in their time, for we have a greater number of allies and citizens than they had, also more arms and horses. No, it was other things that made them great, which we lack: hard work at home, a just rule abroad, and in counsel a free spirit, incapable of crime or of yielding to lust. Instead of these we have luxury and greed. The state is impoverished while private citizens are rich. We praise riches, but follow the path of idleness. We make no distinction between the good citizens and the bad. All the rewards of virtue are appropriated by ambition. And no wonder, when each of you takes thought for himself alone, when you are slaves to pleasure at home and to money and influence here in the Senate. The result is that any stroke that comes falls on a state without defences.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL412_203_1" id="target_note_LCL412_203_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

After the kings were expelled, men acted with justice and moderation only so long as there was fear of Tarquin, that is, until the end of the serious war with Etruria
