knowledge was imprudent. For it was not the Holy Spirit who had revealed this knowledge to Hermes, as he had to the holy prophets, who when they saw what was to come cried exultantly: “If a man shall make gods, lo and behold they are no gods.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_113_1" id="target_note_LCL413_113_1"><sup>1</sup></a> And in another passage: “And it shall happen on that day, says the Lord, that I will cut off the names of the idols out of the land, and they shall be remembered no more.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_113_2" id="target_note_LCL413_113_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Specifically with regard to Egypt, in connection with this matter, the holy Isaiah thus prophesies: “And the idols of Egypt made by hand shall be upheaved from before him, and the heart of Egypt shall be overcome within them,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_113_3" id="target_note_LCL413_113_3"><sup>3</sup></a> and so on to the same effect.</p>
<p>In the same class as the prophets were those who, knowing what was to come, rejoiced when it had come to pass. Such were Simeon and Anna who recognized Jesus when in due time he was born, such was Elisabeth who recognized him by the Spirit even at the time of his conception,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_113_4" id="target_note_LCL413_113_4"><sup>4</sup></a> such was Peter who, when the Father revealed it to him, said: “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_113_5" id="target_note_LCL413_113_5"><sup>5</sup></a> But to this Egyptian the same spirits predicted the time of their own ruin as they had said trembling to the Lord, when he was still before them in the flesh: “Why have you come to destroy us before the time?”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_113_6" id="target_note_LCL413_113_6"><sup>6</sup></a> They asked this either because what they knew must indeed come came upon them suddenly when they expected it to be delayed, or because they meant by destruction their being recognized for what they were, and so despised. And this happened “before the time,” that is before the day of judgement, on which they are to be punished by eternal damnation along
