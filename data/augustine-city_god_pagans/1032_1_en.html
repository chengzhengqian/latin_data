that there was any prophecy concerning Christ in the books of the Hebrews. And there is always the possibility that someone else may be able to explain these matters more satisfactorily than I or one man than another. I would only stipulate that everything that is said must bear on our present subject, the City of God, which sojourns as an alien in this wicked world as though in a flood, if the interpreter does not wish to stray far from the sense intended by the author of this account.</p>
<p>A person, for example, may reject the interpretation that I have given in my work against Faustus of this scriptural passage: “Make it with lower, second, and third storeys.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_569_1" id="target_note_LCL414_569_1"><sup>1</sup></a> There<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_569_2" id="target_note_LCL414_569_2"><sup>2</sup></a> I explained that because the church is assembled from all nations, it is called two-storeyed for the two categories of men, that is, the circumcised and the uncircumcised, or, as the Apostle puts it in another way, the Jews and the Greeks;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_569_3" id="target_note_LCL414_569_3"><sup>3</sup></a> and I explain that it is called three-storeyed because all nations were restored after the flood from the three sons of Noah. But let this person offer some other explanation not incompatible with the rule of faith. For, as we know, God wanted the ark to have quarters not only on the lower level but also on the upper level, which was called the second storey, and on the still higher level, which was called the third storey, so that a third place to live in might rise upward from the bottom. It is possible to interpret this as an allusion to those three virtues praised by the Apostle, namely, faith, hope and charity.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_569_4" id="target_note_LCL414_569_4"><sup>4</sup></a> Or again, even much more suitably, it is possible to interpret it as a reference to those three rich harvests mentioned in the gospel, with a thirtyfold, sixtyfold
