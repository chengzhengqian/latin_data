gods to sky and earth? He cannot do it; these creatures spill from his hands, they leap away, they slip and fall. When about to speak of females, that is, the goddesses, he says: “As I have said in the first book about places,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL412_479_1" id="target_note_LCL412_479_1"><sup>1</sup></a> there is a double origin of the gods, the sky and the earth. Hence some gods are called celestial and some terrestrial. In the previous book we began with the sky, speaking of Janus, whom some identify with the sky, others with the universe. So now as we begin to write about the female deities, we start with Tellus, the earth.”</p>
<p>I realize how much perplexity a man so great and so talented must have suffered. For a certain plausibility leads him to think that the sky is that which acts, while the earth is passive. Hence he ascribes a male power to the former and a female to the latter, without noticing that both powers belong to him who made them both. Hence also in the preceding book Varro similarly explains the famous mysteries of Samothrace,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL412_479_2a" id="target_note_LCL412_479_2a"><sup>2</sup></a> and promises most solemnly that he will expound in writing matters unknown even to the Samothracians,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL412_479_3" id="target_note_LCL412_479_3"><sup>3</sup></a> and send them his exposition. For he says that in Samothrace he gathered many proofs

Aegean, gained a fame in Roman times second only to those of Eleusis. The gods there worshipped were known as Cabiri, or, more vaguely, “the great gods” (<span class="italic">magni di</span>), and were commonly identified with the Penates that Aeneas brought from Troy to Italy; these, in turn, are explained by Varro as being none other than the great gods of the Capitoline temple. As Macrobius and Servius report his words, Jupiter is the middle aether, Juno the air and earth below and Minerva the highest part of the aether, corresponding to the reasoning faculties of the soul. These, we are told, were established on the Capitol by Tarquin, who had been initiated into the Samothracian mysteries (the texts are collected and discussed by Wissowa, <span class="italic">Gesammelte Abhandlungen,</span> 95–128, esp. pp. 101, 117). For the Stoics (<span class="italic">SVF</span> II, 305; III, 217) Minerva was the ruling part, or intelligence, of the aether. In this fragment, however, Varro seems, rather surprisingly, to abandon his usual Stoic allegory to bring in Platonic “Ideas.”</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL412_479_2a').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL412_479_3"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL412_479_3" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">3</sup>Instead of <span class="italic">suis</span> (“to their own people,” that is, “to the Samothracians”) Wissowa (<span class="italic">op. cit.</span> 117) proposed the emendation <span class="italic">Sais</span> (“to the Sai”).
