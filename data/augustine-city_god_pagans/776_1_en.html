for which we no longer had a name, the same question could be asked, “Why did he not create man before that?”</p>
<p>For the eternity that extends backward without any starting point, during which God refrained from the creation of man, is so great that, if there be compared with it any number of eons, however large and inexpressible it be, if it is still bounded by the limit of a definite measure, this number ought not to be regarded as even so big as the tiniest drop of water compared with the entire sea, even all that is enclosed by the flowing ocean. For of these two things one is, to be sure, extremely minute and one incomparably big, but both are finite. On the other hand, that measure of time, starting out from some beginning and limited by some end, no matter how greatly extended it may be, must, in comparison with that which has no beginning, be esteemed as infinitesimal or perhaps rather even as naught.</p>
<p>For if even the briefest moments should be taken away, one by one, from the end of that time span, the number, albeit so huge that it has no name, decreases and, as you work backward, this subtraction will eventually bring you to the beginning. It is like beginning with the present day of a man’s life and subtracting from his days until you come down to that in which he was born. On the other hand, take the time span which is without beginning and, working back, subtract from it not merely tiny moments, one by one, or even large numbers of hours, days, months or years, but periods as great as are contained in that sum of years which, though no computer can designate it, yet is diminished by the subtraction of
