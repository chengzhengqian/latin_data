meticulous critics about the very tiny creatures, not only such as mice and lizards but also such as locusts, beetles and even flies and fleas. They ask whether the number of these creatures in that ark was not larger than the limit set when God gave the order. In this connexion, we must first advise those who are perplexed by the matter that the words “That crawl upon the earth”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_577_1" id="target_note_LCL414_577_1"><sup>1</sup></a> are to be understood as implying that it was not necessary to preserve in the ark creatures that can live in the waters; and this would include not only those submerged, such as fish, but also those that swim on the surface, such as many species of birds.

Or if they were there, just as they usually are in houses, there need not have been any fixed number of them. On the other hand, it may not otherwise have been possible for the very holy mystery that was being enacted, the symbolic representation of so great an event, to be perfectly reflected in actual history as well unless all the creatures that were prevented by nature from living in the waters were present there in that specified number.
