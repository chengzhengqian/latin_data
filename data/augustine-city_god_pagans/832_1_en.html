same time, inasmuch as he cannot be awake and asleep at the same time. Hence we must ask when he will be a dying man. For before death comes, he is not dying, but living. But when death has come, he will be dead, not dying. Accordingly, the former state is still prior to death, the latter already subsequent to death.</p>
<p>When then is he in the state of death? For that is when he is dying, and thus there are three separate states, ‘living,’ ‘dying,’ and ‘dead,’ corresponding, respectively, to the three stages that we speak of, ‘before death,’ ‘in death,’ and ‘after death.’ It is therefore very hard to define when he is dying, that is, in death, a state in which he is neither living, which is prior to death, nor dead, which is subsequent to death, but dying, that is, in death. For as long as the soul is in the body, especially if sensation is also present, man, who consists of body and soul, doubtless lives, and for this reason he must be described as still being before death, not in death. When the soul, however, has departed and removed all bodily sensation, the man is spoken of as past death and dead.</p>
<p>There vanishes then between these two states the interval during which a person is dying or in process of death. For if he is still living, he is before death; if he has ceased to live, he is already past death. Accordingly, he is never conceived to be dying, that is, to be in the midst of death. So too, as time goes by, we seek the present moment without finding it because there is no duration of any length in the passage from future to past.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_169_1" id="target_note_LCL414_169_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
