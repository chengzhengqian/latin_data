to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God. For the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_383_1" id="target_note_LCL413_383_1"><sup>1</sup></a> This is what they despise as foolish and weak, as if they were wise and strong by virtue of their own excellence. But this is the grace that heals the weak who do not proudly boast of a false happiness of their own, but rather confess humbly their genuine misery.</p>

<span class="label"><span class="italic">The incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ, which the irreligion of the Platonists blushes to acknowledge.</span></span>
<p><span class="sc">You</span> proclaim the Father and his Son, whom you call the intellect or the mind of the Father, and one intermediate between these two, by whom we suppose you mean the Holy Spirit;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_383_2" id="target_note_LCL413_383_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and, as is the custom of your school, you call them three gods. Here, although the terms you employ are ill-considered, yet you and your school do perceive however poorly, as in a shadowy presentation of faint images, the goal towards which we ought to strive. But when it comes to the incarnation of the unchangeable Son of God, by which we are saved and so are enabled to attain the ends that we see by faith and in part, ever so little though it be, by knowledge, all of you refuse to accept it. Thus you see, in some sort of way, although it be from a long way off and with clouded vision, the homeland in which we are to abide, but your feet are not on the road that leads to it.</p>
