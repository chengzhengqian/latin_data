Here they affirm only what men have gathered from bodily perception and experience. For they know no flesh except mortal flesh, and the whole of their reasoning amounts to thinking that what they have not experienced is impossible. What sort of reasoning is it to make pain a proof of death, when it is rather a sign of life? Even though we question the possibility of everlasting life, still it is certain that whatever suffers is alive, and that there can be no pain except in something alive. Therefore, one who suffers must necessarily be alive, but pain does not necessarily kill, for even our bodies that are liable to die and will surely die later are not killed by each and every attack of pain. The reason why some attacks of pain cause death is this: the soul is so bound to the body that it retreats before extreme pain and departs, for the very texture of limbs and vital organs is so flimsy that it cannot resist the shock of great, or extreme, pain. But at that time the soul will be knit to such a body, and with such a knot, that the bond will be no more broken by pain than it will be loosened by any lapse of time. Hence although there is now no flesh which can suffer pain and cannot die, nevertheless there will then be flesh of a sort that does not exist now, just as there will also be a death that does not exist now. For what will be is not no death, but an eternal death, in which the soul will neither live, for it will have no God, nor be free from pain, for it will suffer no death.
