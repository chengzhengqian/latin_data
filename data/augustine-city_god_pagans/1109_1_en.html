to the Hebrews: “Through faith also Sarah herself received strength to deliver a child.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL415_139_1a" id="target_note_LCL415_139_1a"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>For both were far advanced in years, as the Scripture testifies, but she was also sterile and her menstrual flow had already ceased, so that she could no longer have conceived, even if she had not been barren. Furthermore, even though a woman is of advanced age, provided the normal menstrual flow of women still continues, she can bear a child to a young man, but not to an older one. And yet that older man could still beget a child, but only by intercourse with a young woman, as Abraham was able to do in the case of Keturah after Sarah’s death, because he came to her when her youth was still vigorous. It is this, then, that the Apostle notes as miraculous, and for this reason he says that Abraham’s body was already dead,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL415_139_2" id="target_note_LCL415_139_2"><sup>2</sup></a> because at his age he could no longer beget a child from any and every woman, even though a brief final period of fertility still remained to her.

For the change of name from Abram to Abraham, and its meaning, all versions are in sufficient agreement
with the Hebrew. But instead of the change from Sarai to Sarah (Sara, Saraa) found in the Hebrew, Vulgate and English Bibles, the LXX and the Old Latin used by Augustine have a change from Sara to Sarra. Jerome defends the Hebrew spelling, explaining the change from Sarai (‘my princess’) to Saraa (‘princess’).

Augustine’s statement that the second name means ‘strength’ seems an inference from the passage in Hebrews, and is not found in Jerome.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL415_139_1a').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL415_139_2"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL415_139_2" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">2</sup>Romans 4.19; Hebrews 11.12.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL415_139_2').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
