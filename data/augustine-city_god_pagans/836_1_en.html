they should violate the commandment received from him and should not observe obedience, whether it was death of the soul or of the body or of the whole man, or that which is called the second death, we must answer: “All of them.” For the first death consists of two deaths, total death of all of them. Just as the whole earth consists of many lands and the whole church of many churches, so total death consists of all deaths.</p>
<p>The reason for this is as follows: the first death consists of two deaths, one of the soul and the other of the body, and thus the first death is that of the whole man when the soul without God and without the body suffers punishment for a certain length of time; the second death, on the other hand, occurs when the soul without God suffers eternal punishment along with the body. Accordingly, when God said concerning the forbidden food to that first man whom he had placed in paradise: “In the day that you eat of it you shall die,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_177_1" id="target_note_LCL414_177_1"><sup>1</sup></a> his threat embraced not only the first part of the first death, when the soul is deprived of God, nor only the second part, when the body is deprived of the soul, nor even the entire first death alone, when the soul undergoes punishment after it is separated from both God and the body, but it included every kind of death down to the very last, which is called the second death and is followed by no other.</p>
