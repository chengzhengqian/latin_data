terminate life rather than to deny him and survive to gain his baptism. Yet surely, if they had done so, they would have been forgiven even the sin of denying Christ through fear of death in that cleansing rite whereby even the slayers of Christ were forgiven their so monstrous crime. But how, apart from the abounding grace of that Spirit who ‘blows where he wills,’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_157_1" id="target_note_LCL414_157_1"><sup>1</sup></a> could they have loved Christ so much that they were unable to deny him although they were in such great mortal peril and although they had such great hope of pardon in prospect?</p>
<p>Death therefore is precious in the case of the saints, who had before them the precedent and pattern of Christ’s death. Such was the grace that emanated from it that they did not hesitate to pay the price of their own death in order to gain him. Thus their death was proof that what had previously been ordained as punishment for sin was put to such good use that it became a means whereby the fruit of righteousness was more abundantly produced. Yet death should not on that account be considered a good thing, for it was turned into something so advantageous, not by its own virtue, but by the bounty of God. And so it is that, whereas death was once held up to us as a formidable threat to prevent the commission of sin, it is now held up to us as a requisite ordeal to prevent the commission of sin and to effect absolution of it if it is committed, as well as to assure the award of the palm of righteousness that is due to so great a victory.</p>
