however, that same city of Athens which had officially condemned him actually went into official mourning for him; and public indignation turned against his two prosecutors to such a degree that one of them was set upon and killed by the violence of the multitude, while the other escaped a similar fate only by going voluntarily into permanent exile.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_15_1" id="target_note_LCL413_15_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>The story of his life and death accordingly made so strong an impression that he left behind him large numbers who adhered to his philosophy. These vied with one another in arguing about moral questions, where the problem debated is the highest good by virtue of which men are made happy. This supreme good was not clearly defined in the discussions of Socrates, for he was in the habit of starting every possible argument and maintaining or demolishing all possible positions. So each of his followers took one of his positions dogmatically and set up his own standard of the good wherever he thought best. Now the term “standard of the good” means the goal at which a man must arrive in order to be happy. But so contradictory were the opinions maintained among the Socratics about this goal that, incredible as it seems for adherents of a single master, some, such as Aristippus, asserted that pleasure is the supreme good, while others, such as Antisthenes, said that it is virtue. Thus there was a wide variety among the views held, and it would be tedious to report them all.</p>
