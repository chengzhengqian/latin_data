passage: that there is a judgement to come, and that it is to come together with the resurrection of the dead. For when he spoke of the men of Nineveh and of the Queen of the South, he spoke beyond a doubt of dead persons; and yet he foretold that they should rise up on the day of judgement. Nor did he mean that they should themselves judge, when he said that they should “condemn”; but he meant that comparison of others with them would bring deserved condemnation upon the others.</p>
<p>Again in another passage, in speaking of the present intermingling of good men and wicked men, and of their separation hereafter, which will certainly take place on the day of judgement, he made use of a comparison with the sown wheat and the tares sown afterward, and in explaining it to his disciples he said: “He who sows the good seed is the Son of Man; the field is the world; the good seed are the sons of the kingdom; but the tares are the sons of the wicked one; the enemy who sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the consummation of the age, and the reapers are the angels. As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire, so shall it be at the consummation of the age. The Son of Man shall send his angels, and they shall gather from his kingdom all stumbling-blocks and all those who do what is wicked, and shall cast them into the fiery furnace; there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth. Then shall the just shine bright as the sun in the kingdom of their father. Who has ears to hear, let him hear.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL416_267_1" id="target_note_LCL416_267_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Here, to be sure, he did not name the judgement or the day of judgement; but he gave a far clearer account of it in a vivid depiction, and foretold that it should be at the end of this age.</p>
