When in terror at this portent the soothsayers had adopted the view that this image of the god should be hurled into the sea, the old men of Cumae intervened and reported that a similar portent had been noted in connection with the same statue during the wars with Antiochus and Perseus;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL411_299_2" id="target_note_LCL411_299_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and they testified that because the outcome had proved favourable to the Romans, gifts had been sent to that same Apollo of theirs by a decree of the Senate.

Not long afterwards came the news that King Aristonicus was defeated and taken prisoner, a defeat certainly displeasing and distressing to Apollo, who made it known even by tears from his own stone.</p>
