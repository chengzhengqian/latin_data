So the mind in which this principle is firmly rooted permits no perturbations, however they may affect the lower levels of the soul, to prevail in it over reason. No, on the contrary, the mind itself is their master and, when it will not consent but rather stands firm against them, upholds the sovereign rule of virtue.

Most modern commentators believe that Augustine has either misread this line or has simply forced it to bear a meaning not intended by Virgil. In the original, according to this view, the mind is Aeneas’, but the tears Dido’s. Augustine would refer both to Aeneas. However, Servius interprets the passage in the same way as Augustine, and V. Pöschl maintains that Servius and Augustine have understood the passage correctly.
