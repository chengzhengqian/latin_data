of Eden. Thus both Scriptures are true: “I have reckoned all sinners on earth as transgressors,” and “Where there is no law, there is no transgression.” And thus since circumcision was a sign of regeneration and the act of birth deservedly brings perdition upon the infant through the original sin by which God’s covenant was first broken, unless regeneration sets him free, these divine words must be interpreted as if they said: “He who has not been regenerated, his soul shall perish from among his people,” for he broke God’s covenant when, in Adam, together with all mankind, he himself also sinned.</p>
<p>For if God had said ‘because he broke this covenant of mine,’ it would have to be understood with reference to the rite of circumcision. But as it is, since he did not expressly state what sort of covenant the infant has broken, we are free to understand it as referring to that covenant whose infringement could be attributed to the child. If, however, anyone still insists that these words apply only to the rite of circumcision, because it was in the fact that the child was not circumcised that he broke God’s covenant, he must seek some sort of phrasing by which to remove the absurdity of thinking that the infant has broken the covenant, on the ground that though it was not broken by him, still it was broken in his case. But even on this assumption one must note that the soul of the uncircumcised infant who had no personal responsibility for the omission would perish unjustly save for the bondage of original sin.</p>
