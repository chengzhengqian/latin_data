love in a bad sense. We can, however, be quite certain that this was not the usage even of writers of secular literature. But I leave it for the philosophers to determine whether and on what principle they make such a distinction. In any case their books bear witness enough that they do highly regard love when it is involved in good things and directed toward God himself. My concern has been to prove that the Scriptures of our religion, whose authority we set above that of all other writings, do not distinguish love from attachment or charity. For I have already demonstrated that love too is used in a good sense.</p>
<p>Lest anyone, however, imagine that whereas love can be used both in a good and in a bad sense, attachment is to be used only in a good sense, let him note what is written in the psalm: “He that is attached to iniquity hates his own soul,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_291_1" id="target_note_LCL414_291_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and the statement of the apostle John who said: “If anyone has formed an attachment to the world, attachment to the Father is not in him.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_291_2" id="target_note_LCL414_291_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Here in a single passage we have attachment used both in a good and in a bad sense. Further, in case anyone demands proof of the word love used in a bad sense, since I have already shown it used in a good sense, I would have him read these words of Scripture: “For men will be lovers of self, lovers of money.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_291_3" id="target_note_LCL414_291_3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>A right will therefore is good love and a wrong will is bad love. Hence the love that is bent on obtaining the object of its love is desire, while the love that possesses and enjoys its object is joy; the love that avoids what confronts it is fear, and the love that feels it when it strikes is grief. Accordingly, these emotions are bad if the love is bad, and good if it is good.</p>
