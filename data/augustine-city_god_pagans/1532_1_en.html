suffer without a soul. Hence, if the reasoning from pain to death were true, that death can happen because pain can happen, it would rather be the soul’s place to die, since pain belongs rather to it. But since the part to which rather pain belongs cannot die, what weight can we allow the argument that those bodies will die just because they will be in pain?</p>
<p>It has, indeed, been said by the Platonists that earthly bodies and mortal limbs are the source of the soul’s fears, desires, sorrows and joys. Hence Virgil says: “From these”—that is, from earthly bodies and mortal limbs—“men fear and desire, men suffer and rejoice.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL417_13_1" id="target_note_LCL417_13_1"><sup>1</sup></a> But we have answered their argument in the twelfth book of this work,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL417_13_2a" id="target_note_LCL417_13_2a"><sup>2</sup></a> by citing their own statement that even souls cleansed from all contamination with body have a disastrous yearning, whereby “they begin once more to wish to return to bodies.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL417_13_3" id="target_note_LCL417_13_3"><sup>3</sup></a> But where there can be desire, surely there can also be pain; indeed, desire frustrated, either by failure to attain its goal or by the loss of what it had attained, turns into pain. Therefore, if the soul, which is the only part of man to suffer, or the chief part, has nevertheless a certain limited immortality of its own, it does not follow that those bodies will be able to die because they will suffer. Finally, if bodies cause souls to suffer, why can they inflict pain on them, but not death? It must be because the proposition is false that what brings pain brings death. Why then is it incredible that fire can bring
