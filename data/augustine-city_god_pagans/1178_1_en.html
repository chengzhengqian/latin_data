witness to the new covenant. Otherwise, as long as Moses is read, a veil is placed over their hearts, but when anyone passes over from their side to Christ the veil will be removed.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL415_277_1" id="target_note_LCL415_277_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Indeed, the very purpose of those who are converted is changed from what is old to what is new, so that each one’s purpose is no longer to gain carnal, but rather spiritual happiness. For this reason, when the great prophet Samuel himself, before he had anointed king Saul, cried out to the Lord on behalf of Israel, and God heard him, and when he offered a whole burnt offering and the gentiles drew near to battle against God’s people, the Lord sent his thunder upon them, and they were confounded and stumbled before Israel and were overcome. Then Samuel took a stone and set it up between the old and the new Mizpah, and called its name Ebenezer, which means in our tongue “the stone of the helper,” and he said: “To this point the Lord has helped us.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL415_277_2" id="target_note_LCL415_277_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Mizpah means ‘purpose.’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL415_277_3" id="target_note_LCL415_277_3"><sup>3</sup></a> That stone of the helper is the intervention of the Saviour, by which one must pass over from the old Mizpah to the new, that is, from the purpose that sought false carnal beatitude in a carnal kingdom to that which by the new covenant seeks the truest spiritual beatitude in the kingdom of heaven. And since there is nothing better, God helps us to reach this point.</p>
