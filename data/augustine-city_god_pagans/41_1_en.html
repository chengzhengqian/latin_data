holiness of her mind, by which the body was kept holy, is already lost and destroyed? Let there be no such mistake, and let us draw from this case the conclusion that holiness of the body is not lost while holiness of the soul remains, even though the body is forced to yield, just as holiness of the body is lost when holiness of the soul is violated, even though the body remain intact.</p>
<p>For this reason, a woman who has been subjected by force and violated by anotherâ€™s sin without any consent on her part, has no fault in herself to be punished by voluntary death. How much less has she any before the event! Let there be no incurring the sure guilt of murder when the outrage itself, though not hers, is still poised, undecided.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Our</span> reasoning is clear in support of the statement that when a body is forced to yield though the pledge of chastity remains no whit vitiated by any consent to evil, the crime belongs only to the man who lay with her perforce and not to the woman who, though forced, consented by no act of will to his lying with her. Can it be that those against whom we are defending as holy, not only the minds, but also the bodies of such Christian women as were forced when prisoners, will be so bold as to maintain the contrary?</p>
