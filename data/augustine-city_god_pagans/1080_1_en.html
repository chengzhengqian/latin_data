Now Abram was seventy-five years old when he departed from Haran.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL415_81_1" id="target_note_LCL415_81_1"><sup>1</sup></a> How can this be true, if he left Haran after his father’s death? For when Terah was seventy years old, as was stated above,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL415_81_2a" id="target_note_LCL415_81_2a"><sup>2</sup></a> he begot Abraham.
