<p>But Varro does not believe these tales, not wishing to believe anything inconsistent with the nature and character of the gods. Nevertheless, in giving an explanation of the name of Athens which is historical and not mythical, he includes in his book the famous lawsuit between Neptune and Minerva, by whose name that city was called, rather than by Neptune’s. When the two competed with a display of prodigies, not even Apollo, when consulted, dared to judge between them. Rather, to end this quarrel of gods, just as Jupiter had sent the three goddesses just mentioned to Paris, so Apollo sent the rivals to men for a verdict. In that court Minerva won in the voting, but was defeated in the punishment of the women who voted for her. She was able to hold sway in Athens as far as her adversaries, the men, were concerned, but could not have her own friends, the women, named for her ‘Athenians.’ In these times, as Varro writes, when Cranaüs, Cecrops’ successor, ruled over the Athenians, or while, according to our own Eusebius and Jerome, Cecrops was still ruling there, the flood occurred which was called Deucalion’s because he reigned in the parts of those lands where its incidence was most severe. This flood, however, definitely did not extend to Egypt and its vicinity.</p>
