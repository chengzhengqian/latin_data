Hence, by their reckoning, Adam was in his twenty third year when he became the father of Seth, and Seth himself was twenty years and six months old when his son Enos was born. But in Scripture Seth’s age is said to be two hundred and five years, for, according to the surmise of those whose view we are presenting, one of our own years used to be divided into ten parts, and these parts were called years. Each of these parts comprises the square of six because God completed his works in six days that he might rest on the seventh (a subject which I have-discussed as best I could in Book XI).<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_471_1" id="target_note_LCL414_471_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Now six times six, or the square of six, makes thirty-six days, which, multiplied by ten, comes to three hundred and sixty days or twelve lunar months. The solar year requires five more days for its completion, plus a quarter of a day, which is the reason why one day, called <span class="italic">bissextus,</span> <a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_471_2a" id="target_note_LCL414_471_2a"><sup>2</sup></a> is added every fourth year. Hence the ancients later added days to make the years come out right in number, and the Romans labelled them intercalary days.</p>
<p>Thus on this theory too Enos, the son of Seth, was nineteen years old when his son Cainan was born, but according to Scripture his age was a hundred and ninety.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_471_3" id="target_note_LCL414_471_3"><sup>3</sup></a> And so through all subsequent generations where mention is made of men’s ages before the flood, we find in our text<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_471_4" id="target_note_LCL414_471_4"><sup>4</sup></a> no one who had a son when he was a hundred years old or less or even a
