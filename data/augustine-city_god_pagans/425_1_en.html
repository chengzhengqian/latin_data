<span class="label"><span class="italic">On the rites of Ceres at Eleusis.</span></span>
<p><span class="sc">Among</span> the rites of Ceres those performed at Eleusis are especially praised, and were formerly most highly renowned among the Athenians. Varro gives no explanation of these except in relation to grain, which Ceres discovered, and to Proserpina, whom she lost when Orcus carried her off. He says that Proserpina represents the reproductiveness of seed. When at one time this productiveness failed, and Earth was sad with the same sterility, the notion arose that the daughter of Ceres, that is, this fertility which had been named Proserpina (from the verb <span class="italic">proserpere</span>, “to creep forth”), had been carried off by Orcus and detained in the lower world. This event was commemorated by public mourning. Then because the same fertility came back, there was a joyful celebration for Proserpina’s return, and from this the annual rites were instituted. Varro adds that there are many traditions in her mysteries, all related to the discovery of grain.</p>
