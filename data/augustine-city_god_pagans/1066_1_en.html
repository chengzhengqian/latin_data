see whether we can find among these the City of God in its earthly pilgrimage. We have traced its history down to the flood and the ark, and have pointed out its continuation in the sons of Noah by his benediction of his sons, and especially in the eldest of them, who was called Shem. For Japheth was blessed only in that he was to dwell in the habitations of his brother Shem.</p>

<p><span class="sc">The</span> series of generations must therefore be traced from Shem himself, to show us the city of God after the flood, just as the line of descent from the man named Seth showed it in the period before the flood. On this account the holy Scripture, after describing the earthly city in Babylon, that is, in ‘Confusion’, returns for a new start to the patriarch Shem, and begins with him the list of generations to Abraham, recording also the number of years that had elapsed before each individual begot a son belonging to this line, and how long each lived. We must surely recognize in this a reference to a point that I promised to explain earlier,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL415_53_1" id="target_note_LCL415_53_1"><sup>1</sup></a> in order to show why it was said of the sons of Heber: “The name of one was Peleg, for in his days was the earth divided.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL415_53_2" id="target_note_LCL415_53_2"><sup>2</sup></a> For how else can the statement that the earth was divided be understood except as referring to the diversity of languages?</p>
