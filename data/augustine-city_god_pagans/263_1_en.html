testimony of the Jewish race. And he ends with the forthright statement that those who first set up images of the gods for the people diminished reverence in their cities as they added to error, for he wisely judged that gods in the shape of senseless images might easily inspire contempt. And when he says, not “handed down error,” but “added to error,” he certainly wants it understood that there had been error even without the images. Hence when he says that only those who believe God to be the soul which governs the world have discovered that he really is, and when he thinks that worship is more devout without images, who can fail to see how near he comes to the truth? If he had had the strength to resist so ancient an error, assuredly he would have held that one God should be worshipped, by whom the world is governed, and worshipped without an image. And being found so near the truth, he might perhaps have yielded easily to correction in regard to the mutability of the soul, so that he would perceive that the true God is rather an unchanging being, who also created the soul itself.</p>
<p>In view of all this we conclude that whenever such men have included in their writings jests at the expense of the many gods, they did so under compulsion of the hidden will of God to confess the truth, rather than because of any intention to convince the people. It follows that whatever testimonies we bring forward from this source are intended to refute those who will not see how great and how malign is the demonic power from which we are freed by the unique sacrifice of such holy blood shed for us, and by the gift of the Spirit imparted to us.</p>
