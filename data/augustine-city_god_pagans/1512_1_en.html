He had in fact also quoted previously some similar complaints of theirs: “Every man who does evil is good in the sight of the Lord, and such men are pleasing to him.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL416_431_1" id="target_note_LCL416_431_1"><sup>1</sup></a> To these complaints against God, I say, they were brought by taking the law of Moses in a carnal sense. And so, too, the writer of the seventy-third<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL416_431_2" id="target_note_LCL416_431_2"><sup>2</sup></a> psalm says that his feet were almost shaken and his steps had staggered,—that is, so as to slip,—because he was envious of sinners, beholding them at peace; so that he said, among other things, “How can God have known, and is there knowledge in the Most High?” and again, “Have I in vain got me an honest mind, and washed my hands among the guiltless?” But in his attempt to solve this most difficult question, which arises when the good seem to be wretched and the wicked happy, he says: “My struggle is too much for me, until I enter the sanctuary of God and understand the last things.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL416_431_3" id="target_note_LCL416_431_3"><sup>3</sup></a> For in the last judgement these things shall not be so, but in the manifest wretchedness of the wicked and the manifest happiness of the righteous something very different from the present state of things will be seen.</p>
