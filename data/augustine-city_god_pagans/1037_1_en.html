not suppose that animals without sex were included there, for it was precisely specified: “They will be male and female.”</p>
<p>There are, in fact, some animals that come into being asexually from diverse kinds of matter but later copulate to reproduce, such as flies. There are others, like bees, that have no distinguishing sexual characteristics. As for those animals that are sexually differentiated but without the capacity to have offspring, like male and female mules, it would be surprising if they were present in the ark and not rather their parents, namely, the horse and the ass, who would have sufficed to be there. The same would apply in the case of any other animals that produce some kind of creature by cross-breeding. But if the presence of these hybrids also was essential to the mystery, they were included; for such a species too has male and female.</p>
<p>A question also arises concerning the kinds of food that could have been available in the ark to animals who are thought to eat only meat. For some people often wonder whether there were on board, without any violation of God’s order, extra animals that must have been included beyond the number prescribed because of the need to feed the others, or whether, as is more credible, there may have been some provisions, other than meat, that were suitable for all. We know, in fact, how many carnivorous animals feed on vegetables and fruit, especially figs and chestnuts. What wonder then if that wise and righteous man, who was also advised by God of what was appropriate for each one, prepared and stored food, apart from meat, that was suitable for each species?</p>
