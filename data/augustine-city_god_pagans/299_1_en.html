Hence it was that they could not endure the rule of kings. “They made the term of command annual, and selected two commanders<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL412_193_1" id="target_note_LCL412_193_1"><sup>1</sup></a> who were called consuls from taking counsel, not kings or masters from reigning or having mastery.” But it would surely seem better to derive kings from the verb which means to rule (<span class="italic">reges a regendo</span>).
