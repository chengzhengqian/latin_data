perhaps we ought rather to say intellectual,—and in this class he includes all the souls of the immortal and blessed, of whose dwelling in heavenly seats he has no doubt—a rational soul, he says, has no natural being above it except God, who created the world and by whom the soul itself was also made.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_259_1" id="target_note_LCL413_259_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Nor can these beings on high obtain a blessed life and the light for understanding the truth from any other source than that whence we too obtain it.
