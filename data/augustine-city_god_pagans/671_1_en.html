City of God, of which it has become our heartâ€™s desire to be citizens because of the love that its Founder has inspired in us. The citizens of the earthly city give preference to their own gods over the Founder of the holy city, because they do not know that he is the God of gods, and not of false gods who are impious and proud and who, being deprived of his unchangeable light in which all may share, are thereby reduced to a kind of poverty-stricken power. They strive after their own personal privileges, so to speak, and seek divine honours from their deluded subjects. He is, rather, the God of pious and holy gods whose delight it is to do homage to the one God rather than to receive homage from many others, and to worship God rather than to be worshipped in place of God.</p>
<p>Well, we have answered the enemies of the holy city in the ten preceding books, as far as we could, with the help of our Lord and King. Now, however, recognizing what is expected of me at this point and not forgetting my duty, but relying on the ever-present
help of that same Lord and King, I shall endeavour, as far as I am able, to discuss the origin, course, and final merited ends of the two cities, by which I mean the earthly and the heavenly. As I have said, they are interwoven, as it were, and blended together in this transitory age.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_427_1" id="target_note_LCL413_427_1"><sup>1</sup></a> I shall first tell how these two cities had their first origin in a parting of the ways among the angels.</p>
