patriarch of all this line who were to be listed thereafter, whether sons, grandsons or greatgrandsons, or those born in later generations. Shem himself certainly did not beget Heber, but appears in the fifth generation of his ancestors. Shem indeed begot Arphaxad among his other sons; Arphaxad begot Cainan; Cainan begot Salah, and Salah begot Heber.</p>
<p>It is not, therefore, without reason that Heber is named first among Shem’s descendants, and is given priority even over his sons, though he belongs to the fifth generation. This is justified by the well-founded
tradition that the Hebrews were given his name, being called, as it were, <span class="italic">Heberaei.</span> There is, however, another plausible theory by which they are supposed to have been named from Abraham, that is, <span class="italic">Abrahaei.</span> <a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL415_21_1" id="target_note_LCL415_21_1"><sup>1</sup></a> But it must be correct that they were named <span class="italic">Heberaei</span> from Heber, and later, with one letter elided, <span class="italic">Hebraei</span> or Hebrews. This Hebrew tongue is the exclusive possession of the people of Israel, among whom the city of God has passed its pilgrimage as well as among the saints, while it has been less perfectly represented by its mysteries among all men.</p>
<p>Thus six sons of Shem are named first; then from one of these were born four grandsons. Another of Shem’s sons also gave him a grandson, of whom in turn his great-grandson was born, and of the latter a great-great-grandson, who was Heber. Moreover, Heber had two sons, one of whom he called Peleg, which is translated ‘Divider.’ At this point the Scripture adds, to explain the appropriateness of the name: “For in his days the earth was divided.” The meaning of this statement will be explained
