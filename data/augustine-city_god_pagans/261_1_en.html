<span class="label"><span class="italic">On the views of Varro, who rejected popular belief, and though he did not come to a knowledge of the true God, still thought only one god should be worshipped.</span></span>
<p>Now what are the views of Varro himself? We regret that he put the stage shows in his “Divine Things,” though that was not his own judgement. For although in many places he exhorts the people, as a religious man, to worship the gods, does he not reveal that it is not by his own judgement that he follows the institutions that the Roman state set up? He does not hesitate to say frankly that, if he were founding that city anew, he would consecrate the gods and give them names according to the principles of nature, rather than as they are now. But as it is, since he is living in an old country, he says that he must keep the traditional account of the names and surnames, and that the object of his writing and research was to persuade people to worship rather than disregard them. By these words this first-rate mind makes it clear enough that he is not being frank on all points, points that were not only matters of contempt to himself, but that would also appear despicable even to the common people unless the subject was kept quiet.</p>
<p>This must have seemed merely my own conjecture, if he did not in another place, speaking of religious ceremonies, himself say plainly that there are many truths that it is best for the common people not to know, and what is more, many mistaken views are held which it is better for the people to take as true.
