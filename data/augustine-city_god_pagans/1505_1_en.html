For he comes as a refiner’s fire and as a fuller’s herb; and he shall sit, refining and purifying as it were silver and gold, and he shall purify the sons of Levi, and shall pour them forth like gold and silver”? Isaiah, too, says something of the kind: “The Lord shall wash the uncleanness of the sons and daughters of Zion, and shall cleanse the blood from their midst by the breath of judgement and by the breath of burning.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL416_417_1" id="target_note_LCL416_417_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Unless perhaps we should say that they are cleansed of their uncleanness and somehow purged only in the sense that the wicked are separated from them by that penal judgement, so that the separation and condemnation of the wicked is the cleansing of the rest, because henceforth they are to live without any contamination from such men. But when he says: “And he shall purify the sons of Levi, and shall pour them forth like gold and silver, and they shall offer to the Lord sacrifices in righteousness, and the sacrifice of Judah and Jerusalem shall be pleasing to the Lord,” he certainly shows that those who shall be cleansed will then please the Lord with sacrifices of righteousness, and that thus they will themselves be cleansed of their own unrighteousness whereby they were hitherto displeasing to God. Now they themselves, when they have been cleansed, will be sacrificial offerings of a complete and perfect righteousness; for what offering more acceptable to God do such persons make than themselves? But the more careful consideration of the question of purgatorial punishments must be postponed to another time.</p>
<p>By the “sons of Levi” and “Judah” and “Jerusalem” we ought to understand the church of God itself, gathered together not only from the Hebrews
