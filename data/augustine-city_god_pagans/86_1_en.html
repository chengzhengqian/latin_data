anyone who brought ill repute or disgrace on another by chanting or composing verses aimed at him.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL411_173_1" id="target_note_LCL411_173_1"><sup>1</sup></a> An admirable provision that. P’or the life we lead should be a matter for the decisions of magistrates and the judgements of courts, not for the exercise of poetic gifts; nor should anyone be exposed to vilification without the right to reply and to make defence in court.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL411_173_2" id="target_note_LCL411_173_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>These passages have been quoted from the fourth book of Cicero’s <span class="italic">Republic,</span> and I have thought best to quote word for word, though with some phrases omitted or transposed a little, to make the meaning clearer. The extract is certainly apposite to the subject that I am endeavouring to explain if I can. He then goes on to make some other remarks and ends the passage by showing that the ancient Romans did not desire any living man to be either praised or berated on the stage.</p>
<p>But the Greeks, as I said, though less mannerly, were more consistent in permitting this licence, since they saw that such ribald charges were acceptable and pleasing to their gods when directed in dramas not only against men but even against themselves. It matters not whether such themes were poetic fictions or whether actual debauchery on their part was recorded and acted out in the theatres and by their worshippers. Would that they were found worthy only of a laugh and not of imitation! For it would have been too presumptuous to spare the reputation of the leaders of the state and of the citizens when the divinities did not wish their own reputation to be spared.</p>
