Moreover, what sort of gods are these who make that prediction but cannot avert what they predict, gods who fall down before a single sorcerer and a single piece of criminal magic,—they say that a yearling infant was slain, dissected, and buried with abominable rites,—so that they allowed a sect hostile to them to recruit its strength over such a prolonged period, to survive the shocking atrocities of so many great persecutions, not by active, but by passive resistance, and to reach the point of overthrowing their own images and temples, rituals and oracles? Finally, what god was it,—surely not ours, but one of theirs,—who was enticed by so great wickedness, or was compelled to bring about that result?
