given up to sin as instruments of iniquity,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL417_319_1" id="target_note_LCL417_319_1"><sup>1</sup></a> lest our eye follow after lust, lest the desire for vengeance overcome us, lest sight or thought linger on that which gives sinful delight, lest a vile or unbecoming word be heard with pleasure, lest we do what is forbidden even if it pleases us, lest in this warfare that is full of toils and dangers we hope to gain the victory by our own strength, or lest we attribute the victory we have won to our own strength and not to the grace of him of whom the Apostle says: “Thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL417_319_2" id="target_note_LCL417_319_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and in another place: “In all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL417_319_3" id="target_note_LCL417_319_3"><sup>3</sup></a> We must know, therefore, that however bravely we struggle against vices, or even overcome and subjugate them, as long as we are in this body we shall never lack reason to say to God. “Forgive us our debts.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL417_319_4" id="target_note_LCL417_319_4"><sup>4</sup></a> But in that kingdom where we shall live for ever with immortal bodies we shall have no battles and no debts. These would never have existed anywhere if our nature had still remained upright as it was created. Hence also this conflict of ours, on which depends our salvation, and from which we desire to be freed in final victory, is one of the evils of this life. And so by the evidence of these evils, so many and so great, we prove that this life is one of condemnation.</p>
