polluted by their contagion. Here, to be sure, there is some impropriety in his view, since the soul is rather given to the body to do good, for it would not learn evil if it did no evil. Still, he corrected the opinion of other Platonists, and in no small matter, when he admitted that the soul, once cleansed from all evil and firmly joined to the Father, will never again suffer the evils of this world. By this verdict he definitely discarded a particularly notorious dogma ascribed to Plato, the view that, as the dead derive from the living, so the living derive from the dead.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_397_1" id="target_note_LCL413_397_1"><sup>1</sup></a> He also revealed as fiction the words of Virgil, spoken presumably under Platonic influence, and telling of purified souls dispatched to the Elysian fields—an allegorical name, it seems, for the joys of the blessed—and

<p>Porphyry was right to reject this doctrine, for it is really stupid to believe that, from a life that cannot be absolutely happy if it is not entirely convinced that its bliss is everlasting, souls should hanker after the foulness of corruptible bodies, as if it were the purpose of perfect purgation to create a demand for defilement. For if perfect purification causes them to forget all past ills, and if this forgetting of ills creates a longing for bodies, in which to be again entangled in ills, it inevitably follows that supreme happiness must be a source of unhappiness, perfect wisdom of folly and perfect purification of impurity.
