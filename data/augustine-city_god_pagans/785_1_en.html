that they nevertheless were created? For indeed we shall not deny that periods of time were also created, although no one is in doubt that time existed at every time.</p>
<p>For if time did not exist at every time, then there was a time when there was no time. Who, no matter how foolish, would say this? We can, to be sure, properly say: “There was a time when Rome was not; there was a time when Jerusalem was not; there was a time when Abraham was not; there was a time when man was not”; and so on. Lastly, if the world was not created with the beginning of time but after some time, we can say: “There was a time when the world was not.” But when we say that there was a time when there was no time, we speak as incongruously as if someone should say that there was a man when there was no man, or that this world was when this world was not. For if two different things are understood, we can find some way to say it: for instance, “There was another man when this man was not.” Similarly then, we can rightly say: “There was another time when this time was not.” But, really, would even the greatest fool say that there was a time when there was no time?</p>
<p>Accordingly, if we say, as in fact we do, that time was created, although it is said always to have existed because time has existed at every time, then it is not logical to conclude that, if angels have always existed, they were therefore not created. Hence we may say that they have always existed because they have existed at every time, and they have existed at every time because the very periods of time could in no way have existed without them.
