not just a little above two hours but twenty-four hours, encompassing a day and a night. And hence the years of those early people who lived even to ages over nine hundred were as long as those of Abraham who later lived to the age of one hundred and seventy<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_491_1" id="target_note_LCL414_491_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and after him, of his son Isaac who lived to the age of a hundred and eighty,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_491_2" id="target_note_LCL414_491_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and of Isaac’s son Jacob who lived to the age of almost a hundred and fifty,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_491_3" id="target_note_LCL414_491_3"><sup>3</sup></a> and after an interval of some time, of Moses who lived to the age of a hundred and twenty,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_491_4" id="target_note_LCL414_491_4"><sup>4</sup></a> and of people even nowadays who live to the age of seventy or eighty or not much more; of which it is said: “And more than these are toil and pain.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_491_5" id="target_note_LCL414_491_5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>Moreover, the difference in numbers that we find between the Hebrew text and our own constitutes no disagreement about this longevity of the ancients; and if any discrepancy is such that the two versions cannot both be true, we must seek the authentic account of events in that language from which our text was translated. Though this opportunity is universally available to those who wish to take it, yet, significantly enough, no one has ventured to correct the Septuagint version from the Hebrew text in the very many places where it seems to offer something different. The reason is that those differences were not considered falsifications, nor do I think that they should be in any way. Rather, where no scribal error is involved, and where the sense would be harmonious with the truth and would proclaim the truth, we should believe that they were moved by the divine Spirit to say something differently, not as part of the service that they did as translators, but exercising the freedom that they enjoyed as prophets.</p>
