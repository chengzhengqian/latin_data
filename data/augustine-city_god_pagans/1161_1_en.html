And “the end of the commandment,”
that is, the goal of the commandment, “is love proceeding from a pure heart and a good conscience and an unfeigned faith.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL415_243_1" id="target_note_LCL415_243_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Furthermore, as John the Apostle testifies, “this love is from God.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL415_243_2" id="target_note_LCL415_243_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Consequently, the power to execute judgment and righteousness comes from God.</p>
<p>But what does “in the midst of the earth” mean? Not that those who live at the ends of the earth are free from the obligation to execute judgment and righteousness, for who would make such an assertion? Why, then, were the words “in the midst of the earth” added? Suppose they had not been added, and only this much were said, “to execute judgement and righteousness,” then the commandment would apply to both groups of men, those who live in the midst of the earth, and those on the shores of the ocean. But for fear that someone might think that after the end of the life that is lived in this body a period might remain for executing judgment and righteousness as he failed to do while he was in the flesh, and that the divine judgment would thus be evaded, it was to prevent this, I think, that the words “in the midst of the earth” were included, meaning “while each man lives in the body.” Surely in this life each man bears his earth about him, which the common earth receives when a man dies, to restore it, of course, at his resurrection. Consequently, “in the midst of the earth,” that is, while our soul is imprisoned in this earthly body, judgment and righteousness must be executed for our benefit in the future when “everyone receives either good or ill according to the deeds he has done in his body.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL415_243_3" id="target_note_LCL415_243_3"><sup>3</sup></a>
