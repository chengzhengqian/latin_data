say that its misery too has always existed. If not, we go on to ask why, if some condition of the soul that has not existed from eternity began to exist from some moment in time, why should it have been impossible for the soul itself to come into being at a certain moment, although it had no existence before? In the second place the soul’s happiness, which after its trial of evil is more secure and is destined to endure forever, as Porphyry admits, undoubtedly also began at a given moment, and yet it will exist forever, though it had no previous existence.</p>
<p>So then the whole argument in support of the view that nothing can be without an end in time unless it also had no beginning in time falls apart. For we have discovered a contrary instance: although the happiness of the soul had a beginning in time, it will still have no ending in time. Therefore let human weakness yield to divine authority, and on the subject of true religion let us trust those happy and immortal beings who do not seek for themselves the honour that they know is due to their God, who is also ours. They bid us sacrifice to him alone whose sacrifice we too along with them are duty-bound to be, as I have often said and must often say in future. We must be offered as a sacrifice, and the minister of the sacrifice must be He who in the human form that he took upon himself and in which he chose also to serve as priest, deigned to become a sacrifice for us even unto death.</p>
