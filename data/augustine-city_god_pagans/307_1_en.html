<p class="noindent">However, men who do not obtain the gift of the Holy Spirit and bridle their baser passions by pious faith and by love of intelligible beauty, at any rate live better because of their desire for human praise and glory. While these men are not saints, to be sure, they are less vile. Cicero also could not disguise this fact. For in the books which he wrote <span class="italic">On the Commonwealth,</span> when he spoke about training the leader of the state, he says that he should be nurtured on glory.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL412_209_2" id="target_note_LCL412_209_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Following this up, he records the fact that his own ancestors had done many marvellous and famous deeds because of their passion for glory. This proves that they not only failed to resist this vice, but even judged it a thing to be aroused and kindled, because they believed it to be advantageous to the state. Moreover, not even in his philosophical works did Cicero shrink from this pestilential notion, for he declares allegiance to it in them as plain as day. When speaking about such pursuits as should in any case be taken up with the true good in mind as their goal, not the windy praise of men, he brought in this universal and general maxim: “Honour fosters the arts. All men are fired to endeavour by glory; and there can never be high achievement in matters that are held in low esteem by a particular people.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL412_209_3" id="target_note_LCL412_209_3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
