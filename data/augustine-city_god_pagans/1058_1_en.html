<p>Neither does God speak to the angels in the way in which we speak to one another or to God or the angels, or the angels to us, or God to us through their agency, but he addresses them in his own indescribable fashion. Yet his words are revealed to us after our fashion. For in fact the sublime speech of God in advance of his action is the immutable reason of the action itself. Nor has his speech a noisy and transitory sound; it has a power that abides eternally and operates temporally. By this he addresses the holy angels, but speaks otherwise to us, who are far away. We too, however, when we apprehend something of such speech by our inward ears, are not far from angels. Therefore there is no need for me to keep explaining the speeches of God in this work. For invariable truth either speaks ineffably by itself to the minds of rational creatures, or speaks through a mutable creature, whether to our minds by means of incorporeal images or to our physical senses by means of corporeal voices.</p>
<p>Surely those words: “Nor will anything that they attempt from now on fail”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL415_37_1" id="target_note_LCL415_37_1"><sup>1</sup></a> were spoken not as an assertion but as a question, such as men are wont to use when they utter threats, as when a certain writer says: “Shall they not procure arms and follow from the whole city?”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL415_37_2" id="target_note_LCL415_37_2"><sup>2</sup></a> We must interpret this sentence, therefore, in this way, as though he said: “Will not all the things that they may attempt fail?” Now saying the words in this way does not give them a threatening tone. But to help those who are somewhat slow of comprehension we have added the particle -<span class="italic">ne</span> to form the word <span class="italic">nonne,</span> inasmuch as the speaker’s tone of voice cannot be indicated in writing.</p>
