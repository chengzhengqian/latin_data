were approved by God, is rejected, but because the writings are not believed to be theirs.</p>
<p>Nor should it seem surprising that writings which are published with a name of such antiquity in the title are classed as doubtful, since in the actual history of the kings of Judah and Israel, which records events that we accept as true on the authority of that same canon of Scripture, there are many references to matters not there explained that are said to be found in other books composed by prophets, and sometimes the actual names of those prophets, too, are not withheld; yet the books are not found in the canon that is accepted by the people of God.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL416_11_1" id="target_note_LCL416_11_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>The reason for this circumstance, I confess, is hidden from me, except that I think that even those men to whom the Holy Spirit certainly revealed matters that properly fell within the scope of religious authority may have written sometimes as men, thanks to historical research, and sometimes as prophets, by divine inspiration; and the two kinds were so different that one kind, such was the verdict, must be credited, as it were, to themselves, the other to God speaking through them. Thus one kind contributed to the increase of knowledge, the other to the authorized doctrines of religion; and in this field strict guard is kept over the canon. Apart from the canon, even if there are now works published bearing the names of true prophets, they have no validity even as items in the armoury of knowledge, since it is uncertain whether they are genuine works of the men to whom they are attributed. Therefore they are not trusted, especially those in which certain statements are found that are even contrary to the testimony of the canonical books, so that they are quite clearly not genuine.</p>
