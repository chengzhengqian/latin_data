<span class="label"><span class="italic">What consideration caused Jacob to be given also the surname of Israel.</span></span>
<p><span class="sc">Moreover</span>, Jacob was also named Israel, as I said a short time ago, and this was the name chiefly used by the people descended from him. Now this name was given him by the angel who wrestled with him on his homeward journey from Mesopotamia, who, as is most evident, acted as the type of Christ. For Jacob’s victory over the angel, naturally in accordance with his will, for the sake of the symbolic portrayal of the mystery, points to the passion of Christ, where the Jews seemed to prevail over him. And yet he obtained a blessing from the very angel whom he had overcome, and thus the conferring of this name was a benediction. Now Israel means ‘Seeing God’, which is to be the reward of all the saints at the end of the world. Furthermore, that same angel touched the broad part of the thigh of the ostensible victor, and thus made him lame.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL415_183_1a" id="target_note_LCL415_183_1a"><sup>1</sup></a> Thus one and the same man, Jacob, was both blessed and crippled—blessed in those among this same people who have embraced belief in Christ, and crippled in those who do not believe.

This explanation was followed by Philo (<span class="italic">On the Change of Names</span> 81; <span class="italic">Embassy to Gaius</span> 4; and frequently elsewhere), by Eusebius (<span class="italic">Preparation for the Gospel</span> 7.8.28; 11.6.30), and by Jerome in his book <span class="italic">On Hebrew Names</span> (<span class="italic">PL</span> 23,832 Israel est videre Deum, sive vir aut mens videns Deum), which was an adaptation from a similar work in Greek ascribed to Philo. Later, however, Jerome abandons this popular etymology in favour of the one implied in Genesis (<span class="italic">Hebrew Questions on Genesis, PL</span> 23,1038 f.)
