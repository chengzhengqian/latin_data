judgement. Found guilty, the devil received his sentence in the person of the serpent, while the woman and her husband received theirs in their own persons. For when God had said to her: “I shall greatly multiply your sorrows and your groaning, and with sorrow shall you bring forth children,” he added next: “And you shall ever come to your husband, and he shall be your master.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_447_1" id="target_note_LCL414_447_1"><sup>1</sup></a> The same words spoken to Cain about sin or the depraved desire of the flesh are here used of the sinful woman; and in this instance we are to understand that man, in order to rule his wife, should resemble the mind that rules the flesh.
