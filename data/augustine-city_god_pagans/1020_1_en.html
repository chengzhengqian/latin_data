were taken captive by love of the daughters of men, and in order to enjoy them as wives, they abandoned the godliness that they had observed in their holy society and sank into the lower morality of the earth-born society. For when physical beauty, which, though created by God, is a temporary and carnal good of the lowest sort, is loved in preference to God himself, who is an eternal, internal and sempiternal good, such love is as bad as when justice is abandoned and gold is loved by the avaricious, through no fault of the gold but of the man. So it is with every created thing. For though it is good, it can be loved both in a good way and in a bad way—in a good way, when due order is preserved, in a bad way when due order is disturbed. I expressed this thought briefly in a poem celebrating the paschal candle:</p>

For we must observe due order in loving even the love itself with which we love in a good way what is worthy of love, if there is to be in us the virtue that enables us to live a good life. Hence, in my opinion, a short and true definition of virtue is ‘a due ordering of love’; and this is why
