<span class="label"><span class="italic">For what supposed advantage the rulers of the nations preferred false religions to continue among the peoples subject to them.</span></span>
<p><span class="sc">Varro</span> also states that the people were more inclined to follow the poets than the philosophers with regard to the genealogies of the gods, and hence his ancestors (that is, the early Romans) believed in the sex and parentage of the gods, and included marriages among them in their system. It certainly appears that this was done for no other reason except that men who posed as prudent and wise made it their business to deceive the people in matters of religion. In this they not only worship, but also imitate the demons, whose greatest desire is to deceive. For just as demons can only possess those whom they have treacherously deceived, so also the rulers—certainly
not honest men, but men like the demons—taught
the people as true in matters of religion what they knew to be false. In this way they bound them with tighter chains, as it were, to the civil society, in order that they might possess men similarly enthralled. Now what weak and untaught person could at the same time escape the deception of the rulers and that of the demons?</p>
