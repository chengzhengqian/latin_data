inactive, the active and the composite, although any one might lead his life in any of them with faith unimpaired and attain to the everlasting rewards, nevertheless there is importance in what he possesses through his love of truth, and in what he pays out because of the claim of Christian love. No man ought to be so completely inactive as not to think of his neighbour’s advantage, nor so active as to neglect the contemplation of God.
