property to his son Isaac, and to the sons of his concubines Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away from his son Isaac while he himself was still living, eastward, to the eastern lands.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL415_161_1" id="target_note_LCL415_161_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Thus the sons of the concubines receive some gifts, but they do not succeed to the promised kingdom, neither the heretics nor the carnal Jews, because there is no heir save Isaac, and “not those who are sons of the flesh are the sons of God, but the sons of the promise are reckoned as his seed,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL415_161_2" id="target_note_LCL415_161_2"><sup>2</sup></a> concerning which this is said: “In Isaac shall your seed be called.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL415_161_3" id="target_note_LCL415_161_3"><sup>3</sup></a> For I see no reason why Keturah, who was married after his wife’s death, was called a concubine, unless it was for the sake of this mystery. But if anyone does not wish to accept these interpretations of these matters, let him not cast reproach on Abraham. For what if this was planned as an answer to later heretics, who attack second marriages,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL415_161_4" id="target_note_LCL415_161_4"><sup>4</sup></a> to demonstrate in the very case of the father of many nations that a second marriage after the first wife’s death is no sin?</p>
<p>And Abraham died when he was a hundred and seventy-five years old. Thus he left his son Isaac aged seventy-five, whom he begot when he was a hundred years old.</p>
