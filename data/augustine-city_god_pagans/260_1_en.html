who spent whole days in prayer and in making sacrifices in order that children of their own might survive them were called superstitious.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL412_115_1" id="target_note_LCL412_115_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Who could fail to understand that he, while showing respect for the customs of his city, was trying to praise the religion of his ancestors and wanted to disentangle it from superstition, but could find no way to do it? For if his ancestors called “superstitious” those who spent whole days in praying and sacrificing, were those also included who set up images of the gods (a thing he condemns), gods of different ages and differently dressed, with genealogies, marriages and family relationships? When he finds fault with these things as superstitious, he certainly casts aspersions on the ancestors who set up and worshipped such images. He makes himself also an accomplice, for although he tries with all his eloquence to extricate himself from their toils, he found it necessary to worship them. And the things which he, as a learned man, loudly proclaims in this treatise he would not dare to whisper in the popular assembly.</p>
<p>So let Christians give thanks to the Lord our God. He is not heaven, or earth, as Cicero argues, but the one who made heaven and earth. He has overthrown these superstitions, which Balbus (as if his name “Stammerer” were a true word) scarcely takes to task. He has overthrown them through the deep humility of Christ, through the preaching of the apostles and through the faith of the martyrs who died for the truth and live with Truth. He has overthrown them not only in the hearts of believers, but also in the temples of superstition, by the freely rendered service of his people.</p>
