who erected the Capitolium there. Aesculapius, too, shifted quarters from Epidaurus to Rome so that this most skilled physician might in this noblest city practise his art with greater renown. The Mother of the Gods also came from Pessinus, wherever that may be, for it was hardly fitting that when her son now had his high seat on the Capitoline Hill, she should still be hidden in an obscure spot. If she is the mother of all the gods, however, she not only followed some of her sons to Rome but came before others who were still to follow. I do admire her, if she herself gave birth to Cynocephalus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL411_303_1" id="target_note_LCL411_303_1"><sup>1</sup></a> who long afterwards came from Egypt. Whether even the goddess Fever is one of her daughters is a matter for her great-grandson
Aesculapius to decide.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL411_303_2" id="target_note_LCL411_303_2"><sup>2</sup></a> But whoever her mother was, I do not suppose that the foreign gods will dare to call baseborn a goddess who is a Roman citizen.</p>
<p>So many were the gods who thus protected Rome, and who can count them: native gods and foreign-born, gods celestial and terrestrial, infernal and marine, fountain gods and river gods, and, as Varro says, gods certain and uncertain, and in every class of gods, as in every kind of animal, the male and the female? Surely, Rome founded as she was under the protection of so many gods, should not have been assailed and afflicted by such great and terrible calamities, of which I shall mention only a few out of many.</p>
<p>For she had summoned for her protection, by a cloud of her own smoke, as it were by a signal raised, far too many gods in order to establish and provide temples, altars, sacrifices, and priests for them, and in doing so to offend the true and most high God to whom alone such religious service should be rendered.</p>
