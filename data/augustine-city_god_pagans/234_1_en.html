<span class="label"><span class="italic">If Jupiter is the supreme power, should Victory also be regarded as a goddess?</span></span>
<p>Do they say, perchance, that Jupiter sends the goddess Victory, and that she obeys him as king of the gods, and comes to those he points out, and takes her place at their side? This might be said with truth, not of that Jupiter whom they fashion to match their fancy as king of the gods, but of the true King of the ages: that he sends, not Victory (who is no real being), but his angel, and gives victory to the man of his choice. His design may be hidden, but can never be unrighteous.</p>
<p>If Victory is a goddess, why is not Triumph also a god, and joined to Victory either as husband or brother or son? Such indeed were the fancies they had about their gods; if the poets invented such fancies and we attacked them, they would reply that the fictions of the poets were only ridiculous stories, not to be taken seriously of the real deities. And yet they did not find themselves ridiculous when they were worshipping such absurdities in the temples, and not merely reading about them in the poets. Therefore they ought to have prayed to Jupiter for everything, and made supplication to him alone. For wherever he had sent Victory, if she was a goddess and subject to him as king, she could not possibly venture to oppose him and act by her own volition instead.</p>
