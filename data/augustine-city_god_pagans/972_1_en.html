<span class="label"><span class="italic">How it was that Cain founded a city amid the first beginnings of the human race.</span></span>
<p><span class="sc">My</span> task at this time, I think, is to uphold the historical account. Otherwise Scripture may not seem credible when it states that a city was built by one man at a time when the earth was populated apparently by not more than four men or rather by only three after the act of fratricide. These three were presumably the first man, who was the father of all, Cain himself and his son Enoch, after whose name the city itself was called.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_449_1" id="target_note_LCL414_449_1"><sup>1</sup></a> But those who are troubled here overlook the fact that the writer of this sacred history was under no obligation to name all the people who may then have existed but only the few required by the plan of the work undertaken. For the aim of that writer, through whom the Holy Spirit was operating, was to arrive at Abraham through a succession of certain generations descended from a single man, and then to proceed from the seed of Abraham to Godâ€™s people, which was set apart from the other nations and would serve to foreshadow and foretell all things that relate to the city whose kingdom will be eternal and to its king and founder Christ, as they were foreseen by inspiration of the Spirit as destined to come. In this connexion, moreover, the other society of men, which we call the earthly city, was likewise mentioned and described to an extent sufficient for the City of God to stand out in brilliant relief by contrast with its opposite.</p>
