severity as they deserve. That does not mean that they will escape these punishments, or ever reach their end, but that they will suffer punishments which are more gentle and easy than they deserve. For thus the anger of God will remain, and in his very anger he will not shut up his tender mercies. My not opposing this view does not, however, mean that I support it.</p>
<p>Some men think that God made a mere threat, and not a true declaration, when He said: “Depart from me, you cursed, into eternal fire,” and “These shall go into eternal punishment,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL417_123_1" id="target_note_LCL417_123_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and “They shall be tormented for ever and ever,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL417_123_2" id="target_note_LCL417_123_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and “Their worm will not die and their fire will not be quenched,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL417_123_3" id="target_note_LCL417_123_3"><sup>3</sup></a> and other sayings of the sort.
