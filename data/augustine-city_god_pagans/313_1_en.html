Suppose this came to pass without Mars and Bellona, so that Victory too had no place, with no one to conquer when no one had fought. Then would not the Romans and the other nations be in one and the same condition? This would be particularly true if the welcome and humane step had been taken at once that was taken later, of granting partnership in the state to all who were subjects of the empire, so that they were Roman citizens. Thus the privilege that formerly belonged to but few would have belonged to all, except that the Roman populace, having no land of their own, would have continued to live at public expense. Under good public administrators this feeding of the people would have been more cheerfully provided by agreement than by extortion from the conquered.</p>
<p>As far as security and morality are concerned, those true values of human life, I am quite unable to see what difference it makes that some men are victors and others vanquished, except for the utterly empty pride in human glory. In that pride those men received their reward, burning with intense desire for glory and spreading the flames of war. Do not Roman lands pay tribute? Have Romans permission to learn anything that is forbidden to others? Are there not many senators in other lands, who do not know Rome even by sight? Take away their boasting, and what are all men? Nothing but men. And if the perversity of the world permitted honours to be distributed according to merit, even so honour in the eyes of men ought not to have been considered of great importance, for it is a smoke that has no weight.</p>
