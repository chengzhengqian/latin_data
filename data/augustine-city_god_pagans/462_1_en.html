were designed to promote a good life. Thales, on the other hand, investigated the nature of things and, in order to establish a school that would survive him, recorded his findings in works which made him famous. His most wonderful achievement lay in his ability to foretell solar and lunar eclipses through his grasp of astronomical calculation. He did hold, however, that water is the primary substance and that from it originate all the elements of the universe, the universe itself, and everything that comes into being therein. Yet he set over this great work, the universe which seems so marvellous when we contemplate it, no regulation by divine intelligence.</p>
<p>Anaximander, who was his pupil, succeeded him, but held a different view about nature. He did not postulate any single original substance, as Thales did in choosing moisture, but thought that individual substances are engendered in each case by their own proper primordial elements. He believed in an infinite number of these primordial elements for each kind of substance,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_9_1" id="target_note_LCL413_9_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and held that they bring into being countless universes along with whatever is produced in them. These universes, he thought, are subjected continually to alternate dissolution and regeneration, with as long a period of existence as is possible in each case. He likewise granted no rôle in these workings of nature to a divine intelligence. Anaximander was succeeded by his disciple Anaximenes,
who ascribed the origin of everything to infinite air. He did not deny the existence of the gods or ignore the question, but he believed that they were not the creators of air, but were themselves derived from air.</p>

Anaxagoras (see below) appears to have held that all things have their origin in infinitely small particles or ‘seeds’ (σπέρματα or, as Aristotle called them, ὁμοιομερῆ).</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL413_9_1').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
