rites to demons. What they should rather attribute to Christ is this, namely that for his name’s sake, in spite of the established rules of warfare, the barbarians set apart as sanctuaries precincts sacred to religion and of the widest area, and in many instances showed such respect, not only for genuine membership in the household of Christ but even for false claims inspired by fear, that they condemned as illicit for themselves acts that by the laws of war would have been permitted them in dealing with those to whom I refer.</p>
<p>Here we were met by the question why these divine benefits were extended even to the wicked and thankless, and why those hardships of war likewise afflicted the just equally with the unjust. This question has many implications, for in all our daily adventures, whether we experience God’s bounty or human disasters, in either case those who live a good or a bad life are often jointly and indiscriminately affected; and many are disturbed by this fact. As the plan of my projected work required me to answer it, I dwelt on it at some length, and chiefly to bring consolation to the holy and religiously chaste women who were criminally attacked by an enemy in such a way as to grieve their modesty, although they lost nothing of their unshaken chastity. I would not have them sorry to be alive, when there is nothing in their lives to make them sorry for sin.</p>
