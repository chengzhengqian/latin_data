As for Minerva, since they have put her in charge of the crafts and have not even found a star to put her on, they have said that she is either the highest realm of aether, or even the moon. And they have also supposed Vesta to be the greatest of the goddesses,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL412_433_2" id="target_note_LCL412_433_2"><sup>2</sup></a> for the reason that she is the earth. Yet they have also thought that the gentler fire of the world, which is suited to human use, should be assigned to her, though not the more violent fire, which belongs to Vulcan.</p>

of Neoplatonic than of Stoic allegory.
