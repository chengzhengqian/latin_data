reason why he wrote first about human things and later about divine things was that states came into existence first, and that these institutions were established by the states. But true religion was not instituted by any earthly city-state, but was itself clearly the founder of a heavenly city, a city truly inspired and instructed by the true God, who gives eternal life to his true worshippers.</p>
<p>Now when Varro confesses that his reason for writing first about human things and later about divine things was that the latter were instituted by men, he gives this explanation: “Just as the painter exists before the picture, and the builder before the building, so the city-states precede the institutions that are set up by them.” Yet he says that he would have written first about the gods and then about men if he had been writing about the divine nature as a whole. The implication is that he deals with part of their nature, and not the whole, and that a good part of the divine being, though not the whole, should not be given precedence over human beings. And what of the fact that in the last three books, when carefully explaining the “certain” and “uncertain” and “select” gods, he seems to omit no part of the divine nature? Then why does he say, “If we were writing about the whole nature of gods and of men, we should have dealt with divine matters before touching on human matters”? For either he is writing about the whole nature of the gods, or about some part, or about no part at all. If he is writing about the whole, it should by all means be placed before human things; and if he is writing only about a part, why does not that part also not take precedence
