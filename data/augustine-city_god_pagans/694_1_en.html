rational though it may be, and on such a tenure that they cannot lose it, not even if they so wish.</p>
<p>But who can clearly determine to what extent they partook of that wisdom before they had sinned? Again, how shall we say that they had equal possession of it with those who are fully and truly happy precisely because they are in no way mistaken in thinking that their happiness is eternal? For surely if they had been equal sharers in this wisdom, they too would have continued to be eternally happy equally with the others, since they must have been equally certain of the future. For happiness is like life; however long it is, it cannot truly be called eternal life if it is destined to have an end; life is life because someone is alive, but it is qualified as eternal only if it has no end. It follows that, though eternity does not automatically ensure happiness, for it is said that hell fire is eternal, yet, if we assume that life is not truly and completely happy unless it is eternally so, then they did not enjoy that sort of life, for their life of happiness was to come to an end some day and therefore was not eternal, whether they knew this to be true or, not knowing, had some other notion. For if they knew this, then fear, and if they did not know it, ignorance, assuredly prevented their being happy. But if their not knowing came to this, that they put no trust in false or uncertain hopes, but could not take the decisive step of believing with steadfast conviction either that their happiness was eternal or that it was destined to end some day, this indecision on the vital question of their happiness was itself a negation of the fully happy life
