injustice; and that a government cannot be carried on or endure at all without a high degree of justice.</p>
<p>When this point has been treated to the satisfaction of those present, Scipio once more returns to the main theme, and resumes and recommends his own brief definition of a state, in which he had said that a state is the people’s estate. He specifies, however, that by a people he means, not every gathering of a throng, but a gathering united in fellowship by a common sense of right and a community of interest. Then he explains the great advantage of definition in debate, and he concludes from those particular definitions that a state, that is, a people’s estate, exists when there is good and lawful government whether in the hands of a monarch, or of a few nobles or of the whole people. When, however, the monarch is unlawful—he used the usual Greek term “tyrant” for such a monarch—or the nobles are unlawful—he called their mutual agreement a faction—Or
the people itself is unlawful—for this he found no current term if he were not to call it too a tyrant-then
the state is no longer merely defective, as had been argued the day before, but, as a chain of reasoning from the foregoing definitions would have made plain, does not exist at all. For there was no people’s estate, he said, when a tyrant or a party took over the state, nor was the people itself any longer a people, if it was unjust, since in that case it was not a throng united in fellowship by a common sense of right and a community of interest, as specified in the definition.</p>
