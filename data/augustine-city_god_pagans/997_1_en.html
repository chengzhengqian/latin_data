Thus in our wonderment we justly ask why for so many years he abstained from sexual union without any deliberate intention to remain continent, or, if he did engage in intercourse, why he did not have children, for we read also concerning him: “And he had sons and daughters, and all the days of Seth were nine hundred and twelve years, and he died.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_499_2" id="target_note_LCL414_499_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
