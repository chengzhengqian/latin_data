<span class="label"><span class="italic">On Virtus and Fides, whom the pagans honoured with temples and sacrifices, passing by other virtues which should have been similarly worshipped, if divinity is rightly ascribed to these.</span></span>
<p><span class="sc">They</span> have also made Virtus, or Virtue, a goddess; and if she were really a goddess she would deserve preference over many others. As it is, since she is not a goddess, but the gift of God, let her be sought and won from him by whom alone she can be granted, and the whole throng of false gods will vanish. But why was Fides, or Faith, also believed to be a goddess? Why did she also receive a temple and an altar? Whoever wisely acknowledges her makes himself her shrine where she may dwell. But how do they know what faith is, when her first and chief duty is to create belief in the one true God? And why was not Virtus enough? Doesn’t virtue also include faith? They saw that virtue was to be divided into four divisions: wisdom, justice, fortitude and moderation. And, since each of these has its own divisions, faith is a subdivision of justice, though it is the sovereign virtue for us who know the meaning of the words, “The just shall live by faith.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL412_71_1" id="target_note_LCL412_71_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>But I marvel at these men who are greedy for a multiplicity of gods. If Fides is a goddess, why have they slighted so many other goddesses in passing them by, when they might have dedicated similar temples and altars to them? Why did Moderation not win recognition as a goddess, since many Roman leaders have gained no small glory in her name?
