be certain that God could in no wise be seen through the eyes even of a spiritual body. But this doctrine is scorned by true reasoning and prophetic authority. For who is so far from the truth that he dares to say that God does not know these corporeal things? Has he therefore a body, through whose eyes he is able to acquire knowledge of them? Furthermore, does not what we said above about the prophet Elisha show well enough that corporeal things can be discerned by the spirit too, without the help of the body? For when that slave accepted the gifts it was certainly a corporeal transaction, but the prophet saw it not through the body, but through the spirit. So as it is certain that bodies are seen by the spirit, what if the power of the spiritual body is to be so great that spirit may also be seen by a body? For “God is Spirit.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL417_369_1" id="target_note_LCL417_369_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Moreover, it is by an inner sense and not by corporeal eyes that a man knows his own life, by which he now lives in the body and causes these earthly limbs to grow and live, but the lives of other men, though invisible, he sees through the body. For how do we distinguish living bodies from dead, unless we see bodies and at the same time lives, which we cannot see except through the body? But with corporeal eyes we do not see lives without bodies.</p>
<p>Therefore it is possible, and very probable, that we shall see the corporeal bodies of the new heaven and the new earth in such a way that, wherever we turn our eyes, we shall, through our bodies that we shall be wearing and plainly seeing, enjoy with perfect clarity of vision the sight of God everywhere present and ruling all things, even material things.
