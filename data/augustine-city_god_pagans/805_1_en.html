<p><span class="sc">God</span> therefore fashioned man in his own image.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_115_1" id="target_note_LCL414_115_1"><sup>1</sup></a> That is, he endowed him with a soul that enabled him through reason and intelligence to surpass all other animals that move on land or swim or fly, since they had no mind of this sort.
