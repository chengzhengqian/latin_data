in this earthly tabernacle. There must indeed be many because I cannot discover the one that is true, whether it be one among mine or one outside them that perhaps does not occur to me. Well, suppose I say that there always was in existence a creature for him who always is Lord and never has not been Lord to be lord over, but that there was a succession of different creatures during different periods of time, for we must not imply that any creature is coeternal with the Creator, a statement rejected by faith and sound reason alike. Then we must avoid the absurdity, which is contrary to true enlightenment, of inferring that, though some mortal creature always existed, one succeeding as another passed away, through one period after another, yet no immortal creature began its existence until our own age was reached when the angels were also created. I take it that we are right in supposing that they are symbolized by that light which was the first thing created or better still by that heaven of which it is said: “In the beginning God created heaven and earth.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_71_1" id="target_note_LCL414_71_1"><sup>1</sup></a> For indeed they could not exist before they were created; otherwise, being immortal, they might, if we say that they have always existed, be believed to be coeternal with God.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if I say that the angels were not created in time but before all measures of time and that they existed for God, who was never other than Lord, to be lord over, I shall next be asked whether, if they were created before all measures of time, created beings could always have existed. The propel answer to this question might perhaps be as follows: Why can we not say that they always existed
