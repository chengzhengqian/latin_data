church, are wise in their own eyes when they scoff at our statement that the separation of soul from body should be accounted among its punishments. The reason for this is that they hold that the soul attains its fullest bliss in the moment when, utterly stripped of all body, it returns to God simple, alone and, in a sense, naked.</p>
<p>In this matter, if I found nothing in their writings to refute this belief, I should have to argue more painstakingly to demonstrate that it is not the body as such but a corruptible body that is burdensome to the soul. This is what lies behind the following statement that we quoted in the preceding book<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_187_1" id="target_note_LCL414_187_1"><sup>1</sup></a> from our Scriptures: “For the corruptible body is heavy upon the soul.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_187_2" id="target_note_LCL414_187_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Surely, by adding ‘corruptible’ the sage meant that the soul was weighed down, not by just any sort of body, but by the body such as it became as a result of sin and consequent punishment.

But Plato declares in the clearest manner that the deities, who were made by the supreme God, have immortal bodies, and he represents God himself, their maker, as promising them a great boon in that they will for ever remain united to their bodies and never be severed from them by any death. Now, in view of all this, why is it that those philosophers, seeking to harry the Christian faith, pretend not to know what they do know or even prefer to be at odds with themselves and to speak against themselves, if only they may contradict us unremittingly?</p>
