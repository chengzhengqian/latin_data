who were prophets at that time, and Ezra, they had no prophets until the Saviour’s coming, except the other Zechariah, the father of John, and his wife Elizabeth, when Christ’s nativity was now at hand, and after his birth the old Simeon and Anna, a widow and already advanced in age, and John himself, the last among them. To be sure, since he and Christ were both young men at the time, John did not foretell Christ’s coming, but he did recognize the unrecognized Christ and with prophetic insight point him out. This explains why the Lord himself says: “The law and the prophets even down to John.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL415_359_1" id="target_note_LCL415_359_1"><sup>1</sup></a> But the prophecies of these five are known to us from the Gospel, in which the virgin herself, the mother of the Lord, is found to have prophesied before John did. But the rejected Jews do not accept the prophecy of these last, though the countless men among them who have come to believe the gospel have accepted them. For then Israel was truly divided into two parts by that division which was foretold to Saul the king by Samuel the prophet, a division that can never be changed. But Malachi, Haggai, Zechariah and Ezra even the rejected Jews have accepted, and regard as the last admitted to the list of those with divine authority. For there exist also writings by these men, like those by the others who, few in number among the great number of prophets, wrote those books which were to win canonical authority. I see that some of their predictions which relate to Christ and his church must be included in this work. This, by God’s help, will be more conveniently done in a following book. Thus I avoid adding more to the burden of this one, which is already so long.</p>
