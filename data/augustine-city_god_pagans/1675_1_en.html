to the testimony of ancient history and in the unhappy experiences of our times<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL417_299_1a" id="target_note_LCL417_299_1a"><sup>1</sup></a>—will anyone by honest reasoning contend that the whole is digested and passes out through the rear, and nothing of it is changed and converted into the flesh of the eater? The very change from his former emaciation shows well enough what were the losses made up by such food. I have already set down a little while ago some arguments which should duly serve to solve this problem as well. For whatever flesh is lost in hunger is undoubtedly gone out into the air, and we have said that almighty God can summon from the air what has escaped. So that flesh will be restored to the man in whom it first took shape as human flesh. For it must be reckoned as borrowed, so to speak, by the second man, and, like any debt, must be repaid to the one from whom it was borrowed. And to the man who was consumed with hunger, his own flesh will be restored by him who can recall even what vanished into the air. Even if it had utterly perished, and no substance of his remained in any of nature’s hiding-places, the Almighty would restore it from any source he might choose. But since we have the statement of the Truth where it says: “A hair of your head shall not perish,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL417_299_2" id="target_note_LCL417_299_2"><sup>2</sup></a> it is absurd to think
that while a man’s hair cannot perish, so much flesh wasted and consumed by hunger could perish.</p>
<p>Now that all these objections have been considered

Jerome in a letter from Bethlehem relates the shock brought by the news, which included the report that a mother had eaten her own child. Jerome’s highly rhetorical letter may well be taking this theme from Josephus, <span class="italic">Jewish War</span> 6.201–213.
Augustine again refers to cannibalism in Chapter XXII, p. 313.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL417_299_1a').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL417_299_2"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL417_299_2" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">2</sup>Luke 21.18.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL417_299_2').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
