brightness, unseen by those who saw other objects, it is called in Greek <span class="italic">aorasia.</span> <a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL417_295_1a" id="target_note_LCL417_295_1a"><sup>1</sup></a> Our translators could not find a Latin equivalent, and in the book of Genesis translated it <span class="italic">caecitas,</span> or “blindness.” For this is what the men of Sodom suffered when they were looking for the door of the righteous man and could not find it.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL417_295_2" id="target_note_LCL417_295_2"><sup>2</sup></a> If it had been the blindness in which nothing can be seen, they would not have been looking for the door to enter, but for guides to take them away from there.</p>
<p>Our love for the blessed martyrs somehow leads us to wish in that kingdom to see in their bodies the scars of the wounds which they have suffered for the name of Christ, and perhaps we shall see them. For it will not be a deformity in them, but an honour, and in their body will shine a certain beauty, not of the body, but of virtue. Still, if limbs have been cut off or torn away from the martyrs, they will not for this reason be without those limbs in the resurrection. For it was said to them: “A hair of your head shall not perish.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL417_295_3" id="target_note_LCL417_295_3"><sup>3</sup></a> But if in that new age it is fitting that the marks of their glorious wounds be seen in that immortal flesh, then in the place where the limbs were struck off or cut away that they might be separated, there will be seen scars, but the limbs will nevertheless be restored, not destroyed. And so though all the defects that may have befallen the body will then be gone, the marks of virtue are not to be considered or spoken of as defects.</p>
