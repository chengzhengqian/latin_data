<p>But let us even in this matter make use of the profitable lesson that the Lord our God provides. Let us consider what great things those Romans disregarded, what they endured, what passions they subdued, all to get glory in the eyes of men. And so they earned the right to receive it as a reward for such virtues. And let this new thought be strong enough to hold down our pride. Let us reflect that the city in which we Christians have the promise of reigning is as far removed from this Rome as heaven is from earth, eternal life from temporal joys, solid glory from hollow praise, the company of angels from that of mortals, and the light of him who made sun and moon from the light of sun and moon; that accordingly we citizens of such a state should not look upon ourselves as having done any great thing if we have accomplished some good works to attain it, or endured some evils, seeing that the Romans did such deeds and suffered such evils for the earthly home that they possessed already. And the remission of sins that gathers citizens for the eternal city has something in it of the famous asylum of Romulus, which was a sort of shadow cast ahead. For there the multitude which was to found the city was brought together by a promised amnesty for all and sundry crimes.</p>
