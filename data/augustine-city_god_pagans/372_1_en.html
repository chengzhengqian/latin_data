that is responsible for their rule that each must be invoked for his own special kind of service? I have already said a great deal on this subject, but not everything. Isnâ€™t this better suited to the buffoonery of the mimes than to the dignity of the gods? If anyone employed two nurses for a child, of whom one gave nothing but food to him, and the other nothing but drink, as the pagans employed for this purpose two goddesses, Educa and Potina, he would certainly seem to be playing the fool, and acting out something like a farce in his house. They say that the god Liber gets his name from liberating because it is through his favour that males in intercourse are liberated from, or relieved of, the semen which they emit. For women they say that the same service is performed by Libera, whom they also identify with Venus; for they think that the woman also emits seed.

In the early republic their cult was Hellenized and subordinated to that of Demeter-Ceres; Liber was identified with Dionysus-Bacchus
and Libera with Kore-Persephone. But their originally independent character was recognized by the pontifical
books that were used by Varro. Learned etymology was added, as well as an alternative identification with Venus-Aphrodite.
