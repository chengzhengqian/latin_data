universal sacrifice through the High Priest who in his passion offered even himself for us in the shape of a slave<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_277_1" id="target_note_LCL413_277_1"><sup>1</sup></a> that we might be the body of so great a head. For it was this shape that he offered, in this that he was offered, because in consequence of this he is mediator, in this he is priest, in this he is a sacrifice. So after having exhorted us to present our bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, which is our reasonable service, and not to shape ourselves in conformity with this world, but to be transformed by the renovation of our heart, that we may have judgement to know what is the will of God, that which is good and acceptable and perfect, the whole sacrifice being ourselves, the Apostle continues, “For by the grace of God given to me I bid every one among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think, but to think with sober judgement, each according to the measure of faith which God has assigned to him. For as in one body we have many members, and all the members do not have the same function, so we, though many, are one body in Christ, but individually members one of another, having gifts that differ according to the grace given to us.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_277_2" id="target_note_LCL413_277_2"><sup>2</sup></a> This is the Christian sacrifice: “though many, one body in Christ.” And this sacrifice the Church continually celebrates in the rite of the altar well known to the faithful, in which it is made clear to her that in her offering she herself is offered to God.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_277_3" id="target_note_LCL413_277_3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
