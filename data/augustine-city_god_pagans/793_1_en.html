know all numbers because of their infinity and that his knowledge extends to a certain sum total of numbers but is ignorant of the rest? Who, no matter how demented, would say that?</p>
<p>Nor will those philosophers be so bold as to scorn numbers and say that they do not fall within the realm of God’s knowledge, for Plato, who is one of them, with his great authority represents God as fashioning the world on numerical principles.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_91_1" id="target_note_LCL414_91_1"><sup>1</sup></a> And in our own Scripture we read the words addressed to God: “Thou hast ordered all things by measure and number and weight.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_91_2" id="target_note_LCL414_91_2"><sup>2</sup></a> The prophet also says of God: “He who brings forth an age by number,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_91_3" id="target_note_LCL414_91_3"><sup>3</sup></a> and in the gospel the Saviour says: “Your hairs are all numbered.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_91_4" id="target_note_LCL414_91_4"><sup>4</sup></a> Let us then not doubt that every number is known to him “of whose understanding,” as the psalm goes, “there is no set number.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_91_5" id="target_note_LCL414_91_5"><sup>5</sup></a> Accordingly, the infinity of number, although there is no set number of infinite numbers, nevertheless is not incomprehensible to him “of whose understanding there is no set number.” Wherefore, if whatever is comprehended by knowledge is limited by the comprehension of him who knows, assuredly all infinity also is in some ineffable way finite to God because it is not incomprehensible for his knowledge.</p>
<p>Consequently, if the infinity of numbers cannot be without limit for the knowledge of God by which it is comprehended, who indeed are we petty men to presume to set limits to his knowledge by saying that, unless the same temporal things are repeated in the same periodic cycles, God cannot either foreknow
