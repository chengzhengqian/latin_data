statement quoted above. For he adds the following words: “With these views the opinion of our ancestors about the plurality of these goddesses is not in conflict.” How can it not be in conflict? Surely it is a very different thing for one goddess to have many names, and for many goddesses to exist. “It is possible,” Varro says, “for the same thing to be one, and to have many things contained in it.” I grant that there are many things in one man, but are there for this reason many men? Granting that there are many things in one goddess, are there for this reason many goddesses? But let them go on as they like, let them divide or combine, multiply or simplify, and complicate the list of gods.</p>
<p>These are the famous mysteries of Tellus and the Great Mother, in which everything relates to perishable seeds and the work of agriculture. Then is it possible that the features which belong to this cult and have that function—the timbrel, the towers, the Galli, the wild tossing of the limbs, the banging of the cymbals, and the lions depicted—give anyone the promise of eternal life? They say that the mutilated Galli serve this great goddess to indicate that those who lack seed should follow after the earth—as if it were not rather their own slavery that caused them to be without seed! For do they by following the goddess acquire seed when they lack it, or do they rather by following her lose the seed that they have? Is this an explanation or a denunciation of the rites? Nor do people observe how far malignant demons have got the upper hand, in that they have been able to exact such cruel service without promising any great reward to be gained by the rites.</p>
