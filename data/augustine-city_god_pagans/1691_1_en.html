errors and untruth? For we are speaking now about the natural capacity of the human mind with which this mortal life is endowed, not about the faith and way of truth by which that immortal life is obtained. Since the creator of this nature, great as it is, is surely the true and supreme God, who himself governs what he has made, and has supreme power and supreme justice, mankind would surely never have fallen to this wretched state, would never have been doomed—except for those who shall be set free—to go from present into eternal wretchedness unless there had come first an all too great sin in the case of the first man from whom the others sprang.</p>
