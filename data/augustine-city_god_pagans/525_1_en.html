<p>Then he goes on to say: “Does not Hermes, my ancestor whose name I bear, have his dwelling in the city to which he has given his name, and does he not help and protect all men who come from every place?” For this elder Hermes, that is to say, Mercury, whom he calls his ancestor, is said to have his dwelling in Hermopolis, that is, in the town that bears his name.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_135_3" id="target_note_LCL413_135_3"><sup>3</sup></a> So there we have two gods whom he declares to have been men, Aesculapius and Mercury. But Greeks and Latins hold the same opinion of Aesculapius; as for Mercury, however, many do not believe that he was a mortal, and yet Hermes asserts that he was his ancestor. We shall be told: “But Hermes the god is a different person from the ancestor of Hermes, although both bear the same name.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_135_4" id="target_note_LCL413_135_4"><sup>4</sup></a> I shall not make a great issue of the contention that the two are different. But I do note that one Hermes, like Aesculapius, is a god who was once a man according to the testimony of his descendant Trismegistus, whose prestige is so great among his followers.</p>
