our offering rather than those things of which they are symbols. Hence he says in another passage of a different Psalm: “If I grow hungry, I shall not tell you; for the world is mine and its fulness. Shall I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats?”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_271_1" id="target_note_LCL413_271_1"><sup>1</sup></a> As if he were to say: In any case, if I had to have them, I should not ask you for them, for I have them at my command. Then he appends an explanation of his words: “Offer to God a sacrifice of thanksgiving, and pay your vows to the Most High: and call upon me in the day of trouble; and I will deliver you and you shall glorify me.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_271_2" id="target_note_LCL413_271_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

In the epistle entitled to the Hebrews it is said: “Do not forget to do good and to share what you have, for such sacrifices are pleasing to God”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_271_4" id="target_note_LCL413_271_4"><sup>4</sup></a> And so, where it is written: “I want mercy, and not sacrifice,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_271_5" id="target_note_LCL413_271_5"><sup>5</sup></a> this must be understood to mean merely that one kind of sacrifice is preferred to another.
