The same explanation is given for the asbestos stone, which has no fire of its own, but catches fire from without and burns so that it cannot be extinguished; so for the other cases, irksome to rehearse, in which an unusual power seems to be present contrary to nature, yet no other explanation is given except to say that such is their nature.</p>
<p>No doubt their explanation is short, and still it answers well enough. But since God is the author of all natural substances, why will they not let us give a better reason, and reply that this is the will of almighty God, when they refuse to believe what they say is incredible and demand an explanation? He is assuredly called almighty for no other reason except that he can do whatever he wishes. He was able to create many things which would surely be thought impossible unless they were manifest, or were affirmed even today by credible witnesses; these include not only things unknown among us, but also the well-known facts I have mentioned. For anyone may justifiably doubt reports which have no witnesses except the authors in whose books we read about them, if these are not men divinely taught, and may have gone wrong as men do.</p>
