<p>Now the reason for this is that man’s genesis from man is not like man’s genesis from dust. For dust served as the material used for the manufacture of man, but man serves as parent for the procreation of man. Accordingly, whereas flesh is not the same thing as earth, though flesh was manufactured from earth, yet man the offspring is just the same thing as man the parent. Therefore the entire human race that was to pass through woman into offspring was contained in the first man when that conjugal couple received the divine sentence condemning them to punishment, and man reproduced what man became, not when he was being created, but when he was sinning and being punished, at least as far as the origin of sin and death is concerned.</p>
<p>For the first man was not reduced by sin or punishment to an infantile state of mental dullness and bodily weakness, such as we see in small children. God meant that these traits should represent the first stages, as it were, of the puppies or cubs whose parents he had cast down to a beast-like level of life and death. For as we read in Scripture, “Man, when he was in honour, did not understand; he was compared to beasts that lacked understanding and became like them.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_143_1" id="target_note_LCL414_143_1"><sup>1</sup></a> And so it is, except that infants, as we see, are even weaker in the use and movement of their limbs and in their sense of desire and aversion than the most delicate new-born offspring of other animals. This suggests that a man’s powers shoot up all the higher above those of other animals, according as they have been drawn back like an arrow when the bow is bent and have thus increased the tension of their thrust.</p>
