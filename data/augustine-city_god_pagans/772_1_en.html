Hence, to avoid extended argument showing how the vain character of those writings which record far more thousands of years is refuted and how no authority worthy of the subject is found in them, let us take the famous letter that Alexander the Great wrote to his mother Olympias.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_49_1" id="target_note_LCL414_49_1"><sup>1</sup></a> In it he introduces the account of events given by a certain Egyptian priest, which the latter extracted from writings held sacred among that people.
