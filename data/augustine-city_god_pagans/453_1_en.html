dead were also summoned, a practice called <span class="italic">nekyo-mantia</span> 
in Greek. But whether called hydromancy or necromancy, it is the same thing, where the dead appear to prophesy. As for the arts by which this is accomplished, I leave that to the pagans, for I will not affirm that these arts were forbidden by law in heathen cities even before the coming of our Saviour, and punished by severe penalties. This, I say, I will not affirm, for perhaps such things were then lawful. However, it was by these arts that Pompilius learned those sacred rites whose action he revealed, while at the same time he buried the explanations, such was even his fear of what he had learned. And when the books containing these causes were produced, the Senate burned them.</p>
<p>Then why does Varro offer other explanations of some sort for those rites, explanations supposedly based on nature? If Numa’s books had explanations of that sort, they would surely not have been burned, or else the conscript fathers would likewise have burned Varro’s books as well, even after they were dedicated to Caesar, the Pontifex Maximus, and published. Well, it was because Numa Pompilius drew, that is, carried out the water to perform hydromancy, that he is said to have had the nymph Egeria as a wife—an explanation given in the book of Varro previously cited.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL412_501_1a" id="target_note_LCL412_501_1a"><sup>1</sup></a> Thus it is that real events are turned into fables by sprinkling them with lies.

In Rome her name was attached to the spring of the Camenae near the Porta Capena, where the Vestals drew water for ritual purposes; hence her name was explained from the Vestals’ “carrying out” the water (Egeria from <span class="italic">egerere</span>). The Camenae were regarded as water nymphs, or Muses, like those known to the Greeks, and so Egeria was able to inspire and direct Numa in his dealings with the gods, and he in turn became a kind of “medicine man,” or magician (see Ovid, <span class="italic">Fasti</span> 3.275–348, with Frazer’s notes).</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL412_501_1a').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
