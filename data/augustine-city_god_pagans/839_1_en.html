<span class="label"><span class="italic">That, when Adam was about to sin, he himself forsook God before he was forsaken by God, and that his withdrawal from God was the first death of the soul.</span></span>
<p>Now, since in the words: “You shall die by death,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_183_1" id="target_note_LCL414_183_1"><sup>1</sup></a> it does not say ‘by deaths,’ let us understand here only that death which occurs when the soul is forsaken by its own life, which in its case means God. The soul was not first forsaken by God and so then forsook him, but the soul first forsook God and was then forsaken by him; for the will of the soul acts first for its own evil, whereas it is the will of the soul’s creator that acts first for its good, whether it be to create the soul which did not yet exist or to recreate it because it had fallen and perished. Accordingly, even though we understand that it was this death of which God gave notice when he said: “In the day that you eat of it you shall die by death,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_183_2" id="target_note_LCL414_183_2"><sup>2</sup></a> as if he had said: “In the day that you forsake me with disobedience I shall forsake you with justice,” surely in this death he gave notice also of the other deaths that doubtless were bound to follow.</p>
<p>For when in the flesh of the unruly soul there arose an unruly movement, on account of which our first parents covered up their shameful members, one death was experienced, that in which the soul was forsaken by God. This death was implied by his words when he said to the man who was distraught with fear and concealing himself: “Adam, where are you?”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_183_3" id="target_note_LCL414_183_3"><sup>3</sup></a> For surely God did not ask this in ignorance
