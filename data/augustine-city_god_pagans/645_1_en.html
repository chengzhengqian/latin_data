whole man, except for his sin, in order to cleanse man, and all that goes to make a man, from the infection of his sins. Would that you too had learned to know him and had entrusted yourself to him for a surer healing rather than either to your own virtue which, being human, is brittle and precarious, or to that utterly fatal practice of meddling with the occult. For he would not have played you false, whose holiness and immortality, as you yourself say in writing, have been acknowledged by your oracles.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_375_1" id="target_note_LCL413_375_1"><sup>1</sup></a> And the most renowned of poets also said of him by poetic symbolism, be it noted, for it was another’s portrait that he sketched, and yet it was a true description if applied to Christ himself:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">With you as guide, such traces of our crimes</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">As linger shall be done away; no more</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Shall terror through the years hold fast the earth.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_375_2" id="target_note_LCL413_375_2"><sup>2</sup></a></span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">Clearly he speaks of such traces as may well linger, in those who are making great progress in the virtue of righteousness, because of the insecurity of our life here. There may be no more crimes, but there are traces; and such things have no healing except by the saviour of whom these verses speak. For clearly Virgil indicates that he did not deliver these verses as his own when he says in the fourth line, I think, of the same Eclogue:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">The final age has come as Cumae’s song foretold.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_375_3" id="target_note_LCL413_375_3"><sup>3</sup></a></span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">On this evidence we may without hesitation declare that these are the words of the Sibyl of Cumae.</p>
