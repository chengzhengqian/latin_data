the construction of so huge an ark, what was the need of including two unclean and seven clean animals of each species<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_573_1" id="target_note_LCL414_573_1"><sup>1</sup></a> when both kinds might have been preserved by the same number? Can it be that God, who ordered them to be preserved so as to restore their species, was unable to create them anew as he had created them before?</p>
<p>Others argue that we have here not an account of actual happenings but only symbolic language to convey hidden meanings. Their view is, first, that it is impossible for so vast a flood to have occurred that water rose fifteen cubits above the highest mountains. According to them, clouds cannot form above the summit of Mount Olympus because the atmosphere there is so high that the denser air in which winds, clouds and rains originate is lacking. They fail to observe that earth, the densest of all the elements, could be found there. Can they possibly deny that the summit of the mountain is made of earth? But if they admit that the earth could rise to those heights in the atmosphere, why then do they maintain that the waters could not? After all, those scientists who measure and weigh the elements do state that water rises higher and is lighter than earth. What reason therefore do they adduce to explain why earth, a heavier and lower element, could penetrate the region of the calmer atmosphere during the course of so many years, if water, which is lighter and rises higher, has not been allowed to do so even for a short time?</p>
<p>Moreover, people say that an ark of those dimensions cannot have contained so many species of animals of both sexes, two of each kind from the unclean
