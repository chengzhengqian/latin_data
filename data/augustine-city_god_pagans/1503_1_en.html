of such importance must be accomplished through the service of angels. Now if we ask who are the “righteous ones” whom the angels are to gather, the answer is, “they who set his covenant above sacrifices.” This is the whole life of the righteous: to set the covenant of God above sacrifices. For either it is the works of mercy that are “above sacrifices,” that is, are preferable to sacrifices, in accordance with the declaration of God, who says: “I desire mercy more than sacrifice”;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL416_413_1" id="target_note_LCL416_413_1"><sup>1</sup></a> or else, if “above sacrifices” means “<span class="italic">in</span> sacrifices,” just as what is certainly done “on earth” may be said to be done “above the earth,” then surely these very works of mercy are the sacrifices that are pleasing to God, as I remember that I have maintained in the tenth book of this work;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL416_413_2" id="target_note_LCL416_413_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and in these works the righteous “set up God’s covenant” because they do them for the sake of the promises that are contained in his new covenant. Therefore, when his righteous ones have been gathered and placed on his right hand in the last judgement, Christ shall certainly say: “Come, blessed of my Father, take possession of the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. For I was hungry, and you gave me to eat,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL416_413_3" id="target_note_LCL416_413_3"><sup>3</sup></a> and so forth, mentioning the good works of the good and their everlasting rewards to be given by the last sentence of the Judge.</p>
