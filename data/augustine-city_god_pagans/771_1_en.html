creation of the human race. For there are some who hold the view that men have always existed, just as they have already come to this conclusion about the universe itself.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_47_1" id="target_note_LCL414_47_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Hence, when Apuleius in particular is describing this race of animate beings, his words are: “Individually, they are mortal, yet collectively, as a comprehensive species, they are everlasting.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_47_2" id="target_note_LCL414_47_2"><sup>2</sup></a> And when we ask these people, on the assumption that the human race has always existed, what truth there can be in their historical accounts relating who the inventors were and what things they invented, who the first founders of liberal studies and of other arts were, or who first settled this or that region and section of the earth, and this or that island, they reply<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_47_3a" id="target_note_LCL414_47_3a"><sup>3</sup></a> that floods and conflagrations, occurring at fixed chronological intervals, lay waste most, but not all, of the earth’s surface so that mankind is reduced to very scanty remnants, and that from the offspring of these the original numbers are again renewed. Thus things that were cut short or destroyed by those immense disasters are again and again introduced as novel discoveries and practices, though really only a reintroduction takes place. Man, however, can spring only from pre-existing man. But in saying this they express what they think, not what they know.</p>
