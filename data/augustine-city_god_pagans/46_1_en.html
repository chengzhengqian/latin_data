commandment that prohibits false witness the prohibition specifies only false witness against a neighbour, and those who do not rightly understand might get the notion that no individual is forbidden to take the stand as a false witness against himself, how much the more should we understand that a man may not kill himself, since in the commandment, “Thou shall not kill,” there is no more added to this, and hence no one is understood to be excepted, certainly not the very man to whom the order is addressed!</p>
<p>On this basis some try to extend this commandment even to wild and domestic animals and maintain that it is wrong to kill any of them. Why not then extend it also to plants and to anything fixed and fed by roots in the earth? For things of this kind, though they have no feeling, are said to live, and therefore can also die, and hence, when violence is exercised, be slain.
