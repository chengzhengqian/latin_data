called the light day and the darkness night.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_451_1" id="target_note_LCL413_451_1"><sup>1</sup></a> But the nature of that light, by what shift back and forth it caused morning and evening and what kind of thing evening and morning were are questions that are far beyond the reach of our perception. Nor can our understanding see the way in which it is true, though that it is true we must believe untroubled by doubt. For either there exists a physical light, whether in the upper regions of the universe far beyond our power of sight or some light from which derived the later inflammation of the sun, or else the word light was used of that holy city, composed of holy angels and blessed spirits, of which the Apostle says: “The Jerusalem that is above, our eternal mother in heaven.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_451_2" id="target_note_LCL413_451_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Note that he says elsewhere too: “For you are all sons of light and sons of the day; we are not of the night or of darkness.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_451_3" id="target_note_LCL413_451_3"><sup>3</sup></a> The only question is whether we are able to find a meaning for the evening and the morning of such a day that will fit this interpretation to some extent.</p>

Accordingly, although the Scripture enumerated those first days in order, it nowhere inserted the the word night. It never says: “Night was made,” but instead: “There was made evening and there was made morning, one day.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_451_4" id="target_note_LCL413_451_4"><sup>4</sup></a> So also the second day and all the rest.
