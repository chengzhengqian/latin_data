incredible, it happened that at Carthage a roast peacock was served to me. I ordered as much meat as seemed good to be taken from its breast and kept. After a period of days in which any other roast meat would go bad, it was brought out and served without having the least offensive odour. It was put back again and after more than thirty days it was found as before, and again after a year it was the same except that its texture was somewhat more dry and shrunken.</p>
