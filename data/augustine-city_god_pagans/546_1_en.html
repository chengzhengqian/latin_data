Apuleius says, this fiction is not so far from the truth, for although the demons are called by the name of gods without being gods, yet they are described as they really are. In fact he places in this category Homer’s Minerva, “who in the midst of the assembled Greeks intervened to restrain Achilles.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_177_1" id="target_note_LCL413_177_1"><sup>1</sup></a> To call her Minerva is, he says, a poetic fiction, because he believes Minerva to be a goddess and gives her a place among the gods, all of whom he considers good and blessed, in a lofty region of the upper air, far from intercourse with mortals. But that there was some demon who favoured the Greeks and opposed the Trojans, just as the Trojans were helped against the Greeks by another demon, whom the same poet mentions under the name of Venus or Mars,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_177_2" id="target_note_LCL413_177_2"><sup>2</sup></a> although Venus and Mars are, according to Apuleius, gods dwelling in heavenly homes and not behaving in such a way; and that these demons fought among themselves for those they liked against those they hated, this, he acknowledges, is, in the poets’ description, not far from the truth.</p>
<p>The poets of course in their account were dealing with those “whose hearts,” so his statement runs, “are stirred by impulses resembling man’s, and their minds are rocked upon the surge of a restless imagination.” This makes it possible for them to indulge their loves and their hates with no regard for justice, just as the mob, which resembles them, indulges its own passionate feelings towards beast-baiters in the arena and charioteers, zealously supporting one favourite faction against the others.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_177_3a" id="target_note_LCL413_177_3a"><sup>3</sup></a> Our Platonic
