Moreover, anything that is found in both places is something that one and the same Spirit chose to say through both kinds of instrument, but in such wise that the one kind led the way in prophesying and the other came after with a prophetic translation of their words. For just as a single Spirit of peace inspired the former when they spoke true and concordant words, so the same single Spirit manifested himself in the latter when without mutual consultation they nevertheless translated the whole as if with one mouth.</p>
