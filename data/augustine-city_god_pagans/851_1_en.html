soul from the body is effected and through which without question the body of a living being, which was visibly alive, visibly perishes. True, there can be no doubt that the souls of the just and holy who are deceased live in repose. Yet they would be so much better off living with their bodies in sound health that even those who think it perfect bliss to be completely disembodied refute their own belief by a conflicting tenet.</p>
<p>None of them will venture to rate wise men, whether yet to die or already dead (that is, men who either already are bodiless or presently will abandon their bodies) higher than the immortal gods to whom the supreme God, according to Plato, promises the immense privilege of an indissoluble life or, in other words, an everlasting union with their bodies.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_207_1" id="target_note_LCL414_207_1"><sup>1</sup></a> But Plato also thinks that men, provided they have lived holy and just lives here on earth, receive the best reward that can be when they are separated from their bodies and received into the bosom of the very gods who never leave their bodies,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_207_2" id="target_note_LCL414_207_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p class="noindent">as Virgil so admirably expressed this view derived from Plato’s creed.</p>
<p>Thus Plato does not believe that the souls of mortals can always remain in their bodies, but rather that they are released by an inevitable death. Nor does he think that these souls survive for ever without bodies; rather people live and die in ceaseless alternation as they pass from one state to the other.
