<span class="label"><span class="italic">On David’s mystical purpose in his arrangement of the psalms.</span></span>
<p><span class="sc">While</span> the city of God was running its course through time, at first David reigned in the earthly Jerusalem, that shadow of the kingdom to come. Now David was a man skilled in songs, who loved musical harmony not for vulgar pleasure, but as a man of faith, for a purpose whereby he served his God, who is the true God, by the mystic prefiguration of a great matter. For the rational and proportionate symphony of diverse sounds conveys the unity of a well-ordered city, knit together by harmonious variety. Almost all his prophecy, then, is in his psalms, and what we call the book of Psalms contains one hundred and fifty of these. Some men maintain that only those psalms were composed by David that are inscribed with his name. Others think that none were composed by him except those introduced by the words ‘Of David himself,’ whereas those that have in their titles the words ‘For David himself’ were composed by others in a style suited to his person. This opinion is refuted by the words of the Saviour himself in the Gospel, when he says that David himself said in the spirit that Christ was his Lord, since the hundred and ninth psalm begins thus: “The Lord said to my Lord:’ Sit at my right hand till I make your enemies your footstool.’”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL415_311_1" id="target_note_LCL415_311_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Now certainly this psalm does not have ‘Of David himself’ in its title, but ‘For David himself,’ as the great majority do.</p>
