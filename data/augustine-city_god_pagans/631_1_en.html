<p>But once again Virgil unfortunately falls down and surrenders to her. For although he represents her as saying in one passage,</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">I am defeated by Aeneas,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_347_1" id="target_note_LCL413_347_1"><sup>1</sup></a></span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">yet Aeneas himself is exhorted by Helenus with what purports to be religious advice in the words:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">To Juno gladly chant your prayers and overbear</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">That mighty queen with suppliant gifts.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_347_2" id="target_note_LCL413_347_2"><sup>2</sup></a></span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">This sentiment leads Porphyry to the conclusion—which
he expresses not as his own opinion but as that of others—that no god or genius enters a man unless an evil god or genius has first been appeased. This implies that in their system evil spirits are more powerful than good, inasmuch as the evil spirits, so they say, prevent good spirits from giving aid unless they are first appeased and so make room for them. Unless the evil spirits consent, the good are powerless to help; but evil spirits can always do hurt because the good spirits are not strong enough to resist them. This is not the way of true and truly holy religion; not thus do our martyrs overcome Juno, which is to say the powers of the air that envy the valour of the god-fearing. Our heroes, if usage permitted us so to call them, do not in the least resort to gifts to overbear Hera, but to valour that comes from God. Surely it was better that Scipio should win his surname Africanus by conquering Africa valorously, than by appeasing the enemy with gifts and persuading them to have mercy.</p>
