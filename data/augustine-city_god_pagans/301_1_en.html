<p class="noindent">When Virgil represents Jupiter as predicting all this as if the events were in the future, the poet was really reviewing past history and looking at things as they were in his own present. But my reason for quoting these words is to show that the Romans had such regard for dominion, after liberty, that they put it high in their scale of noble achievements. The same thought is again expressed in the famous passage of the same poet where, above the arts of the other nations, he gives first place to the peculiarly Roman art of reigning and commanding and subjugating and beating down nations in war:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">Others with tenderer touch shall beat out the bronze</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">to be lifelike.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">That I must grant, for faces that live shall they draw</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">from the marble,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Cases at law with more eloquence plead, and the</span><span class="linebreak"></span>

<span class="line">Trace with the compass, predict as they rise both the</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">stars and the planets.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Thy task, O Roman, remember: to rule by thy</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">sceptre the nations.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
