happily. Nevertheless, they could not die so as to be altogether quit of life and sensation since they were created immortal. Likewise, after the last judgement, when they are hurled headlong into the second death, they will not even there be devoid of life, for indeed they will not be devoid of feeling either when they are in torment.</p>
<p>But men who belong to the grace of God and are fellow-citizens of the holy angels who keep their happy life will be so endowed with spiritual bodies that they will thereafter neither sin any more nor die. For the immortality with which they are clothed will be such that, like the angelsâ€™, it cannot be taken away through sin; and though their carnal substance will be kept, no vestige of carnal corruptibility or sluggishness will be left.</p>
<p>There next arises a problem which must of necessity be treated and, with the help of the Lord God of truth, be resolved. We know that the sensuality of our disobedient members arose in those first human beings as a result of the sin of disobedience, when they had been forsaken by divine grace; that it was as a consequence of this that they opened their eyes to their own nakedness, that is, observed it more narrowly; and that, because an indecent rising resisted the rule of their will, they covered up their indecent parts. All this being so, how would they have produced children if they had remained without sin, as they were created? But it is time to bring this book to a close; and besides, the discussion of so great a problem must not be squeezed into too short a space. Consequently, I postpone it to the following book for more convenient treatment.</p>
