God’s foreknowledge deprive us of all use of our will, when our wills play an important part in the order of causes itself? So let Cicero argue the case with those who say that this order of causes is determined by fate, or rather, call the order itself fate. We refuse to do this, because the word is commonly used to refer to a false notion. As for Cicero’s denial that the order of all causes is perfectly defined and perfectly visible to the foreknowledge of God, that is an abomination to us, even more than to the Stoics. Either he is denying the existence of God, as he essayed to do in the speech that he gave to a disputant in the dialogue <span class="italic">On the Nature of the Gods,</span> or if he agrees that God exists, but denies his knowledge of the future, even so it amounts to nothing more than what “the fool has said in his heart, There is no God.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL412_181_1" id="target_note_LCL412_181_1"><sup>1</sup></a> For one who does not know all future things is surely not God. Hence our acts of will also have just so much power as God chose to give them and also foresaw. Therefore, whatever power they have, they have it most assuredly. They themselves will in any case do what they are going to do, because he whose foreknowledge cannot be mistaken foresaw that they would have the power to do it, and that they would do it. Hence if I saw fit to apply the word fate to anything, I would rather say that the fate of the weaker is the will of the stronger, who has the other in his power, than to admit that the order of causes which the Stoics call fate (in their own, but not the common usage of the word) does away with our free will.</p>
