from the body against its will, the second death<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL417_11_1" id="target_note_LCL417_11_1"><sup>1</sup></a> holds it fast in its body against its will. What is shared by both kinds of death is this, that the soul must have dealt to it by its body what it does not choose to suffer.</p>
<p>Moreover, while these gainsayers observe that there is now no flesh which can suffer pain and not suffer death, at the same time they fail to observe that there is something greater than the body. Surely the soul itself, by whose presence the body lives and is governed, can both suffer pain and be unable to die. There it is! A thing has been found which is immortal, though it has a sense of pain. There will be the same faculty, therefore, in the bodies of the damned that we know exists now in the souls of all.</p>
<p>But if we were to examine the matter more closely, what is said to be the body’s pain belongs rather to the soul. For pain belongs to the soul, not to the body, even when the cause of its pain is derived from the body, when the soul’s pain is felt in a place where the body is hurt. Just as we speak of sentient bodies and living bodies, though the body has sensation and life only through the presence of the soul, so also we speak of bodies in pain though the body can have pain only from the soul. Thus the soul feels pain with the body in the place where there happens to be a cause of pain. It also suffers alone, though it be dwelling in the body, when it is sad from some cause that may even be invisible, while the body is unharmed. It also suffers when it is not situated in the body, for certainly the rich man was suffering in hell when he said, “I am tormented in this flame.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL417_11_2" id="target_note_LCL417_11_2"><sup>2</sup></a> However, a lifeless body does not suffer, nor does a living body
