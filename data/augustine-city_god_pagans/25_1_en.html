“They that wish to become rich fall into temptation,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL411_51_1" id="target_note_LCL411_51_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and so on, he surely is rebuking in the case of riches, not the possession, but the desire for them, since, speaking elsewhere, he lays down the rule: “Instruct those who are wealthy in this world not to be proud-minded nor to trust in the uncertainty of riches, but in the living God who bestows on us all things in abundance for us to enjoy. Let them do good, let them be rich in good works, ready to distribute, given to sharing, as they lay up for themselves a sound basis for the future, in order to possess the true life.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL411_51_2" id="target_note_LCL411_51_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Those who did this with their riches were consoled for light losses by great gains, and were more gladdened by those possessions which by ready distribution they had preserved the more securely, than they were saddened by those that they had lost the more easily by cautiously holding them back. For anything that could be destroyed on earth was something that they had shirked transferring elsewhere.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL411_51_3" id="target_note_LCL411_51_3"><sup>3</sup></a>
They received from their Lord this word of wisdom, “Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust destroy, and where thieves break through and steal; but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, a place to which no thief makes his way and in which no moth does any damage; for where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL411_51_4" id="target_note_LCL411_51_4"><sup>4</sup></a> They have found by test in time of tribulation how wise they were not to despise that truest teacher, that most faithful and unconquered guardian of their treasure. For if many rejoiced that they kept their treasure where, as it chanced, the enemy did not come, how much more certainly and more securely were those able to rejoice
