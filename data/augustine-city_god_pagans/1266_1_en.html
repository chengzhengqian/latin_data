Nay more, they even increased by means of images, which the ancients did not have, the allurements of futile and irreligious superstition. This was brought about by foul demons influencing their minds, who used among other things specious oracles to deceive them, with the result that though new myths were not invented in an age grown too sophisticated, yet the old stories of crimes among the gods were still disgracefully enacted in their shows as a service to their false divinities.
