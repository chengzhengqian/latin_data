declare that its misery and blessedness have always succeeded each other, they must also say that this shifting from one to the other will go on for ever. This will involve them in the absurdity that even when the soul is said to be blessed, it is certainly not so, in so far at least as it foresees its own misery and coming shame. If on the other hand it does not foresee its coming misery and shame, but counts on being for ever blessed, it must be that it is happy because it is mistaken, which is as stupid a statement as could well be made.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_439_1" id="target_note_LCL413_439_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Suppose them to assume, however, that though for infinite ages past the soul has known such alternate states of misery and bliss, yet for the rest of time to come, after its next release from misery, it will not return to it, they are no less convicted of holding that it never was truly blessed before but only now begins to be endowed with bliss of a new sort that is not an illusion. This amounts to an admission that something new happens to it, a great and resounding change such as had never happened before in the eternity of time past.</p>
<p>Now if they refuse to admit that God included in his eternal purpose some cause of this new experience, they will at the same time be saying that he was not the author of this blessedness of the soul, and that is an unspeakably blasphemous statement. If again they say that he conceived a new purpose, and decided to make the soul from now on eternally blessed, how will they show that he is exempt from the changeability which they also refuse to accept? Furthermore, if they admit that the soul was created in time but will never perish in any future time and that it is like the series of numbers in having a beginning
