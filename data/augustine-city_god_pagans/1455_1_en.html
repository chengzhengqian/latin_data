above: “The rest of them did not come to life until the thousand years were ended”;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL416_317_1" id="target_note_LCL416_317_1"><sup>1</sup></a> for in that whole period of time, which he calls a thousand years, however long any individual lived in the body, he did not come to life again out of the death in which his irreligion held him, so that by this coming to life he might participate in the first resurrection, and that the second death might thus have no power over him.</p>

<span class="label"><span class="italic">What answer should be made to those who suppose that resurrection belongs only to bodies, and not also to souls.</span></span>
<p><span class="sc">There</span> are some who suppose that resurrection can be spoken of only as regards the body, and who therefore maintain that this first resurrection also will be of the body.
