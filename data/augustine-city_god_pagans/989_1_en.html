to give credence to that longevity of early people. It was doubtless for these reasons that he added a hundred years in the cases where he did not find the age suitable for engendering children, and after their birth subtracted a like number to make the total tally. For he sought to lend plausibility and propriety to the age suitable for producing offspring, yet without cheating the individual in the total number of years of his life-span.</p>
<p>The fact that he did not do this in the sixth generation prompts us all the more to think that he did it when it was required for the reason that I mentioned, since he did not do it where it was not required. For he found that in the sixth generation, according to the Hebrew text,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_483_1" id="target_note_LCL414_483_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Jared was a hundred and sixty-two years old before he became the father of Enoch, and this age becomes, on that theory of short years, sixteen plus something under two months. Since this age is already suitable for engendering children, it was not necessary to add a hundred short years to make it twenty-six of ours, or to subtract them after the birth of Enoch, as they had not been added before his birth. Thus it happened that in this case there was no discrepancy between the two versions.</p>
