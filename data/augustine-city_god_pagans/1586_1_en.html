concerning bad men. For the statement in the Psalm relates to the vessels of mercy and the sons of the promise, of whom the prophet himself was one. And after saying: “Will God forget to pity, or in anger shut up his tender mercies?” he immediately adds: “And I said, now have I begun, this is the change wrought by the right hand of the Most High.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL417_121_1" id="target_note_LCL417_121_1"><sup>1</sup></a> These words surely explain the preceding, “Will he shut up in anger his tender mercies?” For the anger of God is precisely this mortal life, where man has become like an empty thing, and his days pass like a shadow.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL417_121_2" id="target_note_LCL417_121_2"><sup>2</sup></a> But in this anger God does not forget to pity, but makes his sun to rise on the good and the evil, and rain to fall on the just and the unjust.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL417_121_3" id="target_note_LCL417_121_3"><sup>3</sup></a> It is thus that he does not in his anger shut up his tender mercies.
