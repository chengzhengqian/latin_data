<p>But the blessed Stephen, when he told the same story in the Acts of the Apostles, said: “The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham, when he was in Mesopotamia, before he settled in Haran, and said to him: ‘Depart from your land and from your kindred and from the house of your father, and come into the land that I shall show you.’”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL415_85_1" id="target_note_LCL415_85_1"><sup>1</sup></a> According to these words of Stephen, God did not speak to Abraham after the death of his father, who certainly died in Haran, where Abraham too lived with him as his son, but before he settled in that city, although he was already in Mesopotamia. So he had already left the Chaldeans. For Stephen’s additional statement: “Then Abraham went forth from the land of the Chaldeans and settled in Haran,” does not indicate what happened after God spoke to him—for
he did not go out of the Chaldean land after God’s instructions to him, since Stephen says that God spoke to him when he was already in Mesopotamia—but it refers to that period as a whole, inasmuch as he says ‘then,’ that is, after the time when “he went forth from the Chaldeans and settled in Haran.” Likewise the following words: “And then after his father died, he settled him in this land, where you now dwell, and your fathers before you,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL415_85_2" id="target_note_LCL415_85_2"><sup>2</sup></a> do not mean ‘after his father died, he departed from Haran,’ but’ after his father died, then he settled him here.’</p>
<p>We must therefore understand that God had spoken to Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia,
