<p>At the present time, however, we live well enough if we live without blame. But anyone who thinks that he lives without sin does not actually avoid sin but forfeits forgiveness.

But fear that is not a part of love is of that other sort; and the apostle Paul himself says of it: “For you did not receive the spirit of slavery to fall back into fear.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_315_4" id="target_note_LCL414_315_4"><sup>4</sup></a> That holy
