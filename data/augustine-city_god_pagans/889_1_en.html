<p>The Platonists, it is true, are not so foolish as the Manichaeans, for they do not abominate earthly bodies as the substance of evil<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_283_1" id="target_note_LCL414_283_1"><sup>1</sup></a> since all the elements with their qualities that make up the framework of this visible and tangible world are attributed by them to their god as demiurge.
