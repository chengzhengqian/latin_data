<h3>XXXIII</h3>
<span class="label"><span class="italic">By the counsel and power of the true God the times of all kings and kingdoms have been ordained.</span></span>
<p><span class="sc">God,</span> therefore, the author and giver of happiness, because he is the only true God, himself gives earthly kingdoms to the good and the bad. This is not done rashly or at random, for he is God, not Fortuna, the goddess of luck. He does this in accordance with an order of things and of times which is hidden from us but very well known to him. Yet he is not in subjection, to be a slave to this order, but he rules it as Lord, and dispenses it as Master. But as for happiness, he gives it only to the good. Those who are servants may gain it or fail to gain it, just as those who are rulers may gain it or fail to gain it, but it will be complete only in that life where no one will any longer be a servant. And so earthly kingdoms are granted by him both to the good and to the evil, in order that his worshippers, who are still as little children in the growth of their minds, may not covet these gifts from him as if they were something great.</p>
<p>And this is the mystery of the Old Testament, in which the New was hidden. There the promised gifts are earthly blessings, but even then spiritual men understood, though they did not yet plainly declare, both the eternity which was signified by those temporal things, and the gifts of God in which true happiness resides.</p>
