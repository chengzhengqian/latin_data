would flock to see her. And especially remarkable was the fact that both her parents were not even as tall as the tallest that we are accustomed to see.</p>
<p>It is possible therefore that giants were born even before the sons of God, who were also called the angels of God, united with the daughters of men, that is, of those who lived according to man, or, in other words, before the sons of Seth united with the daughters of Cain. For, in fact, our canonical Scripture says so in the book where we read this. Here are its words: “And it came to pass after men began to multiply on the face of the ground, and daughters were born to them, that angels of God saw that the daughters of men were good; and they took to wife such of them as they chose. Then the Lord God said: ‘My spirit shall not abide in these men for ever, for they are flesh; but their days shall be a hundred and twenty years.’ The giants were on the earth in those days and also afterwards, when the sons of God came in to the daughters of men and engendered children for themselves. These were the giants that were of old, the men of renown.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_553_1" id="target_note_LCL414_553_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>These words of the divine book show plainly enough that there were already giants on earth in those days when the sons of God took as wives the daughters of men, whom they loved since they were good, that is, beautiful; for it is the custom of this Scripture to call good those too who are physically attractive. But giants were born even afterwards, for, as Scripture says, “The giants were on the earth in those days and also afterwards, when the sons of God came in to the daughters of men.” Thus there were giants in those days both before and after that event.</p>
