<span class="label"><span class="italic">What sort of speech we are to suppose that God used in speaking to the angels.</span></span>
<p><span class="sc">The</span> words that were spoken when man was created: “Let us make man,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL415_35_1" id="target_note_LCL415_35_1"><sup>1</sup></a> might also have been understood as referring to the angels, since God did not say ‘let me make.’ However, since the words ‘in our image’ follow, and since it is not lawful to believe that man was made in the likeness of the angels, or that the angels and God have the same image, the plural is correctly understood in this case as referring to the Trinity. Since, however, the Trinity is one God, even after he said ‘let us make’ the Scripture adds: “And God made man in the image of God,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL415_35_2" id="target_note_LCL415_35_2"><sup>2</sup></a> but it does not say ‘the gods made’ or ‘in the image of the gods.’</p>
<p>In the present passage also the same Trinity might have been understood, as though the Father said to the Son and the Holy Spirit: “Come, let us go down and confound their speech,” if there were any difficulty in referring this to the angels. But it is more fitting for the angels to approach God with holy movements, that is by reverent thoughts, which are the means whereby they consult invariable truth as the eternal law that is found in that heavenly court of theirs. For they themselves are not truth in their own sight, but, as participants of creative truth, they are moved towards it, as towards the source of life, to receive from it what they do not possess of themselves. Now this motion of theirs is a steady one, by which they approach but do not withdraw.</p>
