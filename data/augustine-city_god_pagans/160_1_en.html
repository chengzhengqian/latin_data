of this unhappy state of things is the fact that none of these kings closed the gates of war. Hence, none of them reigned in peace, though protected by so many gods.</p>

<span class="label"><span class="italic">How the Roman kings lived and died.</span></span>
<p><span class="sc">What,</span> moreover, were the departures of the kings themselves like? Fictitious flattery says of Romulus that he was taken up into heaven. Let certain of their writers see to this, who have stated that his barbarity led the Senate to hew him in pieces,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL411_321_1" id="target_note_LCL411_321_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and that a certain Julius Proculus was suborned to say that Romulus had appeared to him and through him commanded the Roman people to worship him among the divinities, and that by this means the people, who had begun to storm against the Senate, were checked and calmed. For an eclipse of the sun had also taken place; and the ignorant populace, not knowing that the mathematical regularity of the sun’s own course produced it, gave Romulus’ noble deeds the credit.</p>
<p>They might have reflected that, if the sun’s eclipse was really evidence of grief, that was rather an argument for the belief that he was murdered; when the light of day withdrew, that was visible evidence of very crime. Compare the actual fact when the Lord was crucified by the cruel and sacrilegious Jews. That the eclipse that then occurred was not caused by the regular movement of the heavenly bodies is clearly shown by the fact that it took place at the passover of the Jews. This festival is celebrated at full moon, but eclipses of the sun regularly occur only in the dark of the moon.</p>
