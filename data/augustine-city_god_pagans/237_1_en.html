<span class="label"><span class="italic">Of Fortuna Muliebris.</span></span>
<p>To be sure, they ascribe such honour to this supposed deity which they call Fortuna that they have preserved a story how her image, which was dedicated by matrons and called Fortuna Muliebris, actually spoke, and declared not once but twice that the matrons had correctly performed the dedicatory rites. If this story is indeed true, we need not be surprised. For it is not hard for malicious demons to deceive men in this way too, but they would have done better to take note of the crafty and ingenious wiles of the demons, inasmuch as it was the goddess who comes at random that spoke, not the one who comes to reward those who deserve her. For it was Fortuna who was garrulous, and Felicitas was mute. Why? Is there any other explanation than this? They designed that men should give no heed to right living, once they had gained the favour of Fortuna, for she could make them fortunate without any requirement of good conduct. And surely, if Fortuna speaks, it should at least be masculine Fortune, not feminine, in order to prevent our reaching the conclusion that the very ones who dedicated the image made up the great miracle by virtue of their wagging feminine tongues.</p>
