in what he wrote of human affairs he followed the record of historical events, but when he writes about matters that he calls “divine,” what does he include except speculations about unrealities? This is no doubt what he wanted to convey by a subtle indication, not only by putting these after human affairs in his book, but also by giving his reason for doing so. If he had not stated his reason, various people might perhaps have defended his procedure on various grounds, but by actually giving the reason as he did he left others no occasion to guess at what he meant. He gives proof enough that he had put men before the institutions of men, not the truth about men before the truth about the gods. Thus he admits that when he wrote his books on the divine, his subject was not a truth that pertains to the real world, but a fiction that belongs to the realm of error. And this he stated even more clearly elsewhere, as I have recounted in the fourth book.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL412_307_1" id="target_note_LCL412_307_1"><sup>1</sup></a> For he says that if he were himself founding a new city, he would have written in accordance with the rule of nature, but since he found himself a citizen of an ancient city he could do nothing except follow its traditions.</p>
