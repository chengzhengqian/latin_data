sheaths open so that the ears may emerge. When the grain stood level in the field with ears newly formed, the goddess Hostilina was in charge (for the ancients used <span class="italic">hostire</span> to mean, “make level”); when the grain was in flower, the goddess Flora; when it was milky, the god Lacturnus; when it ripened, the goddess Matuta;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL412_33_1a" id="target_note_LCL412_33_1a"><sup>1</sup></a> and when the weeds were cleared (<span class="italic">runcantur</span>),
that is, removed from the field, the goddess Runcina. I do not record them all, for I am bored by all this, though they are not ashamed of it.</p>
<p>But I wanted to show by this very small sample that they by no means venture to assert that it was these deities who founded, extended and preserved the Roman Empire. These were so occupied, each with his special duties, that no one thing as a whole was entrusted to any one of them. So how could Segetia care for the empire, when she was not allowed to take care of the grain crop and of trees at the same time? How could Cunina think of weapons, when they did not permit her charge to reach beyond the cradled babies? How could Nodutus help in war, when he was not concerned with the follicle of wheat, but only with the node on the joint? Everyone has a single doorkeeper for his house, and since he is a man, that is quite sufficient. But they put three gods there: Forculus for the doors (<span class="italic">fores</span>), Cardea for the hinges (<span class="italic">cardo</span>) and Limentinus for the threshold (<span class="italic">limen</span>). Thus Forculus was not competent to guard both the hinge and the threshold along with the door.</p>
