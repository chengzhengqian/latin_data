<span class="label"><span class="italic">The cruelties in the sack of Rome were in accord with the customs of war; the acts of compassion were manifestations of the power of Christ’s name.</span></span>
<p><span class="sc">Accordingly</span>, whatever destruction, slaughter, plundering, burning, misery, occurred in that recent calamity at Rome, was occasioned by the customary procedures of war. On the other hand, what set a new precedent, the aspect, novel in history and so gentle, that barbarian cruelty displayed, in that basilicas of the most generous capacity were selected and set apart by decree to be occupied as asylums of mercy for the people, where no one should be smitten, whence no one should be ravished, whither many should be conducted by compassionate soldiers for release from bondage, and where none should be taken captive even by ruthless foes—he who does not see that this accrues to the credit of Christ’s name, and to the credit of a Christian era, is blind; he who sees, but does not applaud, is churlish; he who would suppress such applause, is mad. God forbid that any man of sound judgement should attribute this behaviour to the savagery of barbarians. Their hearts are ferocious in the highest degree, relentless in the highest degree; he it was that dismayed, he that bridled, he that miraculously softened their hearts—he who so long ago declared through the prophet: “I will visit their transgressions with the rod, and their sins with stripes. Nevertheless, my lovingkindness will I not take utterly from them.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL411_33_1" id="target_note_LCL411_33_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
