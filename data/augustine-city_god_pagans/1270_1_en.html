Jotham and Ahaz and Hezekiah.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL415_461_1" id="target_note_LCL415_461_1"><sup>1</sup></a> These men are seen by their own statements to have prophesied as contemporaries at the time mentioned. To them are added Jonah, during the reign of the same king Uzziah, and Joel, at the time when Jotham, Uzziah’s successor, had begun his reign. But the dates of these two prophets are found in the chronicles,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL415_461_2" id="target_note_LCL415_461_2"><sup>2</sup></a> not in their own books, because they do not mention their own times. Now these times extend from Procas king of the Latins or his predecessor Aventinus
to Romulus, now a Roman king, or even to the beginning of the reign of his successor Numa Pompilius, inasmuch as Hezekiah, the king of Judah, reigned until this date. Hence it is that these men, wellsprings of prophecy, gushed forth together, so to speak, at the time when the Assyrian empire ended and the Roman began. It was evidently intended that, just as Abraham appeared, to whom the most explicit prophecies of the blessing of all nations in his seed were to be made, in the first years of the Assyrian empire, so also at the beginning of the western Babylon under whose rule Christ was to come, in whom those promises were to be fulfilled, the lips of the prophets should be opened, not only for oral but also for written testimony of this great future event. For although there had hardly ever been a time when the people of Israel were without a prophet from the time when they began to have kings, such prophets had been for the use of their own people only, and not for that of gentile nations. But when the series of prophetic writings that were to be of value to the gentiles in later times was more publicly inaugurated the ideal time to inaugurate it
