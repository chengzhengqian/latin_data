<span class="label"><span class="italic">How the catholic faith is confirmed even through the dissensions of the heretics.</span></span>
<p><span class="sc">But</span> the devil, seeing the temples of the demons deserted and the human race having recourse to the name of the Mediator who sets men free, stirred up heretics to resist the Christian doctrine under the guise of Christianity, as if they could be kept indifferently in the city of God without any reproof, even as the city of confusion kept indifferently the philosophers who held diverse and conflicting beliefs. So those in the church of Christ who crave some unhealthy and base opinion, and who on being reproved, so that they may relish sound and right opinions, stubbornly resist and are unwilling to reform their pernicious and deadly dogmas, but persist in defending them, become heretics and, when they leave her, are counted among the enemies who serve to discipline the church. For even so their wickedness benefits those true catholic members of Christ, since God makes a good use even of the wicked, and “all things work together for good for those who love him.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL416_67_1" id="target_note_LCL416_67_1"><sup>1</sup></a> For all the enemies of the church, however blinded by error or depraved by wickedness, are useful. If given the power of inflicting bodily harm, they exercise her patience. If they oppose her only by their wrong opinions, they exercise her wisdom. Moreover, to bring it about that even enemies shall be loved, they exercise her benevolence or even her beneficence, whether she deals with them by winsome doctrine or by fearsome discipline.</p>
