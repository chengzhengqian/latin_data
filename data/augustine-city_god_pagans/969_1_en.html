For though Cain was already wrong in not allotting rightly, that is, in not living rightly, and hence did not deserve to have his offering approved, God showed how much more wrong he was to hate his righteous brother for no good reason. Yet God did not send him away without a holy, righteous and kind exhortation, for he said: “Calm down, for it is to come back to you, and you are to master it.” Might it mean ‘master him,’ that is, his brother? Heaven forbid! Master what then if not his sin? For after God had said: “You have committed a sin,” he then at once added: “Calm down, for it is to come back to you, and you are to master it.” Certainly the expression that something, that is, sin should come back to the man himself can be taken to mean that he must know that he should put the blame for his sinning on none other than himself.</p>
<p>This is a wholesome medicine of repentance and an entreaty for pardon that is not inappropriate. Consequently, when God says: “For it is to come back to you,” we should understand the verb not as ‘will come’ but as ‘should come,’ that is, we should take the speaker to be prescribing, not predicting. For each one will master his sin only when he does not put it over himself by defending it but makes it subject to himself by repenting it. Otherwise, he will also be its slave while it is master if he lends it his support at its incidence.</p>
