perfection of the universal church is symbolized. This explains why John the apostle writes to seven churches,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL415_235_1" id="target_note_LCL415_235_1"><sup>1</sup></a> as an indication that he is writing for the whole body of the one church. Likewise, in the proverbs of Solomon, Wisdom, prefiguring this long before, “builded her house and supported it with seven columns.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL415_235_2" id="target_note_LCL415_235_2"><sup>2</sup></a> For the city of God was barren among all nations before the offspring that we see with our own eyes was born. We see also that the earthly Jerusalem, who had many sons, has grown feeble, for whatever sons of the free woman were in the city were her strength, but now since the letter alone is there, and not the spirit,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL415_235_3" id="target_note_LCL415_235_3"><sup>3</sup></a> her strength has departed and she has become weak.</p>
<p>“The Lord gives death and birth”—he brought death to her who had many sons, and life to the barren woman who bore seven children. Yet this might more suitably be taken to mean that he gives life to the same persons to whom he has brought death. For she repeated this statement, as it were, when she added: “He brings men down to the grave and restores them to life.” For those to whom the Apostle says: “If you are dead with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sits on the right hand of God,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL415_235_4" id="target_note_LCL415_235_4"><sup>4</sup></a> are certainly benefited when God brings death upon them. To this he adds: “Set your minds on things that are above, not on those that are on earth,” thus showing that these are the same men who “have passed over the earth with hunger.”</p>
<p>“For you are dead,” he says—behold what health there is in God-given death! Then this follows:
