had chosen to have dedicated to them the filth of the stage, yet were so mindful of their own honour and modesty as by no manner of means to grant civil rights to the actors of these plays, as was the Greek custom. Rather, to quote what that same Scipio says in Cicero’s words, “Since they held comedy and all stage shows to be reprehensible, they determined that all men of that class should not only be barred from every right enjoyed by the rest of the citizens, but should even be removed from the censors’ lists as members of the tribe.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL411_185_1" id="target_note_LCL411_185_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>An excellent provision, of course, and one that must be listed to the credit of the Romans, but I could wish that they had followed up and reproduced such wise provision. For there you have a model! Any Roman citizen who had chosen a career on the stage was not only barred from any post of honour but was even quite estopped by the censors’ stigma from keeping his own tribe. What a spirit animated that state, a spirit avid of glory and genuinely Roman!</p>
<p>But I demand an answer: “What is the consistent principle that excludes scenic actors from all right to honour and permits scenic shows to be included among honours paid to gods?” Roman virtue had long been ignorant of those theatrical arts which, if they had been demanded for the titillation of human pleasure, could have insinuated themselves only by a failure of human character. It was the gods who demanded those exhibitions for themselves; how, then, is the player cast out by whose means a god is worshipped? How can you have the face to stigmatize the actor, if you solemnize the exactor of that dramatic filth?</p>
