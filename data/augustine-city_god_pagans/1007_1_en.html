upon the name of the Lord God? In reference to Seth Scripture says: “God has raised me up another seed in place of Abel.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_519_1" id="target_note_LCL414_519_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Why, therefore, should that be said of Enos in particular which is known to be true of all godly men equally? The reason is this: he is mentioned as the first offspring of the father of the generations that have been reserved for a better portion, that is, are to participate in the city above; and it is therefore fitting that we should have foreshadowed in him the man, that is, the society of men, that lives not according to man in the actuality of earthly happiness, but according to God in the hope of eternal happiness. Now it was not said: “He hoped in the Lord God,” or: “He called upon the name of the Lord God.” Rather Scripture states: “He hoped to call upon the name of the Lord God.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_519_2" id="target_note_LCL414_519_2"><sup>2</sup></a> The words “he hoped to call” can only mean, prophetically, that a people would arise which, chosen by grace,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_519_3" id="target_note_LCL414_519_3"><sup>3</sup></a> would call upon the name of the Lord God.
