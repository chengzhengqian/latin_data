that in the future he will be an enemy.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_101_1" id="target_note_LCL414_101_1"><sup>1</sup></a> But heaven forbid that there be any truth in the threats that these philosophers make to us of a misery destined never to be ended but often and endlessly to be interrupted by intervals of false bliss.</p>
<p>Truly, nothing is more false or fallacious than that kind of bliss which leaves us either in so great a light of truth ignorant that we shall be wretched or on the highest pinnacle of happiness fearful because we shall be so. For if in the world beyond we are to be ignorant of future misfortune, then our present misery on earth is better informed, since it allows us to know of future bliss. On the other hand, if in the world beyond impending disaster is not to be concealed from us, the soul passes its periods of time more happily in misery than it does in happiness; for in the former case, when the periods are completed, the soul is to be raised to bliss, but in the latter the soul is at the end to come full circle to misery. And thus the prospect that we have in our unhappiness is happy and that which we have in our happiness is unhappy. Consequently, since we suffer present evils here on earth and fear impending evils there in heaven, it is truer to say that we may always be in misery than that we may sometimes be in bliss.</p>
<p>But these views, as religion cries out and truth proves, are false, for we are truthfully promised that true happiness whose assured serenity will be ours to possess forever unbroken by unhappiness. Let us then follow the straight way that we have in Christ,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_101_2" id="target_note_LCL414_101_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and with him as our leader and saviour let us turn away our minds and the route of our faith from the vain and bungling gyrations of the irreligious.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_101_3" id="target_note_LCL414_101_3"><sup>3</sup></a>
