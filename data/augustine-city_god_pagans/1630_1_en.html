<p><span class="sc">Why,</span> our opponents ask, are not those miracles which you say were once performed being performed today? I could, of course, reply that before the world believed, they were necessary to establish faith, and that whoever still asks for wonders in order to be convinced is himself a great wonder, for refusing to believe though all the world believes. But they say this in order that people may not believe in those former miracles either. Then why is it that men everywhere repeat with such assurance that Christ was taken up to heaven in bodily form? Why is it that in enlightened times, when every incredible story was rejected, the world without any miracles so miraculously credited a thing incredible? Or will they say, perchance, that the deeds were credible, and hence were credited? Then why do they not themselves believe? Our argument can be briefly stated: Either the belief in an incredible event which no one saw was established by other incredible events which really took place and were seen, or else the event was so credible that it needed no miracles to confirm it, and so their unreasonable incredulity is refuted. This I might say to put down idle talkers. For we cannot deny that many miracles were performed to confirm the one great, life-giving miracle by which Christ ascended to heaven with the flesh in which he rose from the dead. For it is all written
