<p>The other kings of the Roman people, with the exception of Numa Pompilius and Ancus Marcius, who died of disease, came to ends that were shocking indeed. Tullus Hostilius, as I said, the conqueror and destroyer of Alba, was consumed by lightning with his whole household. Tarquinius Priscus was slain by the sons of his predecessor. Servius Tullius was foully murdered by his son-in-law Tarquinius Super-bus, who succeeded him on the throne. And when so great a parricide was committed against Rome’s best king, “the gods did not all depart, leaving shrines and altars abandoned,” as it is said they were driven to do in poor Troy’s case merely by the adultery of Paris, so that they abandoned it to demolition and incineration. What is more, Tarquin, the very murderer of his father-in-law, succeeded him on the throne. This very parricide who reigned because he slew his father-in-law, and even boasted of many wars waged and won, and from the spoils built the Capitoline Temple, caused no migration of gods; no, they were at hand, they kept their seats and looked on, they suffered their king Jupiter to sit at their head as their king in his most lofty temple, that is, in a shrine erected by a parricide. For he did not build the Capitoline Temple while he was still free from guilt, and afterwards suffer banishment from the city for his wicked deeds; the very kingdom that he held when he built the Capitoline Temple, was acquired by commission of a monstrous crime.</p>
