Moreover, the reason why Peleg was mentioned is not that he founded a tribe—for his tribe is none other than the Hebrew people itself, and his language is Hebrew—but to mark a notable epoch, since in his days the earth was divided.</p>

For the fact that Heber is in the sixth generation from Noah, whereas Nimrod is in the fourth, does not preclude their having lived at the same time. It might well happen that men lived longer in cases where there were fewer generations, and a shorter time in cases where there are more. Or else men were born later in cases where there were fewer generations, and earlier in cases of more.
