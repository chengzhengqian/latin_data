<p>Nor is it a reason for choosing to live a wicked life, that the gods are thought to have shown more favour to Marius than to Regulus, since Metellus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL411_235_1" id="target_note_LCL411_235_1"><sup>1</sup></a> a man most highly esteemed among the Romans, who had five sons that became consuls, was also fortunate in the goods of this world, while the paragon of vice, Catiline, being reduced to poverty and overthrown in the war brought on by his own crime, was unfortunate. Moreover, the truest and surest good fortune is mainly the portion of the good who worship God, by whom alone it can be bestowed.</p>
