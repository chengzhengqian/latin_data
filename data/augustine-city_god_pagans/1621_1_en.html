come to pass which was likewise incredible, that is, that the world should believe a thing so incredible. For both incredible things, one of which we see, the other believe, were predicted in the same writings, the writings through which the world has come to believe.</p>
<p>And the very manner by which the world has come to believe, when duly considered, seems even more incredible. For it was only a very few fishermen whom Christ sent with the nets of faith out on the sea of the world, men untrained in the liberal arts and altogether untaught in the learning of the pagans, not skilled in grammar, not armed with dialectic, not puffed up with rhetoric.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL417_191_1a" id="target_note_LCL417_191_1a"><sup>1</sup></a> And thus he has taken many “fish” of every kind, including even philosophers—the scarcer they are, the greater the miracle. To these two incredible things, if you please (or rather, because it ought to please), let us add this third; there are then three incredible things which have come to pass. First, it is incredible that Christ has risen in the flesh and ascended to heaven with his flesh. Second, it is incredible that the world should have believed a thing so incredible. Third, it is incredible that a very few unknown, lowly, unskilled men should have been able so effectively to persuade the world and even learned men in it. Of these three the men with whom we are arguing refuse to believe the first, but are compelled actually to see the second, while they cannot find out how it has happened unless they believe the third.</p>

Dialectic was roughly equivalent to the division of philosophy known as logic; more precisely it was the art of disputation by questioning. About the time of his conversion Augustine had undertaken to prepare a series of textbooks on the liberal arts.
