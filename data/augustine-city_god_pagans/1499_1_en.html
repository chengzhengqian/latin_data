wisdom, which pleases Porphyry so much that he proclaims it by the speech of his own gods too, the statement is found that the heavens are to perish, why does the futility of such a false faith go so far as to protest against this article of the Christian faith along with the rest or even above the rest, the article that contains the belief that the world is to perish, an event without which the heavens surely cannot perish? And in the sacred Scriptures which belong to us and are not common to the Hebrews and to us, that is, in the gospels and the apostolic books, one may read: “The form of this world is transient”;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL416_405_1" id="target_note_LCL416_405_1"><sup>1</sup></a> “The world passes away”;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL416_405_2" id="target_note_LCL416_405_2"><sup>2</sup></a> “Heaven and earth shall pass away.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL416_405_3" id="target_note_LCL416_405_3"><sup>3</sup></a> But I fancy that “transient” and “pass away” are milder expressions than “perish.”</p>
