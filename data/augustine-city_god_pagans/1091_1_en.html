many descendants refers, meaning those descended from him not after the flesh but after the spirit, these are the more appropriately compared to the multitudinous sands, and thus the twofold promise can be understood to have been made on this occasion. But our reason for discussing this point is that the text does not make the case clear, inasmuch as the number of that single race descended from Abraham after the flesh through his grandson Jacob multiplied so greatly that it has filled almost all parts of the world. Consequently even this one people could have been hyperbolically compared to the countless sands on the ground that this group, taken by itself, is also incapable of being counted by man.</p>
<p>Surely no one doubts that only the land called Canaan is referred to here. Yet the words “I will give it to you and to your seed for ever” ay disturb some, if by ‘for ever’ they understand ‘for eternity.’ If, however, they interpret the word <span class="italic">saeculum</span> in the light of our firm belief that the beginning of the future age is to coincide with the ending of the present one<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL415_103_1a" id="target_note_LCL415_103_1a"><sup>1</sup></a> it will not disturb them at all. For even though the Israelites have been driven out of Jerusalem, yet they still remain in other cities of the land of Canaan, and shall remain till the end. And since that whole land is peopled by Christians, these too are the seed of Abraham.</p>

The facts of Augustine’s day seemed hardly in accord with the promise. The Romans ruled the land, the population as a whole was Christian, and the Jews had long been forbidden even to enter Jerusalem. Augustine seems to waver between two explanations: (1) though the Jews were excluded from Jerusalem, they were in other cities of the land, and would remain there until the end of the age (<span class="italic">in saeculum, in finem</span>); and (2) granting that the whole land is occupied by Christians, these, too, may properly be counted as children of Abraham, and so the promise is fulfilled in them.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL415_103_1a').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
