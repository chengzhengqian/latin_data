reduces a god-fearing soul to the dilemma of choosing one of two alternatives: either there is something governed by our will, or there is foreknowledge of the future. He thinks that it is impossible for both to exist at once, and that any support of one proposition is a denial of the other. If we choose foreknowledge of the future, freedom of the will is destroyed, and if we choose freedom of the will, foreknowledge of the future is excluded.

For if there is foreknowledge of the future, the whole series of consequences must follow, until the conclusion is reached that nothing is in our power. And again, if there is anything in our power, by reversing the steps of the argument we reach the conclusion that there is no foreknowledge of the future. All the steps are retraced in this way: If freedom of the will exists, all things do not come to pass by fate; if all things do not come to pass by fate, there is no fixed order for all causes; if there is no fixed order of causes, neither is there an order of things fixed for a foreknowing God, for things cannot happen except as their efficient causes come first. If there is no order of things fixed for a foreknowing God, then things do not all come to pass as he knew beforehand that they would come, and if all things do not come
