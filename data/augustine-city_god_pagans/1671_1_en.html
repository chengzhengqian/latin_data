time after time, and the nails which are trimmed off, produce ugliness by returning to their old place, they will not return. Yet when men are raised they will not perish, for they will return to the same flesh with a change of substance so as to occupy whatever place they may in the body, as long as the due proportion of parts is preserved.</p>
