<p>But those theurgists, or rather the demons, when they create false shapes and likenesses of gods, defile rather than cleanse the spirit of man with their sham apparitions and the fraudulent delusion of their bodiless phantoms. For how are they to cleanse the spirit of man when their own spirit is filthy? Otherwise they could by no means be bound by the incantations of a malicious man, nor would they suppress in fear, or refuse with malice equal to his, that same boon, illusory as it was, that they were expected to confer. We are content with your admission that it is impossible for the intellectual soul, that is, our mind, to be cleansed by theurgic purgation and that the spiritual soul itself, which is the part of our soul that ranks below the mind and, so you assert, may be cleansed by such practices, cannot for all that be rendered immortal and eternal by it. But Christ promises eternal life; and this is why, though you are vexed, but withal amazed and struck dumb too, the world is flocking to him. What do you gain by contradicting yourself? You could not deny that men go wrong when they school themselves in theurgic practices, and that they delude as many as they can with their blind and silly dogma, and that it is most certainly a mistake to resort with sacrifices and prayers to principalities and angels; but on the other hand, as if to cover up your waste of effort spent to learn this nonsense, you direct men to the theurgists for the cleansing of the spiritual souls of those whose lives are not guided by the intellectual soul.</p>
