Now there are three verses of this sort, the fifth, eighteenth and nineteenth. Hence if we take in order the letters that stand at the beginning of every verse, and do not read those actually written as the initials of these three lines, but substitute the letter <span class="italic">upsilon</span> as if it were actually placed in that position, the rendering is in five words: Jesus Christ the: Son of God the Saviour, but only when read in Greek, not in Latin.
