and desires. For while the good angels steadfastly remain in the good that is shared by all—in their case this is God himself—and so enjoy his eternity, truth and love, the bad angels, exulting rather in their own power, as though they themselves were their own good, sank from the higher good that brings happiness and is shared by all to the level of merely private good. They preferred the pinnacle of pride to the summit of eternity, the cunning of folly to the absolute certainty of truth and zeal for a faction to oneness in love; and this made them in the end arrogant, deceitful and full of spite.</p>
<p>Thus it is their clinging to God that brings happiness to the good angels; and consequently the opposite, or failure to cling to God, must be regarded as causing the unhappiness of the bad angels. Therefore, if the right answer to the question why good angels are happy is that they cling to God, and if the right answer to the question why bad angels are unhappy is that they do not cling to God, then the only good that can make a rational or intellectual being happy is God.</p>
<p>To be sure, not every kind of being or thing can be happy, for this boon is beyond the reach or capacity of beasts, stocks, stones and the like. Yet the being that can be happy cannot draw happiness from himself, since he was created out of nothing, but from him by whom he was created. For the attainment of this good makes such a being happy, just as the loss of it makes him unhappy. But he whose happiness comes from his own good self rather than from an alien good cannot be unhappy because he cannot lose this self.</p>
