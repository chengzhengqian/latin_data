<p>After this Jacob went on his way into Mesopotamia, to take a wife there. The holy Scripture explains how it came about that he had four women, by whom he begot twelve sons and one daughter, although he had not desired any of them unlawfully. Note that he had come to take one wife, but when another was given him in her place, he did not dismiss her, having had intercourse with her in the night without knowing her identity, lest he should seem to hold her in derision; and at a time when in order to increase the birth-rate there was no law against a plurality of wives, he also took that woman to whom alone he had given his promise to marry. And since she was barren she gave her husband her handmaiden, in order that he might have sons by her. This action her elder sister also imitated, although she had already borne children, since she wished to increase her progeny. We do not read that Jacob sought any woman save one alone, nor did he have intercourse with others except to get offspring. He did not violate his marriage vow, whereby he could not have gone as far as he did if his wives, who legally controlled their husbandâ€™s person,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL415_181_1" id="target_note_LCL415_181_1"><sup>1</sup></a> had not instigated his actions. So he begot twelve sons and one daughter by four women. Then he went into Egypt through the agency of his son Joseph, who, being sold by his jealous brothers, was carried thither and was there elevated to great power.</p>
