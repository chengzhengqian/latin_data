of conversing with the first human beings through a creature subject to him, that is, by assuming an appropriate form as though he were one of their number?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_437_1" id="target_note_LCL414_437_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Did he not carry out the crime of fratricide that he had conceived, even after God had admonished him against it? For God had discriminated between the sacrifices of the two brothers by showing regard for the offering of the one but not for that of the other, a preference which, we must not doubt, could be ascertained by the evidence of some visible sign; and God must have done as he did because the works of Cain were evil whereas those of his brother were good. But Cain then became exceedingly grim and his countenance fell. For in Scripture we read: “And the Lord said to Cain: ‘Why have you turned grim, and why has your countenance fallen? If your offering is rightly made, but is not rightly allotted, have you not committed a sin? Calm down, for it is to come back to you, and you are to master it.’”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_437_2a" id="target_note_LCL414_437_2a"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>In this admonition or warning that God imparted to Cain, the reason or ground for the statement made:
“If your offering is rightly made, but is not rightly allotted, have you not committed a sin?” is not clear; and its obscurity has given rise to many interpretations whenever a commentator on the holy Scriptures attempts to explain the words according to the canon of faith. Certainly a sacrifice is rightly offered when

Augustine’s text differs markedly from the Vulgate but is close to the Septuagint. The sense is not clear, and, to make his point, Augustine exploits the ambiguity of the language in the passage. The Latin for ‘it is to come back to you’ is <span class="italic">ad te . . . conversio eius</span>, which means literally:
‘the turning of it (<span class="italic">or</span> him) to you.’ The phrase lacks a verb and <span class="italic">eius</span> can mean in the context either ‘of it’ or ‘of him.’ Similarly, in ‘you are to master it’ the Latin allows ‘him’ to be understood for ‘it.’ The passage is rendered in the RSV as follows: “The Lord said to Cain, ‘Why are you angry, and why has your countenance fallen? If you do well, will you not be accepted? And if you do not do well, sin is couching at the door; its desire is for you, but you must master it.’”</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL414_437_2a').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
