for themselves he has determined on God himself as the right choice. “For behold,” he says, “those who put themselves far from thee shall perish; thou hast destroyed every man that goes a whoring from thee,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_365_1" id="target_note_LCL413_365_1"><sup>1</sup></a> that is, who chooses to play the harlot with many gods. From this follows the sentence that explains why I thought fit to quote the other passages from this same psalm. “But for me it is good to cling to God,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_365_2" id="target_note_LCL413_365_2"><sup>2</sup></a> not to go far away from him and not to go whoring after many.
