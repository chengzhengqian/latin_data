will be protected.’ Thus they reasoned, but they were led astray, for their wickedness blinded them.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL415_343_1" id="target_note_LCL415_343_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Again, in Ecclesiasticus the future faith of the nations is predicted in these words: “Have mercy upon us, God who rulest all, and send thy fear upon all nations; lift up thy hand against alien peoples, and let them see thy might. As thou wast sanctified in us before them, so mayst thou be magnified in them before us; let them recognize thee even as we also have recognized thee, that there is no God but thee, O Lord.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL415_343_2" id="target_note_LCL415_343_2"><sup>2</sup></a> This prophecy, uttered in the form of a wish and a prayer, we see fulfilled through Jesus Christ. However, the writings not included in the Jewish canon do not have as much weight when used against our opponents.</p>
<p>But in the case of those three books that are definitely accepted as Solomon’s, and that the Jews consider as canonical, painstaking discussion is necessary to make clear that anything of this nature found in them refers to Christ and his church. If this is undertaken now it will extend our task unduly. Yet the speech of wicked men, as read in the book of Proverbs: “Let us conceal the righteous man in the earth unrighteously, and let us swallow him up alive like the grave and wipe out his memory from the earth; let us lay hold on his precious property,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL415_343_3" id="target_note_LCL415_343_3"><sup>3</sup></a> is not so obscure that it cannot be understood as referring to Christ and his property, the church, without laborious exposition. For it is something like this that the Lord Jesus himself shows by a parable in the Gospel that the wicked husbandmen said: “Here is the heir, come, let us kill him, and his inheritance shall be ours.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL415_343_4" id="target_note_LCL415_343_4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
