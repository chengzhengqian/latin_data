another, or if one is appeased while another is stirred up. But if it is said that all of them together, that is, the whole Jupiter, could be offended if his parts were not also worshipped singly and in detail, the statement is absurd. Surely none of those parts would be slighted if he alone were worshipped, since he contains them all. To pass over other assertions, of which there is no end, they say that all the stars are parts of Jupiter, and that all are living and have rational souls, and thus, without controversy, are gods. But they do not see how many they fail to worship, how many temples they fail to build, and how many altars they fail to set up, for they have seen fit to erect such altars and make sacrifices to very few of the stars separately. So if those who are not separately worshipped are angry, are they not afraid to live with only a few placated, and the whole sky angry? But if they are worshipping all the stars by worshipping Jupiter who contains them, by that short cut they could worship all the gods in that one act. Thus none would be angry, since in that one act none would be slighted. That would be better than by worshipping a limited number to afford a just cause for anger to the much larger number who are neglected. Above all they might well be angry to see preferred to them, as they shine from their lofty abode, Priapus distended in obscene nudity.</p>
