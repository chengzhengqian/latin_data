or birth or beginning of a thing, but to the connection and sequence of all the causes whereby everything happens that happens. No great effort need be expended in debate with them on a verbal difference, inasmuch as they ascribe this order and chain, as it were, of causes to the will and power of the supreme God. Most excellently and truly do they believe that he knows all things before they come to pass, and leaves nothing disorderly. All powers are derived from him, though the wills of all men are not ruled by him. Thus it is above all simply the will of the supreme God, whose power reaches out with invincible might through the whole universe, that they call fate. This is shown by the following words (the verses, I think, are by Annaeus Seneca):<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL412_165_1" id="target_note_LCL412_165_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<blockquote><p>

<span class="line indent2">ruler,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Whithersoever thou wilt, and without delay will I</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">hearken.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Here I am, eager; but should I refuse, then with</span><span class="linebreak"></span>

<span class="line indent2">unwilling.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">It is quite evident that in this last verse he gives the name of fate to what he had referred to above as the will of the supreme Father. He says that he is ready to obey him, to be led willingly and not dragged unwillingly, for be it noted,</p>
