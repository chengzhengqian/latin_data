I mean the Epicureans and others like them, and even the Stoics, who, though mightily enamoured of skill in debate, which they call dialectic, still held that it must derive by induction from the bodily senses, affirming that these are the source from which the mind conceives the ideas or <span class="italic">ennoiai</span>, as they call them, of those things which, if you please, they explain by means of definitions, and that these senses are the source from which their whole system of learning and instruction is developed and strung together.</p>
<p>Here I never cease to wonder, when the Stoics assert that only the wise are beautiful, with what physical senses they have seen that particular beauty, and with what eyes of the flesh they have beheld the form and the loveliness of wisdom.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the philosophers whom, on their merits, we put before all the rest, have distinguished those things that are observed by the mind from those which make contact with the senses, neither denying to the senses those powers that they have, nor attributing to them more than they possess. Moreover, they have declared that the light which illumines the intellects of men in all things that may be learned is this selfsame God by whom all things were made.</p>
