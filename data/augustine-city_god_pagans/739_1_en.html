<p>For this reason, even if another kind of light is to be understood in the passage of this book where we read: “God said, ‘Let there be light’; and there was light,” and another kind of darkness is meant in the passage: “God separated the light from the darkness,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_563_2" id="target_note_LCL413_563_2"><sup>2</sup></a> still for us there are these two communities of angels, one enjoying God, the other puffed up with pride. To the one it is said: “Praise him, all his angels,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_563_3" id="target_note_LCL413_563_3"><sup>3</sup></a> while the prince of the other says: “All these will I give you, if you will fall down and worship me.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_563_4" id="target_note_LCL413_563_4"><sup>4</sup></a> One is on fire with a holy love for God, the other reeks with the filthy love of its own exaltation.
