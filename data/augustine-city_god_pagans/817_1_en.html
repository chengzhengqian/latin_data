body since that does derive life from the soul? Indeed, the body cannot otherwise experience those physical pains that it is destined to feel after the resurrection. The answer is perhaps this: since life of any sort constitutes some good, and pain some evil, we ought not to say that a body is alive if the soul resides in it, not in order to make it live, but to make it hurt.</p>
<p>The soul is therefore deriving life from God when it lives a good life, for it can live a good life only if God works in it for good. The body, however, derives life from the soul when the soul lives in it, whether or not the soul itself derives life from God. For in the bodies of the irreligious life is not a life of their souls but of their bodies; and souls, even when dead, that is, when abandoned by God, can contribute life to them since their own life, no matter how slight, which is the source of their immortality, does not come to a halt. But in the punishment of the last judgement such existence may well be called death rather than life, for, although the man does not cease to have feelings, yet his feelings are neither sweetened by pleasure nor made wholesome by calm; rather, sensation is painful and thereby punitive. Moreover, it is called the second death because it comes after the first, which effects the separation of two substances that are joined, whether it be God and the soul or the soul and the body. Consequently, we may say of the first death, that of the body, that it is good for those who are good and evil for those who are evil. But as for the second death, just as it happens to no one who is good, so doubtless it is good for no one.</p>
