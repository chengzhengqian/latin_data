<span class="label"><span class="italic">Whether the extent and the duration of the Roman
Empire should have been ascribed to Jupiter, whose worshippers consider him the greatest god.</span></span>
<p><span class="sc">We</span> must therefore leave this throng of little gods, or put them aside for a while, and examine the role of the greater gods, by which Rome became so great as to rule so long over so many nations. Well, undoubtedly this is the work of Jupiter. For he is the one whom they represent as king of all the gods and goddesses; this is the meaning of his sceptre, and of the Capitol on its high hill. Of this god they declare that it was most aptly said, though by a poet: “All things are full of Jupiter.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL412_35_1" id="target_note_LCL412_35_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Varro believes that he is worshipped even by those who worship one God only, without an image, though he is called by another name. If this is true, why was he so badly treated in Rome, and also by other peoples, that an image was made for him? This fact displeased even Varro so much that, although he was bound by the perverse custom of his great city, he still never scrupled to say and write that those who had set up images for their peoples had both subtracted reverence and added error.</p>

Virgil is here apparently translating from the Stoic Aratus. The idea of Zeus, or Jupiter, as a universal god was an ancient commonplace. However, as Augustine points out, the Jupiter of the state religion was an image enshrined in the Capitol, and was required to share his realm with Juno and the rest; hence he was inextricably involved in the inconsistencies and absurdities of polytheism.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL412_35_1').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
