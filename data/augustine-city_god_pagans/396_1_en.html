Or if a deity has won a place of honour because more people seek after him—more, of course, seek after Venus than Virtue—why is the goddess Minerva famous and Pecunia, the goddess of money, obscure?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL412_387_2a" id="target_note_LCL412_387_2a"><sup>2</sup></a> For in all mankind more are allured by greed than by knowledge of the arts, and even among those who are craftsmen a man is rarely found who will not sell his skill for a price in money, and a higher value is always placed on the end for which a thing is done than on the means used to gain that end. If, then, this selection of gods was made by the judgement of the ignorant crowd, why was not the goddess Pecunia preferred to Minerva, since it is to gain money that there are many craftsmen?

As for the obscurity of the goddess Pecunia, the satirist Juvenal (1.112–16) remarks that although she was most highly revered by the people, she still had no temple in Rome. Evidently Pecunia, Aesculanus and Argentinus had no established cult, but remained forgotten names in pontifical books.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL412_387_2a').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
