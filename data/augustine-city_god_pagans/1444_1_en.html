church be led astray by him which was predestined and elect before the founding of the world, the church of which it is said: “The Lord knows who are his.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL416_295_1" id="target_note_LCL416_295_1"><sup>1</sup></a> And yet there shall be a church in the world at that time too when the devil is to be loosed, just as it has been in the world since it was begun and shall be at all times, surviving in its members who as they are born replace the dying. For a little later he says that after the devil has been loosed he shall lead nations astray in the whole world and draw them into warfare against it, and that the number of its enemies shall be as the sand of the sea.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL416_295_2" id="target_note_LCL416_295_2"><sup>2</sup></a> “And they went up,” he says, “over the breadth of the earth, and encompassed the camp of the saints and the beloved city; and fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them. And the devil, who led them astray, was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and they shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL416_295_3" id="target_note_LCL416_295_3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>This refers to the last judgement; but I thought it should be called to mind now lest any one should suppose that during that short time when the devil shall be loose there shall be no church on earth, either because he is to find none here when he is unbound or because he is to exhaust it by all manner of persecutions. So during the whole time that the Apocalypse embraces, that is, from the first coming of Christ to the end of the age, which shall be his second coming, the devil is not bound in the sense that during this interval, called the thousand years, he does not lead the church astray, since not even when loosed is he to lead it astray. For surely if his binding means that he is unable or is not permitted to lead it astray, what does his loosing mean if not
