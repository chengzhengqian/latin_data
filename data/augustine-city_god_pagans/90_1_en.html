With regard to the Romans themselves, this was a very honourable thing to do, but with regard to their gods it was arrogant and impious, for, knowing that the gods not only suffered themselves to be slashed by the railings and objurgations of the poets but even took pleasure in it, adopted the view that they themselves rather than the gods were too good to be insulted in that way, and so even protected themselves by statute, though they made such treatment of the gods even a part of their own sacred celebrations.</p>
<p>How, then, Scipio, do you praise the denial to the Roman poets of this privilege of slandering any Roman when you see that they spared none of your countryâ€™s gods? Do you think that your Senate House should be more highly regarded than the Capitol? Is Rome alone worth more than the whole heaven, that poets are legally restrained from wagging their slanderous tongues against your fellow citizens but may cheerfully make your gods a target
