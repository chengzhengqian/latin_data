of punishment, yet when it comes to the judgement, mercy will prevail. For a merciful God, they say, will pardon them in answer to the prayers and intercessions of his saints. For if the saints prayed for their enemies while suffering their enmity, how much more will they pray when they see them prostrate in humble entreaty! For it is incredible, they say, that the saints are to lose their bowels of compassion<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL417_97_1" id="target_note_LCL417_97_1"><sup>1</sup></a> at the time when they have attained full and perfect sainthood. Nor will those who once prayed for their enemies when they were not without sin themselves, fail then to pray for suppliants when they themselves have begun to be without sin. Or will God then not hear his children—so many, and so excellent as they will be—when in their holy state he will find nothing to detract from their prayer? Both the former class, who at least allow the faithless and wicked to be tortured for a long period and later to be delivered from all evils, and, still more, this latter class, say that the Psalm speaks for them when it says: “Will God forget to pity, or shut up in his anger his tender mercies?”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL417_97_2" id="target_note_LCL417_97_2"><sup>2</sup></a> It is by his anger, they say, while he sits as judge, that all those unworthy of eternal happiness are punished by eternal punishment. But if he allows the punishment to be long, or allows any punishment at all, then certainly to make this possible he will be shutting up in anger his tender mercies—which the Psalm says that he will not do. For it does not say: “Will he long shut up in his anger his tender mercies?” but clearly states that he will not shut them up at all.</p>
