<p>For this is the worship that we owe to divinity or, if we must speak more explicitly, to deity.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_251_1" id="target_note_LCL413_251_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Since there is need for a single word to describe this, and since no really satisfactory one in Latin comes to my mind, I shall slip in a Greek word where necessary to convey my meaning. To be sure, wherever <span class="italic">latreia</span> occurs in the holy Scriptures, our translators have rendered it “service.” But the service owed to men, in regard to which the Apostle enjoins upon slaves that they must be submissive to their masters,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_251_2" id="target_note_LCL413_251_2"><sup>2</sup></a> is usually referred to by another word in Greek,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_251_3" id="target_note_LCL413_251_3"><sup>3</sup></a> whereas <span class="italic">latreia</span>, according to the usage of those who have set down the word of God in writing, is employed always, or so constantly as to be all but always, of service connected with the worship of God. Consequently, if we were simply to use the Latin word <span class="italic">cultus</span>, this seems to mean service not reserved for God alone. For we are said to “cultivate” (<span class="italic">colere</span>) men too, when we give them constant honourable mention or honours by our actual presence. We speak also of ourselves as “cultivating” not only things to which we yield homage with religious humility but also certain things subordinate to ourselves. For this word gives us the derivatives <span class="italic">agricolae</span> (cultivators of the land), <span class="italic">coloni</span> (settlers) and <span class="italic">incolae</span> (inhabitants), and the gods themselves are called <span class="italic">caelicolae</span> for no other reason than that they “cultivate” the sky, not of course by worshipping it, but by dwelling in it, as if they were a kind of celestial settlers. Here settler has not the meaning it has when used of serfs (<span class="italic">coloni</span>) who owe their status to the soil on which they were born and are so called because they cultivate land under bondage to its
