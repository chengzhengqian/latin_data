mind to arrive at self-knowledge except by the trial of its strength in answering, not merely by words, but by performance, the questions set by temptation. In such a case, if God accepts its offering, then you have a mind truly devoted, compact of the strength of grace, not merely inflated by empty boasting.</p>
<p>Abraham, of course, could never have believed that God takes pleasure in human victims. Still, when the divine command thunders, we must obey without disputing its orders. Abraham deserves credit for his immediate faith that his son, once sacrificed, would rise again from the dead. For when he refused to comply with his wife’s insistence on driving out the handmaid and her son, God had said to him: “In Isaac shall your seed be called.” To be sure, the passage continues thus: “And I will also make a great nation of the son of the handmaiden, because he is your seed.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL415_151_1" id="target_note_LCL415_151_1"><sup>1</sup></a> How, then, can we explain the words “In Isaac shall your seed be called,” since God also called Ishmael his seed? The Apostle, however, interprets the words “In Isaac shall your seed be called” as follows: “It is not the sons of the flesh who are sons of God, but the sons of the promise are reckoned as his seed.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL415_151_2" id="target_note_LCL415_151_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Accordingly, the sons of the promise are called to be the seed of Abraham in Isaac; that is, they are gathered together in Christ by the grace that summons them. The good father, then, faithfully cherishing this promise, since it was bound to be fulfilled by the boy whom God ordered him to slay, did not doubt that if it were possible for a son to be given him after his hopes had failed it was also possible for this son to be restored to him after his sacrificial death.</p>
