<p>I promised also<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL412_11_1" id="target_note_LCL412_11_1"><sup>1</sup></a> that I would show what their moral standards were, and for what reason the true God, in whose power all kingdoms are, deigned to help them extend their empire, and how far from helping them were those whom they rate as gods, and how much harm they did instead, with their trickery and deceit. So I see that I must now take up this topic, especially the extension of the Roman rule. For the pernicious deceit of the demons whom they used to worship as gods and the great harm that they did to Roman morals have been discussed at some length already, especially in the second book. Moreover in all three of the books now finished I have pointed out, as opportunity offered, how much relief amid the very disasters of war God has granted to good and evil men alike through the name of Christ, to which the barbarians have shown great honour contrary to the usages of war. In this way “he makes his sun rise on the good and the bad, and sends rain on the just and the unjust.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL412_11_2" id="target_note_LCL412_11_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
