man. Yet the passage of Scripture would have us understand that there is one book, saying as it does: “And another book was opened.” So we must understand that there is some divine force by which it will be brought about that all the deeds of every man, good or bad, will be called to mind and passed in review with marvellous swiftness by mental intuition, so that his knowledge will either accuse or excuse his conscience, and so each and all will be judged at the same time. And this divine force has doubtless been called “a book” because with it is read, in a way, whatever is rehearsed by its operation.</p>
<p>In order, moreover, to show who the dead are, great and small, who are to be judged, he says by way of outline, as if recurring to something omitted or rather postponed: “And the sea gave up the dead that were in it, and death and hell gave back the dead that were in them.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL416_337_1" id="target_note_LCL416_337_1"><sup>1</sup></a> This doubtless took place before the dead were judged; yet the judgement is mentioned first. This is the sort of thing I meant when I said that in his outline he returned to what he had passed over. But he soon took up the order of events, and to make the order itself quite clear he repeated in its own place, and more appropriately, what he had already said about the dead who were judged. For after saying: “And the sea gave up the dead that were in it, and death and hell gave back the dead whom they possessed,” he at once added what he had placed a little before: “And they were judged, each according to his deeds.” For this is what he had said before: “And the dead were judged according to their deeds.”</p>
