close bearing on the subject in hand. In the first place, the city was wasted by famine; for some authors report that she even dined on the corpses of her own citizens. Thereupon, weary of the whole story, that she might at least escape falling captive into Hannibalâ€™s hands, she officially built a huge funeral pyre, to which as it blazed all consigned themselves and their families, after butchery by the sword as well. Here those gods should have done something, gormandizers and parasites that they were, whose mouths were agape for the fat of sacrificial victims while they maintained the cheat by a fog of treacherous predictions. Here they should have acted, should have supported a state most friendly to the Roman people, should not have let it be destroyed, when destruction menaced it for keeping faith.</p>
<p>They had indeed themselves officiated as mediators when that alliance was established by the signing of a treaty with the Roman republic. A city faithfully preserving the alliance which under their patronage it had agreed to form, pledged its fidelity, and bound itself with an oath, then was besieged, crushed and destroyed by a violator of oaths. If it really was the gods who later, when Hannibal was at the very walls of Rome, terrified him with lightning and storm and drove him far away, they should have done the like on that first occasion at the siege of Saguntum. Indeed, I venture to say that it would have been more to their credit if they had been able to produce a raging tempest in defence of friends of the Romans who were in jeopardy for keeping faith with the Romans, and who at that time had no resources with which to fight, than it was to do so on behalf of the Romans
