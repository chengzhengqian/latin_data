when we keep the foreknowledge of God, or blasphemously to deny that God foreknows the future because we keep free will. Instead we embrace both truths; with faith and trust we assert both. The former is required for correct belief, the latter for right living. And there is no right living if there is no correct belief in God. Far be it then, from us, in order to enjoy free will, to deny the foreknowledge of him by whose assistance alone we are free, or shall ever be free. Consequently laws, reprimands, exhortations, praise and denunciation are not useless, for God knew that they would be used, and they are most effective as far as he foreknew that they would be. Prayers too are effective for obtaining those things which he foreknew he would grant to those who pray. And it accords with justice that rewards are provided for good deeds and punishments for sins. For man does not in fact fail to<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL412_187_1" id="target_note_LCL412_187_1"><sup>1</sup></a> sin because God foresaw that he would sin. Nay, it is precisely because of foreknowledge that there is no doubt that man himself sins when he sins. For he whose foreknowledge cannot be mistaken foresaw that neither fate, nor fortune, nor anything else but the man himself would sin. If he chooses not to sin, he certainly does not sin, and this choice not to sin was also foreseen by God.</p>
