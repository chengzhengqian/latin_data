<p class="noindent">But why is Janus put ahead of him? Let the acute and learned Varro reply: “Because the beginnings are in the power of Janus, and their fulfilment in that of Jupiter. So Jupiter is rightly regarded as king of all. For beginnings are inferior to fulfilments, since, though they precede in time, they are surpassed in dignity by the fulfilment.” This statement would be quite correct if we were making a distinction between the beginning of acts and their fulfilment. To set out is the beginning of an act, to arrive is its fulfilment; to set about learning is the beginning of a process, and the comprehension of what is taught is its fulfilment. So in all cases the beginnings come first, and the fulfilment at the end. But this point has already been discussed in connection with Janus and Terminus. The causes, however, that are assigned to Jupiter are efficient causes, not effects, nor is it in the least possible that they are preceded even in time by deeds done or by beginnings of deeds. For that which causes is always prior to the thing that is caused. Hence, though the beginnings of deeds may belong to Janus, that is no reason for putting them ahead of the efficient causes, which are assigned to Jupiter. For not only is nothing effected, but nothing starts to be effected, unless it is preceded by an efficient cause.</p>
