For if we can know and vouch for those things that are not removed from our senses, whether these senses are internal or even external—and
that is why such things are spoken of as “present,” because we say that they are presented to our senses, just as what is before our eyes is presented to them—yet we cannot know and vouch for what is removed from our senses. Certainly we must have other witnesses in these cases and put our trust in those from whose senses we do not believe these things to be or to have been removed. Therefore, just as in the case of visible objects unseen by us we believe those who have seen them, and likewise where the other individual bodily senses are concerned, so with respect to the things that the mind and heart sense—for the word <span class="italic">sensus</span> or ‘sense’ is quite correct here and has given us the word <span class="italic">sententia</span> or judgement—that is to say, with respect to invisible things not present to our inner sense, we are bound to believe those who have learned of them as they are exhibited under that incorporeal light, or who hold them in lasting contemplation.</p>
