names mean: Gog, “roof”; Magog, “from the roof”; or, as it were, the house and he who goes forth from the house.</p>
<p>They are therefore the nations in which, as we understood above,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL416_323_1" id="target_note_LCL416_323_1"><sup>1</sup></a> the devil is shut up as in a pit, and the devil himself is somehow one who comes out and goes forth from them; as they are “the roof,” so he is the one who goes “from the roof.” If, however, we refer both terms to the nations, and not one of them to the nations and the other to the devil, then they are the roof or covering because the ancient enemy is now shut up in them and somehow covered up; and they will be also from the roof when they burst out from covert into uncovered hatred. And the words: “And they went up over the breadth of the earth, and encompassed the camp of the saints and the beloved city”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL416_323_2" id="target_note_LCL416_323_2"><sup>2</sup></a> surely do not mean that they have come or are to come to a single place, as if the camp of the saints and the beloved city were to be in some single place; for these are nothing else than the church of Christ spread throughout the whole world. Therefore wherever the church shall then be, which is to be among all nations (this is the meaning of the words “over the breadth of the earth”), there shall be the camp of the saints, there shall be God’s beloved city, there it shall be encompassed by all its enemies (for they, too, will be present with it among all nations) in the cruelty of that persecution; that is, it shall be hemmed in, hard pressed, and shut up tight in the straits of tribulation, yet shall not abandon its warfare, of which the word “camp” is here used.</p>
