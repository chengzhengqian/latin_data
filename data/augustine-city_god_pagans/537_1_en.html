may be either Platonists or Aristotelians, since Aristotle, who founded the Peripatetic school, was the pupil of Plato. Others, however, like the Stoics, hold that passions of this kind do not affect the wise man at all.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_159_1" id="target_note_LCL413_159_1"><sup>1</sup></a> But Cicero in his treatise <span class="italic">On the Supreme Good and Evil</span> <a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_159_2" id="target_note_LCL413_159_2"><sup>2</sup></a> shows convincingly that the latter, namely the Stoics, disagree with the Platonists and Peripatetics verbally rather than essentially. He points out that the Stoics refuse to speak of bodily and external things as goods, but employ the term “advantages” on the ground that, according to them, there is no good for man save virtue, which is defined as the art of right living, and exists only as a state of mind. The other philosophers use the straightforward language of customary speech and call these advantages goods, but hold that in comparison with the virtue that is the norm of right living, they are slight and trivial. The result is that, no matter what they are called by the two parties, good or advantageous, still their value is the same for both; and in debating this point the Stoics are merely pluming themselves on a new fashion in words. Hence it seems to me that here too, when the question is asked whether mental passions affect the wise man, or whether he is a complete stranger to them, they are again basing an argument on words rather than on facts. For I judge that the Stoics themselves hold exactly the same view as the Platonists and Peripatetics, in so far as the gist of the matter is concerned and not the mere jingle of the words.</p>
<p>To avoid a tedious explanation of this point, I shall omit other illustrations and content myself with one instance that brings it out very clearly. In his work
