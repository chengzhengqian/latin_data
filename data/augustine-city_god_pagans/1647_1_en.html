mother’s womb, which was intact and in virgin state,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL417_243_1" id="target_note_LCL417_243_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and that he entered a room whose doors were closed to join his disciples.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL417_243_2" id="target_note_LCL417_243_2"><sup>2</sup></a> But let them at least investigate this marvel, and if they find it true, let them believe those other miracles. The woman is of high estate, of noble birth, married to a noble, and lives at Carthage. The renown of the city and of the woman ensure that the facts cannot be hidden from any who look into the matter. Certainly the martyr himself, by whose intercession she was healed, believed on the Son of a mother who remained always a virgin, and believed on him who came to his disciples through closed doors, and, to conclude, believed on him who ascended to heaven with the body in which he had risen again—and this is the point that occasioned all my argument. Furthermore, these miracles are worked through Stephen just because he laid down his life for this faith. So even now many miracles are wrought, as God works them through those whom he chooses and in the manner he chooses, the same God who did those things which we read in the Scriptures. But these later miracles are not as well known, nor are they, like gravel, pounded into the memory by frequent reading so as not to slip from the mind. For even where care is taken, as in Hippo today, to see that the reports of those who receive such favours are read to the people, those who are present hear it but once, and a larger number are not present. The result is that those who were present forget what they have heard after a few days, and you can hardly find anyone who reports what he has heard to anyone who he discovers was not there.</p>
