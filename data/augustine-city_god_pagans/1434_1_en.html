does not honour the Son does not honour the Father who sent him,” he added immediately: “Verily, verily, I say unto you, that he who hears my word and believes on him who sent me has everlasting life, and shall not come into judgement, but has passed from death into life.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL416_275_1" id="target_note_LCL416_275_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Note that he said here that his faithful shall not come into judgement. Now how are they to be separated from the wicked by judgement, and stand on his right hand, unless in this passage he used “judgement” in the sense of “condemnation”?

<p><span class="sc">Next</span> he adds the following words: “Verily, verily, I say unto you that the hour is coming and now is when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God; and they who hear it shall live. For even as the Father has life in himself, so he has given also to the Son to have life in himself.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL416_275_2" id="target_note_LCL416_275_2"><sup>2</sup></a> He is not yet speaking of the second resurrection, that is, of the body, which is to be in the end, but of the first, which now is. In fact, it is in order to make this distinction that he says: “The hour is coming and now is.” Moreover, this resurrection is not that of the body, but of the soul. For souls, too, have their own death, in irreligion and sin, and it is with this death that those are dead of whom the same Lord says: “Let the dead bury their dead”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL416_275_3" id="target_note_LCL416_275_3"><sup>3</sup></a>; that is, let those who are dead in soul bury those who are dead in body.
