the nations serve you and the princes reverence you. Become the master of your brother and your father’s sons shall revere you. He who shall curse you, let him be accursed, and he who blesses you, let him be blessed.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL415_173_1" id="target_note_LCL415_173_1"><sup>1</sup></a> So the blessing of Jacob is the proclamation of Christ among all nations.

The world is filled like a field with the sweet smell of the name of Christ. His is the blessing by the dews of heaven, that is, by the showers of the divine words, and by the fertility of the earth, that is, by the assembling of the peoples. His is the increase of grain and wine, that is, the multitude that the grain and wine gather together in the sacrament of his body and blood. Him do the nations serve, him do the princes reverence. He himself is lord over his brother, since his people rule the Jews. Him do the sons of his father adore, that is, the sons of Abraham after the faith, for he himself is also the son of Abraham after the flesh. Accursed is he who has cursed him, and blessed is he who has blessed him. Our Christ, I say, is blessed, that is, he is truly proclaimed even by the lips of the Jews who, although they have gone astray, none the less chant the law and the prophets, thinking that they are blessing another Messiah, who is still awaited by his erring people.</p>
