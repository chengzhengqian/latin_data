Concerning these cycles and the ceaseless ebb and flow of souls going and returning the Platonist Porphyry<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_103_1" id="target_note_LCL414_103_1"><sup>1</sup></a> declined to follow the opinion of his schoolâ€”I am not sure whether it was because he was agitated by the implicit nonsense of the very idea or because he already had some respect for the Christian era.
