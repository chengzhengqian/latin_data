poor they gain their object, with the result that they believe that they have bought, or rather, are buying every day, a licence from him for their misdeeds, whereby they may commit such damnable deeds without misgivings—whereas, if for a single crime they distributed all their goods to the poor<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL417_155_1" id="target_note_LCL417_155_1"><sup>1</sup></a> members of Christ, unless they were to desist from such deeds, having a love which works no evil, nothing would do them any good.</p>
<p>So he who does suitable alms to atone for sins should first begin with himself. For it is improper not to do for himself what he does for his neighbour, while he hears God saying: “Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL417_155_2" id="target_note_LCL417_155_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and also hears: “Pity thy soul, pleasing God.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL417_155_3" id="target_note_LCL417_155_3"><sup>3</sup></a> How should one who does not do this good deed, that is, please God, be said to do alms suitable to atone for his sins? For on this point another text of Scripture applies: “He that is evil to himself, to whom will he be good?”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL417_155_4" id="target_note_LCL417_155_4"><sup>4</sup></a> No doubt alms aid prayer, and we must by all means heed the words: “Son, thou hast sinned; do so no more, and for thy former sins pray that they may be forgiven thee.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL417_155_5" id="target_note_LCL417_155_5"><sup>5</sup></a> So alms are to be done for this purpose, that we may be heard when praying concerning past sins, not to support a belief that we gain a licence for wrongdoing through almsgiving while we continue in our sins.</p>
<p>Now when the Lord declared that he would recompense those on the right for alms they had done, and those on the left for deeds left undone, his purpose was to show how far such acts avail to wipe out
