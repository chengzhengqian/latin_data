result is that Platoâ€™s own views on important subjects are also far from easy to decipher.</p>
<p>At the same time, I ought to note and record in this work certain tenets that appear in his writings, either pronounced by himself or recounted and written down by him as having been expressed by others and presumably approved by him. I shall do so, whether he supports the true religion which is adopted and vindicated by our faith, or appears to be opposed to it, as in the question whether there is one God or many and how this is related to the true happiness which we expect from life after death. Perhaps indeed those who with good reason prefer Plato greatly to other pagan philosophers and possess a higher reputation for more than ordinary subtlety and comprehension of the truth in following his teaching, have a theory of God which would discover in him the cause of physical existence, the ground of rational thought, and the pattern of life. Of these three, the first is assumed to belong to the natural, the second to the logical and the third to the moral subdivision of philosophy. Man has been so created that, through what is excellent in him, he attains what transcends all else, namely the one true and supremely good God, without whom nothing in nature exists, no doctrine instructs and no employment is profitable. And so let him alone be sought in whom we find all reality interwoven, let our eyes be on him alone who has the certainty of all things for us, let him alone be loved in whom all things for us are right.</p>
