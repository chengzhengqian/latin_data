we call the Father and the Son, and both with their Spirit are one God. This Spirit of the Father and the Son is called in the sacred Writings holy with a certain special meaning attached to the word.</p>
<p>Now the Holy Spirit is another person than the Father and the Son, because he is neither the Father nor the Son. But I have called him another person, not a different thing, because he is, like them, the simple and, like them, the unchangeable good and is co-eternal. And this Trinity is one God, and it is none the less simple because it is a Trinity. For we do not say that this substance of good is simple because the Father alone is in it, or the Son alone, or the Holy Spirit alone. Nor is it, on the other hand, only nominally a Trinity without reality of persons, as the Sabellian heretics have thought,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_465_1" id="target_note_LCL413_465_1"><sup>1</sup></a> but it is called simple because it is what it has, save in so far as each person is spoken of in relation to another. For without question the Father has a Son, but is not the Son; and the Son has a Father, but is not the Father. Therefore it is in respect to himself and not to the other that he is what he has; for example, he is said in respect to himself to be alive surely by having life, and he is himself this life.</p>
<p>Now the reason why something is called a simple substance is this, because it does not possess anything that it can lose, or, to put it another way, because it is not different from what it has, for example, a jar has some liquid in it, a body has colour, the air light or heat and the soul wisdom. Now none of these is what it has, that is, the jar is not the liquid, nor is the body colour, nor is the air light or heat, nor is the soul wisdom. This is why these things can also suffer loss
