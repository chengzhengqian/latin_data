not from the material things that he created, but from God himself.</p>
<p>Indeed, his wholly veracious prophet says: “But for me it is good to cling to God.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_337_1" id="target_note_LCL413_337_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Now among philosophers there is argument about the supreme good, to the attainment of which all our responsible acts should be directed. And the psalmist did not say: “For me it is good to have riches in abundance,” nor “to be decked out in imperial purple and have sceptre and diadem to mark my superiority,” nor, as some even of the philosophers have not blushed to say: “For me the pleasure of the body is good,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_337_2" id="target_note_LCL413_337_2"><sup>2</sup></a> nor, as the nobler philosophers, it is thought, have said more nobly: “For me the moral strength of my mind is good.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_337_3" id="target_note_LCL413_337_3"><sup>3</sup></a> No, the psalmist said, “For me it is good to cling to God.” This teaching he had received from Him who is alone entitled to sacrifice, as his holy angels have also pointed out, and confirmed their message by the evidence of miracles.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_337_4" id="target_note_LCL413_337_4"><sup>4</sup></a> He had thus been led to become himself a sacrifice to God, by whose intelligible flame he was caught up and set afire, and into whose ineffable and incorporeal embrace his holy longing carried him.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if the worshippers of many gods, whatever be the qualities that they assign to them, believe that their gods have performed miracles, putting faith in recorded history or in books of magic, that is, to use the term that they consider more respectable, theurgy, what excuse have they for refusing to credit our miracles? They are found in records that deserve as much more confidence as He is great above all others to whom alone these records direct us to sacrifice.</p>
