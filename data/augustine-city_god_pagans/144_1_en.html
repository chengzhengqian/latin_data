<span class="label"><span class="italic">Whether Rome should have been entrusted to the Trojan gods.</span></span>
<p>So how in any way was it prudent to entrust Rome to the protection of the gods of Ilium after this demonstration in the case of Troy herself? Suppose someone urges that when Ilium fell in the capture by Fimbria, the gods were now familiarly at home in Rome. What, then, made the image of Minerva remain in place? Next we ask, if they were at Rome when Fimbria destroyed Ilium, perhaps they were at Ilium when Rome itself was captured and burned by the Gauls. Having, however, the sharpest hearing and the greatest celerity, they returned at once when the geese cackled,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL411_289_3" id="target_note_LCL411_289_3"><sup>3</sup></a> in order to protect at least the Capitoline Hill, which had been spared. Yet the warning came too late for them to return in time to defend anything else.</p>
