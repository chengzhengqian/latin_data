<span class="label"><span class="italic">On the theological poets.</span></span>
<p><span class="sc">During</span> this same period of time poets arose who were also called theologians, because they composed songs about the gods, but about such gods as were but men, although great men; or else they are elements of this world which the true God created, or were established in sovereignties and powers according to the will of the creator and their own merits. And if the poets among their many vain falsehoods sang at all of the one true God, they certainly did not serve him truly when they worshipped along with him others who are not gods, and offered to these the service that is due to the one God alone, nor when, poets though they were, they could not keep clear of shameful fictions about their gods—I mean, Orpheus, Musaeus and Linus. True it is that those theologians did worship the gods, and were not worshipped as gods; and yet somehow or other the city of the wicked is wont to put Orpheus at the head of sacred, or rather, sacrilegious rites of the nether world. Again, the wife of king Athamas, who was called Ino, and her son Melicertes perished by a voluntary leap into the sea, and were raised to the rank of gods in men’s opinion, as were other men of those days, Castor and Pollux. The Greeks, to be sure, called the mother of Melicertes Leucothea, and the Latins called her Matuta; both, however, considered her a goddess.</p>
