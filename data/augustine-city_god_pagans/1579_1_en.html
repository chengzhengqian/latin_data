<span class="label"><span class="italic">Of those who think that sins committed amid works of alms are not called into judgement of condemnation.</span></span>
<p><span class="sc">Some</span> men also, I have found, think that only those will bum in that eternal punishment who neglect proper alms<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL417_107_1" id="target_note_LCL417_107_1"><sup>1</sup></a> to atone for their sins. They quote the apostle James: “But judgement will be without mercy to him who has shown no mercy.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL417_107_2" id="target_note_LCL417_107_2"><sup>2</sup></a> So he who has shown mercy, they say, though he has not reformed his ways, but has lived wickedly and worthlessly even while doing alms, will be judged with mercy, and either not condemned at all, or freed from his punishment after some period, short or long. That is the reason, they believe, why the judge of the living and the dead chose not to mention anything else that he will say to those on the right hand, to whom he will give eternal life, or on the left, whom he will condemn to eternal punishment, except the acts of charity which were either done or left undone.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL417_107_3" id="target_note_LCL417_107_3"><sup>3</sup></a> They say that the daily petition in the Lord’s prayer also refers to this point: “Forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL417_107_4" id="target_note_LCL417_107_4"><sup>4</sup></a> For whoever forgives a man who sins against him by pardoning his sin, beyond doubt is charitable. This the Lord himself has emphasized by saying: “For if ye forgive men their sins, your Father also will forgive your sins; but if ye do not forgive men, neither will your Father
