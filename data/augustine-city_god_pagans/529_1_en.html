<p>Let us take, for example, Isis, the Egyptian goddess and wife of Osiris, and their ancestors, all of whom, according to written tradition, were kings.—This
Isis, when offering sacrifice to her ancestors, found a crop of barley, from which she showed ears to her husband the King and his counsellor Mercury. That is why people choose to identify her with Ceres.—All the great evils she wrought were recorded, not by the poets, but in the Egyptian mystic writings, as Alexander writes to his mother Olympias.

Let them never, however much they may regard them as gods, dare in any sense to compare them with our holy martyrs, whom nevertheless we do not regard as gods. This is why we have not set up priests for their worship, nor do we offer sacrifice to our martyrs, because such a rite is neither appropriate nor required nor permitted, for it is a rite that belongs to the service of one God alone. Neither do we entertain them with their own crimes nor with shameful exhibitions, as the pagans do when they exhibit the disgraceful actions of their gods, whether committed by them when they were men or, if they were not men before, mere inventions cooked up to titillate baneful demons.</p>
