<p>But at this point we may justifiably ask whether it is one of the afflictions of our present life that we are subject to emotions of this kind even while we are performing our several good actions, though the holy angels may certainly punish without anger those handed over to them for punishment under the eternal law of God and may minister to the sorrowing without themselves sharing a feeling of sorrow, and when those they love are in danger, may bring succour, unmoved by fear. Nevertheless the words denoting these passions are employed in ordinary usage of angels as well; but this is due to a generic likeness between their behaviour and ours, and not to their being afflicted by our emotions. In the same way God himself, according to the Scriptures, becomes angry, and yet he is never moved by any passions. For this word is used to indicate the consequences of his vengeance and not any violent emotion on his part.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_171_2a" id="target_note_LCL413_171_2a"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
