and seven of each kind from the clean. But they calculate, it seems, only three hundred cubits in length and fifty in width, without considering that there is just as much space on the upper level and as much also on the still higher level, so that those dimensions in cubits are multiplied by three and thus come to nine hundred by one hundred and fifty. Further, it is possible, as Origen brilliantly suggested,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_575_1" id="target_note_LCL414_575_1"><sup>1</sup></a> that Moses, a man of God “instructed,” according to Scripture, “in all the wisdom of the Egyptians”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_575_2" id="target_note_LCL414_575_2"><sup>2</sup></a>—and they were devoted to geometry, meant geometric cubits, of which one is said to equal six of ours. If we should follow such a line of thinking, the enormous capacity of an ark of that size would be plain to all.</p>
<p>When they argue that an ark of such vast dimensions could not be framed, their disparaging remarks are quite foolish since they know that enormous cities have been constructed; and, besides, they overlook the hundred years that it took to build that ark. Or if stones can be cemented together by lime alone to form a circular wall many miles long, is it possible that wood cannot be joined by tenons, pegs, nails and pitch-glue to build an ark which would extend not in curving but in straight lines throughout its length and breadth? Such an ark would not be launched into the sea by human effort but would be raised, thanks to the natural difference in specific gravity, by the flood water when it arrived; and the ark would be piloted when afloat by divine providence rather than by human prudence so as to avoid shipwreck anywhere.</p>
