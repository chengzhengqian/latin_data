kingdom of God.” Hence all those who practise such things will be nowhere else but in eternal punishment, since they cannot be in the kingdom of God. For if they persevere in these sins until the end of this life, they cannot be said to persevere in Christ till the end. For to persevere in Christ is to persevere in his faith, and this faith, as the Apostle definitely states, works through love,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL417_137_1" id="target_note_LCL417_137_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and love, as he elsewhere says, works no evil.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL417_137_2" id="target_note_LCL417_137_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Hence, these too should not be said to eat the body of Christ, for they cannot be counted among the members of Christ. For, not to mention the other sins, they cannot at the same time be members of Christ and members of a harlot.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL417_137_3" id="target_note_LCL417_137_3"><sup>3</sup></a> Finally, Christ himself says: “He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me and I in him.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL417_137_4" id="target_note_LCL417_137_4"><sup>4</sup></a> He thus shows what it is to eat the body of Christ and drink His blood, not only in the sacrament, but in reality, for to remain in Christ is to have Christ also remaining in him. For this is the same as if he said: “He who does not remain in me, and in whom I do not remain, may not say or think that he is eating my body or drinking my blood.” So those who are not his members do not remain in Christ. But those who make themselves members of a harlot are not members of Christ, unless by repentance they abandon that evil thing, and by reconciliation return to this good thing.</p>
