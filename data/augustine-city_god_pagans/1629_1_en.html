since Romulus lived about six hundred years before Cicero, and that age is said to have been already so enlightened by education that it rejected the impossible, how much more would this be true in the time of Cicero himself, six hundred years later? And most emphatically would it be true still later, in the reigns of Augustus and Tiberius, when times were still more advanced. Then the human mind could not have believed in the resurrection of Christ in the flesh and his ascension to heaven, but would have mocked at the story, closed their ears, and rejected it from their hearts as impossible, if the possibility and the fact had not been demonstrated by the divinity of Truth itself, and by the truth of Divinity, as well as by the miraculous signs that confirmed the fact. Thus it happened that, in spite of the fearful obstacle of many great persecutions, men confidently believed and boldly proclaimed the resurrection and bodily immortality of Christ, which came first in time, and that of all others, which will follow in the new age. The seed of faith that was destined to bear fruit throughout the world was being sown, and made more fruitful by the blood of the martyrs. For the preceding proclamations of the prophets were read, the display of mighty works added its support, and men were convinced of the truth, new to their experience but not contrary to reason, until all the world, which once madly persecuted the truth, now followed it in faith.</p>
