<p>Nor will that saying of the gospel be thereby falsified: “Who enters into the house of a strong man, to take his goods, unless he first bind the strong man?” For in accordance with the truth of that saying the order is preserved: first the binding of the strong one, and then the taking of his goods, and finally the increase of the church among all peoples far and wide, from the strong and the weak, till by its most robust faith in things divinely predicted and fulfilled it shall have power to carry off the goods of the devil even though he has been loosed. For just as it must be admitted that “when iniquity abounds the love of many waxes cold,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL416_303_1" id="target_note_LCL416_303_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and that those who are not enrolled in the book of life will yield in large numbers to the unprecedented and mighty persecutions and deceptions of the devil, now loosed, so we must think that not only the good whom that time shall find faithful but also some who till then will be outside the church, with the help of God’s grace and by the study of the Scriptures in which there is foretold, among other things, that very end whose approach they perceive, will become firmer in the faith that they hitherto did not hold and strong enough to vanquish the devil even when he is unbound. And if this shall be so, his binding must be spoken of as coming first, so that there may follow a spoiling of him both bound and loosed; for it is this to which the words refer: “Who shall enter into the house of a strong man, to take his goods, unless he first bind the strong man?”</p>
