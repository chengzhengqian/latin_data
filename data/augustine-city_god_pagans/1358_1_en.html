<span class="label"><span class="italic">What view the Christians hold about the supreme good and the supreme evil, as against the philosophers who have maintained that for them the supreme good is in themselves.</span></span>
<p><span class="sc">If</span>, then, we are asked what the City of God replies when asked about these several matters, and first what its opinion is about the ultimate good and the ultimate evil, it will reply that the ultimate good is eternal life, and that the ultimate evil is eternal death, and that in order to obtain the one and escape the other we must live rightly. Wherefore it is written: “The just man lives by faith.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL416_123_1" id="target_note_LCL416_123_1"><sup>1</sup></a> For neither do we see as yet our good, and therefore must seek it by believing, nor is it in our power of ourselves to live rightly unless he who has given us faith to believe that we must seek help from him shall help us, as we believe in and pray to him. But those who have supposed that the ultimate good and evil are to be found in the present life, placing the ultimate good either in the body or in the soul or in both, or, to speak more explicitly, either in pleasure or in virtue or in both, in repose or in virtue or in both, in pleasure combined with repose or in virtue or in both, in the primary wants of nature or in virtue or in both, all these persons have sought, with a surprising vanity, to be happy in this life and to get happiness by their own efforts. Truth laughed at these men through the words of the prophet: “The Lord knows the thoughts of men,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL416_123_2" id="target_note_LCL416_123_2"><sup>2</sup></a> or, as the apostle Paul has set forth this passage: “The Lord knows the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL416_123_3" id="target_note_LCL416_123_3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
