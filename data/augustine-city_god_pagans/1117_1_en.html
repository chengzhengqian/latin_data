And your seed shall possess the cities of the enemy by right of inheritance, and all nations on earth shall be blessed in your seed, because you have obeyed my voice.’”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL415_155_3" id="target_note_LCL415_155_3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>Thus that promise of the calling of the nations in Abraham’s seed, after the burnt offering that is a symbol of Christ, was now also confirmed by an oath that God swore. For he had often made promises, but had never sworn to them. And what is the oath of the true and faithful God but the confirmation of his promises, and, in a way, a denunciation of those who will not believe?</p>
