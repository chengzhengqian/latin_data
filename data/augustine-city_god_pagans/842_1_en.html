supreme God addressing the deities whom he made and saying: “You who have sprung from the stock of the gods, give heed. The works of which I am parent and author are exempt from dissolution against my will, although everything that is fastened together can be sundered; but it is nowise good to choose to undo what is bound together by reason. But since you have had a beginning, you cannot be immortal and indestructible. Yet you will by no means be destroyed, nor will any necessity of death annihilate you or be more powerful than my purpose, which serves as a stronger bond for your continued existence than those bonds by which you were fastened together [at the time that you were created].”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_191_1" id="target_note_LCL414_191_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Thus Plato says both that the gods are mortal because of the union of body and soul<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_189_2a" id="target_note_LCL414_189_2a"><sup>2</sup></a> and that they are yet immortal because of the will and purpose of God who made them.</p>
<p>If then it is punishment for the soul to be bound up in any sort of body, why is it that God addresses them as though they were anxious for fear that they may die, that is, be detached from the body, and why does he give them assurance of their immortality? This assurance, moreover, is based, not on their nature, which is composite rather than simple, but on his own unconquerable will, by which he has power to preserve such things as have a beginning from perishing and such as have been joined together from coming apart, and to make them endure without deterioration.</p>
