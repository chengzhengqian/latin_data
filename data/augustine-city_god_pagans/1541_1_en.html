announced that they would come to pass, doubtless they would be even less inclined to believe than they are now to believe what we say will come. We say that there will be living human bodies which will always burn and suffer, yet will never die. If, instead, we should say that in the world to come there will be a kind of salt which fire would cause to melt, as our salt does in water, and which water would cause to crackle, as our salt does in fire, which of them would believe us? Or if we should say that there will be a spring whose water is so hot in the coolness of night that it cannot be touched, and in the heat of day so cold that it cannot be drunk? Or a stone which burns the hand of him who squeezes it, or one which can never be extinguished when once it has caught fire from any source? And which of them would believe the other examples which I have thought worth a passing mention, while I was omitting countless others?</p>
<p>Therefore, if we were to say that these things will be in that world which is to come, and they were to reply in unbelief, “If you wish us to believe these things, give us the explanation of each one,” we should admit that we could not, for the reason that the feeble reasoning of men is surpassed by these marvellous works of God, and others like them. However, among us the reasonable view is firmly fixed that it is with good reason that the Almighty does those things concerning which the feeble human mind can give no reason. In many things it is unclear to us what His will is. This, however, is very certain, that none of the things which He has willed is impossible, and we believe His predictions since we cannot question either his strength or his truth.
