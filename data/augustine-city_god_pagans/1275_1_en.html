give your life for sin you shall see a long-lived seed, and it is the Lord’s will to rescue his soul from pain, to show him the light and to form his understanding, to justify the righteous man who serves many well, and he himself shall bear their sins. Therefore he shall inherit many, and he shall divide the spoils of the mighty, because his soul was delivered to death, and he was reckoned among the. transgressors, and he bore the sins of many, and for their sins was delivered up.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL415_471_1" id="target_note_LCL415_471_1"><sup>1</sup></a> These things were said of Christ.</p>
<p>Let us now hear what follows concerning the church. He says: “Rejoice, O barren, you that do not bear children; break forth and shout, you who do not give birth, for the children of the desolate one are many, surpassing those of her that has a husband. Enlarge the place of your tent, and of your curtains, fix the pins, spare not, lengthen your cords and strengthen your tent poles, spread forth your tent still to the right and the left, for your seed shall inherit the nations and you shall populate deserted cities. Have no fear because you are put to shame, do not stand in awe because you were reproached, for you shall forget your old confusion and shall not remember the reproach of your widowed state. For it is the Lord that made you, the Lord of hosts is his name, and he that delivered you shall be called the God of Israel in all the earth,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL415_471_2" id="target_note_LCL415_471_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and so forth. But let this suffice. There are some points in it that require explanation, but I think there are enough points that are so clear that even our adversaries will be compelled to understand in spite of themselves.</p>
