that one part as well. Consider how, when we choose, we set our hands and feet in motion to do the things that are theirs to do, how we manage this without any conflict and with all the facility that we see both in our own case and in that others, especially among workers in all kind of physical tasks, where a natural capacity that is too weak and slow is fitted for its employment by the application of greater dexterity and effort.

<p>When in his discussion of the different forms of rule in his work entitled <span class="italic">On the Commonwealth</span> Cicero drew an analogy for his purpose from human nature, did he not say that the members of the body are ruled like children because of their readiness to obey, whereas the depraved parts of the soul are constrained like slaves by a harsher rule?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_381_1" id="target_note_LCL414_381_1"><sup>1</sup></a> No doubt, in the order of nature, the soul ranks above the body, yet the soul itself finds it easier to rule the body than to rule itself.
