Then later, at the end of the flood, we read the following: “And in the seventh month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, the ark came to rest upon the mountains of Ararat. And the water continued to abate until the eleventh month; in the eleventh month, on the first day of the month, the tops of the mountains were seen.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_489_1" id="target_note_LCL414_489_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
