So it is of those who are dead in soul, because of impiety and wickedness, that he says: “The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God; and they who hear it shall live.” By “who hear it” he means “who obey and believe and persevere to the end.” Nor has he made here any difference between the good and the bad; for it is good for all men to hear his voice and to live by passing from the death of irreligion to the life of religion.</p>
<p>And it is of this death that the apostle Paul speaks: “Therefore all men are dead and he died for all, that those who live should not live henceforth for themselves but for him who died for them and rose again.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL416_277_1" id="target_note_LCL416_277_1"><sup>1</sup></a> So all men, without exception, are dead in sin, whether original or voluntary sin, whether sin committed in ignorance or sin committed in wanton defiance of what was known to be right; and for all these dead, there died the only living man, that is, the only one who had no sin whatever, in order that those who live through the remission of sin should now live not for themselves but for him who died for all, for our sins, and rose again, for our justification, so that we, believing in him who makes the irreligious righteous and, being brought to righteousness from irreligion, just as if we were brought to life from death, might be able to attain to the first resurrection, which now is. For in this first resurrection only those take part who are to be blessed forever; but in the second, about which he will presently speak, he will show that both the blessed and the wretched take part. One is the resurrection of mercy, the other of judgement. Wherefore it is written in the psalm: “Of mercy and judgement I will sing to thee, O Lord.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL416_277_2" id="target_note_LCL416_277_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
