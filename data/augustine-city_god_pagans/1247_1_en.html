<span class="label"><span class="italic">On the fall of the Argive kingdom, at the time when Picus, Saturn’s son, first obtained his father’s kingdom among the Laurentines.</span></span>
<p><span class="sc">In</span> those times the kingdom of the Argives came to an end, being transferred to Mycenae, the city of Agamemnon, and the kingdom of the Laurentines rose, in which Saturn’s son Picus was the first to obtain the kingship. It was a time when the Hebrews had as judge a woman, Deborah. But in this the spirit of God was acting through her, for she was also a prophetess. Her prophecy is too obscure for me to be able to prove that it refers to Christ, without an unduly long exposition.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL415_415_1" id="target_note_LCL415_415_1"><sup>1</sup></a> The Laurentians, as I said, now had a kingdom in Italy, and from them the Roman line of descent can be traced more clearly after leaving the Greeks. However, the kingdom of Assyria still survived, in which Lampares was the twenty-third king when Picus became first king of the Laurentians.</p>
<p>As for Saturn, the father of this Picus, let those who deny that he was a man see what is the view held by worshippers of such gods. Not only have others written of him that he reigned in Italy before his son Picus, but Virgil also says in his well-known lines:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">A race untaught, dispersed on lofty mountains,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">He settled, gave them laws, and chose their name,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Latium, since he had hidden safely on those shores.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">The ages passed beneath his rule are those</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">That men call golden.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL415_415_2" id="target_note_LCL415_415_2"><sup>2</sup></a></span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
