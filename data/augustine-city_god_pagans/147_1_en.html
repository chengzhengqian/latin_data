<p>What evil would there have been, or rather what good would have been missed, if those times alluded to by Sallust had endured: “At first the kings (that term was the first used for the right to rule on earth) were unlike; some cultivated the mind, others the body. Men still led lives free from greed; each was well content with his own.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL411_295_1" id="target_note_LCL411_295_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Did the end, so great an extension of their domain, justify the course that was taken? To this Virgil bears hostile witness,</p>

<p class="noindent">Still, he who would defend the Romans for undertaking and waging such great wars is fully justified in urging the consideration that, since enemies made savage inroads on their territory, they were compelled to resist, not by any thirst for the prize of honour on men’s lips, but by the obligation to defend life, and liberty. Fully granted. For, to quote Sallust himself, “When their state, reinforced by laws, customs, territory, seemed to be as prosperous and as powerful as was required, in the usual course of human events, riches begot envy. In consequence the neighbouring kings and states made warlike assaults. Only a few friends gave assistance, for the greater part were terror-stricken and held aloof from battle. But the Romans, energetic at home and in the field, made haste, got ready, rallied one another, faced the enemy, and hedged with arms their liberty, their fatherland and their parents.
