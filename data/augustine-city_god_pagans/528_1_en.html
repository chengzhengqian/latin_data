martyr for the honour and the worship of God, say when he prayed: “I offer sacrifice to thee, Peter, or to thee, Paul, or to thee, Cyprian”?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_141_1" id="target_note_LCL413_141_1"><sup>1</sup></a> No one, for at their memorials sacrifice is offered to God, who made them both men and martyrs and united them in heavenly honour with his holy angels. This is a ceremony of thanksgiving to the true God for the victories of the martyrs, and at the same time we encourage ourselves to imitate them in winning like crowns and palms, as we call upon the same God to aid us and as we renew our memory of them. So whatever offerings are brought by the faithful to the shrines of the martyrs are intended as decorations of their memorials, and are not sacred objects or sacrificial offerings made to the dead as if they were gods.</p>
<p>Some even bring their food to the shrines—this is not done by Christians of the better sort, and in most countries the custom is unknown—but in any case those who do so say a prayer when they have laid the food down by the shrine, and then take it away to eat it or to bestow some of it also upon the needy.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_141_2" id="target_note_LCL413_141_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Their desire is that the food should be made holy for them through the merits of the martyrs in the name of the Lord of the martyrs. But that this is no sacrifice offered to the martyrs is well known to anybody who knows the one sacrifice of the Christians, which is offered there as well as elsewhere.</p>
<p>So we honour our martyrs neither with divine honours nor with human crimes, as do the pagans when they worship their gods, nor do we offer them sacrifices, nor do we convert their evil doings into religious celebrations in their honour.</p>
