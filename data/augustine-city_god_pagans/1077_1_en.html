is said about one of his sons, who was called Nahor, as if to imply that he did not take him along. For the tale runs thus: “And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran, his son’s son, and Sara his daughter-in-law, and led them forth from the land of the Chaldeans to go into the land of Canaan, and he came to Haran and settled there.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL415_75_1" id="target_note_LCL415_75_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Here there is no mention whatever of Nahor and his wife Milcah. But later on, when Abraham sent his slave to bring home a wife for his son Isaac, we find these words: “And the boy took ten camels from among his lord’s camels, and he took with him a portion of all his lord’s goods, and he arose and departed into Mesopotamia to the city of Nahor.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL415_75_2a" id="target_note_LCL415_75_2a"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>By this passage and by other statements in this sacred history Nahor also, Abraham’s brother, is shown to have gone out from the Chaldean region and to have established his residence in Mesopotamia, where Abraham had settled with his father. Why, then, did the Scripture fail to mention him when Terah set out from among the Chaldean people with his household and settled in Mesopotamia, whereas it is stated that he took with him not only his son Abraham but also his daughter-in-law Sarah and his nephew Lot? What reason can we give except perhaps that Nahor had abandoned his father’s and brother’s religion and had embraced the superstition of the Chaldeans, and it was later when he, too, emigrated, either because he repented of his error
