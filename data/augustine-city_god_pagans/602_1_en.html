the crime of sacrilegious occult practices and the open career of a philosopher. For at one time he warns us to beware of this art as being delusive and dangerous in actual practice, as well as prohibited by law, while at another, as if giving in to those who praise it, he says that it does service in purifying one part of the soul, not, to be sure, the intellectual part, which apprehends the truth of intelligible things that have no bodily likenesses, but the spiritual part, whereby we receive the images of corporeal things.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_289_1a" id="target_note_LCL413_289_1a"><sup>1</sup></a> For this part, he says, after certain theurgic initiations which are called <span class="italic">teletae,</span> mystic rites, becomes fit and suitable for the entertainment of spirits and angels and capable of seeing gods. Still, he admits that the intellectual soul receives no purification from these theurgic <span class="italic">teletai</span> such as might make it fit to behold its own God and to perceive the things that truly exist. From this it can be deduced what kind of gods they are or what kind of seeing it is that he says is produced by these theurgic initiations, a seeing that affords no sight of what really exists. Next he declares that it is possible for the rational or, as he prefers to call it, the intellectual soul to escape into its own realm, even though the spiritual part of it has never been purified by any art of theurgy. Furthermore, he says, the purification of the spiritual part by the theurgist does not go so far as by itself to lead all the way to immortality and eternity.</p>

The distinction between the intellectual and spiritual parts of the soul was taken by Porphyry from Plotinus. See <span class="italic">Enneads</span>, 1.1 and 5.3.9. In the Neoplatonic system the intellectual is the soul’s third and highest phase. This portion of the soul achieves understanding through instantaneous intuition. In contrast, the spiritual or middle phase judges sensations and learns through the process of discursive reasoning. Augustine adopts and develops this distinction in the twelfth book of <span class="italic">De Genesi ad Litteram.</span></a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL413_289_1a').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
