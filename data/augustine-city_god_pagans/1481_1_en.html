of the Lord, that we who are alive and are left until the coming of the Lord shall not precede those who have fallen asleep. For the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a cry of command and with the voice of the archangel and with the sound of the trumpet of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first; then we who are alive and are left shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet Christ in the air, and so we shall always be with the Lord.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL416_369_1" id="target_note_LCL416_369_1"><sup>1</sup></a> These words of the Apostle show most clearly that there is to be a resurrection of the dead when Christ comes; certainly his purpose will be to judge the living and the dead.</p>
<p>But it is commonly asked whether those whom Christ is to find living here, represented by the Apostle himself and those living in his own time, are never to die at all, or whether in that very moment of time when they are to be caught up together with those arising again in the clouds to meet Christ in the air they are to pass with marvellous swiftness through death into immortality. For it cannot be said that it is impossible for them to die and live again in that moment when they are transported aloft through the air. For the words: “And so we shall always be with the Lord,” are not to be understood as meaning that we are to remain forever in the air with the Lord; for he himself will certainly not linger there, but only come and pass through. We shall go to meet him as he comes but does not linger; but “so we shall be with the Lord” in the sense that, being possessed of everlasting bodies, we shall be with him wherever he is. And that we must take the words of the Apostle in this sense, as meaning that we are to suppose that those whom the Lord shall find alive
