<span class="label"><span class="italic">Against those who maintain that earthly bodies cannot become imperishable and eternal.</span></span>
<p><span class="sc">These</span> philosophers also argue that earthly bodies cannot be everlasting, although they do not doubt that the entire earth itself constitutes a central and everlasting member of their god; by god they mean not the supreme God, but the great god that this whole universe is to them.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_193_1" id="target_note_LCL414_193_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Well then, the supreme God created for them what they regard as another god, that is, this universe, with precedence over the other deities that are below him. Moreover, they think that this god is animate, possessing, that is, a soul which is, so they say, rational or intelligent and shut up within that massive body.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_193_2" id="target_note_LCL414_193_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Further, according to them, God established the four elements like physical members of that same body, placed and arranged in their proper places; and to secure this great god of theirs from ever dying they would have it that the union of these elements is indissoluble and everlasting.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_193_3" id="target_note_LCL414_193_3"><sup>3</sup></a> Granted all this, what reason is there, if the earth or central member, as it were, in the body of the larger animate being is eternal, why the bodies of other animate beings belonging to earth cannot be eternal if God were to will this as well as that?</p>
<p>Their contention is that earth, the source of the earthly bodies of living things, must be returned to earth; this, they say, is why these bodies must break up and perish and thus be restored to the steadfast and eternal earth from which they were derived.
