rereading the passage if he happens to have forgotten it. In fact I selected the Platonists, who are justly the most renowned of all philosophers, because they had the good sense to see that the soul of man, though it is immortal and rational or intellectual, yet cannot be blessed unless it partakes of the light shed by God, who created the soul itself and the Universe. Consequently they assert that no man will obtain what all men eagerly desire, namely, a blessed life, who has not clung with the purity of a chaste love to the one supreme good, which is the unchangeable God.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, whether they too surrendered to the foolish and mistaken popular notions or whether, as the Apostle says, “they became futile in their thinking,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_249_1" id="target_note_LCL413_249_1"><sup>1</sup></a> they also believed, or chose to have it believed, that many gods should be worshipped, so that some of them considered it a duty to pay divine honours of worship and sacrifice even to demons. To these I have already in large part replied. What I have to do now, as God grants me power, is to consider and discuss the immortal and blessed creatures who are established in heavenly thrones and dominions, principalities and powers,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_249_2" id="target_note_LCL413_249_2"><sup>2</sup></a> whom the Platonists call gods and to some of whom they give the name either of good demons, or, as we do, of angels. What are we to believe that they require of us in order to maintain the laws of religious duty and respect? In plainer terms, is it their will that we should offer worship and sacrifices to them too and consecrate some of our possessions or ourselves by religious rites to them or only to their God, who is also ours?</p>
