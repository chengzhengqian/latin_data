was instituted at this time, when a son was promised from Sarah. And the fact that he orders not only all the sons but also the home-born and purchased slaves to be circumcised, testifies that this grace is given to all men. For what else does circumcision signify but the renewal of nature by the sloughing off of old age? And what else does the eighth day signify but Christ, who at the end of the seven-day period, that is, after the sabbath, rose from the dead? Then too the names of the parents are changed; every detail rings with novelty, and the new covenant is foreshadowed in the old.

For indeed the Greek equivalent of <span class="italic">saeculum</span> is <span class="italic">aiōn.</span>
