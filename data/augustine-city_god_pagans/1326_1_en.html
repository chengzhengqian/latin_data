will give peace in this place” than “I will give peace in the place which this place signifies.”</p>
<p>For all symbolic things seem somehow to play the part of the things that they symbolize; thus it is said by the Apostle: “The rock was Christ,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL416_59_1" id="target_note_LCL416_59_1"><sup>1</sup></a> since the rock of which this was said certainly symbolized Christ. And so the glory of this house, the new covenant, is greater than that of the former house, the old covenant, and will appear yet greater when it shall be dedicated. “For then shall come he whom all peoples desire,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL416_59_2" id="target_note_LCL416_59_2"><sup>2</sup></a> as the Hebrew reads. For his first coming was not yet desired by all peoples; for they knew nothing of him whom it was their destiny to desire, for they had not yet believed on him. Then, too, according to the seventy translators (whose meaning is also prophetic), “shall come the elect of the Lord from all peoples.” For then indeed there shall come only the elect, about whom the Apostle says: “Even as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL416_59_3" id="target_note_LCL416_59_3"><sup>3</sup></a> The master builder himself, who said: “Many are called, but few are chosen,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL416_59_4" id="target_note_LCL416_59_4"><sup>4</sup></a> will show us a house, constructed not of those who were called but came in such fashion that they were cast out of the feast,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL416_59_5" id="target_note_LCL416_59_5"><sup>5</sup></a> but of such as are chosen,—a house that need fear thenceforth no downfall. Now of course, as long as the churches are also made up of those who are to be sorted out as if by a winnowing fan on a threshing floor, the glory of this house does not yet appear so great as it will when every one who is there is one who will be there forever.</p>
