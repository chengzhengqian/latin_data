<p>I would not maintain that the rites of those mysteries are more lewd than the theatrical performances. I do maintain—and history refutes anyone who would deny it—that those same games in which the fictions of the poets rule were not introduced by the Romans into the festivals of their gods through ignorant devotion. No, the gods themselves brought it about by sharp commands and by putting men on the rack, as it were, that the shows should be exhibited ceremonially and dedicated to their honour. I touched upon this point briefly in my first book. It was when a pestilence was growing worse that the stage performances were originally established at Rome through the instigation of the pontiffs.</p>
<p>Who, therefore, would not suppose that in the life he led he ought rather to follow the example set in plays inaugurated by divine initiative, rather than the prescription of laws promulgated by human wisdom? If the poets were untrustworthy when they presented Jupiter as an adulterer, in any case chaste gods ought to have shown their anger and avenged themselves for the production on the stage of so great a crime against religion—not for the failure to produce it.</p>
<p>Of these plays the more tolerable are comedies and tragedies, that is, dramas composed by poets for presentation on the stage, which, though the stories contain many disgraceful items, are not, at least, like many other shows, expressed in obscene language. They are even included in the curriculum of what is termed a select and liberal education, and boys are forced by their elders to read and learn them.</p>
