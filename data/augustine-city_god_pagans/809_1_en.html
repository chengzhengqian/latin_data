as Jacob with the variegated rods caused flocks of varied colours to be born,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_123_1" id="target_note_LCL414_123_1"><sup>1</sup></a> yet she no more made the natural being that is born than she made herself.</p>
<p>Therefore, so far as creation is concerned, neither the material nor the seminal causes that are brought into play for the generation of things make any difference, whether there is action of angels or human beings or any kind of animal or mingling of male and female; nor does it matter whether any desires or emotions of the mother act to impart something in the way of features or colours to the tender and impressionable foetus. For the natural beings themselves, though they may be affected one way or another after their kind, are made by the supreme God alone. His hidden power, pervading all things with its undefilable presence, gives being to every thing that exists on every level, in so far as it has being; for, were it not for his action, a thing would not only not be like this or like that, but it could not be at all.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_123_2" id="target_note_LCL414_123_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>So then, to return to that form which artisans impose from without on physical objects, we say that the cities of Rome and Alexandria had as their founders not the carpenters and the architects but the kings, Romulus and Alexander, respectively, by whose will, plan and power they were built. Now, if this be so, all the more ought we to call none but God alone creator of natural beings, for he makes nothing out of material that he himself has not made nor has he any workmen whom he himself has not created. And if he were to take away his constructive energy, so to speak, from objects, they will no more be than they were before they were created.
