Do the dreams of Titus Tatius or Romulus or Tullius Hostilius seem to you nearer the truth? Tatius made a goddess of Cluacina, Romulus made gods of Picus and Tiberinus, while Hostilius consecrated Pavor and Pallor, the basest affections of men. One of these is mental, the emotion of a frightened mind, the other is physical, not even a disease, but only a colour.

So great is the frenzy of a disordered and unsettled mind that means are used to placate the gods that have never been employed even by the most horrible men whose cruelty is recorded in myth and legend.
