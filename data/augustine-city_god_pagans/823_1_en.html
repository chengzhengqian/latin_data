not loved enough for delight in it to be victorious over desire to sin. And there is no help but the grace of God to ensure our love of true righteousness and our delight in it.</p>
<p>To prevent law, however, from being thought an evil because it was called the power of sin, the Apostle, considering a similar problem in another connexion, said: “And so the law is holy, and the commandment is holy and just and good. Did that which is good then bring death to me? By no means! It was sin, working death in me through that which is good, in order that sin might be shown to be sin and through the commandment sinner or sin might go beyond measure.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_151_1" id="target_note_LCL414_151_1"><sup>1</sup></a> He said ‘beyond measure’ because there is a further transgression when the lust to sin is increased and the very law is despised as well.</p>
<p>Why did I think this worth mentioning here? It was, in fact, because, just as the law is not an evil though it increases the evil desire of sinners, so neither is death a good though it increases the glory of sufferers, when either the law is abandoned for the sake of unrighteousness and so creates transgressors, or death is undergone for the sake of truth and so creates martyrs. And whereas the law is good because it is the prohibition of sin, death is evil because it is the wage of sin.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_151_2" id="target_note_LCL414_151_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Even as unrighteousness, however, makes evil use not only of evil things but also of good things, so righteousness makes good use not only of good things but also of evil things. And so it happens that evil men make evil use of the law although the law is a good thing, and that good men die a good death although death is an evil thing.</p>
