after saying: “And your bones shall rise up like grass,” in order to show that it was indeed the resurrection of the good, albeit of the flesh, that he was now calling to mind, he added: “And the hand of the Lord shall be known to his worshippers.” What is this but the hand of one who makes a distinction between his worshippers and those who hold him in contempt? About the latter the context continues: “And he shall threaten the stubborn” (or, as another translator has it, “the unbelievers”). He will not at that time threaten them, but the words now spoken as a warning will then be fulfilled in good earnest. “For behold,” he says, “the Lord shall come as a fire, and his chariot as a whirlwind, to execute vengeance with indignation and devastation with a flame of fire.
