Why did he make it?” The answer, that is, is discovered to be that it was the Father of the Word who said: “Let it be made,” and that what was created when he spoke was undoubtedly created through the Word. Again in the statement: “God saw that it was good,” it is made abundantly clear that it was not from any compulsion, nor from the least need of any personal advantage, that God made what was made, but solely from his goodness, that is, he made it because it is good. And it is so described after it was made, in order to show that the thing that was made corresponds exactly to the goodness that was the purpose of its creation.

It is, it sees, it loves; in God’s eternity is its strength, in God’s truth its light, and in God’s goodness is its joy.</p>
