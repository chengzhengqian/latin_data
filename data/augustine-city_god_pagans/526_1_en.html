<p>Hermes goes on to say: “We know how many benefits Isis, the wife of Osiris, bestows on us when she is in kindly mood, and how great are the evils she sends when she is angry.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_137_1" id="target_note_LCL413_137_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Then he shows that to this same class of gods belong the deities whom men make by the art I have described (in showing which he lets it be understood that in his opinion demons had their origin in the souls of the dead and, by the art invented by men who were gravely in error and were unbelievers and irreligious, have been introduced into images, because those who made gods of this kind could not by any means make souls). To demonstrate his point, after speaking about Isis and saying “how great are the evils she sends when she is angry,” which I quoted, he added: “To be sure earthly and material<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_137_2" id="target_note_LCL413_137_2"><sup>2</sup></a> gods get angry easily, made and put together as they are by men out of both kinds of substance.” By “both kinds of substance” he means soul and body, the demon serving as soul and the image as body. “Whence,” he says, “it has come to pass that certain animals, as we know, are officially recognized<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_137_3" id="target_note_LCL413_137_3"><sup>3</sup></a> as sacred by the Egyptians, and that the various cities of Egypt worship the souls of those who, while still living, were consecrated as their gods, honouring them to such an extent that their populations live according to their laws and the cities are known by their names.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_137_4" id="target_note_LCL413_137_4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
