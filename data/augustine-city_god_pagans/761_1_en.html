will. For the bad will that was made by a bad will is not the first bad will; the first is the one that was not made by any will. If there came before it a will to make it what it is, the one that made the other is prior. If I am given the answer that nothing made it and that it therefore always was, I ask whether it existed in some creature. If it did not exist in any creature, it did not exist at all; but if it did exist in some creature, it vitiated that creature and made it deteriorate. It did it hurt and thereby deprived it of good.</p>
<p>And for this reason an evil will could not have existed in an evil creature but was bound to reside in one that was good yet changeableâ€”a creature such as to suffer hurt by this defect. For if no hurt was done, there was no defect whatever, and hence we must say that there was no evil will either. Further, if it did hurt, it did that hurt surely by the subtraction or diminution of a good. Accordingly, an evil will could not have existed from all eternity in a thing in which there was originally some natural good that the evil will could diminish by doing hurt to the thing.</p>
<p>If then the evil will did not exist from all eternity, I want to know who made it. The remaining possibility is to say that this evil will was made by something in which no will existed. My next question is whether this thing is superior or inferior or of equal rank. But if it is superior, then it is certainly better, and in that case how has it no will and not rather a good will? The same argument holds again if it is equal. For as long as two beings are possessed of a will equally good, one does not create an evil will in
