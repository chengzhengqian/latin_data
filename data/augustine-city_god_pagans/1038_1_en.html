<p>Is there anything that hunger would not compel us to eat? Is there anything that God could not make palatable and wholesome? Indeed, he could even have enabled those creatures by his divine power to live without food if their eating were not essential to complete the symbolic representation of so great a mystery. Now no one, except a captious critic, can suppose that such manifold details of actual events do not serve to foreshadow the church symbolically. For nations have already filled the church, and people, clean and unclean, are held together, and will be until the predetermined end is reached, in the frame, as it were, of its unity. Since the prophecy is so perfectly manifest in this case, it is abominable to be doubtful about its other implications, which are put somewhat less clearly and are more difficult to detect.</p>
<p>No person therefore, however stubborn, will venture to suppose that this account was written to no purpose; nor can it be reasonably said that though the events happened, they do not have a symbolic significance, or that we have only symbolic words here without any basis in fact, or that it is not the church to which the symbolism refers. Rather we must believe that the transmission of this account in a written history was a wise action, that the events did take place, that they do have a symbolic significance and that this significance points figuratively to the church.</p>
<p>Now that the present book has reached this juncture, I must bring it to a close in order to investigate next the careers of both cities, that is, of the earthly city that lives according to man and of the heavenly city that lives according to God, during the period after the flood and from that time on in subsequent history.</p>
