what do they accomplish then but futility? I likewise know that, where the will goes bad, there a result is produced which, if there were no will to it, would not happen. And that is why, since the lapses are not inevitable but wilful, the punishment that follows is righteous. The lapse is not to what is bad, but to lapse is bad. In other words, the natural objects to which there is a lapse are not bad, but to lapse is bad because the will lapses against the natural order from what has supreme being to what has less being.</p>
<p>Thus avarice is not a defect of gold but a defect of the man who misguidedly loves gold and so deserts righteousness, which should have been immeasurably preferred to gold. Nor is dissipation a defect of beautiful and delightful bodies but a defect of the soul that misguidedly loves bodily pleasures, disregarding the virtue of moderation, by which we are brought into harmony with things of greater spiritual beauty and more unfading delight. Nor is boastfulness a defect in glory among men but a defect in the soul that misguidedly loves glorification by men while it rejects the witness borne by conscience. Nor, finally, is pride a defect of Him who gives power or even of power itself but a defect of the soul that misguidedly loves its own power while it despises the more righteous power of a higher Power. Hence whoever loves misguidedly the good of any natural being, even if he should obtain it, becomes evil himself through this good as well as wretched by the loss of a higher good.</p>
