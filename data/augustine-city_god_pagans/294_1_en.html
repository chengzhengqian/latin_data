<p><span class="sc">Hence</span> we need not fear that necessity which the Stoics feared so much that they took pains to discriminate among causes by exempting some from the decree of necessity while leaving others subject to it. Under the heading of causes that they would not leave in the realm of necessity they put our acts of will, obviously thinking that they would not be free if they were made subject to necessity. If the term necessity should be used of what is not in our power, but accomplishes its end even against our will, for example, the necessity of death, it is clear that our wills, by which we live rightly or wrongly, are not under such necessity. For we do many things that we certainly should not do if we were unwilling. To this class of things belongs first of all the will itself. If we will, the will exists; if not, it does not. For we should not will if we were unwilling.</p>
<p>But if the term necessity is used in the sense that it is necessary for something to be as it is, or happen as it does, I do not know why we should fear that it may destroy our freedom of will. In fact, we do not make the life of God, or the foreknowledge of God, subject to necessity if we say that it is necessary for God to live forever and to foreknow all things.

Of course he is rightly called omnipotent, although he cannot die or be
