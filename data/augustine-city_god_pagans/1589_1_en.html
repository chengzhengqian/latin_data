establish their own righteousness, and so are not submissive to the righteousness of God,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL417_127_1" id="target_note_LCL417_127_1"><sup>1</sup></a> which is Christ. In this righteousness is found the great sweetness of God, of which it is said in the Psalm: “Taste and see how sweet is the Lord.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL417_127_2" id="target_note_LCL417_127_2"><sup>2</sup></a> And while tasting this sweetness in this pilgrim journey, we are not filled. Rather, we hunger and thirst for it, that we may afterwards be filled, when we shall see him as he is.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL417_127_3" id="target_note_LCL417_127_3"><sup>3</sup></a> Then will be fulfilled the Scripture: “I shall be fully fed when thy glory shall be manifested.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL417_127_4" id="target_note_LCL417_127_4"><sup>4</sup></a> Thus Christ perfects the greatness of his sweetness for those who hope in him. Furthermore, if, as they think, God hides from them who fear him the sweetness by which he will pardon the wicked in order that men who do not know about it may fear condemnation and live rightly, that thus there may be some to pray for the ungodly, then how does he perfect his sweetness for those who hope in him? For, according to their dreams, it is those who do not hope in him that he will pardon. Then that sweetness of his must be the object of our search, that which he perfects for those who hope in him, not that other which he is supposed to perfect for those who scorn and blaspheme him. In vain, therefore, after this body is dead, does man seek what he has failed to provide for himself while living in the body.</p>
<p>Moreover the apostolic saying, “For God has shut up all in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all,” does not mean that he will condemn no one, but its meaning appears in what was said above. For the Apostle was speaking about the Jews who should afterwards believe, to the Gentiles addressed in the letter, who were certainly already believers.
