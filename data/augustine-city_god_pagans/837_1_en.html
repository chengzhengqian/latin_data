<h3>XIII</h3>
<span class="label"><span class="italic">What the first punishment was that the first human beings experienced for their transgression.</span></span>
<p><span class="sc">For</span> after God’s command had been disobeyed, the first human beings, as divine favour departed from them, straightway became ashamed of the nakedness of their bodies. Hence too they used fig leaves, which perhaps were the first things they hit upon in their embarrassment to cover their pudenda, that is, shameful members.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_179_1" id="target_note_LCL414_179_1"><sup>1</sup></a> These had been the same organs before, but had not then been shameful. Thus they experienced an unprecedented movement of their own disobedient flesh as punishment in kind, as it were, for their own disobedience.</p>
<p>The soul, in fact, delighting now in its own freedom to do wickedness and scorning to serve God, was stripped of the former subjection of the body, and because it had wilfully deserted its own higher master, no longer kept its lower servant responsive to its will. It did not maintain its own flesh subject to it in all respects, as it could have done for ever if it had itself remained subject to God. Thus it was that the flesh then began to “lust against the spirit.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_179_2" id="target_note_LCL414_179_2"><sup>2</sup></a> This is our congenital conflict. From the first transgression come the beginning of death in us and the carnal rebellion or even victory that we sustain in our limbs and blighted being.</p>
