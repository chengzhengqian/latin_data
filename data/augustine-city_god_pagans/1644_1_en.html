<p>When a nun on a nearby estate, called Caspaliana, was desperately ill, her tunic was brought to the same shrine, but before it was brought back, she was gone. Her parents, however, covered her body with the tunic, and she recovered her breath and became well.</p>
<p>At Hippo, at the shrine of the same martyr, a Syrian named Bassus was praying for his daughter, who was dangerously ill, and whose garment he had brought with him. Slaves came running from his house to tell him that she was dead, but while he was praying they were intercepted by his friends and forbidden to tell him, lest he begin wailing in public. When he reached home, the house was echoing with the wails of his family, but he threw his daughter’s garment which he was carrying, over her body, and she was restored to life.</p>
<p>Again, it was there in our city that the son of one Irenaeus, a tax-collector, fell sick and died. While the body was lying lifeless and his kindred were in mourning and lamentation and arranging the funeral, while others spoke words of consolation, one of his friends suggested that the body be anointed with oil from the martyr’s shrine. It was done, and the man revived.</p>
<p>Likewise, in our city a former tribune, Eleusinus, had an infant son who grew ill and died. He laid the body on a shrine of the same martyr which was in the suburb where he lived, and after praying with many tears he took him up alive.</p>
