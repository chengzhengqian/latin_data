<span class="label"><span class="italic">What is to be understood by the conformity of the saints to the image of the Son of God.</span></span>
<p><span class="sc">The</span> passage also which says that the elect are conformed to the image of the Son of God can be understood of the inner man. On this point another passage says: “Be not conformed to this world, but be ye reformed in the renewing of your mind.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL417_279_1" id="target_note_LCL417_279_1"><sup>1</sup></a> So where we are reformed in order not to be conformed to this world, there we are conformed to the Son of God. It can also be taken to mean that as he was conformed to us in his mortality, so we should be to him in his immortality, and this belongs to the time of the bodily resurrection. But if by these words we are taught in what form bodies will rise, as in the case of the “measure,” so in this “conformation,” not size, but age, must be understood. And so all will arise with bodies as large as before, or as large as they would have had in full-grown youth. Yet no harm will be done if the form be that of an infant or old man, in a life where no weakness either of mind or body will remain. So if any one maintains that each one will rise with the same size of body with which he died, there is no need of engaging in toilsome controversy with him.</p>
