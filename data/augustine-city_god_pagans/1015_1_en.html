number ten (and hence the designation of the famous decalogue), surely then the number eleven, passing ten as it does, stands for trespassing against the law and consequently for sin. This is why eleven curtains of goats’ hair were ordered to be prepared for the tabernacle of the testimony,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_535_1" id="target_note_LCL414_535_1"><sup>1</sup></a> which served the people of God as a mobile temple on their wandering.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_535_2" id="target_note_LCL414_535_2"><sup>2</sup></a> For the goats’ hair brings sins to mind because the goats are to stand on the left;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_535_3" id="target_note_LCL414_535_3"><sup>3</sup></a> and when we confess a sin, we prostrate ourselves on goats’ hair as if to say in the words of the psalmist: “And my sin is ever before me.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_535_4" id="target_note_LCL414_535_4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
