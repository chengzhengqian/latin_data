<span class="label"><span class="italic">That when the saints undergo the first death in the cause of truth they are thereby freed from the second death.</span></span>
<p><span class="sc">Indeed</span>, a more careful consideration shows that, even when a person dies loyally and gloriously in the cause of truth, death is avoided. For he undergoes some part of it that he may not have the whole come to him, as well as the second, never-ending death besides. He accepts separation of soul from body to prevent separation of God from the soul before separation of soul from body; otherwise, when the first death of the entire man had run its course, it would be followed by the second death, which is eternal.</p>
<p>Therefore death, as I said,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_159_1" id="target_note_LCL414_159_1"><sup>1</sup></a> is not good for anyone at the time when it is experienced by the dying and is causing them to die, but it is borne gloriously in order to keep or to obtain something that is good. But when those who are described as already dead are in the state of death, there is no mistake in saying that it is evil for the evil and good for the good. For the souls of the righteous that are separated from the body are at rest, whereas those of the wicked suffer punishment; and this situation obtains until the bodies of the righteous are resurrected to an eternal life and those of the wicked to an eternal or second death.</p>
