For the words that immediately follow this statement are: “And God formed dust from the earth into man.” This is the text found in the Greek books from which the Bible itself was translated into Latin.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_239_2a" id="target_note_LCL414_239_2a"><sup>2</sup></a> It is immaterial whether you choose to translate the Greek verb <span class="italic">eplasen</span> by <span class="italic">formavit</span> (he formed) or <span class="italic">finxit</span> (he fashioned), though the latter is the more appropriate term.
