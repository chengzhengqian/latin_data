hundred and twenty or somewhat more. But the earliest age at which men had children then is reported to have been a hundred and sixty and above. For no person, it is maintained, can have children at the age of ten, that is, according to the calculation of those people, a hundred. Puberty is developed and capable of procreation in the sixteenth year, which, by ancient reckoning, was called the hundred and sixtieth year.</p>
<p>To lend credibility to the theory that the year was differently calculated in those early times, the proponents of this view add as evidence from the works of a good many historians the fact that the Egyptians had a year of four months,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_473_1" id="target_note_LCL414_473_1"><sup>1</sup></a> the Acarnanians of six months and the Lavinians of thirteen months. Pliny the Elder mentioned<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_473_2" id="target_note_LCL414_473_2"><sup>2</sup></a> that, according to the testimony of written sources, one person lived for a hundred and fifty-two years and another for ten years longer, that some people lived to be two hundred years old and others to be three hundred years old and that some people even attained the age of five hundred, others of six hundred and still others of eight hundred. But, in his judgement, all this was due to ignorance of chronology. For, as he said, “some people counted the summer as one year and the winter as a second year, others counted each of the four seasons as a year, like the Arcadians whose years were three months long.” The Egyptians, he added, whose short years, as I mentioned above, were each four months long, at times even made the end of a year coincide with the waning of the moon.
