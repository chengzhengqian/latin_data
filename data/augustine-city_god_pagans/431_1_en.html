whom they call Dis Pater? Where will his wife Proserpina be? According to another view stated in the same work of Varro’s she is held to be, not the fertility of the earth, but its lowest part. And if they say that a part of the world soul, in permeating the upper part of the earth, constitutes the god Dis Pater, and in permeating the lower part constitutes the goddess Proserpina, then what will Tellus be? For the whole of which she consisted was divided into two parts and into two gods in such a way that no one can find out any third part, Tellus, or any place for her. That is, unless someone says that the two deities Orcus and Proserpina, taken together, constitute the one goddess Tellus. Then there are no longer three, but either one or two. But still they have three names; they are regarded as three and worshipped as three, with their own altars, shrines, rituals, images and priesthoods, and hence their own deceiving demons to debauch the prostituted soul.</p>
<p>Again let them answer: What part of the earth is permeated by a part of the world soul to make the god Tellumo? None, Varro says, but one and the same earth has a double faculty, the male power to produce seeds and the female power to receive and nourish them. Hence from the female power she is called Tellus and from the male Tellumo. Then why did the pontiffs, as Varro relates, add two more, and offer sacrifice to four gods: Tellus, Tellumo, Altor and Rusor?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL412_457_1a" id="target_note_LCL412_457_1a"><sup>1</sup></a> Enough has already been said

It has been argued (St. Weinstock, in <span class="italic">RE</span> 5A.1, 791–806) that Tellus and her male counterpart Tellumo were primitive Roman deities of vegetation, whose connection with Mother Earth was late and due to Greek influence. In any event, her connection with Ceres goes back to very early times, and Greek conceptions of both must have prevailed from the time when Ceres was equated with Demeter (493 <span class="sc">b.c.</span>). Altor and Rusor appear to be pontifical inventions; as against Varro, Weinstock takes the original meanings to be “Feeder” and “Ploughman.” Compare Rose on “Tellus” in <span class="italic">OCD.</span></a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL412_457_1a').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
