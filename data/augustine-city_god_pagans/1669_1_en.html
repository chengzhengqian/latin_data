From him the body derives its increase, so as to build itself up in love.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL417_287_1" id="target_note_LCL417_287_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Here is described the perfect man—the Head and the body which consists of all the members whose number will be made up at the proper time. Now, however, members are daily being added to that body. Thus the Church is being built, to which the Scripture says: “But ye are the body and members of Christ,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL417_287_2" id="target_note_LCL417_287_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and in another passage: “For his body, which is the church,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL417_287_3" id="target_note_LCL417_287_3"><sup>3</sup></a> and again likewise: “We, being many, are one bread, one body.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL417_287_4" id="target_note_LCL417_287_4"><sup>4</sup></a> Concerning the building of this body the passage we have quoted also says: “In order to perfect the saints for the work of ministering and for building up the body of Christ.” Then follow the words we are discussing: “Until we all attain to the unity of the faith and the full knowledge of the Son of God, to mature manhood, to the measure of the age of the fullness of Christ,” and so on, till he shows to what body the measure belongs by saying: “We must grow up in every way in him who is the head, Christ. On him the whole body depends, being connected and united by each contact with his bounty, as each part is active in due measure.” Hence, just as there is a due measure of each part, so there is surely a measure of the fullness of the whole body, which consists of all its members, and of this it is said, “to the measure of the age of the fullness of Christ.” This fullness is mentioned also in the place where he says of Christ: “And him he gave as head over all things to the church, which is his body, the fullness of him who fills all in all.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL417_287_5a" id="target_note_LCL417_287_5a"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
