according to the Apostle there are men who preach Christ unworthily. But “whether in pretence,” he says, “or in truth, Christ is preached.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL415_11_1" id="target_note_LCL415_11_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Christ himself planted the vineyard, of which the prophet says: “The vineyard of the Lord of hosts is the house of Israel.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL415_11_2" id="target_note_LCL415_11_2"><sup>2</sup></a> He also drinks of its wine, by which we may perhaps understand that cup of which he says: “Are you able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of?”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL415_11_3" id="target_note_LCL415_11_3"><sup>3</sup></a> And again: “Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL415_11_4" id="target_note_LCL415_11_4"><sup>4</sup></a> By this he doubtless refers to his passion, or, since the wine is the fruit of the vineyard, the following meaning is preferable, that from the vineyard itself, that is, from the race of the Israelites, came the flesh and blood that he assumed for our sakes, in order to undergo his passion. “He was intoxicated,” that is, he suffered. “And he was naked,” for then his weakness was uncovered, that is, it became evident. Of this the Apostle says: “Though he was crucified through weakness.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL415_11_5" id="target_note_LCL415_11_5"><sup>5</sup></a> Wherefore he also says: “The weakness of God is stronger then men, and the foolishness of God is wiser then men.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL415_11_6" id="target_note_LCL415_11_6"><sup>6</sup></a> However, after saying “And he was naked,” the Scripture added the words “in his house,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL415_11_7" id="target_note_LCL415_11_7"><sup>7</sup></a> a neat turn of phrase to indicate that Christ was to endure death on the cross at the hands of people of his own flesh, those of his own household and bloody namely the Jews.</p>
<p>It is only by the outward sound of their voices that wicked men preach the passion of Christ, for they do not understand what they preach. The righteous, on the other hand, possess this great mystery in their inmost being, and inwardly in their hearts
