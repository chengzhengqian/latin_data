For while the prophet did not need his eyes to see one who was absent, he did not therefore cease to use them to see things present. And yet he would have been able to see those things with the spirit even if he had closed his eyes, just as he saw things absent when he himself was not with them. Far be it from us then to say that those saints will not in that life with their eyes closed see God, whom they will always see in spirit.</p>
