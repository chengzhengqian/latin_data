Hence, they say, the explanation that was given for those natural marvels, permitting us to state, “This force is natural, such is the nature of this thing,” cannot be offered in this case, for we know that such is not the nature of human flesh. For this we have indeed an answer, based on our sacred writings. Before the first sin this human flesh was of one kind, a kind that could never suffer death; after the sin it was of another kind, such as we have come to know in the tribulation of this mortal life, a kind that cannot retain life for ever.
