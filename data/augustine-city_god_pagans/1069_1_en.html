that true piety survived only in those generations which were descended from the seed of Shem through the line of Arphaxad, leading down to Abraham. However, by men’s arrogance in building a tower to reach the sky, a symbol of impious self-exaltation, the city or community of the ungodly was revealed. Whether, then, this city had not existed before that time, or had been concealed, or whether instead both cities had existed side by side, the good city surviving of course in the two sons of Noah who were blessed, and in their descendants, and the evil in the son who was cursed, and in his progeny, among whom arose that mighty hunter against the Lord, all this is a difficult problem to solve.</p>
<p>For perhaps, and this is certainly the most tenable theory, there were already among the descendants of Noah’s two good sons men who scorned God even before the founding of Babylon, and likewise worshippers of God among the sons of Ham. In any case we must believe that the world never lacked men of either type. Indeed, when it was said: “All men have gone astray, they are altogether become worthless; there is none that doeth good, no, not one,” in both the psalms where these words are found we also read: “Will none of the doers of iniquity understand, those who devour my people as they eat bread?” The conclusion is that the people of God did exist even at that time. Therefore the words “There is none that doeth good, no, not one,” were said of the sons of men, not of the sons of God. For the preceding line is as follows: “God looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there were any who understood or sought after God.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL415_59_1" id="target_note_LCL415_59_1"><sup>1</sup></a>
