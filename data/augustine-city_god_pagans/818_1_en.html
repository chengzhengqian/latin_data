<span class="label"><span class="italic">Whether death, which by reason of the sin of the first human beings has spread among all human beings, is punishment for sin even in the case of saints.</span></span>
<p><span class="sc">But</span> this raises a question that cannot be ignored, namely, whether, in actual fact, death, by which soul and body are separated, is good for those who are good; because, if this is the case, how shall we maintain that it is also the punishment of sin? For if the first human beings had not sinned, they doubtless would not have suffered this death. How then can it be good for those who are good if it could not happen except to bad men? Conversely, if it could not happen except to bad men, it ought not to be good for the good but non-existent. For how could there be any punishment for those in whom there was nothing to be punished for?</p>
<p>Therefore we must admit that, although the first human beings were indeed so created that they would not have known any kind of death if they had not sinned, yet these same persons, as the first sinners, received punishment by death on such terms that whatever should spring from their stock was also to be held liable to the same penalty; for they were to have no progeny other than that which resembled them. Their punishment, in fact, was commensurate with the enormity of their guilt and effected in their original nature a change for the worse. As a result, what came initially as punishment to the first human beings who sinned also follows as a natural consequence in the rest who are born.</p>
