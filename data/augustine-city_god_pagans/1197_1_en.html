prevented from satisfying this expectation, although I have already done so in the case of one psalm, by the riches rather than by poverty of material. For I am prevented from including everything, by my desire to avoid prolixity, but I fear that, if I select some portions only, I may appear to many who know the material to have omitted parts that are more essential. Then, too, the evidence that is presented must be supported by the context of the entire psalm, at least so far as to show that there is nothing to contradict it in case the whole is not pertinent to its support. Otherwise I fear that I might seem to be gathering individual verses on the topic in hand, in the technique used in centos, when one makes selections from a long poem not written on the same subject, but on another and very different one.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL415_315_1a" id="target_note_LCL415_315_1a"><sup>1</sup></a> Moreover, to be able to show this in every psalm, the whole must be explained, and how great a task this would be is clearly shown, both by the works of other authors and by our own, in which we have carried out this plan.
