For even those who hold that when Scripture says that the good ground bears a plentiful harvest, some thirty-fold, some sixty, some a hundred,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL417_169_1" id="target_note_LCL417_169_1"><sup>1</sup></a> it should be understood to mean that the saints, according to the diversity of their merits free, some thirty men each, some sixty, some a hundred, suppose that this will happen on the day of judgement, not after the judgement. There was a certain man, they say, who saw people perversely promising themselves impunity because of this notion, whereby it seems that in this way all may come to be freed from hell. He made the apt retort, it is said, that it is better to live a good life, whereby a person may be found among those who will intercede for the liberation of others, lest the intercessors be so few that when each has speedily filled out his quota of thirty, sixty or a hundred, many others should be left unable to gain deliverance from punishment by their intercession, and lest among these be found every one who with baseless audacity promises himself the hope of profiting by anotherâ€™s merit.</p>

So now, having completed our reply, we end the book as we promised.</p>
