connection with the Jewish people. For us, to be sure, those suffice which are quoted from the books of our enemies, for we see and know that it is in order to bear this witness,—which they involuntarily supply on our behalf by possessing and preserving these same books,—that they themselves are scattered among all peoples, in whatever direction the church of Christ expands.</p>
<p>For a prophecy about this thing was given in advance, in the Psalms which they, too, read, where it is written: “My God, his mercy shall go before me; my God has shown me concerning my enemies, that you are not to slay them, lest they some day forget your law; scatter them by your might.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL416_51_1" id="target_note_LCL416_51_1"><sup>1</sup></a> So God has shown the church the grace of his mercy in the case of her enemies the Jews, since, as the Apostle says: “Their sin is the salvation of the Gentiles.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL416_51_2" id="target_note_LCL416_51_2"><sup>2</sup></a> For this reason he did not slay them (that is, he did not put an end to their being Jews, although they were conquered and oppressed by the Romans), lest through forgetting the law of God they should bear no effective witness on this point that we are concerned with. So it was not enough for him to say: “You are not to slay them, lest they some day forget your law,” without also adding: “Scatter them.” For if they dwelt with that testimony of their Scriptures in their own land only, and not everywhere, then the church, which is everywhere, could not have them at hand among all the Gentiles as witnesses to those prophecies that were given in advance concerning Christ.</p>
