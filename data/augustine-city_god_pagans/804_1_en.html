<span class="label"><span class="italic">That God foreknew that the first man whom he created would sin, and at the same time foresaw how large a company of righteous men he would translate by his grace from the human race into the society of the angels.</span></span>
<p><span class="sc">God</span> was not unaware that man would sin and that, being already doomed to death, he would propagate mortals destined to die. Further, these mortals, he knew, would go so far in the enormity of their sins that even beasts without a rational will, such as arose in teeming numbers from the waters and the lands, would live more securely and peaceably with their own kind than men, whose race was propagated from one individual for the purpose of inspiring harmony. For never did lions or dragons wage such wars with one another as men have waged.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_113_1" id="target_note_LCL414_113_1"><sup>1</sup></a> But he foresaw also that by his grace a company of righteous men would be called to adoption and that, after they were forgiven their sins and made righteous by the Holy Spirit, they would be united with the holy angels in eternal peace, when the last enemy, death, was destroyed.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_113_2" id="target_note_LCL414_113_2"><sup>2</sup></a> And this company, he knew, would profit by a consideration of the historical fact that God had created the human race out of one man to make it clear to men how pleasing to him is oneness even among many.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_113_3" id="target_note_LCL414_113_3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
