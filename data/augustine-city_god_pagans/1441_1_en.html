all and followed him: “He shall receive in this world one hundredfold,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL416_289_1" id="target_note_LCL416_289_1"><sup>1</sup></a> in explanation of which, as it were, the Apostle speaks of those who “seem to have nothing, yet have all things,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL416_289_2" id="target_note_LCL416_289_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and as even earlier it was said: “The wealth of a believer includes the whole world”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL416_289_3" id="target_note_LCL416_289_3"><sup>3</sup></a>), how much more is a thousand the equivalent of totality, since it is the cube of ten, rather than the square! Wherefore there can be no better understanding of the words of the psalm: “He has been mindful at all times of his covenant, the word that he bestowed on a thousand generations,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL416_289_4" id="target_note_LCL416_289_4"><sup>4</sup></a> than by understanding “a thousand generations” to mean “all generations.”</p>
<p>“And he cast him into the pit,” he says, meaning that he cast into the pit the devil, meaning by the pit the innumerable multitude of the irreligious, whose hearts go deep indeed in malignity against the church of God; not that the devil was not in them before, but he is said to have been cast there because when cut off from believers he gains greater possession of the irreligious. For he is more completely possessed by the devil who not merely is alienated from God but goes out of his way to hate those who serve God. “And he shut him up,” he says, “and put a seal upon him, so that he could no longer seduce the nations until the thousand years should be ended.” “Shut him up,” that is, forbade him to go forth. And the added words, “put a seal upon him,” seem to me to mean that God wished it to be unknown who belonged to the devil’s party and who did not. For in this world this is indeed unknown, since it is uncertain whether he who seems to stand is about to fall, and whether he who seems to lie prone is about to rise again.</p>
