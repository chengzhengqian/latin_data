In those who wish themselves to be regarded as gods by the men whom they serve, or in those who do marvels only to produce faith in God—for Christ also is God? In those who decreed that even their crimes should be their sacred rites, or in those who do not wish even their praiseworthy deeds to be enacted as rites but wish all for which they are rightly praised to contribute to the glory of him in whose name they receive praise? For it is in the Lord’s name that their souls receive honourable mention. Let us therefore put our trust in them, since they have both: words that are true and deeds that are wondrous. For they suffered because they spoke the truth, and so are able to do marvellous deeds. Foremost among those true words is this, that Christ rose from the dead and in his own flesh first displayed the immortality of the resurrection. And he has promised that we shall have such a resurrection at the beginning of the new age, or, if you prefer, at the end of this.</p>
