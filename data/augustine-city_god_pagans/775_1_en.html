<p><span class="sc">When</span> the origin of the world was under consideration,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_55_1" id="target_note_LCL414_55_1"><sup>1</sup></a> I gave an answer to those who refuse to believe, not that the world always existed, but that it had a beginning, even as Plato too very plainly acknowledges,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_55_2" id="target_note_LCL414_55_2"><sup>2</sup></a> although some believe that he held a view opposed to what he states. This same answer I should also give in discussing the original creation of man for the benefit of those who are likewise disturbed by the question why man was not created during the countless and infinite ages past but was created so late that it is less than 6,000 years since he came into existence, according to sacred Scripture.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_55_3" id="target_note_LCL414_55_3"><sup>3</sup></a> If they are bothered by the short lapse of time because they regard the years as so few since man, as we read in our authorities, was created, let them reflect that nothing that has some limit is really long and that all finite measures of ages, if compared with unbounded eternity, must be regarded not merely as minute but as naught. It follows too that, if there were said to be not 5,000 or 6,000 years since God created man but even 60,000 or 600,000, or 60 or 600 or 600,000 times that number, or if this sum were likewise squared again and again until we came to numbers
