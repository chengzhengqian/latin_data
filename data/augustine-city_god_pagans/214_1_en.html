Ninus, king of Assyria, was the first to give up the ancient and ancestral custom of the nations and adopt the novelty of a lust for empire. He was the first to make war on his neighbours, and extended his conquests as far as the borders of Libya, over peoples who till then were inexperienced in the art of self-defence.” And a little later he says: “Ninus reinforced by constant new acquisitions the mighty dominion he had won.

A century later Berossus wrote a history of Babylon in Greek, rejecting the legends of Ninus as spurious. Oldfather (in the Loeb Diodorus,
