wreak their hatred against the city of God. These demons are so tyrannical that they are not content with accepting sacrifice from those who offer it and demanding it from willing worshippers, but they even persecute the unwilling and try to exact it by violence and torture. This power is so far from being destructive to the Church that it is actually found to do her a service, since it adds new martyrs and helps make up their full number;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_345_1" id="target_note_LCL413_345_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and the city of God holds her martyred citizens in greater honour and higher repute in such measure as they fight with fortitude against the sin of denying their religion, even to the shedding of their blood.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_345_2" id="target_note_LCL413_345_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>If the Church’s traditional canon of style permitted such a term, we might more neatly dub them “our heroes.” This name is said to have been derived from Juno, because in Greek Juno is called Hera, and therefore one or another of her sons, according to Greek mythology, was called Heros.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_345_3" id="target_note_LCL413_345_3"><sup>3</sup></a> Now the cryptic meaning of the myth is this. The air (<span class="italic">aer</span>) is counted as Juno’s realm,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_345_4" id="target_note_LCL413_345_4"><sup>4</sup></a> and there, they would have it, the heroes dwell together with the demons. By heroes they mean such souls of the departed as earned distinction to some degree in this life. Our martyrs, in contrast, would receive the appellation heroes—if, as I said, ecclesiastical style admitted this term—not because they and the demons could be members of one community in the air, but because they overcame these same demons, that is to say, powers of the air, and in company with them Juno herself, whatever her particular significance is thought to be. It is not altogether unfitting that the poets depict her as hostile to manly qualities
