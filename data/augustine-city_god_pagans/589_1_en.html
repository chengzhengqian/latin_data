by sins and evil desires, and are consecrated in his name. For he is the fount of our blessedness, he is the goal of all our striving. In electing him, or rather re-electing him, for we had lost him by our neglecting him, in re-electing him then—and this is also said to be the derivation of the word “religion”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_263_1" id="target_note_LCL413_263_1"><sup>1</sup></a>—we make our way towards him through our love, that when we reach him, we may have rest, being blessed because made perfect by him who is our goal. For our good, the supreme good that is the great subject of dispute among philosophers, is nothing but to cling to him, the sole being by whose incorporeal embrace the intellectual soulis, if we may put it so, impregnated and made to give birth to true virtues.</p>
<p>To love this good with all our hearts, with all our souls, and with all our strength, is what we are enjoined to do. Towards this good it is our due to be led by those who love us and our duty to lead those whom we love. In this way those two commandments are fulfilled on which depend all the law and the prophets: “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind” and “You shall love your neighbour as yourself.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_263_2" id="target_note_LCL413_263_2"><sup>2</sup></a> For in order that man should know what it means to love himself, a goal has been appointed for him, to which he is to direct all his efforts to achieve blessedness; for he who loves himself wants nothing else but to be blessed. Now this goal is to cleave to God.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_263_3" id="target_note_LCL413_263_3"><sup>3</sup></a> So when the man who now knows how to love himself is commanded to love his neighbour as himself, what does this mean but that, as far as he can, he is to exhort his neighbour to love God.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_263_4" id="target_note_LCL413_263_4"><sup>4</sup></a> This is the worship of God, this is true
