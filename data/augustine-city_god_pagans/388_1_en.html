<h3><span class="ac">Preface</span></h3>
<p>Now as I attempt more studiously still to uproot and destroy the old depraved notions, hostile to true piety, which a long-standing error has fixed deeply and tenaciously in the dark places of the heart, and as I co-operate, to the best of my small ability, with the grace of him, the true God, who is able to accomplish this task, while I hope to enjoy his help, readers with quicker and better perceptions who find the preceding books sufficient, and more than sufficient, for the purpose, must bear with me patiently and calmly and, for the sake of others, not regard as superfluous a discussion of which they no longer feel the need themselves. It is a matter of very great importance when we proclaim that the true and truly holy deity, though he provides the helps we need to sustain even this frail life that we now live, should nevertheless not be sought out and worshipped for the sake of the passing vapour of mortal life, but for the sake of the truly happy life, which must be eternal life.</p>
