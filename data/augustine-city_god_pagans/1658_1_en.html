are linked by the two in the middle, air and water, and fire occupies its place in the highest heaven, while earth has its place in the lowest foundation of the world, so to speak, why is fire itself on the earth? For, according to this reasoning, the two elements of earth and fire should be in their proper places, the highest and the lowest. Thus, just as they argue that what belongs to the lowest element cannot be in the highest, so neither should that which belongs to the highest be in the lowest place. That is, just as they think that there is not and never will be any particle of earth in heaven, so we should have found no particle of fire on earth. But in fact fire is not only on the earth but even under the earth, so that the mountain peaks belch it forth. Moreover, we see that there is fire on earth when men make use of it, and that it comes from earth, since it is engendered both from sticks and stones, which are undoubtedly earthly bodies. But the heavenly fire, they say, is calm, pure, harmless and eternal, while this other is disordered, reeking, perishable and destructive. However, it does not destroy the mountains and caverns of earth in which it seethes continually. But granting that this fire below is unlike the other, so that it is suited to our dwelling-places on earth, why will they not allow us to believe that the substance of corporeal bodies will some day be made incorruptible and suited to heaven, just as now the corruptible fire is suited to this earth? From the comparative weight and order of the elements, therefore, they adduce no argument to prevent the almighty God from making our bodies such that they can dwell in heaven also.</p>
