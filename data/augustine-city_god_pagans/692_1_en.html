<p>The soul itself, too, even if it be wise without end, as it will be when it is redeemed for eternity, will, for all that, be wise because it participates in unchangeable wisdom, which is not the same thing as the soul itself. For even if the air is never bereft of the light that suffuses it, this does not mean that the air is not one thing and the light that illumines it something different. Nor do I mean by this that the soul is air, as some have thought who could not conceive of an incorporeal nature.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_469_1" id="target_note_LCL413_469_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Yet great as is their disparity, the two things, soul and air, have a certain similarity, enough to let us say without impropriety that the incorporeal soul is illumined by the incorporeal light of the simple wisdom of God, just as the corporeal air is illumined by corporeal light.
