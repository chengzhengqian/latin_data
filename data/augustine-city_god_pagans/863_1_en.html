made into a living soul.” Accordingly, the Apostle intended us to understand that the animal body of man was implied in the scriptural words: “The first man was made into a living soul.”</p>
<p>On the other hand, to indicate how we are to understand the term ‘spiritual,’ he added: “The last Adam was made into a life-giving spirit.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_231_1" id="target_note_LCL414_231_1"><sup>1</sup></a> With these words he doubtless referred to Christ, who had already risen from the dead so as to be thereafter wholly immune to death.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_231_2" id="target_note_LCL414_231_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Then he follows this up, saying: “But the spiritual does not come first; rather the animal, and later the spiritual.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_231_3" id="target_note_LCL414_231_3"><sup>3</sup></a> Here he has far more openly revealed that he meant us to understand an animal body where Scripture says that the first man was made into a living soul, and a spiritual body where he says: “The last Adam was made into a life-giving spirit.”</p>
<p>For first is the animal body, such as the first Adam had, though that would never have died, had he not sinned. Such too is the body that we now have, with its nature as much changed and decayed in our case as it was in Adam’s after he sinned, whereby he was from then on doomed to die. Christ also deigned to assume originally such a body on our behalf, not indeed because he was obliged, but because he was able. But hereafter there will be a spiritual body, such as has already gone before us in the person of Christ as our head. This same kind of body will come later in the case of those who are his members at the final resurrection of the dead.</p>
