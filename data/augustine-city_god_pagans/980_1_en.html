Noah he is six years younger in the Hebrew version than in our own; but after the birth of this son he lived thirty years longer by the former account than by the latter. If those six years are subtracted from the thirty, the difference is the above-mentioned twenty-four.</p>

<p><span class="sc">This</span> discrepancy between the Hebrew text and our own gives rise to that very celebrated problem<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_465_1" id="target_note_LCL414_465_1"><sup>1</sup></a> concerning the fourteen years that Methuselah, according to our calculation, lived after the flood. For Scripture relates that of all those who were then on earth only eight people escaped destruction by the flood in an ark, and Methuselah was not among them. According to our text, Methuselah was a hundred and sixty-seven years old before the birth of the son whom he called Lamech;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_465_2" id="target_note_LCL414_465_2"><sup>2</sup></a> then Lamech himself was a hundred and eighty-eight years old before he became the father of Noah,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_465_3" id="target_note_LCL414_465_3"><sup>3</sup></a>and these two ages combined come to three hundred and fifty-five years. If we add to this sum the six hundred years of Noahâ€™s age at the time of the flood,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_465_4" id="target_note_LCL414_465_4"><sup>4</sup></a> the total becomes nine hundred and fifty-five,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_465_5" id="target_note_LCL414_465_5"><sup>5</sup></a> and this is the number of years that elapsed from the birth of Methuselah to the year of the flood.</p>
