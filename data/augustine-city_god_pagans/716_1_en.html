more surprised than I can say that a man so erudite and so well versed in ecclesiastical literature should have failed to notice, first how far his view conflicted with the purport of our Scriptural passage, whose authority is so high. When after its description of all the works of God the sentence was added in each case: “And God saw that it was good,” and after the whole account was complete, the words were brought in: “And God saw everything that he made, and behold, it was very good,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_517_1" id="target_note_LCL413_517_1"><sup>1</sup></a> we were meant to understand that the world was created solely for the purpose of providing for the creation of good things by a good God.</p>

And, though sin came in, it does not follow that the whole universe is filled with sin on that account, for the far greater number, who are good, among the heavenly angels keep to the right pattern with which they were created. Nor did the evil will, evil because it did not choose to keep the right pattern of its nature, thereby escape the laws of a just God who orders all things well. For a beautiful picture is improved by dark colours if they are fitly placed, and just so the universe of real things, if it could be so contemplated, is beautiful, sinners and all. To be sure, if you consider sinners as they are in themselves, their ugliness is a disfiguring blemish.</p>
