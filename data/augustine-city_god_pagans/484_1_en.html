translated into Greek, the language in which he was competent. Unless perhaps, because he was an eager student, he studied them by means of an interpreter, as he did Egyptian books, not with a view to writing a scriptural translation—this privilege, we are told, Ptolemy obtained only in return for a great exercise of kindness<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_53_1" id="target_note_LCL413_53_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and because he also could inspire awe by virtue of his royal power—,but in order to assimilate as much as he could understand by discussing their content.</p>
<p>Certain indications seem to support this supposition. For example, the book of Genesis begins with the words: “In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. And the earth was invisible and without form, and darkness was over the abyss, and the spirit of God moved over the waters.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_53_2" id="target_note_LCL413_53_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Moreover, in the <span class="italic">Timaeus</span>, his treatise on the formation of the universe, Plato says that God in this operation first united earth and fire.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_53_3" id="target_note_LCL413_53_3"><sup>3</sup></a> But it is clear that he assigns to fire the region of heaven. So this opinion bears a certain resemblance to the statement: “In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.” Next Plato speaks of the two elements, water and air, which by their intermediate position form a bond between the two extremes.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_53_4" id="target_note_LCL413_53_4"><sup>4</sup></a> This prompts the thought that he so understood the scriptural words: “The spirit of God moved over the waters.” I mean that he did not note accurately what term Scripture usually employs for the Spirit of God and, because air too is called spirit, it may be thought that he supposed that the four elements are mentioned in this text.
