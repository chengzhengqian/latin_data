individual verses was so contrived that they formed an acrostic of these words: <span class="italic">Iesous Chreistos Theou Uios Soter,</span> which, translated into Latin, means ‘Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the Saviour.’ Now these verses, whose initial letters convey the meaning that we have just given, are as follows in the translation that a certain man has made in good Latin verses with sound metre:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">In sign of judgment shall the earth with sweat be drenched.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Eternally to reign a king from heaven shall come,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Sit here, to wit, to judge all flesh, to judge the world.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Our God shall unbelievers and believers see</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Uplifted with the saints, as ends the present age.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">So souls embodied shall before his judgement stand;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">CHaotic now, untilled the world in thickets dense doth lie.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Rejected images and all men’s gauds shall be,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Each land and all the sea and sky with fire shall blaze,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">In searching to destroy the gates of loathsome hell.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Salvation’s light shall set saints’ bodies free,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Though wicked souls shall burn in everlasting flame.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Obscurest acts revealing, each shall his secrets tell.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Soon too shall God unlock men’s bosoms to the light.</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
