which they died, but by a miracle of God will receive in a moment the form which would have accrued to them at a later time? For in the saying of the Lord: “A hair of your head will not perish,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL417_275_1" id="target_note_LCL417_275_1"><sup>1</sup></a> it is stated that nothing which once was will be lacking, but it is not denied that there may be something more which once was lacking. But the dead infant lacked the full growth of his body. Though a perfect infant he certainly lacks the perfection of bodily size, beyond which, when it has accrued, his stature can no longer increase. All men have this limit of perfection; they are conceived and born with it, but they have it in design, not in actual mass, just as all the members already potentially exist in the seed, and even after birth some things are still lacking, such as teeth and the like. In this design which is impressed on the corporeal substance of each one the parts which as yet do not exist, or rather, are not seen, seem already somehow threaded in, if I may speak so, and with the passage of time they will come into being, or rather, into view. So by this design the infant who is going to be short or tall is already short or tall. In accordance with this design we assuredly do not fear any diminution of the body in the resurrection. For even if the equality of all required all to reach gigantic size, so that those who were very large need lose nothing in stature and thus belie the saying of Christ that not even a hair of the head would perish, how could the Creator who made all things from nothing lack material to add whatever as marvellous designer he knows should be added?</p>
