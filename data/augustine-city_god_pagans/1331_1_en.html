<p>Thus the devil, the prince of the impious city, in setting in motion his own vessels against the city of God which is a pilgrim in this world, is permitted to do her no harm. Beyond doubt the divine providence provides means to comfort her by prosperity, lest she be broken by adversity, and means to train her by adversity, lest she be spoiled by prosperity, and so tempers the one by the other that we recognize that this is the very source of the words of the psalm: “According to the multitude of my sorrows in my heart thy consolations have made glad my soul,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL416_69_1" id="target_note_LCL416_69_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and likewise the saying of the Apostle: “Rejoicing in hope, patient in tribulation.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL416_69_2" id="target_note_LCL416_69_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>For it must not be supposed that another saying of the same teacher can fail at any time: “All who desire to live a godly life in Christ suffer persecution.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL416_69_3" id="target_note_LCL416_69_3"><sup>3</sup></a> Because even though those who are without do not rage, and there seems to be, and really is, tranquillity, which is a very great source of consolation, especially to the weak, nevertheless there are some, nay many, within, who by their abandoned behaviour torment the minds of those who live a godly life. For they are the cause of railing against the Christian and catholic name; and the dearer this name is to those who wish to live a godly life in Christ, the more they grieve that evildoers within the church make it less attractive than the minds of the godly desire. The heretics themselves, too, since they are thought to have the Christian name and sacraments and scriptures and creed, cause great sorrow in the hearts of the godly; for many who wish to become Christians are compelled by their dissensions to hesitate, and many revilers find among them something from which to create railing charges
