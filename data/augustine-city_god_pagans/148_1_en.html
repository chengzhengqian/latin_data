Afterwards, when they had dispelled the menace by their valour, they went to the aid of friends and allies, and found friends more by conferring than by receiving benefits.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL411_297_1" id="target_note_LCL411_297_1"><sup>1</sup></a> In this way Rome grew by honourable means.</p>
<p>What about Numa’s reign, then? Was the long peace maintained despite the inroads and attacks of wicked men, or was the continuance of peace due to the non-occurrence of such things? For if Rome was at that time also harassed by wars, yet did not meet force with force of arms, then the means she used to hold her enemies in check, though they were unconquered in battle and undeterred by any warlike move, might always have been used; and thus Rome might have remained at peace for ever and Janus’ gates for ever have been closed. If this was not in Rome’s power, she therefore enjoyed peace, not at the pleasure of the gods, but at the pleasure of her neighbours on every side and only so long as they did not attack—unless your gods are to be so bold as to put up for sale to one man the decision to do or not to do of another man. There are occasions, to be sure, when the demons, to the extent that they are permitted, may move by fear or excitement such hearts as already have some weakness of their own. But if they always had the power to do so, and if other action were not frequently taken by a less obvious and higher power in opposition to their effort, they would always have peace and victory in war at their discretion, since these almost always come about by motivation of men’s minds. Generally, however, peace and victory come about against the will of the gods; it is not only the myths, largely fictitious as they are, containing as they do hardly any truth
