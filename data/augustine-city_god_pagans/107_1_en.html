let lavish banquets be largely attended where for anyone who has the desire and the power there may be by day and by night indulgence in sport, drinking, vomiting, dissipation. Let the noise of dancing everywhere be heard, let the theatres erupt in cries of indecent merriment and with every kind of utterly cruel and utterly degraded pleasure. Let him be regarded as an enemy of the people who frowns on such bliss; whoever would try to change it or do away with it, let the mob unrestrained deny him a hearing, toss him from the seats, remove him from the living. Let those be considered true gods who saw to it that the people should win the occasion of such bliss and preserved it when won. Let them be worshipped as they choose, let them demand whatever games they choose, let them hold them in the company or at the expense of their worshippers. Only let them see to it that such a state of happiness be not endangered by an enemy, by a plague, by any disaster.”</p>

Had these men a king of this type, who was not only self-indulgent in such matters, but in no serious way opposed the indulgence of anyone else in them, they would consecrate a temple and a flamen to him with more alacrity than the ancient Romans showed in the case of Romulus.</p>
