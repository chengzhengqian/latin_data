generation from Adam, since the apostle Jude says this in a canonical letter.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_559_1" id="target_note_LCL414_559_1"><sup>1</sup></a> But these writings are with good reason not included in the canon of Scripture which was carefully kept in the temple of the Hebrew people by a succession of priests. For they were judged of dubious authenticity because of their age. It was also impossible to ascertain whether they were what Enoch had written since they were not presented by men who were found to have kept them with proper ceremony through successive generations. Hence discerning authorities are right in their judgement that the writings presented under Enoch’s name with those tales about giants not having human fathers should not be attributed to him. In like manner, many writings are presented by heretics under the names of other prophets or, if they are later, under the names of the apostles, but all these too have been excluded after careful examination from canonical authority and go under the name of apocrypha.</p>
<p>Therefore, according to the Hebrew and Christian canonical writings, there is no doubt that there were many giants before the flood and that these were citizens of the earth-born society of men; there is also no doubt that the sons of God, who descended from Seth according to the flesh, sank to the level of this society after forsaking righteousness. And it is not surprising that their offspring could be giants—not all of them in fact, but there were more giants then than in succeeding eras since the deluge. The Creator saw fit to create them in order to make it known in this way too that the wise man should attach little importance not only to physical beauty
