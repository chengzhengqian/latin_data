And do the gods hear both sides and recognize both sides, and yet not only fail to exclude from their presence these malign demons whose desires and actions are in direct contradiction to the dignity of the gods and the religious feeling of Plato, but actually use those evil neighbours to convey their gifts to the good Plato who is far away from them?
