<span class="label"><span class="italic">On the longevity of men before the flood and on the larger stature of human bodies.</span></span>
<p><span class="sc">Hence</span> no intelligent judge could doubt that it was possible for Cain to found not only a city of some sort but even a large one, since the lives of mortals were prolonged for so great a span.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_457_1" id="target_note_LCL414_457_1"><sup>1</sup></a> But some unbeliever might perhaps dispute with us the many centuries that, as we read in our authorities, the men of that age lived, and might argue that this is incredible. In the same way some people refuse to believe that men’s bodies were of much larger size then than they are now. It was this point that prompted their most distinguished poet Virgil to say of an enormous boundary-stone that a brave warrior of those early times caught up and, as he ran, swung around and hurled:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">Scarce could that stone twice six picked men</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">upraise</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
