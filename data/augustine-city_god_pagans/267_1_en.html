victory, yet they regarded victory not as a goddess, but as the gift of their God. Their crops that they had without Segetia, their oxen without Bubona, honey without Mellona, fruits without Pomona, in short, absolutely all the blessings for which the Romans thought they must pray to the vast throng of false gods, these they received much more happily from the one true God.</p>
<p>And if they had not sinned against him, led astray by unholy curiosity as by some magic arts, falling away to worship idols and finally murdering the Christ, they would have remained in the same kingdom, and if it did not grow in size, it would have grown in happiness. As for their present dispersion through almost all the lands and peoples, it is by the providence of the true God, to the end that when the images, altars, groves and temples of the false gods are everywhere overthrown, and the sacrifices forbidden, it may be demonstrated by the Jewish scriptures how this was prophesied long ago. Thus the possibility is avoided that, if read only in our books, the prophecy might be taken for our invention.</p>
<p>Now for more on this subject my readers must turn to the next book, for a limit must be set to the undue length of this one.</p>
