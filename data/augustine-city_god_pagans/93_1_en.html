The Greeks think they are right in honouring the players because they worship the gods who demand the plays; the Romans, however, do not permit the players to besmirch even their plebeian tribe, much less the Senate House. The nub of the matter may be put in the form of a syllogism. The Greeks lay down the major premise: If such gods must be worshipped, certainly such men should also be honoured. The Romans add the minor: But such men should by no means be honoured. The Christians draw the conclusion: Therefore, such gods are by no means to be worshipped.</p>

How is it that the actors of these poetical fictions and contemptible gods are defamed, while their authors are honoured? Should we, perhaps, rather, give the palm to Plato, the Greek, who, in framing the ideal state, gave his judgement that poets should be banished from the city as enemies of truth? He in truth could not stomach insults offered to the gods, nor would he suffer the minds of the citizens to be tarnished and depraved by poetic fictions.</p>
