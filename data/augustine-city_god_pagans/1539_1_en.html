The passage in Pliny is brief and not very clear. W. H. Jones translates in the Loeb edition (Vol. VIII, 431): “Salt of Agrigentum submits to fire and sputters in water” (<span class="italic">ignium patiens ex aqua exilit</span>). A note suggests that this “salt” was lime, or else there is some early mistake in the manuscripts.

The report of contrasting temperatures by night and by day may easily be exaggerated. The spring in Epirus is in Pliny 2.106.228 and Solinus 7.2, p. 55.

Modern travellers have sometimes identified this “apple” with the <span class="italic">Solanum sodomeum,</span> a shrub with purplish blossoms and bright-yellow berries about the size of a plum. Others choose the <span class="italic">Calotropis procera,</span> called <span class="italic">osher</span> by the Arabs, and found by Edward Robinson growing near the Dead Sea. The trees were ten to fifteen feet high, with smooth yellow fruit the size of a large apple, or orange (see M’Clintock and Strong, <span class="italic">Cyclopedia</span> I (1895), 325 f., with illustrations of the fruit and flowers).</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL417_27_5').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
