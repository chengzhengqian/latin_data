separate the fictions of the poets, which of course belong to the theatre, from the civil theology which they say belongs to the city, as if they were separating unworthy and base things from things honourable and worthy? Consequently we have reason rather to thank the actors who have spared men’s eyes, and have not laid bare in public shows everything that is screened by the walls of the temples.</p>
<p>What good can we think of the rites that are shrouded in darkness, when the things that are brought out to the light are so detestable? To be sure, the rites that are secretly performed by castrated and effeminate men are their own affair; they were, however, quite unable to keep these same men out of sight, men unhappily and shamefully unmanned and depraved. Let them persuade whoever they can that some holy act is performed by the ministry of such men, since they cannot deny that these men are counted as holy and occupied with their holy rites. We do not know what they do, but we do know the men that they use to do it. Moreover, we know what happens on the stage, where no eunuch or effeminate man has ever come on, even as one of a chorus of harlots.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL412_331_1a" id="target_note_LCL412_331_1a"><sup>1</sup></a> And still the plays too are enacted by base and infamous men, for in fact they could not have been presented by men of good standing. What sort of sacred rites, then, are those, for whose performance their holy purity has chosen such men as not even the obscenity of the stage has admitted to its company?</p>

Instead of the regular actresses (<span class="italic">mimae</span>), harlots (<span class="italic">meretrices</span>) were substituted, who would disrobe themselves at the demand of the audience (Wissowa, <span class="italic">RE</span> 6, 2751). The festival became popular in the provinces as well as in Rome (Latte, <span class="italic">Römische Religionsgeschichte,</span> 73). Augustine implies that a similar custom was followed in Carthage in connection with the worship of the Virgo Caelestis (Vol. I, 251 f.).</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL412_331_1a').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
