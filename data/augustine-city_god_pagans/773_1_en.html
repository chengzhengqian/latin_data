empire of the Persians and Macedonians down to the time of Alexander himself, whom he was addressing, though in the records of the Greeks we find that the Macedonian empire down to the death of Alexander covered 485 years,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_51_1" id="target_note_LCL414_51_1"><sup>1</sup></a> while the Persian empire, till the victory of Alexander put an end to it, completed the sum of 233 years.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_51_2" id="target_note_LCL414_51_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Thus we see that the Greek accounts give much smaller figures than the Egyptian accounts, nor could we make the figures equal even if we multiplied by three. For it is reported that the Egyptians had in former times years so short that a year ended every four months, and hence the full and true year, such as both they and we now have in common, covered three of their former years.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_51_3" id="target_note_LCL414_51_3"><sup>3</sup></a> But not even so, as I say, does Greek history agree with Egyptian in chronology. And we have a reason to give credit to Greek history in that it does not exceed the true tale of years that appears in our own truly sacred writings.</p>
<p>Further, if this widely known letter of Alexander disagrees so strikingly in its chronology with acceptable trustworthy history, how much less faith must we put in those other documents which, though they abound in fantastic tales supposedly of ancient times, our foes may have chosen to offer as a counterpoise to the authority of the familiar and divinely inspired books of Scripture, which predicted that the entire world would put faith in them, and in which, as it predicted, the entire world has put faith.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_51_4" id="target_note_LCL414_51_4"><sup>4</sup></a> The truth
