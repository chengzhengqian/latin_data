that these are good demons, not gods established in lofty regions and remote from contact with men. Although the discussion appears to be purely semantic, the name demons is so detestable that we must take all precautions to avoid using it in connection with the holy angels.</p>
<p>The time has come, therefore, to end this book with a statement of our conclusion: we know that the immortal and blessed ones, who, whatever they are to be called, were in any case made and created, are not intermediaries whose purpose is to guide unhappy mortals to eternal bliss. They are separated from mortals by a twofold distinction. On the other hand, those who are in the intermediate position, having immortality in common with those above and misery in common with those below them—and deserving their misery because of the evil in their hearts—have the power rather to grudge than to grant us the bliss that they do not possess. It follows that the friends of the demons can offer us no reason worth our consideration why we should worship them as benefactors; rather we ought to shun them as frauds. Those, moreover, who are good and on that account not only immortal, but also blessed, whom they think it prudent to worship with rites and sacrifices under the name of gods, in order to secure a happy life after death, whatever their character and whatever title they deserve—those beings do not want such religious worship to be offered to any but the one God by whom they were created and by communion with whom they are blessed. With the help of that same God, we shall discuss this point more thoroughly in the next book.</p>
