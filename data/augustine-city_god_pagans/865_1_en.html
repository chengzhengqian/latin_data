<p>The Apostle puts this more plainly in the same letter as follows: “By a man came death and by a man has come also the resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ shall all be made alive”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_235_1" id="target_note_LCL414_235_1"><sup>1</sup></a>—and from that time surely in a spiritual body which will be for a life-giving spirit. Now, it does not follow that all those who die in Adam will be members of Christ, for a far greater number of them will be stricken with the second and everlasting death. Rather, the Apostle used the word ‘all’ in both clauses because, just as no one dies with an animal body except in Adam, so no one is brought to life with a spiritual body except in Christ.</p>
<p>We must therefore by no means think that we shall have at resurrection the sort of body that the first man had before he sinned; neither should we interpret the words: “As was the man of earth, so also are those who are of the earth,” in the light of what happened because sin was committed. For we must not imagine that the first man had a spiritual body before he had sinned and that it was changed into a merely animal one on account of sin. To think thus is to pay too little heed to the words of our great teacher, who says: “If there is an animal body, there is also a spiritual body. Thus too it is written: ‘The first man Adam was made into a living soul.’” This surely did not happen after Adam had sinned since it is the first condition of man, in regard to which the blessed Paul adduced this testimony of the Law<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_235_2" id="target_note_LCL414_235_2"><sup>2</sup></a> to explain what the animal body is.</p>
