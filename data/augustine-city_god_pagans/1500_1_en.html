part of the world in which he said that these same heavens were kept in store, while the higher heavens, in whose firmament the stars are set, are safe and abide in their own perfection. For even the saying of Scripture, that “the stars are to fall from heaven,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL416_407_1" id="target_note_LCL416_407_1"><sup>1</sup></a> apart from the fact that it may with far greater probability be understood in another sense, shows rather that those heavens are to remain, if the stars are really to fall from them. The expression, then, either is figurative, as is more credible, or refers to something that will certainly be more astounding than anything in our day and will take place in this lowest heaven, like that star in Virgil that “coursed, trailing bright light in a tail behind, and hid itself in the wood of Ida.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL416_407_2" id="target_note_LCL416_407_2"><sup>2</sup></a> But what I have quoted from the psalm seems to leave none of the heavens out of the future destruction.

But since, as I have said, they will not deign to approve the view of the apostle
