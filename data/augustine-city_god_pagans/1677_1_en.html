Nay, even if by some dire misfortune or by the savagery of foes the whole should be utterly ground to dust and scattered in the air or water so that, as far as possible, it may be allowed no existence at all, it can by no means be removed from the omnipotence of the Creator. No, not a hair of its head will perish. Hence the spiritual flesh will be subject to spirit, but it will still be flesh, not spirit; just as the carnal spirit was subject to the flesh, but was still spirit, not flesh; Of this we have an example in the deformity of our penal state. For those men to whom the Apostle says: “I could not speak to you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL417_303_1" id="target_note_LCL417_303_1"><sup>1</sup></a> were carnal not in flesh but in spirit. And the man who is called spiritual in this life is still carnal in respect to his body, and sees another law in his members fighting against the law of his mind.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL417_303_2" id="target_note_LCL417_303_2"><sup>2</sup></a> But he will be spiritual in respect to his body as well when the same flesh is raised so as to fulfil the Scripture: “It is sown an animal body, it will rise a spiritual body.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL417_303_3" id="target_note_LCL417_303_3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

Nevertheless, the joy of our hope must be expressed for the glory of God, and from the inmost marrow of burning, holy love come the words: “Lord, I have loved the beauty of Thy house.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL417_303_4" id="target_note_LCL417_303_4"><sup>4</sup></a> Hence, from the gifts which he bestows on the good and the evil in this most troubled life, with his help let us estimate, as best we can, how great is that which we have not yet experienced, and surely are not able worthily to utter. For I will not speak of the time when God made man upright, nor of that
