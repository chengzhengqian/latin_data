<p>Let us, then, not linger here for research into many writers and the weighing of their evidence in the case. Romulus’ brother, all agree, was openly slain, and not by enemies nor by foreigners. Whether Romulus was the agent or the principal only, he was in a truer sense the chief of the Romans than was Paris of the Trojans. Why, then, did that kidnapper of another’s wife provoke against the Trojans the wrath of the gods, while that slayer of his own brother rallied to the Romans the protection of the same gods?</p>
<p>If, on the other hand, that crime did not come home to Romulus either as enacted by him or by his order, since the crime should in any case have been dealt with, the city as a whole committed the murder that as a whole it overlooked, so that this way it slew, not its brother, but its father, which is worse. For each was a founder of the city in which one of the two, removed by a crime, was not allowed to be a ruler. In my opinion, there is no answer to the question what punishment Troy deserved for which the gods abandoned her to destruction, or what reward Rome had earned that the gods should take up their residence to ensure her prosperity, unless we say that being vanquished and having fled from Troy, they resorted to the Romans in order to cheat them as well. Not so, however, for they stayed in Troy too in order to cheat as usual those who should once more inhabit those lands, while here at Rome by even greater exercise of their sophistic arts they have boasted still greater honours.</p>
