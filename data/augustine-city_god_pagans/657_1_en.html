Nor will the soul in truth be happy in a state where, no matter how long it remains in it, it must be fooled if it is to be happy. For it will not be happy unless it be free from anxiety; but to be free from anxiety, it will falsely suppose its happiness to be eternal—falsely,
for the time will also come when it will be wretched. How then can a man rejoice in truth, when the cause of his rejoicing is untruth? Porphyry saw the force of this and to meet it, declared that the purged soul returns to the Father, to escape from being stained ever again by contact with ills and so held down. Certain Platonists, then, were wrong when they accepted as necessary the cycle of continual going and coming from the same to the same. But even if this were true, what would be the advantage of knowing it? Would the Platonists have the effrontery to rate themselves as better than we because we were already in this life ignorant of a fact of which they themselves in another and better life and at the height of purification and wisdom were going to be ignorant, when they were to be kept happy by believing what was not in fact true? And if it is the height of absurdity and folly to say that, Porphyry’s view is surely more acceptable than that of those who conceived of souls as swinging in a circle between alternate joy and misery. If this is so, here we have a Platonist adopting a different view from Plato’s, and a better one. Mark him well. He saw what Plato failed to see. Nor did he, coming after so great, so wise a master, boggle at correcting his error. He loved truth more than the man.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_399_1" id="target_note_LCL413_399_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
