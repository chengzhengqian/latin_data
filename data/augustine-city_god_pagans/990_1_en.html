Now if by a hundred and seventy years the proponent of the short-year theory meant us to understand seventeen for the requisite sexual maturity, there was no need for him either to add or to subtract anything here because he had found an age suitable for the procreation of children. It was this consideration that prompted him to add those hundred years in the other cases where he did not find it. Now we might properly suppose that this matter of twenty years could have been due to an accidental error, were it not for the fact that he took the trouble to restore them, after he had subtracted them, to make the total sum tally. Or are we perhaps to think that this was done for the more subtle purpose of concealing the deliberate practice of first adding and then subtracting a hundred years since something similar was done even where it had not been necessary? In this case it was not a question, to be sure, of a hundred years, but still of a certain number of years which, however small, was first subtracted and then restored.</p>
<p>But it does not really matter what explanation we adopt. For whether or not we believe that it happened as I suggested, or whether, in fine, this is or is not the case, the fact is that when some divergence appears in the two texts, it is impossible for both versions to be true and historically accurate; and I myself should in no way doubt that credence is rightly given rather to the original language from which a rendering was made by translators into
