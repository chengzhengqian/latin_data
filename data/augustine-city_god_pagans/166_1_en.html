<p>For the same Brutus is said also to have been of the blood of Tarquin, but what brought down Collatinus, be it noted, was the resemblance of the name, since he was also called Tarquinius. He should, therefore, have been required to give up his name, not his country. Lastly, his name should have been docked of the term, and he called simply Lucius Collatinus. Why did he not lose what he could have lost with no harm? In order that he might be commanded to enjoy no honour, first consul though he was, and no citizenship, good citizen though he was. Is that to pass for glory, such injustice as Junius Brutus’, execrable and profitless to the state? Did his “love of country and boundless appetite for fame” force him to do even that?</p>
<p>When the tyrant, Tarquin, was in any case already expelled, Lucius Tarquinius Collatinus, husband of Lucretia, was elected consul along with Brutus. How justly the people gave heed to the character of a citizen, not to his name! How wickedly Brutus deprived both of country and office his colleague in the first holding of that new office, when he might have deprived him of his name only, if that gave offence! These evil deeds were done, these untoward events took place, at a time when “equitable and just law prevailed.” Lucretius also, who was elected to replace Brutus, died of disease before the year was out. So Publius Valerius, who succeeded Collatinus, and Marcus Horatius, who filled the vacancy caused by the death of Lucretius, completed that funereal and hellish year which had five consuls, the year in which the Roman republic inaugurated the new office and power of the consulship itself.</p>
