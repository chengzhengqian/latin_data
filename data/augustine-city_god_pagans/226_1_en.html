Under the name of Liber let him preside over the seeds of men, and as Libera over the seeds of women; let him be Diespater to bring the offspring to the light of day, Mena whom they put in charge of the menstrual periods of women, Lucina to be invoked by women in labour; let him bring help to the new-born by receiving them in the lap of earth, under the name of Ops; let him open their mouths to wail and be called the god Vaticanus; let him lift them from the earth and be called the goddess Levana, let him guard cradles and be called Cunina. Let no other than he be present in those goddesses who sing the destiny of children at birth and are called Carmentes; let him preside over chance events and be called Fortune.
