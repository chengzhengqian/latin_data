created.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_455_1" id="target_note_LCL413_455_1"><sup>1</sup></a> The word of his command was not a sound in the ear and transitory, but spiritual and eternal. No, God’s resting signifies the rest of those who rest in God,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_455_2" id="target_note_LCL413_455_2"><sup>2</sup></a> just as the gladness of a house signifies the gladness of those who are glad in the house. This is true even if it is not the house itself but some other thing that makes them glad; how much more is this the case if that same house makes those who live in it glad by its beauty!<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_455_3" id="target_note_LCL413_455_3"><sup>3</sup></a> It is accordingly called glad, not only by the figure of speech whereby we use the container for the contained; we say for example that theatres applaud or meadows low, whereas these are the places where men applaud and cattle low, but also by the figure that puts the cause for the effect. So, for example, we speak of a letter as joyful when we have in mind the joy of those who are made joyful by reading it. Accordingly, it is quite proper that, when the prophetic author<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_455_4" id="target_note_LCL413_455_4"><sup>4</sup></a> reports that God rested, he means by God’s rest the rest of those who rest in God and of whose rest he is the cause. The prophecy is also a promise to mankind, since it is addressed to man and was certainly recorded for his benefit, a promise that men too after the good works that God works in them and through them, if they have beforehand in this life made their way to him, as it were, by the path of faith, will find eternal rest in him. For this rest is also referred to symbolically in the commandment of the law enjoining a rest from labour on the sabbath day among the ancient people of God. This is a matter that I must discuss more thoroughly in its proper place.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_455_5" id="target_note_LCL413_455_5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
