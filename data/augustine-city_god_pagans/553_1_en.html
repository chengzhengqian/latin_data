For, however wicked men may have been, let them but believe that they may become <span class="italic">larvae</span> or <span class="italic">di manes</span>, and they become just so much worse as their interest in doing harm is increased, even to the point where they suppose themselves encouraged to do hurt by the promise of certain sacrifices, divine honours, you might say, after death. This is implied in Apuleius’ statement that <span class="italic">larvae</span> are harmful demons who once were men. But this leads to another question. He furthermore asserts that men who are blessed are called <span class="italic">eudaimones</span> in Greek because they are good souls, that is they are good demons; thus he supports his view that the souls of men are also demons.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_191_2" id="target_note_LCL413_191_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

The Latin terms refer to various categories of disembodied spirits feared or honoured by the Romans. In spite of Apuleius’ subtle distinctions, the Romans frequently confused the character and functions of the several types of beings named. In origin the <span class="italic">Lares</span> were probably farm-land deities who became tutelary spirits of the household. Later they were identified with the protecting souls of deceased ancestors. <span class="italic">Lemures</span> and <span class="italic">larvae</span> were dreadful wandering ghosts of the unquiet dead who haunted the air at night. (But Apuleius actually uses <span class="italic">lemures</span> as a general term for all disembodied souls. Augustine is wrong in asserting that he confines this term exclusively to the evil spirits). In contrast the <span class="italic">di manes</span> were probably the duly honoured dead whom their descendants did not have to fear so long as they honoured them with banquets at the proper festivals.

and Ward Fowler, <span class="italic">Roman Festivals</span>, pp. 107–109.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL413_191_1a').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL413_191_2"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL413_191_2" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">2</sup><span class="italic">De Deo Socratis</span> 14.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL413_191_2').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
