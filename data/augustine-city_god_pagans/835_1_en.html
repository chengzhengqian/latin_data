perfect participles. But if we ask for the past tense of the verb <span class="italic">moritur</span>, the regular answer is <span class="italic">mortuus est</span> (‘he has died’ or ‘he is dead’), the letter <span class="italic">u</span> being doubled. For <span class="italic">mortuus</span> is used in the same way as <span class="italic">fatuus</span> (‘foolish’), <span class="italic">arduus</span> (‘steep’), <span class="italic">conspicuus</span> (‘visible’), and any like words that do not imply past time, but, being adjectives, are declined without distinction of tense. That adjective, moreover, is employed in place of a past participle as if to make a tense where none can be.

There, conversely, men will not be in a state before death or after death but always in death, and for this reason never living, never dead, but endlessly dying. Indeed, man will never be worse off in death than where death itself will be deathless.</p>
