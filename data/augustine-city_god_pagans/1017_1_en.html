<p>The purpose of the insertion of this passage was, I think, to begin the chronological reckoning afresh at this point from Adam himself. The writer of these words chose not to do the same in the case of the earthly city, making it appear as if God gave an account of it without including it in the count. But why, we may ask, does he go back at this point to make the recapitulation after the mention of Seth’s son, a man who hoped to call upon the name of the Lord God?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_539_1" id="target_note_LCL414_539_1"><sup>1</sup></a> It must be that this was the right way to present the two cities, the one by citing a slayer at its beginning and end (for Lamech too confesses to his two wives that he had committed a murder),<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_539_2" id="target_note_LCL414_539_2"><sup>2</sup></a> the other by citing the man who hoped to call upon the name of the Lord God.
