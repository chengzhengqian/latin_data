sacred writings: “The God of gods, the Lord has spoken,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_239_1" id="target_note_LCL413_239_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and in another passage: “Give thanks to the God of gods,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_239_2" id="target_note_LCL413_239_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and again: “A great king above all gods.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_239_3" id="target_note_LCL413_239_3"><sup>3</sup></a> And when it is written: “He is to be feared above all gods,” the meaning is immediately made clear, for the following words are: “For all the gods of the gentiles are demons, but the Lord made the heavens.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_239_4" id="target_note_LCL413_239_4"><sup>4</sup></a> Thus the psalmist said “above all gods,” but added “of the gentiles,” that is those whom the gentiles look upon as gods, but who are demons. As for the phrase “to be feared,” that refers to their fear when they said to the Lord: “Have you come to destroy us?”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_239_5" id="target_note_LCL413_239_5"><sup>5</sup></a> But the expression “God of gods” cannot be understood as meaning god of demons; and as for “a great king above all gods,” far be it from meaning a great king above all demons. Rather the same Scripture speaks also of men who belong to God’s people as “gods.” In the words of the psalmist, “I have said ‘You are gods, sons of the Most High, all of you.’”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_239_6" id="target_note_LCL413_239_6"><sup>6</sup></a> Thus we may understand that he who is called “God of gods” is God of gods in this sense, and that when he is called “a great king above all gods,” it is above gods in this sense that he is a great king.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, when we are asked: “If men are called gods because they belong to the people of God, to whom God speaks through angels or through men, how much more worthy of that name are the immortal beings who enjoy the very happiness that men would fain arrive at by worshipping God,” what are we to reply? Well, we can only say that it is not without reason that in the holy Scriptures men are called gods more explicitly than those who are immortal
