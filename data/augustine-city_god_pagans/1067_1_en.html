<p>Therefore, omitting the other sons of Shem who have no significance in this connection, the account follows a particular line, giving the list of their generations, in order to bring us down to Abraham, in the same way that only those were listed before the flood who belonged to the line leading down to Noah in direct descent from that son of Adam who was named Seth. This series of generations, accordingly, begins as follows: “Now these are the generations of Shem. Shem, the son, was a hundred years old when he begot Arphaxad in the second year after the flood. And Shem lived five hundred years after he begot Arphaxad, and begot sons and daughters, and he died.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL415_55_1" id="target_note_LCL415_55_1"><sup>1</sup></a> The account then continues with a similar list of the others, stating in what year of his life each individual begot the son who belonged to this line of descent that leads to Abraham, and how many years each lived thereafter, and mentions his begetting of sons and daughters. This tells us the sources from which the population increased, so that we need not stick, noting the small number of men named, and childishly ask how such vast stretches of lands and kingdoms could have been populated by the descendants of Shem, especially when we consider the Assyrian power. For from Assyria Ninus, the famous conqueror of all eastern peoples whatsoever, ruled with great prosperity and created for his successors an exceedingly vast and stable empire, which was to continue for a long time.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL415_55_2" id="target_note_LCL415_55_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>However, to avoid undue waste of time, we do not set down the number of years that each man in those successive generations lived, but only the year of his life in which each begot a son, and these we list in due
