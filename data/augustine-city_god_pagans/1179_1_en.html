<p><span class="sc">At</span> this point I see that the time has come to explain what God promised to David himself, who succeeded Saul in the royal power, a transfer that symbolized that final transfer on account of which all these things were said and recorded by divine agency, since this is important for the subject under discussion. When much good fortune had befallen King David, he bethought himself to build a house for God, namely that highly renowned temple that was later constructed by his son King Solomon. While he was planning this, the word of the Lord was given to Nathan the prophet<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL415_279_1" id="target_note_LCL415_279_1"><sup>1</sup></a> for him to bear to the king.

And I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will establish them, and they shall dwell apart, and shall have no further care. And the son of iniquity shall not continue to humiliate them
