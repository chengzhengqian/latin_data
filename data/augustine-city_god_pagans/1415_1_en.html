<span class="label"><span class="italic">About the peace of a people that is alienated from God, and the use made of it for pious ends by the people of God during their pilgrimage in the world.</span></span>
<p><span class="sc">Wherefore</span>, as the life of the flesh is the soul, so the blessed life of man is God, of whom the sacred scriptures of the Hebrews declare: “Blessed is the people whose God is the Lord.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL416_237_1" id="target_note_LCL416_237_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Wretched, therefore, is the people that is alienated from that God. Yet even this people loves a peace of its own, which must not be rejected; but it will not possess it in the end, because it does not make good use of it before the end. But that it should possess this peace meanwhile in this life is important for us, too, since so long as the two cities are intermingled we also profit by the peace of Babylon; and the people of God is by faith so freed from it as meanwhile to be but strangers passing through. For this reason the Apostle too admonished the church to pray for its kings and other high persons, adding these words: “That we may live a quiet and tranquil life with all piety and love.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL416_237_2" id="target_note_LCL416_237_2"><sup>2</sup></a> And the prophet Jeremiah, in predicting the captivity that was to befall the ancient people of God, and in bidding them by divine inspiration to go obediently to Babylon and by their very patience to do God service, added his own admonition that they should pray for Babylon, saying: “Because in her peace is your peace”;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL416_237_3" id="target_note_LCL416_237_3"><sup>3</sup></a> that is, of course, the temporal peace of the present that is common to the good and the evil alike.</p>
