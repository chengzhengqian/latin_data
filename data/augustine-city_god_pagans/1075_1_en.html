<p><span class="sc">Let</span> us now survey the progress of the city of God from that new era of time<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL415_71_1" id="target_note_LCL415_71_1"><sup>1</sup></a> which began with the life of father Abraham. For from his time the evidence for the city of God becomes more explicit, and there are clearer indications of divine promises which we now see fulfilled in Christ. As we have learned, then, from the account in the holy Scripture, Abraham was born in the Chaldean region,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL415_71_2a" id="target_note_LCL415_71_2a"><sup>2</sup></a> a land that belonged to the Assyrian power.
