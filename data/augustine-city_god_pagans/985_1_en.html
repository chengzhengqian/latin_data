“Thus,” he remarked, “among them some people are reported to have lived even for a thousand years.”</p>
<p>Certain individuals regard these arguments as plausible and attempt by use of them not to weaken but to strengthen the trustworthiness of our sacred history and thus to lend credibility to the tradition that the ancients lived for so many years. Hence they have persuaded themselves and deem it no shame to persuade others that the period of time then called a year was so brief that ten of those years are equal to one of ours and ten of ours to a hundred of the former. The utter falsity of such reasoning, however, can be demonstrated by the clearest evidence.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_475_1" id="target_note_LCL414_475_1"><sup>1</sup></a> But before I prove this, I think that I should mention the possibility of a more credible view.</p>
<p>We could surely have disproved and refuted this assertion by evidence from the Hebrew text, where we find that Adam was not two hundred and thirty but a hundred and thirty years old when he became the father of a third son.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_475_2" id="target_note_LCL414_475_2"><sup>2</sup></a> For if this number of years is equal to thirteen of ours, he must obviously have been eleven years old or only slightly more when he had his first son. Now who can engender children at such an age in accordance with that ordinary law of nature so well known to us all?</p>
<p>But let us pass over Adam. He could perhaps have engendered children even when he was created, for it is unlikely that he was made as small as our babies are at birth. His son Seth was not two hundred and five, as our text tells us, but a hundred and five when he became the father of Enos;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_475_3" id="target_note_LCL414_475_3"><sup>3</sup></a> and consequently he was not yet eleven years old according
