and you have said: ‘Wherein have we spoken against you?’ You have said: ‘Everyone who serves God is foolish, and what profit have we because we have kept his ordinances and have walked in supplication before the face of almighty God? And now we call aliens happy, and all those who work iniquity are restored; they have both opposed God and have been saved.’ Those who feared the Lord spoke these scornful words, each one to his neighbour; and the Lord marked it and listened; and he wrote a book of remembrance in his sight for those who fear the Lord and reverence his name.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL415_509_1" id="target_note_LCL415_509_1"><sup>1</sup></a> By that book he means the New Testament.</p>
<p>Next let us hear what follows: “And they shall be mine, says the Lord almighty, for a special possession on the day that I make, and I will choose them as a man chooses his son who serves him; and turn again and you shall distinguish between the just and the unjust, between him that serves God and him that does not. For lo, the day is coming, burning like an oven, and it shall burn them utterly, and all the aliens and all that act wickedly shall be as stubble, and the day that is to come shall consume them with fire, says the Lord almighty, and there shall be left of them neither root nor branch. But for you who fear my name the sun of righteousness shall rise with healing in his wings; and you shall go forth leaping for joy like calves released from the pen. And you shall tread down the wicked, and they shall be as ashes under your feet on the day when I act, says the Lord almighty.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL415_509_2" id="target_note_LCL415_509_2"><sup>2</sup></a> The day referred to is the day of judgment, about which we shall speak more fully at the proper time, if God wills.</p>
