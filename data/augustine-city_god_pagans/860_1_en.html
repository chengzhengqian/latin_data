by a life-giving spirit from all sluggishness and decay of flesh. Then man will no longer be earthly but heavenly, not because his body, which was fashioned of earth, will cease to be the same, but because the bounty of heaven will make it fit for dwelling even in heaven, with no loss of its substance but with a change in its quality.</p>
<p>The first human being, however, a man of the earth, earthly,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_225_1" id="target_note_LCL414_225_1"><sup>1</sup></a> was formed as a living soul and not a life-giving
spirit;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_225_2" id="target_note_LCL414_225_2"><sup>2</sup></a> that state was reserved until he should earn it by obedience. Thus there is no doubt that his body was animal rather than spiritual: it stood in need of food and drink to avoid the pangs of hunger and thirst and was protected against the necessity of death and kept in the flower of youth, not by the final complete and indestructible immortality, but by the tree of life. Yet he would by no means have died if he had not fallen by sinning under the condemnation of which God had given notice and forewarning. Though he was not thereafter denied nourishment even outside of paradise, he was nevertheless barred from the tree of life and thus delivered to time and old age for an end to be made of him, at least in respect of the life that, if he had not sinned, he might have led in paradise continually renewed, though in a body merely animal until it should become spiritual as a reward for obedience.</p>
<p>Therefore, even if we were to understand that, when God spoke the words: “On the day that you eat of it you shall die,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_225_3" id="target_note_LCL414_225_3"><sup>3</sup></a> he meant to include the obvious form of death that brings separation of soul from body, still we need not find any inconsistency
