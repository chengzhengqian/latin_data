reason of our earthly body, but by our devout choice of the true God to be our help.</p>
<p>Admittedly the demons hold sway over many men who are clearly not fit to partake in true religion, and these men are their prisoners and subjects, the greater part of whom they have persuaded of their divinity by miraculous but fraudulent signs in the form of either deeds or prophecies. There are, however, some who have observed their vices with somewhat closer and more careful attention and whom they have not been able to persuade of their divinity; and so they have invented a role for themselves as intermediaries between gods and men and as agents in securing benefits. Perhaps there were some men who still thought them unworthy even of the deference to be gained by this rôle, yet, though they did not believe them to be gods because they realized that they were evil and would have none but good gods, at the same time they did not dare to say that they were altogether unworthy of divine honour, chiefly for fear of giving offence to the multitude who, as they saw, maintained so many rites and temples for the service of the gods through their long tradition of false religion.</p>

One of these, the <span class="italic">Asclepius</span> which is quoted below, was in the form of a dialogue between Hermes and Asclepius. On the vexed question of the date and authorship
of this work and on the historical circumstances surrounding its composition, see W. Scott, <span class="italic">Hermetica,</span> Vol. I (Oxford, 1924), pp. 51–81. Scott argues that Hermes’ prediction
of the impending doom of the Egyptian religion, quoted below by Augustine, must have been written in the years <span class="sc">a.d.</span> 268–273, a time of great political and religious unrest in Egypt. Queen Zenobia of Palmyra had invaded the land, bringing with her foreign troops whose hostility or indifference to the traditional Egyptian cults served to promote the spread of already powerful Christianity. A. S. Ferguson, however, maintains that “The prophecy fits the conditions of the last great uprising of the Jews [<span class="sc">a.d.</span> 115], which was heralded by ominous natural disasters and wrought immense havoc in Egypt and Libya.” It is also possible that the author of the prophecy develops commonplaces of apocalyptic literature without reference to any specific historical event. If so, the date of the <span class="italic">Asclepius</span> cannot be exactly ascertained, except that it must be earlier than Lactantius (c. <span class="sc">a.d.</span> 240–320), who quotes from it extensively in his <span class="italic">Divinae Institutiones.</span> See A. S. Ferguson in Scott’s <span class="italic">Hermetica</span>, Vol. IV (Oxford, 1936), pp. x—xvi, and also A. D. Nock and A. J. Festugière, <span class="italic">Corpus Hermeticum</span> (Paris, 1945), Vol. II, p. 288 ff.
The Latin translation of the <span class="italic">Asclepius</span> used by Augustine has come down to us among the works of Apuleius, who was born about <span class="sc">a.d.</span> 125. But the style and general ineptitude of the translation make it certain that this is not the work of Apuleius. Lactantius did not know the translation used by Augustine; his Latin version of the Greek is his own.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL413_103_1a').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
