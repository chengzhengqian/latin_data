the beginnings of youth after the toga praetexta is put aside, and also Fortuna Barbata who provides the young men with a beard. They refused to honour the men by making their deity, whatever it is, into a male god “Barbatus” from <span class="italic">barba,</span> as they have Nodutus from <span class="italic">nodi.</span> They could at least have called it “Fortunius” and not “Fortuna,” since it has got whiskers. As the god Iugatinus let him unite married couples, and when the bride’s girdle is loosed let him be invoked as Virginensis.
