myself in such a way as to exclude all doubts about them from my mind. I do believe the things that I have experienced myself and those that anyone else may easily put to the test. Such, for example, is the lime that boils in water and is cold in oil, the loadstone that draws iron by an invisible attraction but will not move a straw, the flesh of the peacock that does not decay—though even the flesh of Plato has decayed—the straw that is cold enough to prevent snow from melting and warm enough to force apples to ripen, the radiant fire that in keeping with its brightness whitens stones as it bakes them, but on the contrary darkens most things as it burns them. Similar also is the fact that black spots are made by spilling clear oil, and likewise black lines by rubbing with white silver. In making charcoal, too, the igniting fire changes everything to its opposite: from beautiful wood come ugly coals, the fragile from the solid, the unrotting from the rotting. These marvels and many others that it would be tedious to include in this book are known to me personally, some of them to many others besides, and some to all men. On the matters which I have set down without personal experience, but from reading—except the spring where burning torches are quenched and quenched torches kindled, and the apples of Sodom which look ripe on the outside but are full of smoke within—I have not been able to find any competent witnesses from whom I could learn whether the stories are true. As for the spring, I have not found any who could say that they had seen the one in Epirus, but I have found men who were acquainted with a similar spring in Gaul, not far from the city of Grenoble.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL417_45_1" id="target_note_LCL417_45_1"><sup>1</sup></a>

Such a spring has been identified near Grenoble, the Fontaine-Ardente, at Saint-Barthélemy du Guâ (Isère). There are jets of escaping natural gas which support a small flame, according to Marrou, <span class="italic">Saint Augustin et la Fin de la Culture Antique,</span> 145, note 4.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL417_45_1').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
