So this threefold division does not upset the previous classification, which gives us to understand that the pursuit of wisdom in the widest sense is made up of practice and theory.</p>
<p>However, I consider it too tedious to expound in detail what conclusion Plato reached within or concerning each of these fields of study, or, in other words, what he discovered or believed to be the goal of all actions, the cause of all natural objects and the light of every act of reason; nor do I consider it right to make statements that may be rash.
