or the restraint of bad from their gods or even have hoped for them, since in their own laws they surpass and convict the gods.</p>
<p>The gods demand plays in their honour; the Romans exclude the players from every honour. The gods order the disgraces of the gods to be enacted in their rites in poetic fictions; the Romans warn shameless poets not to bring disgrace on men. Plato,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL411_191_1" id="target_note_LCL411_191_1"><sup>1</sup></a> however, that “half-god,” not only took a stand against the wanton desire of such gods, but also held up a standard that the Roman genius should have put into practice, for he would not permit the poets themselves even to reside in a state with a sound constitution, either because poets in their fiction propose a model sanctioned only by themselves, or because they hold up to wretched men the worst possible examples in their stories of the gods.</p>
<p>We, however, call Plato neither a god nor a demigod, and we do not compare him with any holy angel of the supreme God, or with any prophet of truth, or with any apostle, or with any of Christ’s martyrs, or even with any human being who is a Christian. The reason for this opinion of ours will, with God’s favour, be given in its own place. But since they insist that he was a demigod, we think he should be preferred, if not to Romulus or to Hercules (although no historian has said or poet pretended that Plato slew his brother or was guilty of any other outrage), certainly to Priapus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL411_191_2" id="target_note_LCL411_191_2"><sup>2</sup></a> or to any Cynocephalus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL411_191_3" id="target_note_LCL411_191_3"><sup>3</sup></a> or to Fever,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL411_191_4a" id="target_note_LCL411_191_4a"><sup>4</sup></a> divinities who were in part received by the Romans from foreign lands and in part hallowed as peculiar to themselves.</p>
