<span class="label"><span class="italic">On the evil of death in general, whereby the union of soul and body is sundered.</span></span>
<p><span class="sc">Wherefore,</span> so far as the death of the body or, in other words, the separation of the soul from the body is concerned, it is not good for anyone when those who are said to be dying are undergoing it. For a grating and unnatural feeling is produced by the force itself that rends asunder the two things that were joined and interwoven in the living person; and this experience lasts until there is a complete loss of sensation, which was present precisely because of the union of soul and flesh. But all this anguish is sometimes cut short by a single blow to the body or by a sudden seizure of the soul, the swiftness of which prevents its being felt.</p>
<p>Yet, whatever it is in the dying that removes with a feeling of distress the power of feeling, it adds to the merit of patience when it is borne with religious faith, but it does not expunge the term ‘penalty.’ Thus, although death is doubtless the penalty incurred by a man at birth as a direct descendant of the first man, yet, if it is paid on behalf of religion and righteousness, it becomes the glory of a man at rebirth; and although death is recompense of sin, it sometimes succeeds in bringing it about that there is no recompense for sin.</p>
