<span class="label"><span class="italic">On the meaning of the divine answer about the twins while they were still in the womb of their mother Rebecca.</span></span>
<p><span class="sc">Let</span> us now examine the course of the city of God through the period of Abraham’s descendants. Between the first year of Isaac’s life and his sixtieth year, when his sons were born, it is worth noting that when he asked God that his wife, who had been barren, might bear a child, God had already granted his request, and she had already conceived, for the twins were even then struggling in her womb. And when, tormented by this discomfort, she inquired of the Lord, she received this answer: “Two nations are in your womb, and two distinct peoples shall issue from your belly. One people shall overcome the other, and the elder shall serve the younger.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL415_163_1" id="target_note_LCL415_163_1"><sup>1</sup></a> The apostle Paul wishes this to be taken as a conspicuous instance of God’s grace, since when they were not yet born and were doing nothing, whether good or bad, the younger son was chosen, without any good deeds to his credit, and the elder was rejected.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL415_163_2a" id="target_note_LCL415_163_2a"><sup>2</sup></a> At this time, beyond any possible doubt, both were equal in

From the year 394, when Augustine wrote his <span class="italic">Commentary on Romans</span> (see Chapter 60), he made use of the Esau story to support three points of his teaching:
(1) God in his grace elects certain individuals in advance of any merit on their part. The topic is more fully developed in his answers to the <span class="italic">Questions of Simplicianus</span> 1.2, written about 396, and became the principal topic of the Pelagian controversy,
which occupied the last years of Augustine’s life.
(2) The statement that the elder son should serve the younger had a double meaning. Not only were the descendants of Esau to serve the Israelites, as in David’s time (see <span class="italic">Questions on the Heptateuch</span> 1.72), but their lot also prefigured that of the Jews, who were to serve the Christians (see <span class="italic">Confessions</span> 7.9.15; <span class="italic">Against the Jews</span> 7.9, and other references in B. Blumenkranz, <span class="italic">Die Judenpredigt Augustins</span>, 170). (3) The Biblical statement that the unborn children had done nothing good or bad also served to refute the Platonists and others who spoke of pre-natal sins (see, e.g., <span class="italic">On the Grace of Christ and Original Sin</span> 2.31.36).</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL415_163_2a').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
