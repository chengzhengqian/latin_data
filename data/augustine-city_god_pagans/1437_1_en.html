world, that is, at the last and supreme judgement of God), “when all who are in the graves shall hear his voice and shall come forth.” He does not say, as in the case of the first resurrection, “and they who shall hear it shall live”; for not all shall live, that is, not all shall live that life which, because it is blessed, is the only life that should be so called; for of course they could not without some sort of life hear and come forth from the tombs in the resurrection of the flesh.</p>
<p>Moreover, he instructs us in the next verse why they shall not all live. He says: “They who have done good deeds, to the resurrection of life”; these are they who are to live; “but they who have done evil deeds, to the resurrection of judgement”; these are they who are not to live, because they are to die the second death. In fact, they have done evil deeds because their life has been evil; and their life has been evil because in the first resurrection, the resurrection of the soul which now is, they have not lived a new life, or they have not persevered to the end in newness of life. Since, then, there are two regenerations, of which I have already spoken above: one after the faith, which even now comes about through baptism; the other after the flesh, which is to come about in its exemption from decay and death through the great and last judgement, so there are two resurrections: one, the first, of the soul, which now is, and which prevents us from coming into the second death; the other, the second, which is not now, but is to be at the end of the world, and is not of the soul but of the body, and which by the last judgement will send some into the second death and others into that life which has no death.</p>
