should use them only on occasion. And when we read those writers against whose authority it is wicked to rebel, these special meanings are to be understood only in places where the correct sense can find no alternative, as in those passages that I cited for illustration whether from the prophet or from the Gospel. For everyone knows that the wicked exult with joy, and yet, “There is no gladness for the wicked, says the Lord.” Such differentiation is possible only because the verbal expression ‘to be glad’ has a different meaning when it is employed in a special and distinct sense. Similarly, who would deny that it is wrong to instruct men that they should also do to others whatever they desire others to do to them, lest they then regale one another with base and forbidden pleasures? And yet there cannot be a more wholesome or truer injunction than this: “Whatever you will that men should do to you, do so also to them.” Why is this so? Only because in this passage the word ‘will’ is employed in a certain particular way and is not admissible in a bad sense. Yet no one certainly would have used the commoner idiom, to which customary usage especially resorts, to say: “Be it not your will to utter any lie,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_299_1" id="target_note_LCL414_299_1"><sup>1</sup></a> unless there were also a bad will. A distinction is made between the perversity of the bad will and that other which the angels proclaimed when they said: “Peace on earth to men of good will.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_299_2" id="target_note_LCL414_299_2"><sup>2</sup></a> For the addition of good was superfluous if will can only be good. Further, what great commendation of charity would it have been to say as the Apostle does, that it finds no gladness in iniquity,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_299_3" id="target_note_LCL414_299_3"><sup>3</sup></a> if it were not that malice does find gladness thus?</p>
