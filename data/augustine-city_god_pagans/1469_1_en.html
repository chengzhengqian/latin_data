conflagration the qualities of the corruptible elements that were suited to our corruptible bodies shall utterly pass away in the blaze, and our very substance shall acquire such qualities as shall, by a miraculous change, be suited to our immortal bodies, with the object, clearly, that the world, renewed for the better, may be fitly furnished with men who have been renewed even in the flesh for the better.</p>
<p>Now when he says: “And there is no more sea,” I cannot easily say whether it is to be dried up by that intense heat, or whether it is itself to be transformed for the better. For although we read that there is to be a new heaven and a new earth, I do not recall that I have read anything anywhere about a new sea, unless what is to be found in the same book: “A sea as it were of glass, like unto crystal.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL416_345_1" id="target_note_LCL416_345_1"><sup>1</sup></a> But it was not of the end of the age that he was then speaking, nor does it appear that he meant the sea in the literal sense, but “a sea as it were.” But just as prophetic expression is fond of mingling figurative with literal language, and thus of somehow veiling the meaning, so in this instance the words: “And there is no more sea” may have been meant of the sea of which he had just said: “And the sea gave up the dead that were in it.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL416_345_2" id="target_note_LCL416_345_2"><sup>2</sup></a> For from that moment the roughness and stormy weather of human life<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL416_345_3" id="target_note_LCL416_345_3"><sup>3</sup></a> in this age shall be no more; and he used the word “sea” as a symbol of that.</p>
