<p>Now Procas ruled before Amulius. Amulius, moreover, had made his brother Numitor’s daughter, named Rhea (who was also called Ilia, the mother of Romulus), a Vestal virgin. Men claim that she conceived twins of Mars, and in this way they honour or excuse her lapse from chastity, and offer as proof the fact that a she-wolf nursed the infants when they were exposed. For they think that this sort of animal belongs to Mars, and hence the she-wolf is believed to have offered her dugs to the little ones for the reason that she recognized them as the sons of her master Mars. And yet men are not lacking who say that when the exposed infants lay wailing they were first rescued by an unidentified harlot, and that her breasts were the first to suckle them—for indeed they called harlots she-wolves, for which reason even now houses of ill-fame are called <span class="italic">lupanaria</span> meaning dens of wolves—and that later they came into the hands of the shepherd Faustulus and were nursed by his wife Acca.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL415_437_1" id="target_note_LCL415_437_1"><sup>1</sup></a> And yet, if to convict the man who was king, who had cruelly ordered them to be flung into the water, God wished to aid those infants through whom a great city was destined to be founded after their divine escape from the water, by letting a wild animal suckle them, what is surprising in this? Amulius’ brother Numitor, the grandfather of Romulus, succeeded him in the Latin kingdom, and Rome was founded in the first year of this Numitor; for this reason he ruled thereafter along with his grandson, that is, with Romulus.</p>
