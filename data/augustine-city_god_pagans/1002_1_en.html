For, as I have already argued, it multiplies ties of kinship and prevents one individual from occupying two relationships since two persons can hold them and thus increase the number of kindred. But there is a further reason: human nature is somehow commendably endowed with a certain sense of shame, so that if kinship entitles a woman to honour and respect, it keeps from her that passion which, though it results in offspring, is still carnal lust and, as we see, causes a blush even in chaste wedlock.</p>
