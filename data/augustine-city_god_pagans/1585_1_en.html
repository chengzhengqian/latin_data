dead takes place there will be some to whom mercy will be granted after they have suffered the punishment that belongs to spirits of the dead, so that they will not be cast into eternal fire. It could not be said truly of some that they will not be forgiven either in this world or in that which is to come,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL417_119_1a" id="target_note_LCL417_119_1a"><sup>1</sup></a> if there were not some who, though not forgiven here, will nevertheless be forgiven in the world to come. But once the judge of the living and the dead has said: “Come, O blessed of my Father, take possession of the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world,” and to others on the opposite side, “Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire which is prepared for the devil and his angels,” and once these have gone “into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL417_119_2" id="target_note_LCL417_119_2"><sup>2</sup></a> then it is a matter of excessive presumption to say that the punishment of any of these will not be eternal, when God has said that they will go into eternal punishment. To maintain this presumptuous argument is to destroy hope or raise doubt concerning eternal life also.</p>
<p>Let no one therefore understand the verse in the Psalm which says: “Will God forget to pity, or in anger shut up his tender mercies,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL417_119_3" id="target_note_LCL417_119_3"><sup>3</sup></a> so as to suppose that the pronouncement of God is true concerning good men, but false concerning the wicked, or concerning good men and wicked angels true, but false

This text, along with 1 Corinthians 3.12–15, gave Augustine his Biblical support for belief in purgatory. There was also a long-established custom of prayer for the dead which was related to the belief. In his treatise <span class="italic">On Care to be had for the Dead</span> 3, he cites 2 Maccabees 12.39–45, a passage which relates that Judas Maccabeus, after burying those slain in battle, paid the cost for sacrifice to be made in Jerusalem for the sins of the dead; Augustine adds that in his time the whole church approved of such a custom. This evidently refers to the celebration of mass for the dead, which he mentions elsewhere in connection with his mother’s burial (<span class="italic">Confessions</span> 9.12.32). A council at Carthage in 397 regulated the custom, providing that, if the mourners were not fasting, the “commendation” of the dead should be completed with prayers only.
