the laying away of the bodies of the dead make miserable those who are already at rest in the hidden abodes of the godly! Consequently, when such rites were wanting in the case of Christian corpses in that sack of the Great City, or of other towns as well, no blame attaches to the living, who were unable to pay that tribute, nor any punishment to the dead, who cannot feel the loss.</p>

<p><span class="sc">But</span> many Christians, they say, were also led into captivity. This, of course, is great misery, if they could have been led anywhere where they did not find their God. There are in the Holy Scriptures many consolations for this kind of calamity too. The three young men were in captivity.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL411_67_1" id="target_note_LCL411_67_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Daniel was in captivity.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL411_67_2" id="target_note_LCL411_67_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Other prophets were in captivity, and God did not fail them as comforter. So, also, he has not deserted his faithful under the domination of a nation which, though barbarous, is yet human, as he did not desert the prophet in the belly of the monster.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL411_67_3" id="target_note_LCL411_67_3"><sup>3</sup></a> Our opponents again prefer to ridicule rather than to believe these facts, yet they believe the story that appears in their own literature,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL411_67_4" id="target_note_LCL411_67_4"><sup>4</sup></a> how Arion of Methymna, a most famous lyre player, when he was cast out of a ship, was received on a dolphinâ€™s back and borne to land. But that story of ours about the prophet Jonah is more incredible, more incredible evidently because more miraculous, and more miraculous because it displays greater power.</p>
