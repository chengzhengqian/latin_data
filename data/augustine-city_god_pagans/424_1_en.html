What need is there to say more about this cruellest of absurdities? Rather, let us observe and remember this principle, that these explanations have nothing to do with the true God. He is a living, incorporeal, and immutable being, and from him must that life be sought which is happy forever, while their goals are in material, temporal, mutable and mortal things.</p>
<p>Again he says: “The fact that Saturn in the myth castrated his father Caelus, or Heaven, means that the divine seed is in Saturn’s keeping, not in that of Caelus.” The reason for this is that, so far as can be known, nothing in the sky springs from seed. But lo and behold! If Saturn is the son of Caelus, he is the son of Jupiter. For countless writers are careful to state times without number that Jupiter is Caelus, or the sky. In this way their theories, which do not proceed from truth, generally overthrow each other even when no one attacks them.</p>
<p>Varro says that Saturn was called Chronos, the Greek word for a space of time, without which a seed cannot be fruitful. These statements and many others are made about Saturn, and all refer to seed. With all this power Saturn should at least be enough to care for seed. But why are other gods required for this work, especially Liber and Libera, who is also known as Ceres? But concerning these gods and their relation to seed Varro says all over again quite as much as if he had said nothing at all about Saturn.</p>
