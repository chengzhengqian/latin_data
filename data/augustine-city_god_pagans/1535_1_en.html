yet it also has such durability that no moisture will rot it and no period of time destroy it? Whence those who set up boundary stones make a practice of spreading charcoal beneath, to refute any litigant who may appear after the longest lapse of time and contend that the fixed stone is not the boundary. What enables the charcoal, buried in moist earth where wood rots, to endure so long unconsumed, except fire, the great consumer of most things?</p>
<p>Let us consider also the marvel of lime. Aside from the fact, on which we have already said enough, that it is whitened by fire, which blackens other things, it absorbs fire from fire in a most mysterious way, and as a lump now cold to the touch it stores the fire so secretly that it is wholly concealed from all our senses. Only by experiment can the fire be discovered persisting asleep within, even while it is invisible. Hence we call it “quicklime,” that is, “living lime,” as if the hidden fire were the invisible soul of a visible body. Again, how strange it is that when it is quenched, then it is kindled! For in order to release the hidden fire, the lime is poured into water, or water is poured over it, and though it was cold before, it is now made hot by the same agent by which all hot things are cooled! Thus, as the lump dies, so to speak, the departing fire which was hidden now appears, and henceforth the lump is so cold in death that it will no longer burn with the addition of water, and what we used to call “living lime” we now call “extinct,” or “slaked lime.” What can we imagine to increase the strangeness of this marvel? Yet there is something more. Mix it, not with water, but oil, which is, rather than water,
