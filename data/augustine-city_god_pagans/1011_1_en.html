Now in the case of the generations descending from the seed of Seth the author of this book had in mind to come down to Noah and, resuming with him, to continue in due sequence. But if in the case of Cain’s progeny the writer did not have in mind someone to whom he was obliged to trace the line, what need was there to pass over first-born sons in order to arrive at Lamech, with whose children (that is, in the eighth generation from Adam or the seventh from Cain) the end of that series is reached?
