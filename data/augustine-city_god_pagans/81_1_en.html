shamelessness of the Feast of Flight<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL411_163_1" id="target_note_LCL411_163_1"><sup>1</sup></a>—a feast of flight indeed, but one that put to flight modesty and good manners—but where there was a message for the people giving the gods’ instructions about repressing avarice, crushing ambition, and curbing luxury, where the wretched might learn the lesson that, as Persius dins it in our ears, must be learned:</p>
<p>“Come and learn, Ο miserable souls, and be instructed in the causes of things: learn what we are, and for what sort of lives we are born; what place was assigned to us at the start; how to round the turning-post gently, and from what point to begin the turn; what limit should be placed on wealth; what prayers may rightfully be offered; what good there is in fresh-minted coin; how much should be spent on country and on kin; what part God has ordered you to play, and at what point of the human commonwealth you have been stationed.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL411_163_2" id="target_note_LCL411_163_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Let them tell us where these precepts of gods who gave instruction were commonly recited and often heard by the nations who worshipped them, just as we point to our churches established for this purpose in any quarter to which the Christian religion spreads.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Will</span> they perhaps remind us of the schools of the philosophers and their disputations?</p>
