To be sure, some doctors called anatomists with a cruel zeal for science have dissected bodies of dead men and even of men who died while the doctor was cutting and examining them. Thus they have not humanely, but in human flesh, explored every secret place in order to gain new information about such parts and the kind of treatment to employ, and in what spot.
