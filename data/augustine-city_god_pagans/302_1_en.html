<p class="noindent">The Romans practised these arts with the more perfection, the less they devoted themselves to pleasure, the less they weakened mind and body by the love and pursuit of wealth, for wealth undermined morals and led to the plundering of poor citizens, while bounty was lavished on vile actors.</p>
<p>Hence when Sallust wrote his prose and Virgil his verses, men had outstripped their famous ancestors in moral decline and in affluence: they no longer employed those ancient arts in their competition for honours and glory, but plotted with treachery and deceit. Thus the same writer states: “At first, instead of avarice, it was ambition that stirred the minds of men, a vice that comes close to being a virtue. Glory, honour and power are sought by hero and coward alike; but the former climbs by the honest path, while the latter, because he has no good arts, resorts to plots and trickery for weapons.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL412_199_2" id="target_note_LCL412_199_2"><sup>2</sup></a> He means obviously by good arts the using of virtuous means to arrive at honour, glory and power, and not to employ deceitful cunning. The hero and the coward alike desire these things, but the former, that is, the hero, climbs by the honest path. The path is virtue, by which he climbs to the prize he would possess, that is, glory, honour and power.</p>
<p>That this ideal was ingrained in the Romans is shown also by the temples of two gods that they set up in closest proximity, those of Honos and Virtus,
