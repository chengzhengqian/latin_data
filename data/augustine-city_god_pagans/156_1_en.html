triplet brothers, one from each side. From the Roman side the three Horatii, from the Alban the three Curiatii advanced. The three Curiatii slew two of the Horatii, but the one who remained defeated and put to death the three Curiatii.</p>
<p>Thus Rome emerged as victor, but with such slaughter even in the final combat that of the six, but one came home. To whom did the loss on both sides come, to whom the grief, if not to Aeneas’ stock, Venus’ descendants, Jupiter’s grandsons? For this, too, was a worse than civil war when the daughter city fought with the mother city.</p>
<p>To the death combat of the triplets there was added another atrocious and shocking catastrophe. Since both nations had formerly been friendly, being, of course, both neighbours and relatives, a sister of the Horatii had been betrothed to one of the Curiatii, and when she afterwards burst into tears at the sight of the arms of her betrothed, borne by her victorious brother as spoils, she was slain by that same brother. The feeling of this one woman seems to me more humane than that of the whole Roman people. I do not think her at fault for weeping over the man to whom she was bound by half her duty, or perhaps over the very brother who had slain one to whom he pledged his sister.</p>
<p>How comes it that good Aeneas, in Virgil, is praised for his grief over his enemy even though slain by his own hand?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL411_313_1" id="target_note_LCL411_313_1"><sup>1</sup></a> How comes it that Marcellus shed tears of compassion when he reflected on the city of Syracuse, how it was a moment ago at the pinnacle of its fame and had collapsed under his attack, and went on to contemplate the common lot of all men?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL411_313_2" id="target_note_LCL411_313_2"><sup>2</sup></a> I submit the argument to the verdict
