Man therefore was handed over to himself because he forsook God in his self-satisfaction, and since he did not obey God, he could not obey even himself. From this springs the more obvious wretchedness whereby man does not live as he chooses. For if he lived as he chose, he would deem himself happy; but yet he would not be happy even so if he lived an indecent life.</p>

<span class="label"><span class="italic">On the true happiness, which our present life does not possess.</span></span>
<p><span class="sc">Yet</span>, if we are to regard the matter more closely, only a happy man lives as he chooses, and only a righteous man is happy. But even the righteous man himself will not live as he chooses until he arrives where he both is wholly free from death, deception and injury and is assured that he will always so remain. For this is what our nature seeks, and it will not be fully and perfectly happy unless it attains what it seeks. But who among us now can live as he chooses when the very matter of living is not in his power? For he chooses to live but is compelled to die. How then does he live as he chooses if he does not live as long as he chooses? But if he should choose to die, how can he live as he chooses when he does not choose to live? And if a person should choose to die, not because he does not choose to live, but in order to have a better life after death, then he does not yet live as he chooses, but will so live when by dying he has attained to what he chooses.</p>
