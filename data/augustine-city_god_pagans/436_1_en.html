Because the aspect of the earth in spring is more beautiful than in the other seasons, Porphyrius, the famous philosopher, declared that Attis symbolized the flowers, and was mutilated because the flower falls before the fruit.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL412_467_1a" id="target_note_LCL412_467_1a"><sup>1</sup></a> Then it is not the man, or what passes for a man named Attis, that was compared with a flower, but rather his virile parts. These fell to earth, of course, while he went on living. Or rather, they did not fall, nor were they picked off, but were obviously ripped off. And when that flower was lost, there was no fruit afterwards, but rather sterility followed. What then is the meaning of the remnant of the man, whatever was left of him after his mutilation?

Or did they make a vain attempt and, finding no answer, simply persuade men that it was better to believe what rumour reported and books recorded about the castrated man?
