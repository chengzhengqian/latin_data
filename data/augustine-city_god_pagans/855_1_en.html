if they had not sinned, nevertheless, as human beings they took nourishment since their bodies were earthly—not
yet spiritual but still animal. These bodies, it is true, did not grow old and decrepit and thus end of necessity in death; this privilege was afforded them by the wonderful grace of God from the tree of life that stood in the middle of paradise along with the forbidden tree. Nevertheless, they did take other nourishment also, except from the one tree that had been forbidden, not because it was itself an evil, but to teach the good of absolute and unqualified obedience. This is the great virtue of a rational being subordinate to the Lord his Creator. For where nothing evil, but only something forbidden, was touched, disobedience alone constituted the sin.</p>
<p>Therefore the purpose of the other nourishment that the first human beings took was to prevent their animal bodies from suffering any distress through hunger or thirst. On the other hand, they ate of the tree of life to avoid surprise by death from any quarter whatever or disintegration of their bodies through old age and exhaustion after they had run the full course of their years. One might say that all the other foods served as aliment, but the latter as a sort of sacrament. In this way the tree of life can be regarded as having played the same role in the material paradise as is played in the spiritual or intelligible paradise by the wisdom of God, of which we read in Scripture: “It is a tree of life to those who embrace it.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_215_1" id="target_note_LCL414_215_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
