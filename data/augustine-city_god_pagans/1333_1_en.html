<span class="label"><span class="italic">Whether it should be believed</span>, <span class="italic">as some suppose</span>, <span class="italic">that since the completion of the ten persecutions that are past no further persecution remains except the eleventh</span>, <span class="italic">which is to be in the very time of Antichrist.</span></span>
<p><span class="sc">Furthermore</span>, I do not think that one should rashly say or believe, as some have done or now do, that the church will not suffer other persecutions before the time of Antichrist, in addition to those that she has already suffered, to wit ten, so that the eleventh and last is to be inflicted by Antichrist. As the first persecution they reckon that of Nero, the second that of Domitian, the third of Trajan, the fourth of Antoninus, the fifth of Severus, the sixth of Maximinus,
the seventh of Decius, the eighth of Valerian, the ninth of Aurelian, the tenth of Diocletian and Maximian. For they think that the plagues in Egypt, of which there were ten before the people of God began their exodus, should be interpreted as meaning that the last persecution by Antichrist should be taken as figured in the eleventh plague, in which the Egyptians, while pursuing the Hebrews with enmity, perished in the Red Sea, while the people of God passed through on dry land. But I do not think that those events in Egypt were prophetic symbols of these persecutions, although those who think so evidently have matched those and these one by one with far-fetched ingenuity, yet not so much by prophetic inspiration as by speculation of the human mind, which sometimes attains to truth but sometimes goes astray.</p>
