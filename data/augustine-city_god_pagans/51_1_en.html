not spare himself? Was it more a disgrace to be victorious contrary to orders than to submit to a victor contrary to propriety?</p>
<p>Cato, therefore, in no wise judged it a disgrace to live under Caesar’s victorious rule, for otherwise a father’s sword would have freed his son from this disgrace. What can we conclude but that his love for his son, who, he hoped and resolved, would be spared by Caesar, was equalled by the feeling with which he begrudged Caesar the glory of pardoning himself, to use the phrase attributed to Caesar,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL411_103_1" id="target_note_LCL411_103_1"><sup>1</sup></a> or to put it more gently in our own terms, by his discomfiture for fear that Caesar should have the glory of pardoning him.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Our</span> opponents, furthermore, do not want us to prefer to Cato that saintly man Job, who chose rather to suffer dreadful evils in his flesh than by self-inflicted death to be rid of all these pains, or the other holy men of whom it is recorded in our books—and they are most lofty in their supreme authority and most trustworthy—that they chose rather to bear capture and enslavement by the enemy than to take their own lives. On the contrary, I shall prefer to Marcus Cato an example taken from their books, that same Marcus Regulus.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL411_103_2" id="target_note_LCL411_103_2"><sup>2</sup></a> For Cato never had defeated Caesar, but, when he was defeated by him, disdained to be subject to him, and to avoid being subject, chose suicide instead.</p>
