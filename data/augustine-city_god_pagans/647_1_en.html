<span class="label"><span class="italic">The arguments that blinded Porphyry and prevented him from recognizing the true wisdom, which is Christ.</span></span>
<p>So you direct men into the most undoubted error and you are not ashamed of committing so great a wrong, although you profess to be a lover of virtue and wisdom;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_379_1" id="target_note_LCL413_379_1"><sup>1</sup></a> whereas if you had loved them truly and faithfully, you would have come to know “Christ the virtue of God and the wisdom of God,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_379_2" id="target_note_LCL413_379_2"><sup>2</sup></a> instead of being so puffed up with pride in your own empty knowledge that you recoiled in shock<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_379_3a" id="target_note_LCL413_379_3a"><sup>3</sup></a> from his supremely health-giving humility.</p>
<p>Still, you do admit that even the spiritual soul can, without the aid of the theurgic arts and rites, which you have wasted so much effort to learn, be purified by the virtue of continence. You also say on occasion that rites do not raise the soul after death, so that it is evident now that they procure no benefit after the termination of this life even for that very same part of the soul that you call spiritual. And yet you treat these matters in a great variety of ways and keep recurring to them—to no other purpose, so far as I can judge, than to give yourself the air of one expert in such things too and to win the approval of those who pry into forbidden arts, or else yourself to win new fanciers of such things.
