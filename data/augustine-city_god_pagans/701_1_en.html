morning!”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_487_1" id="target_note_LCL413_487_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Ezekiel says: “You were in the delights of God’s paradise, you were adorned with every precious stone.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_487_2" id="target_note_LCL413_487_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Here it is understood that there was a time when he was without sin. In fact a little later he is told more explicitly: “You walked blameless in your days,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_487_3" id="target_note_LCL413_487_3"><sup>3</sup></a> And if no other more fitting interpretation of these passages can be found, then we must also accept the statement: “He did not abide by the truth,” as meaning that he was in the truth but did not remain in it permanently, and the words: “The devil has sinned from the beginning,” as meaning that he is not to be supposed to sin from his beginning, when he was created, but from the beginning of his sin, because it was by his pride that sin first came to be.</p>
<p>Then there is the statement in the book of Job where the devil was being discussed: “This is the beginning of the Lord’s handiwork, which he made to be a laughing-stock for his angels.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_487_4" id="target_note_LCL413_487_4"><sup>4</sup></a> With this passage the psalm too appears to agree in which we read: “This serpent which thou didst form to be a laughing-stock.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_487_5" id="target_note_LCL413_487_5"><sup>5</sup></a> But the words in Job are not to be interpreted by assuming that the devil was created from the beginning as a fit subject for the angels to make fun of, but that he was consigned to this punishment after his sin. He started, then, as the handiwork of the Lord, for there is no natural creature even among the least significant and lowest animalcules

Lucifer (“light-bearer”) in this biblical passage is properly an epithet of the King of Babylon. The Christians, taking this passage in conjunction with Luke 10.18, used Lucifer as a synonym for Satan. To the pagans Lucifer meant the morning-star, the planet Venus. Because of this pagan usage, the Revised Standard Version renders Lucifer as “Day Star” in Isaiah 14.12.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL413_487_1').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL413_487_2"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL413_487_2" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">2</sup>Ezekiel 28.13 (Septuagint).</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL413_487_2').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL413_487_3"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL413_487_3" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">3</sup>Ezekiel 28.15 (Septuagint).</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL413_487_3').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL413_487_4"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL413_487_4" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">4</sup>Job 40.19 (Septuagint).
