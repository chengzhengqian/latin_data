is without a doubt incomparably preferable to all earthly kingdoms, is at the disposal of any of them? And such gods were thought unable to grant even earthly rule, not because they were great and exalted, while the gift was small and base, so that in their sublimity they would not deign to bother with it, but for another reason. Granted that when we contemplate the frailty of human life, anyone may well despise the tottering summits of earthly power, yet these gods have shown themselves quite unworthy to have the granting and preserving even of these things entrusted to their hands. Therefore if, as the argument of the last two books has shown, no god out of that throng of what one may call plebeian gods, or noble gods either, is fit to grant mortal kingdoms to mortals, how much less can any god make immortal beings out of mortals!</p>
<p>A further observation may be added. If we are now dealing with men who think that the gods should be worshipped not for the sake of this life, but to gain that which is to come after death, it is clear now that such gods should not be worshipped at all, even to gain the things that are singled out and assigned to their power, not by any consideration of truth, but by idle fancy. This is the belief of those who argue that their worship is necessary for the interests of this mortal life, but I have already refuted them sufficiently, to the best of my ability, in the five preceding books. Suppose it to be true that those who worship the goddess Juventas are markedly superior in the bloom of youth, while those who slight her either die prematurely in youth, or lose their vigour while still young, as in a sluggish old age.
