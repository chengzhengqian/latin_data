whereas it is contrary to God only as evil to good, in the case of the original nature that it vitiates, it is contrary not only as a bad thing but also as a hurtful thing. Evil things are in fact not hurtful to God but to natural beings that are changeable and perishable, but still good beings, as the defects themselves also testify. For if the beings were not originally good, no defects could be hurtful to them.</p>
<p>For what is effected when there is hurt? Is it not some deprivation of completeness, beauty, health, virtue or any good thing of which a being has been wont to suffer removal or diminution through a defect? But if the good thing were not there at all, then there could be no removal of it, hence no hurt, and in consequence there is no defect either. For there can be no defect where there is no hurt. Hence we deduce that, although a defect cannot do hurt to an unchangeable good, still it can do hurt only to a good thing, for a defect cannot be present where no hurt is done. Here is another way of putting it: there can be no defect either in the highest good or where some good does not exist.</p>
<p>Accordingly, good things can exist unalloyed in some cases, but unalloyed evils can in no case exist. For even those beings that have incurred a defect by the entrance of an evil will, though they are evil in so far as they are defective, yet are good in so far as they are natural beings. And when a defective being is undergoing punishment, there is in this circumstance, apart from its goodness as a natural being, further good in that it does not go unpunished.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_15_1" id="target_note_LCL414_15_1"><sup>1</sup></a> For there is justice in this and any justice is doubtless good.
