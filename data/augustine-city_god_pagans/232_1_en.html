it is a necessary evil. Yet since it would be worse for wrongdoers to rule over the just, this necessary evil is also properly termed a fortunate event. But without doubt it is better fortune to live in peace with a good neighbour than to subdue a bad neighbour in war.</p>
<p>He prays badly who prays for someone to hate or fear, in order to have someone to conquer. Hence if it was by waging just war, not unholy or unjust, that the Romans were able to acquire so great an empire, should they not also worship as a goddess External Aggression? For we see that she contributed greatly to the growth of the empire; she made others unjust that there might be peoples with whom just wars could be waged, and thus the empire was enlarged. And why shouldn’t Aggression be a goddess, too, at least the Aggression of foreign nations, if Fear and Pallor and Fever won approval as Roman gods? So it was with the help of these two, External Aggression and the goddess Victory, that the empire grew. Aggression provided the occasions for wars, and Victory brought them to a happy conclusion, even if Jupiter was keeping holiday. For what role could Jupiter play here, when anything that might be taken to be a favour granted by him was named a god, worshipped as a god, and invoked on its own account as part of him? He might also have had some part here if he himself were called “Empire” as she is called Victory. Or if empire is the gift of Jupiter, why isn’t victory also regarded as his gift? That would surely be the case if men recognized and worshipped, not a stone in the Capitol, but the true King of kings and Lord of lords.</p>
