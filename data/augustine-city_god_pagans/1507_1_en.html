righteous than the rest, was accustomed to make offering, according to God’s commandment, first for his own sins, and then for those of the people. It is therefore necessary for us to explain how we should understand the words: “As in the days of old, and as in former years.” For perhaps this is a reference to the time when the first human beings were in paradise. For then, pure and untainted by any uncleanness
or taint of sin, they offered themselves to God as the purest sacrifices; but after they were banished thence because of their transgression and the human race was condemned in them, no one, except the one Mediator and any still tiny children who have received the baptism of rebirth, “no one,” as it is written, “is free from uncleanness, not even the infant who has lived but a day upon the earth.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL416_421_1" id="target_note_LCL416_421_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

And so, since we must believe that after such a cleansing the righteous will have no sin, surely that time, so far as the absence of sin is concerned, should be compared with no other time save that when the first human beings lived in paradise, before their transgression, in utter innocence and happiness. This, then, is the proper interpretation of the words “as in the days of old, and as in former years.”</p>
