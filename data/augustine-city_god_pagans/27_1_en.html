suffer on his behalf—not to love gold and silver for which in either case it was the height of wretchedness to suffer, whether they lied and kept them concealed or told the truth and surrendered them.</p>
<p>For during the torture no man lost Christ by confessing; no one preserved wealth except by denying. For this reason it may be that the tortures which taught them that the good to be held dear is a good that cannot decay were more profitable than those goods of theirs, which without any profitable service at all, brought torture upon their owners through love of them.</p>
<p>Certain others there were who, even though they had nothing to surrender, were tortured because they were not believed. Yet these too perhaps had some desire to possess wealth and were not poor by a holy act of will. These had to be shown that not merely the possession of wealth but the very desire for it was worthy of such tortures. Even if they had no hidden gold and silver through hope of a better life—I do not know whether it happened to any such that he was tortured in the belief that he did possess—but even if this did happen, surely he who under those tortures confessed holy poverty, confessed Christ. For this reason, even if he did not succeed in convincing the enemy, the confessor of this holy poverty could not have been tormented without a heavenly reward.</p>
<p>Many, they say, even Christians, were laid low by the long famine. This also the good and faithful turned to good purposes by piously bearing it. For those whom the famine slew, it snatched from the evils of this life, as sickness does from bodily ailments. Those whom it did not, were taught to live more scantily, were taught to fast more extensively.</p>
