But that molar, I should suppose, belonged to some giant. For not only were bodies in general much larger then than our own, but the giants towered far above the rest, even as in subsequent times, including our own, there have almost always been bodies which, though few in number, far surpassed the size of the others. Pliny the Elder, a man of great learning, declares that, as the world advances more and more in age, nature bears smaller and smaller bodies;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_459_2" id="target_note_LCL414_459_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and when he mentions that even Homer often regretted this in his poetry,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_459_3" id="target_note_LCL414_459_3"><sup>3</sup></a> he does not ridicule such statements as poetic fictions but, speaking as a recorder of the wonders of nature, assumes their historicity. But, as I have said, the size of ancient bodies is disclosed even to much later ages by the frequent discovery of bones, for bones are long-lasting.</p>

Yet we should not on that account question the reliability of this sacred history; our refusal to believe what it relates would be as shameless as our evidence of the fulfilment of its prophecies is certain.
