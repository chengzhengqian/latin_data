<p>Aulus Gellius says that he read in this work that the Stoics believed in mental visions which they call phantasies, and no man can prevent their impact on the mind or choose the time thereof. When these sensations arise from terrifying and awe-inspiring circumstances, the mind of even the wise man must unavoidably be disturbed, so that for a little while he either becomes pale with fear or is depressed by gloom, inasmuch as these passions inhibit the proper activity of mind and reason. Yet this does not cause the mind to fear any evil, nor to give assent to the emotions nor to yield to them. For this assent, they maintain, is within the power of man to grant or withhold, and they think the difference between the mind of the wise and that of the foolish man is just this, that the mind of the foolish man yields to these same passions and subordinates his mental judgement to them, while the wise man, though obliged to experience them, preserves with mind unshaken a true and steadfast opinion regarding the things that he ought rationally to pursue or avoid.
