<p>For instance, anger with a sinner in order to reform him, or sadness on behalf of one who is distressed in order to relieve him, or fear for one in danger, to save him from death—with such feelings I hardly suppose that anyone of sane and thoughtful mind would find fault. No doubt the Stoic practice is to condemn even pity,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_169_1" id="target_note_LCL413_169_1"><sup>1</sup></a> but how much more honourable it would have been for the Stoic described by Aulus Gellius to be deeply moved by pity for a fellow-creature in order to save him than by fear of being shipwrecked.
