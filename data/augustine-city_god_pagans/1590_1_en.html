He says: “For as you in time past did not believe in God, but now have obtained mercy by their failure to believe, so these have not believed now in the mercy shown to you, in order that they also may obtain mercy.” Then he adds the words with which they flatter themselves in their error: “For God has shut up all in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL417_129_1" id="target_note_LCL417_129_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Who are the “all,” except those of whom he is speaking, as if he had said “both you and they”? So God shut up all in unbelief, both Gentiles and Jews, whom He foreknew and predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL417_129_2" id="target_note_LCL417_129_2"><sup>2</sup></a> that from the bitterness of their unbelief they might by repenting be confounded, and by believing be converted to the sweetness of God’s mercy, and cry, as it is written in the Psalm: “How great is thy sweetness, O Lord, which thou hast hidden from those that fear thee, but hast perfected for those who hope,” not in themselves, but “in thee!”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL417_129_3" id="target_note_LCL417_129_3"><sup>3</sup></a> And so he pities all the vessels of his mercy. What is the meaning of “all”? All those, of course, both from the Gentiles and the Jews, whom he has predestined and called, justified and glorified,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL417_129_4" id="target_note_LCL417_129_4"><sup>4</sup></a> and of all these (not of all men) he will condemn no one.</p>
