by the Gracchi when by their partisan bands they caused universal disorder, by Marius and Cinna and Carbo<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL411_229_1" id="target_note_LCL411_229_1"><sup>1</sup></a> when they moved on to civil wars undertaken for most dishonest reasons, waged ruthlessly and terminated more ruthlessly, or, to top all, by Sulla himself, whose life and character and deeds, as described by Sallust and other historians, were such that—what reader, I ask you, does not shudder at the recital? What reader will not admit that the republic then had perished?</p>
<p>Will they possibly have the audacity to reply in defence of their gods, as they usually do, that they abandoned the city because of the morals of the citizens of this type, and employ the words of the well-known lines of Virgil:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">They have withdrawn, deserting shrine and altar;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">The gods have gone, once mainstay of our power.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL411_229_2" id="target_note_LCL411_229_2"><sup>2</sup></a></span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">First, if this be so, then they have no cause to complain that the Christian religion so offended their gods as to make them abandon Rome, since, as we see, their forefathers had already by their immoral practices driven from the city’s altars all those numerous and diminutive gods like so many flies. Really now, where was this crowd of divinities when, long before the ancient morals had decayed, Rome was taken and burned by the Gauls? Were they present then, perhaps, but asleep? For then the whole city was in the hands of the enemy, save only the Capitoline Hill, and this, too, was about to be taken, were it not that the geese at any rate were awake while the gods slept. Hence Rome sank almost to the level of the Egyptians, who worship beasts and birds, when the goose was honoured in annual ceremonies.</p>
