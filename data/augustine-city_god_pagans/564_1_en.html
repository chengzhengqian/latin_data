be better than the gods, who, if they mingled with men, would be contaminated. For the special virtue of the gods is said to be that they are set apart on a lofty height where contact with men cannot contaminate them.</p>
<p>As for God, the supreme creator of all things, whom we call the true God, Apuleius assures us that, according to Plato’s teaching, he is the only one who, because of the poverty of human speech, cannot be even passably described by any form of words. Moreover, he continues, even when wise men have removed themselves by a powerful act of mind as far as possible from the body, the knowledge of this God hardly reaches them, and, when it does on occasion, it darts at lightning speed like a flash of white light through the deepest darkness.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_213_1" id="target_note_LCL413_213_1"><sup>1</sup></a> If then we are to suppose that the truly supreme God, who is above all things, does visit, occasionally though it be and like a flash of white light though it be, that darts at lightning speed, yet he does draw near to the minds of wise men with a kind of intelligible and ineffable presence when they have withdrawn from the body as far as was permitted, and if we are to suppose that he cannot be contaminated by them, what is the point of placing those gods far away in a lofty abode in order to avoid contamination by contact with men? As if, indeed, those ethereal bodies whose light fulfils the earth’s need for illumination fulfilled their function otherwise than by being seen! Moreover, if the heavenly bodies, all of which he describes as visible gods,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_213_2" id="target_note_LCL413_213_2"><sup>2</sup></a> are not contaminated by being seen, neither are the demons contaminated by the gaze of men, however near they may be when men behold them.</p>
