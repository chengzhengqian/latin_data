where-with each day there are created new men, from whose bodies, if they have lived wisely, they will be freed with no need to rotate back to miseries, they will, to be consistent, have to say that the souls are infinite in number. For no matter how large a finite number of souls there may have been, it could not be enough for infinite past ages to ensure the perpetual creation of men whose souls were always to be set free from this mortality and never thereafter to return to it. And they will be quite unable to explain how there can be an infinite number of souls in a world where, according to them, events must be finite for God to know them.</p>
<p>Wherefore, since we have now exploded that theory of cycles, according to which the soul was bound to return to the same miseries, nothing can be more in harmony with our faith than to believe that it is not impossible for God both to create new things which he never before created and at the same time, because of his ineffable foreknowledge, not to have a will that changes. Further, the question whether the number of souls that have been set free and are no longer to return to miseries can always go on increasing is recommended to the attention of those who so subtly debate about putting a limit on things infinite. We, for our part, conclude our argument in the form of a dilemma. For if the answer is yes, why should it be denied that what had never before been created can have been created, if, in the case of souls set free, a number which never before existed not only was created once but will never cease to be created? On the other hand, if there must be some fixed number of souls set free
