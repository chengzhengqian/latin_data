deceived, for he is omnipotent in that he does what he wills and does not suffer to be done what he does not will; otherwise he would certainly not be omnipotent. Hence it is because he is omnipotent that there are certain things he cannot do. The case is similar when we say that it is necessary, when we exercise will, to do so of our own free will. This that we say is undoubtedly true, yet we do not thereby put our free will under the necessity that takes away liberty.</p>
<p>Our wills, therefore, exist, and they do whatever it is that we do with a will, which would not be done if we were unwilling. Furthermore, when anyone suffers something against his will because of the will of other men, even so will is in control. Though it is not his own will, it is still a man’s will, but its power is from God. If it were only a man’s will, without the power to accomplish its will, the thing that held it fettered would be some more powerful will. Yet the will would still be a will, not another’s, but the will of him who had a will, even if he could not carry it out. Hence what a man suffers against his will should be ascribed, not to the wills of men or angels or any created spirit, but rather to the will of him who bestows the power to realize the wish.</p>
<p>It is not true, then, that there is no reality in our will just because God foresaw what would be in our will. For when he foresaw this, he foresaw something. Further, he who foresaw what would be in our will certainly foresaw something real, not a mere nothing. Hence assuredly there is something in our will, even though God has foreknowledge of it. Therefore we are in no way compelled either to abolish free will
