For it was only after man sinned that this lust arose; it was after man sinned that his natural being, retaining the sense of shame but losing that dominance to which the body was subject in every part, felt and noticed, then blushed at and concealed that lust. The nuptial blessing, however, whereby the pair, joined in marriage, were to increase and multiply and fill the earth, remained in force even when they sinned, yet it was given before they sinned, for its purpose was to make it clear that the procreation of children is a part of the glory of marriage and not of the punishment of sin.</p>
<p>There are, nevertheless, in our own day men who must surely lack knowledge of that former happiness in paradise, for they believe that children could only have been engendered by the means with which they are personally acquainted, that is, by lust, which, as we see, causes embarrassment even to the honourable state of marriage. Some of these men<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_373_1" id="target_note_LCL414_373_1"><sup>1</sup></a> not merely reject outright but unbelievingly deride the holy Scriptures, in which we read that after sin nakedness caused shame and the organs of shame were covered. Others among them, on the other hand, accept and honour the Scriptures but hold that the words ‘Increase and multiply’ are not to be taken as referring to carnal fertility because some similar statement is also found with reference to the soul: “Thou wilt multiply me with strength in my soul.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_373_2" id="target_note_LCL414_373_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Belying on this passage, they interpret allegorically the words that follow in <span class="italic">Genesis:</span> “Both fill the earth and be masters of it.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_373_3" id="target_note_LCL414_373_3"><sup>3</sup></a> By earth they understand the flesh which the soul fills with its presence and over which it has greatest mastery when it is multiplied
