fire and worm.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL417_63_1" id="target_note_LCL417_63_1"><sup>1</sup></a> It could have been put more briefly, “the punishment of the wicked.” Why, then, was it said “of the flesh of the wicked” if not because both fire and worm will be the punishment of the flesh? Or perhaps the punishment of the flesh is mentioned here because that part of a man is punished that has lived according to the flesh—since that is what will bring him to the second death, which the Apostle had in mind when he said: “For if you live according to the flesh, you shall die.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL417_63_2" id="target_note_LCL417_63_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Let each one choose what he prefers, either to refer fire to the body, worm to the mind, the one literally, the other figuratively, or to refer both literally to the body.</p>
<p>For I have already done enough in the foregoing to prove that animals can live even amid flames, in conflagration without being consumed, and in pain without dying by the marvellous power of the almighty Creator. And he who declares that this is impossible for him does not know him from whom all marvels in nature are derived. For it is God himself who made all the marvels in this world, small and great, that I have mentioned, and an incomparably greater number that I have not mentioned, and enclosed them in the universe itself, a single miracle, and greatest of all. So let each choose, as he likes, one of the two alternatives, whether he thinks the worm pertains literally to the body or figuratively to the mind, the word being translated from corporeal to incorporeal things. But which of these is true the fact itself will one day more conveniently show. Then such will be the knowledge of the saints that they will not need experience of those punishments
