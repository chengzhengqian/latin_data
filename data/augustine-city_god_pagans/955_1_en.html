by grace and chosen by grace, one by grace an alien below and by grace a citizen above. In himself he has his origin in the same lump that was condemned in its entirety at the beginning, but God, like a potter, to use the figure that the Apostle not impudently but prudently introduces, made “out of the same lump one vessel to be honoured and another to be despised.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_415_1" id="target_note_LCL414_415_1"><sup>1</sup></a> But first to be made was the vessel for dishonour, then later the other for honour; for the individual too, as I have already indicated, begins with the inferior, which must be our starting-point, but need not be our permanent abode, and later comes to the superior, toward which we may advance as we move forward and in which we may abide when we have reached it. Consequently, though not every evil man will later be good, yet no one will be good who was not evil earlier; but the sooner a particular man changes for the better, the more speedily he may receive the name belonging to his new status and hide his former name under the later one.</p>
<p>Thus we read in Scripture that Cain founded a city,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_415_2" id="target_note_LCL414_415_2"><sup>2</sup></a> but Abel, being a sojourner, founded none. For the city of the saints is above, though it brings forth citizens here below, in whose persons it sojourns as an alien until the time of its kingdom shall come. On that day it will assemble them all as they rise again in their bodies, and they will receive their promised kingdom, where with their Prince, who is king of the ages,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_415_3" id="target_note_LCL414_415_3"><sup>3</sup></a> they will reign for all eternity.</p>
