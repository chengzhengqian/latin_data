for Iphigenia, the daughter of king Agamemnon. For feats of this sort cannot have been difficult for demons who were permitted to perform them by-God’s
judgment; but because that maiden was later found alive, it was easy to see that a hind had been substituted for her. The companions of Diomede, on the other hand, since they suddenly vanished from sight and did not reappear anywhere afterwards, since the avenging evil angels destroyed them, are believed to have been transformed into these birds, birds that were secretly brought to that place from other regions where this type of bird lives, and suddenly substituted for them. Moreover, as for the birds bringing water to Diomede’s temple in their beaks and sprinkling it, and fawning on men of Greek origin but attacking foreigners, it is no wonder that this is done at the prompting of demons who have reason to encourage the belief that Diomede became a god, in order to deceive men. They want men to worship many false gods, thereby wronging the one true God, and to render service to dead men who did not truly live, even when they were alive, by means of temples, altars, sacrifices and priests, all of which rightly belong to none save the one true and living God.</p>
