<p>Accordingly, though there are many bodies of Christians that earth has not covered, yet no one has separated any of them from heaven and earth which is wholly filled by the presence of him who knows whence he shall restore to life what he has created. Indeed, it is said in the Psalm: “The dead bodies of thy servants have they given to be meat unto the fowls of the heaven, the flesh of thy saints unto the beasts of the earth. Their blood have they shed like water round Jerusalem; and there was none to bury them.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL411_61_1" id="target_note_LCL411_61_1"><sup>1</sup></a> But the intent was to enlarge on the cruelty of those who did this, rather than on the misery of those who suffered it. For though in the eyes of men such a lot seems harsh and dreadful, yet “precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his saints.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL411_61_2" id="target_note_LCL411_61_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Therefore, all such offices, that is, the care taken with funerals, the embalming for burial, the procession of the mourners, are more for the comfort of the survivors than to assist the dead. If a costly burial does any good to a wicked man, then a good man will be harmed by a cheap one or by none at all. A funeral, gorgeous in the sight of men, was given that purple-clad rich man by his crowd of servants, but much more glorious, in the sight of the Lord, was the one granted that poor man with his sores, at the hands of the angels who carried him, not to a marble tomb, but to the bosom of Abraham.</p>
<p>The men against whom I have undertaken to defend the City of God laugh at these things, but for all that their philosophers too have scorned to concern themselves about burial. And often whole armies, dying for the soil of their native land, cared not where afterwards they were to lie or to what beasts they fell
