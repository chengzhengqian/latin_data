deserted the pasture, and there are no cattle at the mangers.” He saw that the nation which was destined to kill Christ was to lose its rich harvest of spiritual goods, which he figuratively described in prophetic fashion in terms of the fertility of the earth.</p>
<p>And since the reason why that nation suffered such a visitation of God’s wrath was that in their ignorance of God’s righteousness they wished to establish their own in its place,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL415_491_1" id="target_note_LCL415_491_1"><sup>1</sup></a> he adds at once: “But I shall be glad in the Lord, I shall rejoice in God my saviour. The Lord God is my strength, he shall establish my feet till the end; he shall set me upon the heights so that I may win the victory with his song.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL415_491_2" id="target_note_LCL415_491_2"><sup>2</sup></a> This refers, of course, to the song of which much the same thing is said in the psalm: “He has set my feet on a rock and has guided my steps, and he has put in my mouth a new song, a hymn to our God.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL415_491_3" id="target_note_LCL415_491_3"><sup>3</sup></a> That man, therefore, wins the victory with the Lord’s song who pleases by praising the Lord, not himself, according to the words: “He who glories, let him glory in the Lord.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL415_491_4" id="target_note_LCL415_491_4"><sup>4</sup></a> Now the reading of certain manuscripts, “I will rejoice in God my Jesus,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL415_491_5a" id="target_note_LCL415_491_5a"><sup>5</sup></a> seems to me better than the text given by those who, wishing to translate this into Latin, have not employed that name which is for us more pleasing and sweet to pronounce.</p>

But he also had “certain manuscripts,” perhaps of Jerome’s Vulgate, which presented the curiously awkward text “I will rejoice in God my Jesus” instead of “God my saviour.” The name “Jesus”
(Greek for “Joshua”) is related to the Hebrew word for “saviour”, as is clear from Matthew 1.21. Augustine here shows his fondness for such word-play.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL415_491_5a').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
