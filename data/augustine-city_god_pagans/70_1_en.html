<p>Next I must show what their moral standards were and for what reason the true God, in whose power all kingdoms are, deigned to grant them assistance in expanding their empire, and how far from helping them were those whom they rate as gods and how much harm they did instead with their trickery and deceit. Finally, I shall reply to those who, though refuted and convicted by the clearest evidence, attempt to declare that the gods should be worshipped, not for advantages to be enjoyed in this present life, but for those in the life to come after death.</p>
<p>This, if I am not mistaken, will be a much more difficult matter for discussion and more deserving of closer-knit argumentation, inasmuch as in this case I shall not only be discussing the subject with philosophers—not just any philosophers, but with such as are most renowned among the pagans and agree with us on many points—but shall also take as subjects of discussion the immortality of the soul, the proof that the world was created by the true God, and the providence of God whereby he rules the universe that he has established. But since they too require to be refuted on those points on which they disagree, I am bound to answer the call of duty in order that, first refuting contrary opinions of the wicked to the best of such ability as God imparts, I may then speak in support of the City of God and of true religion and worship of God, in which alone is found a truthful promise of everlasting bliss.</p>
<p>Here accordingly let this book end, that we may make a fresh start in disposing of succeeding topics.</p>
