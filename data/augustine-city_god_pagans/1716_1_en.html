unvexed by evils that evils will be completely erased from their senses. But by the faculty of knowledge, which will be strong in them, they will know not only their own past, but also the eternal misery of the damned. Otherwise, if they do not know that they were once wretched, how will they “sing the mercies of the Lord for ever,” as the psalm says?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL417_381_1" id="target_note_LCL417_381_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Surely nothing will be more pleasant in that city than this song to the glory of the grace of Christ, by whose blood we have been freed. There will the words be fulfilled: “Be still and see that I am God.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL417_381_2" id="target_note_LCL417_381_2"><sup>2</sup></a> That will truly be the greatest sabbath, a sabbath that has no evening. This sabbath God commended in the account of creation, where we read: “And God rested on the seventh day and hallowed it, because in it he rested from all his works which God began to make.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL417_381_3" id="target_note_LCL417_381_3"><sup>3</sup></a> We ourselves shall be the seventh day, when we shall be filled and refreshed by his blessing and sanctification. There we shall be still and see that it is he who is God, though we wanted to be that ourselves when we fell away from him, giving ear to the tempter’s words: “Ye shall be as gods.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL417_381_4" id="target_note_LCL417_381_4"><sup>4</sup></a> Thus we departed from the true God, though by his action we might really have been gods, by partaking of him and not departing from him. For without him what is it that we were doing except to be our own undoing by his wrath? Restored by him and perfected by greater grace we shall rest for ever, and see always that he is God, and we shall be filled with him when he himself shall be all in all. For even our good works, at the moment when they are known to be his rather than ours, are at once imputed to us in order that we may gain this sabbath.
