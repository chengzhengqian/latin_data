Saturn the giver of seed, or sower, and Liber and Libera who set in motion and discharge the seedsâ€”seeds
which are not worth a thought until they attain to life and sensation. But these gifts do not come from the select gods, but from some who are unknown and, when compared with the others in rank, neglected, not selected.</p>
<p>But the reply may be made that Janus has charge of all beginnings, and hence the opening made for the conception is not improperly assigned to him. They may say that Saturn has charge of all seeds, and hence the planting also of human seed cannot be severed from his activity, and that Liber and Libera have charge of releasing all seeds and so preside also over those that belong to the reproduction of men, and that Juno is in charge of all purgations and births, and so does not fail to assist in the purgations of women and the delivery of human offspring. Then let them consider what they should say of Vitumnus and Sentinus, whether they want them also to have charge of all things that live and feel. If they grant this power, let them take note how much higher they are going to place these gods. For to be born from seed is to be born on earth and from the earth, but they hold that life and sensation belong also to the gods of the heavenly bodies. And if they say that Vitumnus and Sentinus are assigned only to those beings who come alive in the flesh and are served by its senses, why does not that god who makes everything live and feel give life and sensation also to the flesh, granting, as part of his universal activity, this gift also to everything born? And then what need is there for Vitumnus and Sentinus?</p>
