said of his body: “Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up again.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL415_193_1" id="target_note_LCL415_193_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Moreover, the manner of his death, that is, the elevation of the cross, is conveyed in a single word, when he says, “You have risen high.” The evangelist expounds the next words, “You lay down and slept,” when he says, “And he bowed his head, and yielded up his spirit.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL415_193_2" id="target_note_LCL415_193_2"><sup>2</sup></a> If not, it certainly refers to his sepulchre, for in this he lay down and slept, and no man roused him, as the prophets roused certain men, and as he himself roused others, but he arose himself as if from sleep.</p>
<p>Again, the robe that he washes in wine implies that he washes away sins by his blood, for those who are baptized know the sacrament of his blood. For this reason also Israel adds: “And his garment in the blood of the grape”—what is this but the Church? “And his eyes red with wine” are the spiritual men who have drunk of his cup, of which the Psalm sings: “And thy cup that inebriates me, how glorious it is!”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL415_193_3" id="target_note_LCL415_193_3"><sup>3</sup></a> “And his teeth whiter than milk”—the milk that the little ones drink, as the Apostle says, means nourishing words, for they are not yet able to take solid food.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL415_193_4" id="target_note_LCL415_193_4"><sup>4</sup></a> It is he himself, then, in whom the promises made to Judah were stored up, and until these were fulfilled, princes, that is, kings of Israel, were never lacking in that line. “And it is he himself that the nations are awaiting”—this saying is clearer at first glance than it can be made by any exposition.</p>
