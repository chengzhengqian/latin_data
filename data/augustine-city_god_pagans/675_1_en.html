<span class="label"><span class="italic">On the creation of the universe, which is neither independent of time nor ordained by a new decision of God, as if he later chose to do what he formerly had not chosen to do.</span></span>
<p><span class="sc">Of</span> all visible things the universe is the greatest, just as God is the greatest of all that are invisible. But we behold the existence of the universe, while we only believe that God exists. Yet we have no more trustworthy witness than God himself to testify that he made the universe. Where did we hear him speak? Nowhere more clearly as yet than in the holy Scriptures, where his prophet said: “In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_435_1" id="target_note_LCL413_435_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Was this prophet there when God created the heaven and earth?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_435_2" id="target_note_LCL413_435_2"><sup>2</sup></a> No, but the wisdom of God, by which all things were created, was there; and this wisdom also passes into holy souls, making them friends of God and mouthpieces for him<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_435_3" id="target_note_LCL413_435_3"><sup>3</sup></a> and giving them noiselessly and inwardly an account of his works. The angels of God as well, who always behold the face of their Father<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_435_4" id="target_note_LCL413_435_4"><sup>4</sup></a> and announce his will to anyone whom it befits to know it, speak to them too. One among these was the prophet who said and wrote: “In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.” And so proper a witness is he to convince us that we should believe in God that, aided by the same spirit of God who revealed this truth for him to know, he also predicted so long beforehand the coming faith that was to be ours.</p>
