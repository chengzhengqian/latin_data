unexampled birth of his body from a virgin? This should be no obstacle either. On the contrary, it ought rather to be an inducement to you to embrace our faith, that a marvellous person was born in a marvellous way.</p>
<p>Or do you really refuse to believe, perhaps, that he bore aloft his body itself, laid aside in death, changed for the better in the resurrection, and now incorruptible and mortal no longer? Do you refuse to believe this because you see Porphyry so often insisting, in those very books <span class="italic">On the Return of the Soul</span> from which I have often quoted, that the soul must avoid all union with a body in order to abide forever happy with God? But it was rather Porphyry himself who was in need of correction when he held such a view, particularly inasmuch as you have such incredible notions in common with him concerning the soul of this visible world, that is, of so huge a corporeal mass. I mean that you follow Plato,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_389_1" id="target_note_LCL413_389_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and maintain that the universe is a living being, and not only alive but supremely happy, and you would even have it eternal. How then can it be that its soul will never be detached from its body and yet will never be deprived of happiness, if a soul to be happy must avoid every kind of body? There is the sun, too, and the other heavenly luminaries, which you acknowledge in your books are bodies, and all men join you in seeing this plainly and saying so without scruple. And in addition, you, with that higher wisdom that you claim, maintain that these are supremely happy beings that live forever united with their bodies. Why is it, then, that when the Christian faith is recommended to you, you immediately forget or pretend to be unacquainted
