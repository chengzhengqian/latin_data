worldly success that they love overmuch, and that men like Marius may be blessed in abundance with health, strength, wealth, high offices, respect and long life, and enjoy these blessings all their days, though the gods be wroth with them, and also the fact that men of the stamp of Regulus may be tormented by captivity, bondage, poverty, sleeplessness and pain, and die a cruel death, though the gods be friendly to them. If they grant this point, they confess in brief that the gods bring no advantage and that their worship is superfluous.</p>
<p>For granted that, instead of teaching the qualities of character and the honesty of a life whose rewards must be hopefully sought after death, they rather saw to it that just the opposite lessons were inculcated in the people, granted too that even in the sphere of these temporary and transitory blessings they neither injure any whom they hate nor advance the cause of any whom they love, to what end are they worshipped, to what end do those who are so eager to worship them demand the privilege? Why is there murmuring in periods of hardship and sorrow that they must have withdrawn because they were offended, so that for their sakes the Christian religion becomes the undeserving target of abuse? If, on the other hand, they are capable of doing good or harm in such matters, why did they assist the worst of men, Marius, but fail the best of men, Regulus, in such matters? Should we not conclude from this that they are utterly unjust and wicked? And if that is thought to be reason to fear and worship them the more, let the pagans not think that either, for it is not the case that Regulus worshipped the gods less than Marius.</p>
