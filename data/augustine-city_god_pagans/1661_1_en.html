materials can be gathered up and renewed as human flesh. They also follow up every kind of monstrosities and defects, whether accidental or congenital; with mingled horror and ridicule they mention monstrous births, and ask what will be the state of each deformed creature in the resurrection. For, if we say that no such deformity will belong to the resurrected body, they think that they will refute us by the marks of the wounds with which the Lord Christ arose. But among all these objections the most difficult question proposed is: Into whose flesh will the flesh return when under pressure of famine a man is kept alive by eating human flesh? For that flesh was changed into the flesh of the eater, and replaced a loss which was evident in his leanness. Will the flesh return to the man to whom it first belonged, or to the one who acquired it afterwards? They ask the question in order to mock at our belief in the resurrection, and in order, like Plato, either to promise the human soul an alternation of real unhappiness and false blessedness, or else, like Porphyry, to admit that after many cycles of living again and again in different bodies the soul at last ends its miseries, and never returns to them, not, however, that it has now an immortal body, but that it escapes having any kind of body.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL417_271_1" id="target_note_LCL417_271_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
