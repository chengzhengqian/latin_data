In his controversy with the Pelagians Augustine argued that just as no one, child or adult, could enter the kingdom of God unless he was “born of water and of the Spirit” (that is, baptized), so he could not have eternal life without “eating of the flesh” and “drinking the blood” of Christ (that is, without communion).
