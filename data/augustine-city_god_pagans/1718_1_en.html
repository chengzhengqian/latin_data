each of these separate ages studiously at this time is too long a task. But this seventh will be our sabbath, and its end will not be an evening, but the Lordâ€™s Day, an eighth eternal day, sanctified by the resurrection of Christ, which prefigures the eternal rest of both spirit and body. There we shall be still and see, shall see and love, shall love and praise. Behold what shall be in the end without end! For what else is our end, except to reach the kingdom which has no end?</p>
<p>In my judgement I have, with the help of the Lord, discharged my debt of completing this huge work. May those who think it too little or too much, forgive me; and may those who think it just enough rejoice and give thanks, not to me, but with me, to God. Amen. Amen.</p>
