of Edom, was born in the land of Edom and died there. Now he is so praised by the divine pronouncement that for justice and piety no man of his era is set on his level.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL416_55_1" id="target_note_LCL416_55_1"><sup>1</sup></a> And although we do not find his date in the Chronicles, yet we gather from the book about him, which the Jews admitted to canonical authority as if it had been their own, and deservedly, that he belonged to the third generation after Israel.</p>
<p>And I do not doubt that it was divinely provided by this one example that we should know that there could be also scattered among other peoples men who lived as followers of God and found favour with him, being members of the spiritual Jerusalem. But we must not suppose that this was granted to any one unless there was revealed to him the one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL416_55_2" id="target_note_LCL416_55_2"><sup>2</sup></a> whose coming in the flesh was foretold to the saints of old, just as his having come has been proclaimed to us, so that one and the same faith may lead through him to God all who are predestined to enter the city of God, the house of God, the temple of God. But whatsoever prophecies of other men regarding the grace of God through Jesus Christ are cited may be thought to have been forged by the Christians. Therefore there is no surer means of convincing “aliens” of whatever country, if they dispute about this matter, and of making them one with us, if they are really wise, than to bring forward the divine prophecies about Christ written in the books of the Jews, by whose expulsion from their own homes and dispersion throughout the whole world, in order to bear this witness, the church of Christ has increased in every region.</p>
