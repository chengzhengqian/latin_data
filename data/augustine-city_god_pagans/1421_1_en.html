<p><span class="sc">Since</span> we are about to speak concerning God’s final judgement day, as he may allow, and to affirm its truth in face of the impious and the unbelievers, we ought first to lay down as the foundation of our edifice the evidence of God’s word. Those who are unwilling to believe that evidence strive to contravene it with false and fallacious quibbles of man’s devising, arguing either that some evidence adduced from the sacred Scriptures has a different meaning or that such evidence is not God’s word in the first place. For I suppose that no man who understands these utterances and believes that they were spoken by the most high and true God through holy souls fails to yield and agree with them, whether he expressly confesses his agreement, or because of some fault is ashamed or afraid to do so, or even with a stubbornness akin to madness sets himself to defend most strenuously what he knows or believes to be false against what he knows or believes to be true.</p>
