<p><span class="sc">Our</span> adversaries are wont to question us very closely, and in their questioning to ridicule our belief in the resurrection of the flesh. They ask whether abortive foetuses will rise again; they quote the words of the Lord: “Verily I say unto you, not a hair of your head shall perish,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL417_267_1" id="target_note_LCL417_267_1"><sup>1</sup></a> then ask whether all will have equal height and strength, or will have different bodily sizes.

For we will not deny the resurrection of any who are capable both of being born, and of being born again in baptism. Then they ask what will be the size of our bodies, if all are to be equal. For if all are to be as large and as tall as the largest and tallest have been here, the problem concerns not only infants, but also the majority of men—from what source will come the portion which was lacking here, if each one is to receive what he had here.</p>
