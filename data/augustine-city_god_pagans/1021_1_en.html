in the holy <span class="italic">Song of Songs</span> Christ’s bride, the City of God, sings: “Set affection in due order within me.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_547_1a" id="target_note_LCL414_547_1a"><sup>1</sup></a> Thus the sons of God disturbed the due ordering of this affection, that is, of attachment and love, when they became detached from God and attached to the daughters of men.</p>
<p>These two epithets are enough to mark the contrast between the two cities. For the sons of God too were sons of men by nature, but they began to have another name by grace. In the same passage of Scripture, where the sons of God are said to have loved the daughters of men, they are also called angels of God.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_547_2" id="target_note_LCL414_547_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Hence many think that they were not men but angels.</p>

Augustine’s text seemingly follows the Septuagint, which reads here: τάξατε ἐπ᾿ ἐμὲ ἀγάπην. But the latter version apparently means: “Set in order (<span class="italic">or</span> array) your love toward me.” In his interpretation of the quotation Augustine attempts to make it conform to the important concept of <span class="italic">ordinata dilectio</span> discussed in his <span class="italic">De Doctrina Christiana</span> 1.27.28. He may have been influenced to adopt this explanation of the passage by Origen’s comment on the verse in his <span class="italic">Homiliae in Canticum Canticorum</span> (translated by Jerome into Latin) 2.8, edited by W. A. Baehrens in <span class="italic">Origenes Werke</span> (1925), vol. 8, pp. 52–53, and, more fully, in the third book of his <span class="italic">Commentarium in Canticum Canticorum</span> (translated by Rufinus into Latin), edited by W.
