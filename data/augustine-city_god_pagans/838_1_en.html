<span class="label"><span class="italic">What man was like as created by God and into what condition he Jell through the free exercise of his own will.</span></span>
<p><span class="sc">God</span> created man upright, for He is the author of natural beings, not, surely, of their defects. Man, however, when he was willingly corrupted and justly condemned, engendered corrupt and condemned offspring. For we were all in that one man since all of us were that one man who fell into sin through the woman who was made from him before sin. We did not yet have individually created and apportioned shapes in which to live as individuals; what already existed was the seminal substance from which we were to be generated. Obviously, when this substance was debased through sin and shackled with the bond of death in just condemnation, no man could be born of man in any other condition. Thus from the abuse of free will has come the linked sequence of our disaster, by which the human race is conducted through an uninterrupted succession of miseries from that original depravity, as it were from a diseased root, all the way to the catastrophe of the second death that has no end. Only those who are freed through the grace of God are exempt from this fate.</p>
