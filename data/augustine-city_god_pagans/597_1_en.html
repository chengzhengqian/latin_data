<span class="label"><span class="italic">The holy angels have such love for us that they want us to be worshippers, not of themselves, but of the one true God.</span></span>
<p><span class="sc">Well</span> may those immortal and blessed beings established in heavenly abodes, rejoicing together in their union with their creator, enjoying security because he is eternal, certainty because of his truth, and sanctity by his gift, be unwilling that we should sacrifice to themselves, choosing rather that we should sacrifice to him whose sacrifice they know themselves to be along with us, for they mercifully love us mortal and wretched creatures to the end that we may be immortal and blessed. For with them we form one city of God, the city to whom it is said in the Psalm: “Glorious things are spoken of thee, Ο city of God.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_279_1" id="target_note_LCL413_279_1"><sup>1</sup></a> This city has two divisions, one consisting of us, sojourning in an alien land, the other of them, lending us their aid. It is, be it noted, from that city on high where God’s will, intelligible and immutable, is the law, from that lofty senate, so to speak, of caretakers (<span class="italic">curia</span>)—for care (<span class="italic">cura</span>) is there taken for us<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_279_2" id="target_note_LCL413_279_2"><sup>2</sup></a>—that
