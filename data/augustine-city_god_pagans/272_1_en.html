in the life of twins: in their actions, their fortunes, their professions, their trades, their honours and in all the other things pertaining to human life and even in their death? It commonly happens that in these respects the twins resemble many strangers more than they resemble each other. And yet in birth they were separated by a very brief interval of time, and in conception they were begotten at one moment, by one act of intercourse.</p>

Like the earlier Stoics he was a defender of divination and he wrote five books on the subject. Cicero says that all the Stoics except Panaetius accepted astrology, thus confirming what is here said of Posidonius. See Cicero, <span class="italic">De divinatione,</span> 1.6 and 2.87, pp. 229, 471 in the Loeb edition. Stoics and astrologers had similar views on fate, the unity of the world, and the “sympathy” between its parts. The doctrine of sympathy is supposed to have been given a scientific basis by Posidonius’ discovery, on a visit to the Atlantic at Cadiz, of the connection between the tides and the phases of the moon. The fragments of Posidonius are meagre, with very little on astrology except what is said here.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL412_139_2a').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
