“And your life is hidden with Christ in God”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL415_237_1" id="target_note_LCL415_237_1"><sup>1</sup></a>—see then how God gives life to these same persons! But were those whom he brought down to the grave and those whom he restored to life the same persons? Certainly, for there is no question among believers but that we see both these acts fulfilled in his case—and
note that he is our head—with whom the Apostle says our life is hidden in God. For he who “did not spare his own son, but delivered him up for us all,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL415_237_2" id="target_note_LCL415_237_2"><sup>2</sup></a> in this act surely put him to death, and in that he raised him from the dead, restored him to life again. Furthermore, inasmuch as his voice is recognized in the prophecy: “Thou wilt not leave my soul in hell,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL415_237_3" id="target_note_LCL415_237_3"><sup>3</sup></a> it was one and the same person whom he brought down to the grave and whom he restored to life. By his poverty we are enriched. For “the Lord makes men poor and enriches them.” To understand what this means, let us hear the words that follow: “He humbles and exalts them,” which surely means that he humbles the proud and exalts the humble. For what we read in another passage: “God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL415_237_4" id="target_note_LCL415_237_4"><sup>4</sup></a> is the burden of the whole speech of the woman whose name signifies his grace.</p>
<p>But the words added at this point: “He raises up the poor man from the earth,” I think apply to no one better than to him who “for our sake became poor, when he was rich, that by his poverty,” as was said shortly before, “we might be enriched.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL415_237_5" id="target_note_LCL415_237_5"><sup>5</sup></a> For he raised that same body from the earth so quickly that his flesh did not see corruption. Nor will I deny the application to him of the words that follow: “And he lifts up the needy from the dung.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL415_237_6" id="target_note_LCL415_237_6"><sup>6</sup></a> “The needy”
