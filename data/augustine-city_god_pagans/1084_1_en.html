the prophets heralded. The first of these promises reads as follows: “And the Lord said to Abram: ‘Depart from your land and from your kindred and from your father’s house and go into the land that I shall show you; and I will make of you a great nation, and will bless you, and make your name great, and you shall be blessed, and I will bless those that bless you and curse those that curse you, and in you shall all the tribes of the earth be blessed.’”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL415_89_1" id="target_note_LCL415_89_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

For he could not have departed thence, unless he had lived there previously. Is there, then, any real contradiction in Stephen’s words: “The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia, before he lived in
