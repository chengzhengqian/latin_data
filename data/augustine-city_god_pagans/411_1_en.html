to sucking animals, especially since there was also a goddess Rumina to furnish her help and service for this work. For I think the reply can be made that Juno herself is none other than Jupiter, according to these verses of Valerius Soranus, where it is said:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">Jupiter, mighty Father of kings and of gods and</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">of all things,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Mother as well of the gods . . .</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">Why then was he also called Ruminus, when, if perhaps we were to inquire more carefully, we might find that he is also identical with the goddess Rumina? If there was good reason for supposing it unsuitable to the dignity of the gods, in the case of one stalk of wheat, that one god should have the care of the knots, another that of the sheath, how much more unworthy is it that one low task, namely, to see that animals get nourishment from the breast, should require the power of two deities. One of them was Jupiter, himself king of all things, and he performed this task not along with his wife, but with some unknown Rumina. Unless he is himself Rumina—Ruminus perhaps for suckling males and Rumina for females. Of course I might say that they were unwilling to give Jupiter a woman’s name, except that it was said of him in those verses I quoted, “Father and Mother as well,” and except that among his other names I have read that he was also called Pecunia. I found this goddess among those petty gods, and have mentioned her in the fourth book.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL412_417_1" id="target_note_LCL412_417_1"><sup>1</sup></a> But since both males and females have money, why was Jupiter not called both Pecunia and Pecunius, as he is called Rumina and Ruminus? I leave the answer to them.</p>
