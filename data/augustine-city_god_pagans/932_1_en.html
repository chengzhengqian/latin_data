<span class="label"><span class="italic">On the utterly absurd indecency of the Cynics.</span></span>
<p><span class="sc">Those</span> canine philosophers, or Cynics,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_369_1" id="target_note_LCL414_369_1"><sup>1</sup></a> were not aware of this fact when they expounded a view offensive to human modesty, a view that can only be termed canine, that is, base and shameless. They held that since the act is lawful when it is done with a wife, no one should feel ashamed to do it openly and engage in marital intercourse on any street or square. Nevertheless, our natural sense of shame has been victorious over this heretical notion. There is, to be sure, a tradition that Diogenes once ostentatiously performed such an act because he thought that his school would win more publicity in this way, that is, if its shamelessness was more sensationally impressed upon the memory of mankind.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_369_2" id="target_note_LCL414_369_2"><sup>2</sup></a> The later Cynics, however, have abandoned any such practice, and modesty has prevailed over error, that is, the instinct among men to feel ashamed before other men has prevailed over the doctrine that men should make it their aim to be like dogs.</p>
<p>Hence I prefer to think that Diogenes and others who reputedly did such a thing rather acted out the motions of lying together before the eyes of men who really did not know what was done under the cloak, I do not believe that there could have been any achievement of such pleasure under the glare of human gaze. For those philosophers did not blush to seem willing to lie together in a place where lust itself would have blushed to rear its head. Even now we see that there are still Cynic philosophers
