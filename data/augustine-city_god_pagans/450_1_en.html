religion, still, by offering any sort of explanation derived from nature they might have mitigated to some slight degree the offence caused by any shameful or absurd features of the rites whose meaning was not understood. Such was Varro’s purpose in attempting to explain certain fables of the theatre or mysteries performed in the temples. In this Varro did not justify the theatre by showing its similarity to the temples, but rather condemned the temples because they were like the theatres.

The first was empty, but the second contained two bundles of books (which appeared to be quite new, <span class="italic">recentissima specie</span>), seven in Latin on pontifical law, seven in Greek on philosophy, recognized as Pythagorean.
