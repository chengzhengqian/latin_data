<span class="label"><span class="italic">Of those who fix the rule that those who persevere in the Catholic faith, though they live most wickedly and hence deserve to burn, nevertheless will be saved for keeping the foundation of faith.</span></span>
<p><span class="sc">There</span> are those who because of the passage, “He that endureth to the end shall be saved,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL417_105_1" id="target_note_LCL417_105_1"><sup>1</sup></a> promise this only to those who persevere in the Catholic Church, however wickedly they live in it. That is, they are to be saved as through fire by the merit of the foundation, of which the Apostle speaks: “For other foundation can no one lay than that which is laid, which is Christ Jesus. But if anyone build on the foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble, each one’s work will be made manifest, for the day will declare it, because it is revealed in fire and the fire will prove each one’s work, of what sort it is. If anyone’s work shall abide which he built thereon, he will receive a reward. But if anyone’s work shall be burned he will suffer loss, but he himself will be saved, yet so as through fire.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL417_105_2" id="target_note_LCL417_105_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Hence they say that a Catholic Christian, be his life what it may, has Christ as his foundation, a foundation that no heresy can have, cut off as it is from the unity of his body. And so they think that even if his life be evil, as was his who built with wood, hay or stubble, the Catholic Christian will be saved through fire. That is, he will be freed after a punishment in that fire by which the wicked will be punished in the last judgement.</p>
