is what they do. On the one hand, they maintain with great force of argument that the soul, in order to be happy, must keep clear not only of an earthly body but of every kind of body, and, on the other hand, they declare that the gods have souls which are supremely happy and yet bound up with eternal bodies, that is, celestial souls which are bound up with bodies of fire,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_197_1" id="target_note_LCL414_197_1"><sup>1</sup></a> while the soul of Jupiter himself, whom they identify with the universe, is wholly contained in the sum total of material elements that constitute the entire structure which extends from earth to heaven.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_197_2" id="target_note_LCL414_197_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Plato holds the view that this soul of Jupiter spreads and extends by musical ratios from the earth’s innermost core or centre, as it is called by geometricians, through all its parts to the highest and furthest reaches of heaven.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_197_3" id="target_note_LCL414_197_3"><sup>3</sup></a> And thus, according to him, this universe is an everlasting living thing of the greatest magnitude and happiness; for its soul possesses the perfect bliss of wisdom and does not abandon its own body, while the body is for ever animated by the soul and, although it is not simple but composed of so many large bodies, has no power to make the soul sluggish or slothful.</p>
<p>Therefore, since these philosophers allow so much to their own speculations, why are they unwilling to believe that God’s will and power can make earthly bodies immortal and that souls can live everlastingly and happily in them, inseparable from them by any death and undepressed by their weight? After all, they do maintain that such a life is possible for their gods in bodies of fire and for Jupiter himself, king of the gods, in the whole mass of material elements.
