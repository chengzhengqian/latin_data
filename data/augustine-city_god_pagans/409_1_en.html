Soranus wrote, “Jupiter, mighty Father, and Mother as well,” and with equally good reason described him as one God, comprising all others. For the universe is one, and all things are in that one.</p>

<span class="label"><span class="italic">Whether the distinction between Janus and Jupiter is justified.</span></span>
<p><span class="sc">Therefore</span>, since Janus is the world, and Jupiter is the world, and there is one world, why are there two gods, Janus and Jupiter? Why do they have separate temples, separate altars, different sacred rites, and unlike statues? Is it because power over beginnings is one thing and power over causes another, so that the name Janus is given to the former, Jupiter to the latter? Well, if one man should have two capacities in different fields, or two crafts, should we speak of two judges, or two artisans, because the capacities are different in the two fields? So when one god himself has power over beginnings and over causes, must we then think that he is two gods because beginnings and causes are two things? But if they think that this is right, they should also say that Jupiter himself is as many gods as the number of cult-titles they have given him on account of his many functions. For all together the things that account for those cult-titles are extremely numerous and varied. I shall mention a few of them.</p>
