And many of those who sleep in the mound of earth shall arise, some to life everlasting, and some to shame and confusion everlasting. And the wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament, and many of the just as the stars for ever and ever.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL416_401_1" id="target_note_LCL416_401_1"><sup>1</sup></a> This passage is very similar to that already quoted from the gospel,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL416_401_2" id="target_note_LCL416_401_2"><sup>2</sup></a> at least as regards the resurrection of dead bodies. For those who are there described as being “in the graves” are here said to be “sleeping in the mound of earth,” or, as others translate, “in the dust of earth”; and just as it is there said that they “shall come forth,” so here they “shall arise”; and just as there “they who have done good deeds, to the resurrection of life, but they who have done evil deeds, to the resurrection of judgement,” so in this passage, “some to life everlasting, and some to shame and confusion everlasting.” Nor should it be supposed that there is a difference in that, whereas the gospel refers to “all who are in the graves,” the prophet does not speak of all but of “many of them who sleep in the mound of earth.” For Scripture sometimes uses “many” for “all.” Thus it was said to Abraham: “I have made you the father of many nations,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL416_401_3" id="target_note_LCL416_401_3"><sup>3</sup></a> but in another passage: “By your seed shall all nations be blessed.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL416_401_4" id="target_note_LCL416_401_4"><sup>4</sup></a> Of such a resurrection it is said a little later, also, to this prophet Daniel himself: “You, too, come and rest; for there is still a day before the completion of the consummation, and you shall rest and rise again at your allotted time at the end of days.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL416_401_5" id="target_note_LCL416_401_5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
