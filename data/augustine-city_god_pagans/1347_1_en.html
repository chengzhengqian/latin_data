Now these four,—pleasure, repose, the two together, the primary wants of nature,—exist in us in such a fashion that virtue (which education subsequently implants) is desirable for their sake, or they are desirable for the sake of virtue, or both for their own sakes; so twelve sects arise, since by this principle of classification we get in each case three sub-classes. I will give the proof in one case, and it will not be hard to discover a proof for the rest. Since, then, physical pleasure is either subjected to mental virtue, or is put above it, or is bracketed with it, we have a threefold division of sects. Now bodily pleasure is subjected to virtue when it is taken into the service of virtue. For example, it is an obligation of virtue to live for one’s fatherland and to beget sons for one’s fatherland, neither of which can be done without bodily pleasure; for without it food and drink cannot be taken for the sake of life, nor can sexual intercourse take place for the sake of procreation.
