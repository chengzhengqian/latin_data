death of the poor and pious man while the dogs licked his sores than that of the wicked rich man, clothed in purple and fine linen, what harm did those terrible deaths do to the dead who had lived well?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL411_59_1" id="target_note_LCL411_59_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<span class="label"><span class="italic">On the burial of men’s bodies and that Christians lose nothing even if burial be denied.</span></span>
<p><span class="sc">What</span> about the fact that when so many were slaughtered the corpses could not even be buried? This does not overmuch dismay a religious faith, holding to the promise that not even devouring beasts will be prejudicial to bodies that are to rise again, for not a hair of their head will perish. In no wise could Truth say: “Fear not men who kill the body but are not able to kill the soul,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL411_59_2" id="target_note_LCL411_59_2"><sup>2</sup></a> if anything that the enemy had chosen to do with the bodies of the slain could be prejudicial to a future life.</p>
<p>Perhaps, however, someone is so foolish as to maintain that those who kill the body ought not to inspire fear before death that they will kill the body, and yet ought to inspire fear that after death they will not permit the body when slain to be buried? If so, then what Christ says is false: “Those who slay the body and after that can do no more,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL411_59_3" id="target_note_LCL411_59_3"><sup>3</sup></a> if they can indeed do to us as much as they do to our bodies. Far be it from us to think that what Truth has said is false! For it is said that they do something to us when they kill us, because there is sensation in the body when they kill it, but after that they have nothing they can do because there is no sensation in a body once slain.</p>
