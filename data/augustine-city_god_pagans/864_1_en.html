difference between these two men, saying: “The first man is of the earth, earthly, the second man is of heaven. As is the man of earth, so also are those who are of the earth; as is the man of heaven, so also are those who are of heaven. And even as we have put on the image of the man of earth, let us also put on the image of the man who is from heaven.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_233_1" id="target_note_LCL414_233_1"><sup>1</sup></a> The Apostle expressed himself in this way in order that the sacrament of regeneration may even now find fulfilment in us, just as he states elsewhere: “As many of you as were baptized in the name of Christ have put on Christ.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_233_2" id="target_note_LCL414_233_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Actually, however, this will be consummated only when in us too that which is animal through birth has become spiritual through resurrection. For, to quote his words again: “In hope we were saved.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_233_3" id="target_note_LCL414_233_3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>We put on the image of the man of earth by lineal transmission of sin and death, a legacy imposed on us by birth; on the other hand, we shall put on the image of the heavenly man by the grace of forgiveness and of eternal life. This we receive by rebirth, but only through the Mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_233_4" id="target_note_LCL414_233_4"><sup>4</sup></a> In him the Apostle intends us to see the heavenly man because he came from heaven to be clothed with a body of earthly mortality in order that he might clothe it in heavenly immortality. But his reason for using the term ‘heavenly’ of others too is that they become His members through grace, and thus Christ is united with them, even as a head with its body.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_233_5" id="target_note_LCL414_233_5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
