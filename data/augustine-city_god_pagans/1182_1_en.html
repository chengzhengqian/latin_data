known, and yet we read in this psalm, not to mention anything else: “He shall reign from sea to sea and from the river even to the ends of the earth,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL415_285_1" id="target_note_LCL415_285_1"><sup>1</sup></a> which we see fulfilled in Christ. It was indeed from the river that he set out on his course of being Lord, the river where, after his baptism by John, who also pointed him out, he first obtained recognition from his disciples, who called him not only “Teacher,” but also “Lord.”</p>
<p>Now the only reason why Solomon began to reign while his father David was still living, which did not occur in the case of any other of their kings, was to make it completely clear by this means also that he himself was not the person indicated by that prophecy which is addressed to his father in these words: “And it shall come to pass, when your days have been accomplished and you sleep with your fathers, that I will raise up your seed after you, the fruit of your loins, and will prepare his kingdom.” In view of this, how will it be possible to assume that we have a prophecy of Solomon because of the following words: “He shall build me a house,” instead of understanding rather from what precedes: “When your days have been accomplished and you sleep with your fathers, I will raise up your seed after you,” that another peacemaker is promised, whose elevation was to take place, according to the prophecy, not before David’s death, but after? For no matter how long it was to be before Jesus Christ came, there is no doubt that it was after the death of king David, to whom this promise was given, that he should come who would build a house for God, not of wood and stone, but of men, the sort of house that we rejoice
