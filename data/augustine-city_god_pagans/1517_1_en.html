you shall know that the Lord almighty has sent me.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL416_441_1" id="target_note_LCL416_441_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Now behold: the Lord almighty says that he was sent by the Lord almighty. Who dare understand these words save of Christ speaking to the lost sheep of the house of Israel? For he says in the gospel: “I am not sent save to the lost sheep of the house of Israel,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL416_441_2" id="target_note_LCL416_441_2"><sup>2</sup></a> which he has compared here to the pupil of God’s eye to show his outstanding feeling of affection, for the apostles themselves were sheep of this kind.

<p>Likewise, speaking through the same prophet, the Lord says: “And it shall be in that day that I shall seek to do away with all the nations that come against Jerusalem, and I will pour over the house of David and over the inhabitants of Jerusalem the spirit of grace and mercy; and they shall look upon me because they have insulted me, and they shall
