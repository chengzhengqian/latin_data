creatures dwelling in the holy precincts of heaven, “whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_129_1" id="target_note_LCL413_129_1"><sup>1</sup></a> from whom they are as far removed in the feelings that rule their heart as is vice from virtue and malice from goodwill.</p>

<span class="label"><span class="italic">Concerning what holy angels and good men can have in common.</span></span>
<p>So there is no need at all to take a roundabout route through the fancied mediation of demons in order to secure the good will or the good offices of gods, or rather of good angels; the right way is through resembling them in good will, which enables us to be with them, to live with them, and to worship with them the God they worship, even if we cannot see them with the eyes of the flesh. But in as far as we are wretched because we are unlike them in our will, and our weakness makes us frail, in so far are we much inferior to them in our standard of life, rather than in the spatial position of our bodies. For our failure to be united to them is not due to our dwelling on earth through the limitations of our flesh, but is due rather to the uncleanness of our hearts with which we mind earthly things.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_129_2" id="target_note_LCL413_129_2"><sup>2</sup></a> But while we are being healed, so that we may be as they themselves are, during this period we come close to them through our faith, if, with the help that they themselves also provide, we believe that we are receiving the blessing of happiness from him who had already conferred it upon them.</p>
