<p>Yet, despite this belief, such as it was, Porphyry did not go so far as to teach also that these souls should not pay pious homage to gods with bodies. Why so, unless because he did not believe that these souls, although they were accompanied by no body, were superior to those gods? Therefore, if those philosophers will not venture, as I do not think they will, to rank human souls above gods who are supremely happy and yet endowed with everlasting bodies, why do they consider the message of Christianity so absurd, when it declares that the first human beings too were so created that, had they not sinned, no death would have parted them from their bodies? Rather they would have received as a reward for maintaining obedience the gift of immortality and would have lived joined to their bodies for ever. Moreover, the saints will possess at resurrection those very bodies in which they toiled in this life; and their bodies will be such that neither shall any deterioration or handicap affect their flesh nor any grief or misfortune their bliss.</p>
