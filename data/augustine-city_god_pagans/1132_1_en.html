<p>Now seventy-five persons are said to have entered Egypt together with Jacob himself, counting Jacob along with his children. In this number only two women are listed, one a daughter and the other a granddaughter.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL415_185_2a" id="target_note_LCL415_185_2a"><sup>2</sup></a> But a careful scrutiny of the data does not indicate that Jacob’s progeny had reached this large number by the day or the year when he entered Egypt. For indeed even the great-grandsons of Joseph are listed with the rest, and these absolutely could not have been living at this time, for Jacob was then a hundred and thirty years old, and his son Joseph thirty-nine. Since it is known that Joseph took his wife in his thirtieth year or later, how could he have had great-grandsons within nine years through the sons that he begot of this wife? Since Joseph’s sons Ephraim and Manasseh did not have sons at this time, but Jacob found them as boys less than nine years old when he came to Egypt, how does it happen that not only their sons, but even their grandsons are counted among those seventy-five
