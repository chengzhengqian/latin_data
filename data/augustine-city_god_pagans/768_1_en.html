would they have lapsed from this good will if they had been truly unwilling to do so.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if good angels existed first without a good will and if they created it in themselves without the help of God, then they were made better by themselves than by him. Heaven forbid! For without a good will they could only have been evil. Or if they were not evil for the reason that an evil was not in them either, since they had not lapsed from the good will which they had not yet come to possess, at any rate they were not yet of such sort, that is, not yet as good as they were as soon as they had a good will. But if they were incapable of making themselves better than they were created by him whose work is improved upon by none, then surely the good will also, which was an improvement in them, could not have been in their possession without the co-operative help of their creator.</p>
<p>Granted that the good will of these angels had for its effect this, that they turned not to themselves who had less being but to him who has supreme being and that by clinging to him they had more being and by communion with him lived a wise and happy life, what else does this mean but that the will, however good, would have remained destitute with only its desire, except that he who created out of nothing a good being, fitted to receive him, went on making it better by filling it with himself, having already awakened in it a greater yearning for him?</p>
<p>Moreover, we have another point that demands discussion. Supposing that the good angels were alone responsible for creating the good will in themselves, was it with or without a will that they did this?
