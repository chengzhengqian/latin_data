earthly bodies there are, such as lead, which can nevertheless receive a shape from the artisan that will make them float on the water. Is the heavenly Artisan, then, denied the power to give the human body such properties as will make it soar heavenward and exist in that element?</p>
<p>Now against the argument that I have just used, no examination or discussion of the order of elements, in which they put their trust, affords any basis for a reply. For though the earth, beginning with our level, is first, water second, air third and heaven fourth, above all these is the natural substance of soul.

Finer than all, what is it doing in this coarse mass? Lighter than all, what is it doing in this dead weight? Swifter than all, what is it doing in this sluggish frame? Should not the virtue of its pre-eminent nature be able to accomplish the task of lifting its body to heaven?

<p>Now if we turn to the miracles wrought by their gods, which they set against those wrought by our martyrs, will not these also be found to speak on our behalf, and contribute to our argument?
