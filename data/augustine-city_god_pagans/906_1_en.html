fear, however, that endures forever,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_317_1" id="target_note_LCL414_317_1"><sup>1</sup></a> if it is to be present in the world to come (and how else can it be understood to endure for ever?) is not a fear that frightens a person away from an evil that may happen, but a fear that keeps him in a good that cannot be lost.</p>
<p>Where the love of a good thing attained is unchangeable, there surely, if the expression is possible, the fear of an evil to be avoided is carefree.
