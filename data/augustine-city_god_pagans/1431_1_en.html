<p>In like manner he said to his disciples: “Verily I say to you that have followed me, in the rebirth, when the Son of Man shall sit on the throne of his glory, you shall also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL416_269_1" id="target_note_LCL416_269_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Here we learn that Jesus shall judge with his disciples. Wherefore he said elsewhere to the Jews: “If I cast out demons by Beelzebub, by whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore they shall be your judges.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL416_269_2" id="target_note_LCL416_269_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Nor should we suppose that only twelve men shall judge with him, because he says that they shall sit on twelve thrones. For the number twelve is a symbol of the total number of the multitude of those who shall judge. For the two parts, three and four, of the number seven, by which totality is generally signified, when multiplied into one another, give twelve. For thrice four, or four times three, are twelve, not to mention any other analyses of this number twelve that support this interpretation. Otherwise, since we read that Matthias was ordained an apostle in the place of the traitor Judas,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL416_269_3" id="target_note_LCL416_269_3"><sup>3</sup></a> the apostle Paul, who laboured more than them all,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL416_269_4" id="target_note_LCL416_269_4"><sup>4</sup></a> will have no throne of judgement; yet he certainly shows that he belongs with the other saints in the number of the judges when he says: “Know you not that we shall judge angels?”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL416_269_5" id="target_note_LCL416_269_5"><sup>5</sup></a> A like principle holds in the application of the number twelve to those who are to be judged. For although it was said, “judging the twelve tribes of Israel,” the tribe of Levi, which is the thirteenth tribe, is not therefore exempt from judgement by them, nor will they judge only that people, and not the other nations as well. And when he said, “in the rebirth” he meant, beyond doubt, that word to be understood as meaning the resurrection of the dead;
