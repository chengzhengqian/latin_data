of his works, but by his rest, which has no evening since it is not a created thing; not being known, like created things, one way in the Word of God and another way in itself, it does not give rise to a twofold knowledge, one a daylight knowledge, as it were, the other a twilight knowledge.</p>
<p>Assuredly more could be said about the perfection of the number seven, but this book is already prolix and I am also in danger of appearing to take advantage of the opportunity to parade my scrap of knowledge with more vanity than profit. So I must observe moderation and gravity lest, in dwelling at length on number, I be convicted of neglecting measure and weight. Accordingly let it suffice to observe that the first odd integer is three, that four is the first even integer, and that the sum of these is seven. For this reason seven is often used to indicate universality, as in: “A righteous man will fall seven times, and will rise again,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_555_1" id="target_note_LCL413_555_1"><sup>1</sup></a> meaning: However many times he may fall, he will not perish—a passage that was not meant to be taken as referring to sins, but to the kind of trouble that inculcates humility. So it is also in “Seven times a day will I praise thee,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_555_2" id="target_note_LCL413_555_2"><sup>2</sup></a> which appears elsewhere in the form: “His praise shall be continually in my mouth.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_555_3" id="target_note_LCL413_555_3"><sup>3</sup></a> Many such passages are found in the sacred writers, where the number seven, as I have said, is customarily employed to express universality or completeness in every sphere. For this reason the same number is often used to indicate the Holy Spirit, of whom the Lord said: “He will teach you the whole truth.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_555_4" id="target_note_LCL413_555_4"><sup>4</sup></a> In this number is God’s rest, the rest that we find in him. Rest, it is understood, is in a whole, that is in complete
