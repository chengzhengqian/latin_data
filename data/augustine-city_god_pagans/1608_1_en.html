has courted the saints with the mammon of unrighteousness. This term refers to money or riches that are wrongly acquired—or, if properly acquired, still not true riches, but what unrighteousness supposes to be riches, not knowing what are the true riches of which those had a superfluity who receive others with them into eternal tabernacles. And so there is a certain manner of life which is neither so wicked that those who live it cannot be helped to reach the kingdom of heaven by their generous almsgiving (by which not only is the poverty of the righteous supported, but friends are also gained to receive the givers into eternal tabernacles), nor so good that it is sufficient of itself to gain so great happiness, unless they obtain mercy by the merits of those whose friendship they gain.</p>
