grave from gay, and things that men should seek from those that they should reject. We are aware of their purpose. They recognize that the mythical theology of the theatres derives from the civil theology and is reflected like an image of it in the mirror provided by the songs of the poets. So after expounding the theology that they dare not condemn they go on to refute and censure its image with less restraint. Thus those who detect their purpose will also detest the real face of which the other is an image. The gods themselves, however, seeing their own faces, so to speak, in the same mirror, are so much in love with the image that their identity and character stand out clearer if we keep in view both the original and the image. This has moved them to force their worshippers by dire threats to dedicate to them the indecencies of the mythical theology, to give these a place in their solemn festivals, and to include them in the class of “Divine Things.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL412_347_1" id="target_note_LCL412_347_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Furthermore, in doing this they have revealed more clearly that they are unclean spirits, and this theology of the theatre, though worthless and condemned, they have made an organic part of the civil theology, which passes as superior and approved. Thus their theology as a whole is base and deceiving and filled with imaginary gods, one part of it being found in the writings of the priests and the other in the songs of the poets. Whether it has other parts as well is another question. I am now following Varro’s division and have given sufficient proof, I think, that his theology of the city and that of the theatre both belong to the one civil theology. Hence, since both are equally foul.
