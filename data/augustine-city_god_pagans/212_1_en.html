taken in their case that, when they were given an opportunity to escape from their previous way of life by casting their lot with a city-state, they might cease to dwell on the penalties that were in store for them, might no longer be driven by such terror to greater crimes, and so in the future be less hostile to society.</p>
<p>I shall, however, mention an affair by which the Roman Empire itself, after it had become great by the conquest of many nations and was a menace to the rest, was sorely hurt and profoundly alarmed. This was a revolt which the Romans suppressed, averting major disaster only by a great effort, when a very few gladiators escaped from their school in Campania, gathered a large army under three generals, and ravaged Italy far and wide with the utmost savagery.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL412_19_1" id="target_note_LCL412_19_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Now let them tell us what god helped those men to rise from a small and negligible robber band to be a kingdom that the Romans had to fear, great as their forces had become, and numerous their citadels? Will they say that because the rebels did not long hold out they were not helped by the gods? As if the life of any man were long! By that reasoning the gods help no one to rule, for each individual dies in a little while, and you must not count as a benefit a thing that vanishes in a moment like a puff of smoke for each individual, and so, of course, for all men one by one.</p>
<p>For what does it matter to those who worshipped the gods under Romulus and died long ago, that after their death the Roman Empire has grown so great, while they are pleading their cases before the judges of the underworld? Whether their cases are good or bad does not matter in the present argument.
