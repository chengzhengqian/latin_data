<p><span class="sc">Well</span>, I promised that I should have something to say in reply to those who hold our religion responsible for the disasters of the Roman state, and that I should record the miseries which that state and the provinces under its rule suffered before their sacrifices were prohibited, that is, as many misfortunes as I could recall, or as seemed enough for my purpose. Without doubt they would attribute all these disasters to us if our religion had already been known to them or had forbidden them their sacrilegious sacrifices.</p>
<p>These matters, I think, I have adequately disposed of in the second and third books. In the second I dealt with moral evils, which should be regarded either as the only evils, or as the greatest evils. In the third I dealt with the only evils that fools dread to suffer, namely, bodily and external ills, to which the righteous are also commonly subject. Our foes accept the former evils, I do not say with patience, but with pleasure, though this kind of evil makes them evil themselves.</p>
