however, be understood to have come down to the city, inasmuch as his angels, in whom he dwells., came down. Thus the words that follow: “And the Lord God said, ‘Behold, the people are one and they all have one language,’” and so forth, and the next words, “Come, let us go down and confound their speech,” are a recapitulation<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL415_33_1a" id="target_note_LCL415_33_1a"><sup>1</sup></a> which shows how the action described in the words “the Lord came down” was performed. For if he had already come down, what is the meaning of “Come, let us go down and confound” (which is understood as spoken to the angels), except that he who was present in the angels when they descended himself came down through their agency? And he rightly did not say “Come and go down and confound” but rather “Let us confound their speech,” thus showing that he acts through his servitors, in order that they themselves may also be God’s co-workers, as the Apostle says: “For we are labourers together with God.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL415_33_2" id="target_note_LCL415_33_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

The last is the common meaning of ‘recapitulation’ in English, while the former is more common in Augustine.
From it is derived (3) a specialized term, ‘recapitulation,’ a rule for solving difficulties in the Biblical narrative. For instance, one reads (Genesis 10.32) that mankind was dispersed “by families, languages, lands and nations,” and then reads (Genesis 11.1) that the whole earth had one language. This appears to be a contradiction until one applies the rule of recapitulation. The second statement goes back to an earlier point in the story, when all men did have one language, and tells how they came to have many. Augustine found this rule as the sixth of seven rules of Tyconius, a Donatist scholar, and regarded it as very useful (<span class="italic">On Christian Doctrine</span> 3.36.52-54). The case in this passage is similar, for only by ‘recapitulation’ could it first be said that the Lord came down, then made the proposal, “Come, let us go down.” In Chapter XV (p. 83 below) the rule is invoked to explain a more difficult problem about the ages of Abraham and his father, with a reference to the earlier case where the dispersion is related before the confusion of tongues.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL415_33_1a').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL415_33_2"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL415_33_2" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">2</sup>1 Corinthians 3.9.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL415_33_2').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
