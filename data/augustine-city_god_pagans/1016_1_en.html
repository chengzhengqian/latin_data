I should next examine and relate how these two progenies, which by their separate lines suggest two cities, one the city of the earth-born and the other the city of the reborn, later became so mixed and mingled that the entire human race, with the exception of eight people, deserved to perish in the flood.</p>

<span class="label"><span class="italic">Why it is that after the mention of Enoch, son of Cain, the account of his entire line is continued down to the food, but after the mention of Enos, son of Seth, there is a return to the origin of man s creation.</span></span>
<p>Now we must first consider why the genealogical accounts proceed differently in the case of Cain and Seth. For in the enumeration of the generations deriving from Cain, the man in whose name the city was founded, that is, Enoch, was mentioned before the rest of the descendants, and then they were listed as far as the end of which I have spoken, that is, down to the time when that line with its entire offspring was destroyed in the flood. In the case of Seth, however, after the mention of one son, namely, Enos,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_537_1" id="target_note_LCL414_537_1"><sup>1</sup></a> the other descendants were not directly added down to the time of the flood, but a short passage is interjected as follows: “This is the book of the birth of men. When God made Adam, he made him in the likeness of God. Male and female he made them, and he blessed them and named them Adam on the day when he made them.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_537_2" id="target_note_LCL414_537_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
