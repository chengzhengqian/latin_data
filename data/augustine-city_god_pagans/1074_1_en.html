could the twelve sons of Joktan, who was another son of Heber, and brother of Peleg, have already founded tribes, if we assume that Joktan was born after his brother Peleg merely because he is listed after him? For indeed the earth was divided at the time when Peleg was born. Consequently, we must understand that he was indeed mentioned first, but was born long after his brother Joktan, whose twelve sons already had such large families that they could be divided, each with its own language.</p>
<p>For the son who was later in respect of age could be mentioned first, just as in the case of Noah’s three sons. Those descended from his son Japheth, who was the youngest of them, were listed first, then those descended from Ham, the middle son, and last of all the sons of Shem, who was first and eldest. Moreover, the names of these tribes have survived in part, so that their derivation is clear even today; for example, the Assyrians from Assur and the Hebrews from Heber. Some names have been so changed in the course of time that even the most learned men, carefully scrutinizing the most ancient records, have not been able to discover the origins of them all, but only those of a few tribes. For the fact that the Egyptians are said to be descended from Ham’s son who was called Mizraim preserves no echo of the origin of their name. A similar case is that of the Ethiopians, who are said to be descended from that son of Ham who was called Cush.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL415_69_1" id="target_note_LCL415_69_1"><sup>1</sup></a> If, indeed, everything is taken into account, more names seem to have been changed than to have survived unaltered.</p>

These the LXX translators had substituted for the Hebrew ‘Mizraim’ and ‘Cush,’ but kept the latter in Genesis 10.6 for the ‘sons of Ham.’ The Greek names were in use as early as Homer, but are of obscure origin.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL415_69_1').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
