<p>When Scripture says: “And they engendered children for themselves,” it shows plainly enough that earlier, before the sons of God fell as they did, they engendered children for God, not for themselves, that is, that sexual lust was not their master but the servant of their reproductive function, and that they did not engender a family for their own pride but citizens for the City of God, to whom they, as angels of God, would deliver a message, urging them to place their hope in God,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_555_1" id="target_note_LCL414_555_1"><sup>1</sup></a> as did the son of Seth, that is, the son of resurrection, who hoped to call on the name of the Lord God. Having this hope, they would share with their offspring in an inheritance of eternal blessings and would be brothers of their own children under God the father.</p>
<p>These sons of God, however, were not angels of God in the sense that they were not also human beings, as some people think, but they were assuredly human beings. On this point the testimony of Scripture is unequivocal. For after the words “the angels of God saw that the daughters of men were good, and they took to wife such of them as they chose,” it at once adds; “Then the Lord God said: My spirit shall not abide in these men for ever, for they are flesh.’” They owed their creation as angels of God and sons of God to the spirit of God, but because they sank to a lower level, they are called human beings, a name that they had by nature, not by grace. They are also called flesh since they deserted the spirit, and in deserting, they were deserted by it.</p>
<p>In the Septuagint too they are called both angels of God and sons of God. This reading, to be sure,
