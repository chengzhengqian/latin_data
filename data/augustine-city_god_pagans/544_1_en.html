<span class="label"><span class="italic">The passions which, according to Apuleius, agitate the demons by whose means, he maintains, men secure the support of the gods.</span></span>
<p><span class="sc">Let us</span> postpone for the moment the question of the holy angels and consider the meaning of the Platonists’
view that the demons, situated midway between gods and man, are tossed upon these swelling waves of passion. The point is that if their minds remained free and in command of these emotions which they experience, Apuleius would not have said of them, “their hearts are stirred by impulses resembling men’s, and their minds are rocked upon the surge of a restless imagination.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_173_1" id="target_note_LCL413_173_1"><sup>1</sup></a> So then, it is their mind itself—that higher element in their personality which makes them rational beings and in which would reside the virtue and wisdom, if they possessed any, that would rule the stormy passions belonging to the lower parts of the personality so as to govern and control them—it is their mind itself, I repeat, as this Platonist admits, that is tossed on the furious sea of the passions. And so the mind of the demons is a prey to the passions of lust, fear, anger and every other passion of that sort. What part of them, then, is free and in possession of the wisdom whereby they may find favour with the gods and encourage men to follow a pattern of higher morals, when their own mind, enslaved and oppressed by vicious passions, employs whatever reason nature has bestowed upon it to cheat and ensnare us so much the more fiercely the more it is held in the grip of its lust to do harm?</p>
