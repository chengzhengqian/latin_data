Moreover, Salah himself was also of this same age when he begot Heber. Now Heber was a hundred and thirty-four years old when he begot Peleg, in whose time the earth was divided. Peleg himself, moreover, lived a hundred and thirty years, and begot Reu. And Reu lived a hundred and thirty-two
years and begot Serug. And Serug lived a hundred and thirty years and begot Nahor. Nahor lived seventy-nine years and begot Terah. Terah lived seventy years and begot Abram, whom God later, changing his name, called Abraham,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL415_57_1" id="target_note_LCL415_57_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Thus the years from the flood to Abraham add up altogether to one thousand and seventy-two according to the common version, that is, that of the seventy translators.
