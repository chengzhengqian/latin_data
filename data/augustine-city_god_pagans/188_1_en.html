why Concord should be a goddess, but Discord not, why we should not employ Labeo’s distinction and view one as a good goddess, the other as an evil one?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL411_377_1" id="target_note_LCL411_377_1"><sup>1</sup></a> He seems to have had no other evidence than that he noticed in Rome a temple dedicated to Fever, as well as one to Health.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL411_377_2" id="target_note_LCL411_377_2"><sup>2</sup></a> By this analogy therefore a temple should have been founded not only to Concord, but also to Discord.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL411_377_3" id="target_note_LCL411_377_3"><sup>3</sup></a> Thus the Romans to their peril chose to live under the menace of so evil a goddess unplacated, and never reflected that the tale of Troy and its destruction begins with the resentment of Discord. You know, of course, that when she was not invited with the other gods, she contrived to set three goddesses disputing by placing before them the golden apple. Hence the quarrel of the deities, the victory of Venus, the kidnapping of Helen and the destruction of Troy. It follows that if she was perhaps offended because she of all the gods had obtained no temple in the city, and was therefore already upsetting the state with such great tumults, she may well have been far more fiercely aroused when she saw erected a temple to her adversary on the spot where that slaughter—the spot where her handiwork, that is—had taken place!</p>
<p>When we have our fun with such inanities, those learned and sapient men are bilious, yet, since they do worship pairs of good and bad divinities, they cannot extricate themselves from this dilemma about Concord and Discord; either they overlooked the worship of these goddesses and preferred to them Fever and Bellona, to whom they dedicated shrines in ancient times, or they have worshipped them too, though Concord thus abandoned them and Discord raging led them all the way to civil wars.</p>
