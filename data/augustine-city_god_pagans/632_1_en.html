<span class="label"><span class="italic">The source of the saints’ power infighting against demons and the source of the heart’s true cleansing.</span></span>
<p><span class="sc">It</span> is by true piety that men of God cast out the power of the air,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_349_1" id="target_note_LCL413_349_1"><sup>1</sup></a> the enemy and adversary of piety, that is, by exorcizing, not by appeasing it; they overcome all temptations that the struggle with it brings forth by appealing, not to the enemy, but to their own God against the enemy. For that power neither conquers nor enthralls any man unless he join it by some act of sin. It follows that any victory over it is won in the name of Him who took human form and lived without sin in order to accomplish the remission of sins by being himself both priest and sacrifice, that is, the mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_349_2" id="target_note_LCL413_349_2"><sup>2</sup></a> through whom we are cleansed of sin and reconciled to God. For nothing but sin separates men from God, and our sins are cleansed, not by any virtue of ours, but by God’s mercy, thanks to his indulgence and not to our own power, for even the very virtue that is called ours, however little it be, is a free grant of his bounty. We might indeed give much of the credit to ourselves while we are in this flesh of ours, were it not that until we lay this flesh aside, we live subject to his pardon. For this reason, therefore, grace was granted to us through the Mediator to the end that we who were polluted by sinful flesh might be cleansed by “the likeness of sinful flesh.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL413_349_3" id="target_note_LCL413_349_3"><sup>3</sup></a> Thanks to this grace of God, by which he manifests his great compassion
