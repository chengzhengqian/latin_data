Christ among the living and the dead. “For,” as the Apostle says, “to this end Christ died, that he might be Lord both of the living and of the dead.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL416_313_1" id="target_note_LCL416_313_1"><sup>1</sup></a> But the Apocalypse spoke of the souls of the martyrs only because it is especially those who fought for the truth even unto death who reign after death; while we, taking the part for the whole, understand that all the other dead also belong to the church, which is the kingdom of Christ.</p>
