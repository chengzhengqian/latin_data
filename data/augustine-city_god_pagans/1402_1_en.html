subdued will be better off, because when not subdued they were worse off. In support of the reasoning a striking example is introduced, as if drawn from nature, and stated as follows: Why, then, is it that God commands man, the soul commands the body, the reason commands lust and the other vicious parts of the soul? By this example it is taught clearly enough that servitude is the interest of some men, and that service, to God at any rate, is the interest of all.</p>
<p>For in serving God the soul rightly commands the body, and in that very soul the reason that is subject to God as master rightly commands the lusts and the other vices. Wherefore when a man does not serve God, how much justice must we suppose him to possess? For if a man does not serve God, in no wise can his soul justly command his body or his human reason command his vices. And if in such a man there is no justice, there can be no doubt that there is no justice in a gathering consisting of such men. In this case, therefore, there is not that common sense of right which transforms a multitude of men into a people, whose estate has been said to constitute a state. For why need I speak of the common profit whereby also a gathering of men, according to our definition, is called a people? Although, if you give diligent attention, there is no common profit when men live impiously, as do all who do not serve God and do serve demons,—demons that are all the more impious in that these most unclean spirits demand sacrifices to be paid to them as to gods,—nevertheless I think that what we have said concerning a common sense of right is enough to demonstrate that in terms of this definition a people in whom there is no justice cannot be described as having a state.</p>
