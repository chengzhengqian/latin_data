since that which exists at every time may properly be said to exist always? Indeed, so surely did they exist at every time that they were created as well before all measures of time, that is, if measures of time began with the heaven and they already existed before the heaven. But let us suppose that time did not begin with the heaven but existed even before the heaven. Now, by time I do not mean time calculated in hours, days, months and years, for these measures of periods of time, which are properly and commonly called ‘units of time,’ manifestly began with the motion of the heavenly bodies; hence, when God created them, he said: “And let them be for signs and for seasons and for days and for years.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_73_1" id="target_note_LCL414_73_1"><sup>1</sup></a> But by time I mean that indicated in some changing motion, of which one part passes earlier, another later, because they cannot exist simultaneously.

Now who would say that what existed at every time did not always exist?</p>
<p>But if I give this answer, I shall be asked: “Why then are they not coeternal with the Creator if they as well as he have always existed? How can we say, moreover, that they were created if we understand that they have always existed?” What reply shall we give to this? Are we to say that they did indeed always exist, since they who were created simultaneously with time or with whom periods of time were simultaneously created existed at every time, but
