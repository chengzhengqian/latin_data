died,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_249_1" id="target_note_LCL414_249_1"><sup>1</sup></a> a passage informing us that all things that lived on the earth perished in the flood.</p>
<p>Thus we find both a living soul and a spirit of life even in beasts, and this is the regular manner of expression in divine Scripture. Moreover, here too, in the passage just cited, where we read: “All things that have the spirit of life,” the Greek term is <span class="italic">pnoê</span> rather than <span class="italic">pneuma.</span> Why then do we not ask: “Since a soul cannot exist without being alive, what need was there to add ‘living’? Or what need was there to add ‘of life’ after saying ‘spirit’? But we understand that Scripture has as usual employed the expressions ‘living soul’ and ‘spirit of life’ when it meant us to understand ‘animals,’ that is, animate bodies, such as might have in them through a soul the manifest sense perception that the body also possesses. On the other hand, when we come to the creation of man, we forget the usage that is found in Scripture. Yet it employed quite its normal style to instruct us that, even though man received a rational soul, which, as we are given to understand, was not brought forth like the souls of other fleshly creatures by the waters and the earth, but was created by the breath of God, he was nevertheless fashioned in such a way that, like those other animals, he lived in an animal body, which is created when a soul (<span class="italic">anima</span>) lives in it. Scripture refers to the other animals when it says: “Let the earth bring forth a living soul,” and again when it says that they have in them a spirit of life. In their case too the Greek term is not <span class="italic">pneuma</span> but <span class="italic">pnoê,</span> and here surely Scripture does not use the noun to refer to the Holy Spirit but rather to their soul or life principle.</p>
