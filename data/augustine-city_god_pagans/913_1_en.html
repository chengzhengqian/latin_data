he no doubt began with the lower member of that human couple in order to arrive gradually at the whole. Presumably he did not think that the man was readily gullible or that he could be snared by his own mistake, but only if he gave way to the mistake of another.</p>
<p>So was it with Aaron, for he did not agree with the mistaken multitude to construct an idol because he was persuaded, but he yielded to it because he was under pressure.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_331_1" id="target_note_LCL414_331_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Nor is it credible that Solomon mistakenly thought that he should serve idols; he was driven to such acts of irreligion by the blandishments of women.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_331_2" id="target_note_LCL414_331_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Similarly, when we consider the situation of that first man and his woman, two fellow human beings all alone and married to each other, we must suppose that he was not led astray to transgress the law of God because he believed that she spoke the truth, but because he was brought to obey her by the close bond of their alliance. For the Apostle was not speaking idly when he said: “And Adam was not deceived, but the woman was deceived.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_331_3" id="target_note_LCL414_331_3"><sup>3</sup></a> He must have meant that Eve had accepted what the serpent said to her as though it were true, while Adam refused to be separated from his sole companion even in a partnership of sin. Yet he was no less guilty if he sinned with knowledge and forethought. This also explains why the Apostle does not say: “He did not sin,” but: “He was not deceived.” For he surely refers to him where he states: “Sin came into the world through one man”;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_331_4" id="target_note_LCL414_331_4"><sup>4</sup></a> and a little later when he says more explicitly: “Like the transgression of Adam.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL414_331_5" id="target_note_LCL414_331_5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>The Apostle meant us to understand the deceived
