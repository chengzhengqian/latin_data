beaten back by some projecting height or is collected in the thin downward channel of a canyon, the wind often revolves upon itself and makes an eddy similar to those waters which we said are altered into whirlpools. This wind, revolving and passing round the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> same spot and gathering momentum by its very rotation, is a whirlwind. If it is fairly violent and has been revolving a fairly long time, it ignites and makes what the Greeks call <span class="italic">Prester;</span> that is, a fiery whirlwind.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL457_97_1" id="target_note_LCL457_97_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Winds that have burst their way from the clouds generally produce all the disasters whereby tackle is carried away and entire ships are lifted into the air.</p>
<p>Also, some winds generate from themselves different<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span> winds by scattering the air and driving it in other directions also than the one in which the winds themselves were moving. I will say something which also occurs to me: drops of moisture do not yet manage to fall even though they have already started downwards and are slipping; but when many drops have come together and mass has given them strength, then they are said to flow and move. In the same way, as long as there are only slight movements of an atmosphere which is agitated at several points there is not yet wind. Wind begins to develop at the same time that it combines all those movements and concentrates them in a single effort. The degree of movement separates air from wind; for the more violently moving air is wind. On the other hand, gently flowing atmosphere is air.</p>
