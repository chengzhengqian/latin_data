<p>But Egypt does have earthquakes, and so does<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> Delos, which Virgil ordered to stand still:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">He arranged that it be tilled,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">A land without earthquake</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">And scorning the winds.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL457_203_1" id="target_note_LCL457_203_1"><sup>1</sup></a></span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">Philosophers, a credulous race, have also said, on Pindar’s authority,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL457_203_2" id="target_note_LCL457_203_2"><sup>2</sup></a> that Delos did not have earthquakes. Thucydides says that Delos was previously indeed stable but had an earthquake around the time of the Peloponnesian War.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL457_203_3" id="target_note_LCL457_203_3"><sup>3</sup></a> Callisthenes says<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> that this happened at another time, too. “Among the many prodigies,” he says, “by which the destruction of the two cities, Helice and Buris, was foretold, especially notable were both the immense columns of fire and the Delos earthquake.” He wishes Delos to be understood as stable because it is placed upon the sea and has hollow cliffs and porous rocks to give a way back for the air caught in them.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL457_203_4" id="target_note_LCL457_203_4"><sup>4</sup></a> And for this reason islands have firm ground and the closer cities come to the sea the safer they are.</p>
<p>Pompeii and Herculaneum know that this is not<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span> true. Now add that every seashore is subject to earthquakes. For example, Paphos has collapsed more than once. The famous Nicopolis has already become familiar with this catastrophe also. Deep sea surrounds Cyprus, and Cyprus has earthquakes.
