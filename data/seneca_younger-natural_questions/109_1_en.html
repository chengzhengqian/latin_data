localities where rain is scarce. Thus, they explain<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> that the deserts of Ethiopia are dry and that very few springs are found in the interior of Africa because the condition of the climate is hot and almost always summer; and so the sands lie barren without trees, without cultivation, sprinkled by infrequent rains which they immediately drink up. On the other hand, it is well known that Germany and Gaul, and the parts of Italy next to them, abound in streams and rivers because they have a moist climate and not even their summers lack rainfall.</p>
<p>7. It is obvious that much can be said against this<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1</span><span class="br"></span> theory. First of all, as a diligent vine-gardener myself I assure you that no rainfall is so heavy it wets the ground to a depth beyond ten feet. All the moisture is absorbed in the outer surface and does not get down to the lower levels. How, then, is rain<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> able to supply an abundance to rivers since it only dampens the surface soil? The greater part of rain is carried off to sea through river-beds. The amount which the earth absorbs is scanty, and the earth does not retain that. For the ground is either dry and uses up what is poured into it or it is saturated and will pour off any excess that has fallen into it. For this reason rivers do not rise with the first rainfall because the thirsty ground absorbs all the water.</p>
<p>What about the fact that some rivers burst out of<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> rocks and mountains? What will rains contribute to these rivers, rains which pour down over bare rock and have no ground in which to settle? Besides, in very dry localities wells are driven down to a depth beyond a distance of two hundred or three hundred feet and find copious veins of water at a level where
