Just as the sun sends out rays far and wide but itself has a different shape, different from the light which flows from it, so the body itself of comets is rounded but their glow appears more lengthened than that of other celestial bodies.</p>

Aries rises within a very short time, Libra emerges quite slowly; and yet both these constellations are of the
