the pre-dawn breeze. Add now the fact that if the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> cause of their blowing were the lengthened space of the day, they would also blow before the solstice when days are longest and when snows are mostly melted. For in the month of July everything is clear of snow, or at least very few places still lie under snow.</p>
<p>12. There are certain types of wind which clouds<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1</span><span class="br"></span> emit when they are burst and rent from top to bottom. The Greeks call these winds <span class="italic">ecnephiae</span> [“cloudbursts”].<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL457_93_1" id="target_note_LCL457_93_1"><sup>1</sup></a> They develop, I suppose, in this way: there is a great inequality and dissimilarity among the particles which are emitted by earthly vapor and travel to the upper atmosphere. Some of these particles are dry, others wet. When they have massed together in one body there is a great discord of particles struggling internally; from which it is probable that some clouds are formed hollow like a flute, and narrow tubular spaces are left inside them. Thin air is confined in these spaces. When it is<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> buffeted about on a restricted track it becomes hot, and for this reason expands and needs more room. It splits its envelope and bursts forth in wind which, generally, is a squall because it hurtles down from above; and it falls on us with severe force, since it is not diffused and does not come come through an opening but struggles and makes a path for itself by force and fighting. Usually this is a brief gust, because it breaks through confining barriers and ramparts of the clouds through which it was travelling; so it arrives violently, sometimes with fire and thunder in the sky.</p>
