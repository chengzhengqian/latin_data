it would not last; it would be quickly extinguished the way halos which encircle the sun or the moon fade within a very short space of time. Not even a rainbow lasts very long. If there were any such phenomena by which the space midway between two planets might be united it would disappear with equal rapidity. Certainly it would not remain as long as comets ordinarily do. The planets have their orbits within the zodiac; they influence this circle. But comets are observed everywhere. The time when they appear is no more fixed than the limits of space beyond which they may not pass.</p>

However, innumerable planets move in secret, unknown to us either on account of the dimness of their light or because the position of their orbits is such that they are eventually seen only when they reach the extremities of those orbits. Therefore, as he says, certain planets appear, new to us, which mingle their light with the permanent stars and project a brighter fire than is usual in stars.</p>
<p>This is the least of the things he lies about. His<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> whole account of the universe is a shameless falsehood.
