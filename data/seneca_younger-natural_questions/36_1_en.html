For this reason all phenomena of this type are white and similar to moon-shaped discs, because they reflect bright light when they are struck obliquely by the sun. If the cloud is below the sun and too near it is dispersed by the sun. Yet placed far away it will not bounce back the sun’s rays or reflect its image. So in our experience, mirrors also do not reflect our image when they are removed some distance from us because our vision does not have a way back all the way to us.</p>
<p>In addition, these “suns”—for I will use the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> historians’ term—are a sign of rain, especially if they have occurred in the southern region, where the heaviest rainclouds develop. When such an image surrounds the sun on both sides a storm is coming—if we believe Aratus.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL450_73_1" id="target_note_LCL450_73_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
