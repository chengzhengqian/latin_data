of the theory that the earth is a living creature.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL457_171_1" id="target_note_LCL457_171_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Otherwise, the earth would feel the agitation all over, the way an animal does. For, in us a fever does not attack certain parts more slowly than others but spreads through all parts with the same uniformity.</p>
<p>Consider, therefore, whether some of the air from<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> the surrounding atmosphere enters into the earth. As long as it has a way out, it slips through without doing damage. If it stumbles against something or meets something which blocks its path, then at first it is loaded down with the atmosphere that flows upon it from behind, next it escapes with difficulty through some crack, and the narrower the crack the more violently the air spurts out.
