Actually, what resemblance do clouds<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">8</span><span class="br"></span> have to mirrors? While mirrors are not even translucent, clouds transmit light; mirrors are dense and solidified, clouds are rarefied; mirrors are entirely of the same material, clouds are made up accidentally from different elements and for that reason are unstable and not likely to stick together long.

They prove to Suetonius’ satisfaction that Nero was not guilty, as rumoured, of publishing other poets’ work as his own. The rumour may have been associated with the widely known fact that many of Nero’s speeches in the early part of his reign were written by Seneca.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL450_49_1a').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
