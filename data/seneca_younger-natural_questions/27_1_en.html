<p>Even mirrors do not reproduce everything with fidelity. There are some mirrors you are afraid to<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">14</span><span class="br"></span> look into: they reflect such a deformity from the distorted image of the viewer; the likeness is preserved—but made to look worse than it is. There are other mirrors which can make you pleased with your strength when you look into them. Your arms grow so much larger and the appearance of your whole physique is increased to more than human proportions. Some mirrors show the right side of the face, others the left. Others twist and invert the face. Why is it surprising that a mirror of this sort also occurs in a cloud and reflects a defective image of the sun?</p>

Seneca discusses theories about the rainbow’s half circle below, Chapter 8.1-5. Perhaps in this chapter he dealt with the inverse relationship between the rainbow and the sun (mentioned above, Chapter 3.11; cf. Pliny 2.150) and the section has been lost.
