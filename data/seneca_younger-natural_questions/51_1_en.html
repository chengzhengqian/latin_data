composites.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL450_103_1" id="target_note_LCL450_103_1"><sup>1</sup></a> A composite is the contact of two bodies joined to each other. Continuity is the uninterrupted joining of parts to each other. Unity is continuity without the composite feature. There is<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> no doubt that of the substances which we see and handle, which either are perceived or perceive, some are composites. They attain form by assembly, accumulation, or construction (for example, a rope, grain, a ship—whereas a tree or a rock is a non-composite).
Therefore, you ought to concede that also among things that escape the senses, but are apprehended by thought, some have a unity of substance.</p>
<p>See how I spare your ears. I could have saved myself<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span> trouble if I had been willing to use the jargon of philosophers and say “united bodies.” Since I grant you this concession, thank me in return. What am I trying to say? Any time I say “one,” remember that I am referring not to a number but to the characteristic of a body which is cohesive by its own oneness, not by external help. Atmosphere belongs to this brand of substances.</p>
<p>3. The term “universe” includes all things<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1</span><span class="br"></span> which are, or can be, within our knowledge. Some of these are “parts” of the universe, others remain in the realm of “material.” All nature requires material, just as every art does which involves handiwork. I will explain more clearly what this means.<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span>
