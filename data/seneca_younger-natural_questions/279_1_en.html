would be produced every year, for every year some planets are in the same constellation simultaneously.</p>
<p>If a star made a comet by approaching another<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span> star the comet would cease to exist in a moment. For, the velocity of stars in transit is very great. Consequently, every eclipse of stars is brief because the same motion that brought them rapidly together separates them rapidly. We see the sun and the moon separate within a very short time after the eclipse has begun. The separation ought to be much quicker in the case of stars, which are much smaller. And yet comets remain for six months, which would not happen if they were produced by the conjunction of two planets. Planets are not able to stay together very long. The law of their own speed necessarily separates them. Besides,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span> those stars only appear to us to be close. In fact, they are divided by immense distances. Therefore, how could one star transmit fire all the way to another star, in such a way that they both seemed joined, when they are separated by vast space?</p>
<p>The light of two planets, it is said, is mingled and<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">6</span><span class="br"></span> gives the appearance of one; in the same way, to be sure, that a cloud turns pink from the rays of the sun, or as a cloud in the evening or morning sky turns orange, or as a rainbow or a second sun is seen.</p>
<p>First, all these phenomena are produced by a great<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">7</span><span class="br"></span> force. It is the sun which illuminates them. Planets do not have that same power. Second, all these phenomena occur below the moon, in the vicinity of the earth. The upper regions are pure and without admixtures, always keeping their own colour. Besides, if any such phenomenon did occur<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">8</span><span class="br"></span>
