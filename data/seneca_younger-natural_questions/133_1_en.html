rivers. Third, if the mouth of the river is beaten by<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> more frequent winds and lashed by the sea-waves the river stops and seems to rise because it cannot flow out. The fourth cause is that of the stars, for in certain months these bodies exert more force and drain rivers. When they recede farther away they absorb and draw off less water. So, what used to be expended turns up as an increase.</p>
<p>Certain rivers fall visibly into some cave and so are<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> carried out of sight. Others diminish gradually and are lost but return after some distance and recover their name and course. The reason is obvious: there is a vacant space underground; moreover, all liquid by its nature is carried to a lower and empty region. And so the rivers received into that empty region continue their course out of sight, but as soon as anything solid meets them so as to obstruct them they burst through the section that offers the least resistance to their exit and recover their course on the surface.</p>

Herodotus (7.30) says the river Lycus disappears underground to reappear about a half mile farther on where it joins the Meander. Pliny (2.225) includes the Lycus in Asia and the Erasinus in Argos among the rivers that flow underground and come to the surface again, as the Tigris does in Mesopotamia.
