no coating of plated material stays on. Also, the south wind, which comes from that region, is the hottest of winds. None of the animals that lie hidden in winter ever hibernates there. Snakes are on the surface and in the open even during winters. Also, snow never falls at Alexandria, which is located far from the excessive heat, and the southern regions do not even have rain. How, then, does a region<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">19</span><span class="br"></span> subjected to such heat get snow that will last through an entire summer? No doubt some mountains receive snow, even thereâ€”but more snow than the Alps, or the peaks of Thrace, or the Caucasus? The rivers of these mountains swell in the spring and early summer; subsequently in winter they diminish. In the springtime, of course, the rains wash down the snow. The first heat dissipates the snow that is left. Neither the Rhine, the Rhone, the Danube,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">20</span><span class="br"></span> nor the Hebrus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL457_35_1" id="target_note_LCL457_35_1"><sup>1</sup></a> (which lies below the Haemus) overflows in the summer; yet their snows are perpetually very deep, as is natural in northern regions. The Phasis, too, and the Borysthenes would rise in that same season if snows were able to make rivers swell in spite of summer heat. Besides, if this were<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">21</span><span class="br"></span> the cause of the Nile rising, its stream would be fullest in early summer since at that time the snows are still mostly intact and the melting comes from their excessive softness. The Nile, however, floods for four months and the additions to its water are constant.</p>
