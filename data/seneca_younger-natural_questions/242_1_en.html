[There is a problem of interpretation (and reading?)
in Seneca here: <span class="italic">in his ipsis quaestionum naturalium causis.</span> If we accept this as right, what would <span class="italic">in ipsis causis</span> mean? Probably “in regard to the very subjects of discussion with which we are dealing.” But what would <span class="italic">in . . . quaestionum naturalium causis</span> mean? It is hard to see. Oltramare suggests plausibly that Asclepiodotus’ work had the title Αἰτίαι Φυσικαὶ or Αἰτιῶν Φυσικῶν Ζητήσεις “Physical
Causes” or “Researches into Physical Causes.” It is
hardly reasonable to think that Seneca misrendered it as if it were the unacceptable Ζητήσεων Φυσικῶν Αἰτίαι. I suggest (<span class="italic">a</span>) reading <span class="italic">ipsius</span> instead of <span class="italic">his ipsis</span>—that is, Seneca himself, while writing a work on <span class="italic">Naturales Quaestiones</span> speaks in it of a similar work by Asclepiodotus; and (<span class="italic">b</span>) that A. wrote a work entitled Φυσικῶν Αἰτίαι, “Causes of Natural Phenomena,” with the same subject as Seneca’s <span class="italic">Naturales Quaestiones;</span> that, in referring to A.’s work, S. called it in Latin <span class="italic">Naturalium Causae</span> or <span class="italic">Rerum Naturalium Causae,</span> “Causes of Natural Phenomena”; and that, not S., but a scribe in the early tradition of MSS., with S.’s own work in mind, inserted (or substituted for <span class="italic">Rerum) Quaestionum,</span> so that the text now reads, in error, <span class="italic">quaestionum naturalium causis.</span> However, if quaestiones can mean the same as <span class="italic">quaerenda</span> “phenomena to be examined into” (so Alexander), then in Latin such <span class="italic">quaerenda</span> could have <span class="italic">causae</span> without error.—E.
