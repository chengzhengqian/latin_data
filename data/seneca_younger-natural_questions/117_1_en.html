Hence comes all metal-producing<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> soil where our avarice seeks gold and silver.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL450_235_1" id="target_note_LCL450_235_1"><sup>1</sup></a> And there are the kinds of moisture which change from liquid to stone. In fact, earth and moisture decay into substances such as bitumen and other substances like it. This is the origin of waters, which are produced according to the law and will of nature. But just as in our bodies, the liquids in<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span> the earth often develop flaws. A blow or some shock, or the exhaustion of the soil, or cold or heat damage its natural quality. The presence of sulphur, also, draws moisture together, a condition which sometimes lasts for a long while, sometimes only briefly. Therefore, just as in our bodies when a vein is cut the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span> blood continues to ooze until it all flows out or until the cut in the vein has closed and shut off the bleeding, or some other cause keeps the blood back; so in the earth when veins are loosened or broken open a stream or a river gushes out.
