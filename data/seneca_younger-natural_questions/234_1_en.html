<p>12. It is a favourite theory of most of the greatest<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1</span><span class="br"></span> authorities that it is moving air which causes earthquakes. Archelaus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL457_163_1a" id="target_note_LCL457_163_1a"><sup>1</sup></a> a scholar accurate in matters of ancient times, says as follows: winds are carried down into cavities of the earth; then, when all the spaces are filled and the air is thickened as much as it can be, the moving air which comes in on top of it compresses the air that was there first and pushes it and with frequent blows first packs it together then forces it out. Then in seeking room the air unblocks<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> all the narrow passageways and tries to break out of its enclosure. In this way it comes about that the earth is moved, when the moving air is struggling and searching for a way out. And so, a calm and quiet condition of the atmosphere precedes the period when there will be an earthquake, obviously because the force of air which usually stirs up the winds is retained in the interior of the earth.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL457_163_2" id="target_note_LCL457_163_2"><sup>2</sup></a> At this time too when the earthquake occurred in Campania, even though it was the restless season of the winter, the air in space remained still throughout the preceding days.</p>
