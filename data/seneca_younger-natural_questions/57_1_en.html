<p>How is a voice transmitted through the barrier of a<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span> wall unless air exists in the solid matter also? Air receives the sound sent from outside and passes it on. The energy of air exerts tension not only on exposed matter but also on concealed and enclosed matter. Air can do this easily because it is never divided but maintains continuity with itself even through objects which seem to separate it. Although you interpose walls and obstructing high mountains, through all such barriers a passageway is prevented not for itself but only for us. For, the only block is that through which <span class="italic">we</span> are not able to follow the air; but air passes through the very obstacle which separates it. It not only pours around and encircles obstacles in its midst but even permeates them.</p>
<p>10. Air is diffused from the bright atmosphere down<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1</span><span class="br"></span> to earth. It is thinner, more mobile, and more buoyant than earth and water too but thicker and heavier than upper atmosphere. By itself air is cold and dark. Its light and heat are from another source. Air is not the same throughout its entire<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> expanse. It is altered by its surroundings. Its highest region is extremely dry and hot, and for this reason also very thin because of the nearness of the eternal fires, the many movements of the stars, and the continuous revolution of heaven. The lowest region, near the earth, is dense and dark because it receives the terrestial exhalations. The middle region is more temperate (compared to the
