was rising or whether it was setting or retrograde (for that is the term they have given to it when it recedes)—we learned only a few years ago.</p>
<p>People have been found who would say to us:<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">6</span><span class="br"></span> “You are wrong if you judge that any star either stops or alters its orbit. It is not possible for celestial bodies to stand still or turn away. They all move forward. Once they are set in motion they advance. The end of their orbital motion will be the same as their own end. This eternal creation has irrevocable movements. If they stop at any time it means that the bodies which are now maintained by a constancy and equilibrium will collide with one another.”</p>
<p>What is the reason, then, that some celestial bodies<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">7</span><span class="br"></span> appear to move backward? The encounter with the sun imposes upon them the appearance of slowness, as well as the nature of their paths and their orbits which are so placed that at a fixed period they deceive observers. In the same way ships seem to be standing still even though they are moving under full sail. Some day there will be a man who will show in what regions comets have their orbit, why they travel so remote from other celestial bodies, how large they are and what sort they are. Let us be satisfied with what we have found out, and let our descendants also contribute something to the truth.</p>
<p>26. Someone says, “We do not see through stars<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1</span><span class="br"></span> to objects on the other side, yet our vision passes through comets.” First of all, if this does happen, it does not happen in that part where the celestial body itself is a thick and solid fire but only where a scattered glow extends and is dispersed into hair.
