that there is also a third way, which is designated in our vocabulary. Our elders for good reason spoke about the earth’s “tremor,” which is unlike the other two, for at such a time things are neither jolted nor tilted but vibrated. In an event of this sort the result is minimal damage. In the same way, a tilt is far more destructive than a jolt, for unless a movement which restores the tilt rushes in quickly from the other side a collapse necessarily follows.</p>
<p>22. Since these movements are dissimilar among<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1</span><span class="br"></span> themselves their causes are also different. First, therefore, let us talk about a jolting movement. If at any time heavy loads are drawn by a series of several vehicles, and their wheels, because of the greater strain, slip into ruts in the road, you will feel the ground quake.</p>
<p>Asclepiodotus reports: when rocks were torn from<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> the side of a mountain and fell the buildings in the vicinity collapsed because of the resulting shock. The same thing can happen under the earth with the result that from overhanging cliffs something may be loosened and fall with a great crash and noise into the cavern lying below. The greater the weight or the height the more violently it comes down. And thus the whole roof of the underground valley is moved.</p>
<p>It is credible that rocks are not only split off by their<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> own weight but also when liquid travels over them the continuous moisture weakens the joints in the stone and day by day carries away something of the mass to which the stone is attached and abrades the skin, so to speak, by which the stone is held in place. Finally, the prolonged attrition through the ages weakens those parts which it wears into day by day to
