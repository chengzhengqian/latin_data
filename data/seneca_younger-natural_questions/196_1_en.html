true, as yet push the air with its rays; none the less the sun already harasses and stimulates the air with the light that precedes its rays. For when the sun<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> itself comes out some of the exhalations are carried off to a higher altitude, others are dissipated by the heat. For this reason the gulf breezes are not given the power to blow beyond morning. All their strength is extinguished at the appearance of the sun. Even if they do blow more strongly, they none the less subside around midday; and in fact the breeze never lasts till noon. However, some breezes are weaker and briefer according to whether they are derived from stronger or weaker sources.</p>
<p>9. Yet why are winds of this sort stronger in spring<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1</span><span class="br"></span> and summer? They are very light the rest of the year and do not rise enough to fill sails. The explanation is that spring is full of moisture from rainwater, and there is greater evaporation from places saturated and oversaturated by the humid conditions of the sky.</p>
<p>But why does the wind blow equally strong in the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> summer? The reason is that the dayâ€™s heat remains after sunset and lasts most of the night. This heat draws out exhalations and more forcefully attracts anything ordinarily given off by the ground in any case. Soon the heat does not have enough strength to absorb what it draws out. For this reason the soil and its moisture emit for a longer time the particles that are ordinarily exhaled by the earth or made to ooze out.</p>
