<p>17. To be a slave to one’s self is the most grievous kind of slavery. It is easy to shake off if you cease demanding so much of yourself, if you stop searching for personal profit, if you keep before your eyes your nature and time of life—even if you are still young—and say to yourself: “Why am I a fool? Why do I pant, sweat, upset the earth and the forum? I do not need much, and only for a short time.”</p>
<p>18. On this point it will help us to study nature. In the first place we will get away from sordid matters. Second, we will free the mind—and we need one that is sound and great—from the body.
