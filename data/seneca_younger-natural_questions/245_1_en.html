<p>20. Now we come to those writers who have stated<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1</span><span class="br"></span> as a cause of earthquakes either all the elements I mentioned or several of them. Democritus thinks several.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL457_185_1" id="target_note_LCL457_185_1"><sup>1</sup></a> For he says that an earthquake is produced sometimes by moving air, sometimes by water, sometimes by both. He follows through on his theory in this way: some parts of the earth are hollow. A large quantity of water flows into them. Some of this water is thin and accordingly more fluid than the rest. When it is driven back by the heavy mass coming upon it, it strikes against the earth and causes it to move, for water cannot fluctuate without causing what it shoves against to move.</p>
<p>And now we must speak about water also in the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> same way as we spoke about air. When it is accumulated in one place and ceases to restrain itself it inclines in one direction and opens a path, at first by its weight, then by its impetus. Having been enclosed for a long time, it cannot go out except down a slope, and is not able to fall straight down moderately or without a concussion of those things through which or into which it falls. But when it has already begun<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> to be swept along, if it is halted at some place and the force of its current is rolled back upon itself, it is driven back against the earth containing it and attacks any part of the earth that is especially unstable. In addition, at times the earth becomes so saturated with moisture collected deep within it that it settles lower and its very foundations are weakened; then the earth is overwhelmed at that point against which the weight of converging waters leans most heavily.</p>
<p>In fact, air sometimes drives water and if it<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span>
