are undamaged, as I said,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL450_183_1" id="target_note_LCL450_183_1"><sup>1</sup></a> the money which was in them is discovered fused because the extremely thin fire runs through invisible openings but overcomes whatever it finds solid and resistant inside the wood. However, as I said, it is not destructive in one way<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> only, but you can understand what each force has done from the very type of damage. You can recognize the lightning by its effect. Sometimes the force of the same lightning bolt causes many different effects in the same material; for example, in a tree it burns through the driest part, bores through and splinters the very hard and very solid material, scatters the outer bark, bursts and splits the inner layers, lashes and strips the leaves. It congeals wine, fuses iron and copper.</p>
<p>53. It is strange that wine congealed by lightning<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1</span><span class="br"></span> either kills or causes insanity when drunk after it returns to its former state. If anyone asks me why this happens, this occurs to me: there is a sickness-bearing power in lightning. It is probable that some trace of it remains in liquid which lightning has condensed and congealed. The liquid could not have been solidified unless some cohesive element had been added to it. Besides, after lightning there is<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> also a disagreeable odour in oil and in all unguents. It is clear from this that some sickening power exists in the subtle fire that has been hurled down contrary to its nature. Not only does the fire destroy the things it strikes but even the things it has breathed upon. In addition, wherever lightning has struck there is sure to be an odour of sulphur in the area, which disturbs the reason if inhaled too much because it is by nature unwholesome.</p>
