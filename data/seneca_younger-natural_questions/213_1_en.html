will make a journey for gold in spite of the anger of gods and men.</p>
<p>Accordingly, someone sensibly said that nature<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">11</span><span class="br"></span> would have done better for us if she had forbidden the winds to blow and, by restraining the varied extent of their raging, had arranged that each man stay in his own land. If nothing else, a man would then be born to do evil only to himself or to his countrymen. As it is now, domestic evils are not enough for me; I have to suffer also ills from abroad. No country is so distantly remote that it cannot ex-<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">12</span><span class="br"></span> port some of its own ills. For all I know even now some ruler of a great nation (hitherto unknown to me), puffed up by the indulgence of fortune, is not restricting his armies within his own country but is outfitting fleets and moving against people who never even heard of him. How do I know but that this wind or that is bringing war to me? A great measure of peace would be granted to humans if the seas were closed.</p>
<p>None the less, as I said before, we cannot complain<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">13</span><span class="br"></span> against god, our author, if we have corrupted his benefits and cause them to be evil. He gave winds to maintain the temperature of sky and earth, to produce and to check moisture, to nurture the crops of the fields and the trees, crops which the very agitation of the winds ripens (for this movement, along with other causes, draws the nutriment to the top so that the crops do not wilt). He gave us<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">14</span><span class="br"></span> winds so that we might get to know distant lands. For man would have been an untaught animal and
without experience of affairs if he had been circumscribed by the limits of the land where he was born.
