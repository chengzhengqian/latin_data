rock or I am crushed by an entire mountain; whether the weight of a single house covers me over and I expire beneath its little dust heap or the whole earth covers my head. It does not matter whether I give up this ghost in broad daylight or in the vast bosom of the gaping earth, whether I am carried alone to the depths or with a great crowd of peoples perishing along with me. It makes no difference to me how great a tumult accompanies my death. Death amounts to the same thing everywhere.</p>
<p>Accordingly, let us have great courage in the face<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">10</span><span class="br"></span> of that disaster, which can neither be averted nor foreseen. Let us stop listening to those who have renounced Campania and who have emigrated after this catastrophe and say they will never visit that district again. For who promises them better foundations for this or that soil to stand on? All<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">11</span><span class="br"></span> places have the same conditions and if they have not yet had an earthquake, they none the less can have quakes. Perhaps this night or, before tonight, this day will split open the spot where you stand securely.

We are<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">12</span><span class="br"></span> mistaken if we believe any part of the world is exempt and safe from the danger of an earthquake. All regions lie under the same laws: nature has not created anything in such a way that it is immobile. Some things fall at one time, others at another, and just as in large cities one home here another home there is propped up, so on the globe of earth now this part now that has a flaw.</p>
