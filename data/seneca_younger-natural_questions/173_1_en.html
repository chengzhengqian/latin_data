rise in the summer and all wells would have abundant water in the summer. Finally, it is not true that in winter there is greater heat underground. But why are caves and wells warm? Because they do not receive the freezing air from outside. Thus they do not have heat; they exclude cold. They are cold in the summer from the same cause; for, since they are remote and secluded, the heated air does not penetrate to them.</p>
<p>Diogenes of Apollonia<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL457_41_1" id="target_note_LCL457_41_1"><sup>1</sup></a> says: “The sun draws<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">28</span><span class="br"></span> moisture to itself; the land, dried out, takes moisture from the sea; the sea itself draws moisture from other waters. But it cannot happen that some land is dry, other land flooded, for all lands are perforated with communicating passages<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL457_41_2a" id="target_note_LCL457_41_2a"><sup>2</sup></a> and the dry sections draw from the moist. Otherwise, unless the land received some moisture it would have completely dried out. Accordingly, the sun draws up moisture, but only from those regions which the sun especially oppresses; that is, the southern regions. When the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">29</span><span class="br"></span> land is parched it draws in more moisture. Just as in a lamp the oil flows to where it is burned, so water inclines to where the force of the heat and of the burning land draws it. But where does the land draw it from? Surely from areas of eternal winter. The northern regions abound in water. (For this reason the swift current of the Pontus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL457_41_3" id="target_note_LCL457_41_3"><sup>3</sup></a> runs constantly towards the lower sea and does not ebb and flow in
