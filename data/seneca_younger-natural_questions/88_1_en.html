cannot be deferred beyond ten years, public ones beyond thirty years. In this way they, too, are limited because there is included a “beyond which” they may not be deferred. Therefore, let there be an established limited period for all lightning bolts and for each result. For, there cannot be any knowledge of the unlimited.</p>
<p>The Etruscans speak in general terms and vaguely<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> about what really ought to be noted in lightning. They could have set up classifications as was done by the philosopher Attalus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL450_177_1a" id="target_note_LCL450_177_1a"><sup>1</sup></a> who had devoted himself to this study, so that they might investigate where the lightning occurred, when, to whom, in what circumstances, what sort, and what amount. If I were willing to arrange lightning bolts into their categories I would not have time for anything else. I would be getting into an enormous task.</p>
