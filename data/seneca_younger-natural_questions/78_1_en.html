lightning stroke. Any warning given by lightning is not refuted by contradictory entrails or birds.</p>
<p>On this point they seem to me to be mistaken.<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> Why? Because nothing is truer than the truth. If birds have foretold the future such an auspice cannot be nullified by lightning—or they foretold what was not the future. I am not now comparing a bird with lightning but two revelations of the truth which, if they do foretell the truth, are the same. So, if the intervention of lightning negates the revelations of the entrails or of augury the entrails have been improperly examined, the augury improperly observed. For it does not matter whether the appearance of one or the other omen is larger or more powerful by nature; if both have given indications of the truth they are equal as far as it pertains to the truth. If<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> you say the power of flame is stronger than the power of smoke, you are quite right. But flame has no more power than smoke has to indicate fire. So if people say this: “Whenever entrails indicate one thing, lightning another, the authority of lightning will be greater,” I will perhaps agree. If they say this: “Although another omen has foretold the truth a stroke of lightning has nullified prior omens and claimed belief only in itself,” it is untrue. Why? Because it makes no difference how many omens there might be. Fate is single. If fate is correctly understood from the first omen it does not become destroyed by the second omen. So I say it does not<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span> matter whether we seek the truth by one means or another since the truth which is sought is the same. Fate cannot be altered by a lightning stroke. Why not? For lightning itself is a part of fate.</p>
