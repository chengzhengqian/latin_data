before them the omen of bloodshed to come. Others diminish and increase their light, just as the other stars do which are brighter and larger when they descend because they are seen from a closer position, and are smaller and dimmer when they recede because they are withdrawing far away.</p>
<p>18. Against this statement the response will be<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1</span><span class="br"></span> immediately that the same thing does not happen in the case of comets which happens in the case of the other celestial bodies. For comets are largest on the day on which they first appear. And yet they would be bound to increase in size the closer they approach. As
it is, however, their original appearance remains until they begin to be extinguished. Then, what is said against previous theorists is also said against this one: if a comet were a planet—that is, if it were a celestial body—it would move within the limits of the zodiac, within which all celestial bodies restrict their orbits.</p>
<p>A star never appears through another star; our<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> eyesight is not able to pass through the middle of a celestial body to see through it to the things on the other side. But through a comet the things beyond are seen as though through a cloud. Accordingly it is obvious that a comet is not a celestial body but a light or irregular fire.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL457_265_1" id="target_note_LCL457_265_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>19. Our Stoic Zeno<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL457_265_2" id="target_note_LCL457_265_2"><sup>2</sup></a> has the following theory: he<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1</span><span class="br"></span> judges that stars come together and combine their rays, and from this union of light there comes into existence the image of a rather long star. Therefore, some suppose that comets do not exist but that only the appearance of comets is rendered through the reflection of neighbouring celestial bodies or through the conjunction of stars clinging together.</p>
