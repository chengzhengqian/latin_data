rainwater does not penetrate. So you know that no<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span> water from the sky exists there nor any collection of moisture, but what is commonly called living water. The theory that all water comes from rain is disproved by another argument: the fact that certain springs well up on the high tops of mountains. It is obvious that they are forced up or are formed on the spot, since all rainwater runs down.</p>
<p>8. Some suppose that just as on the outer surface of<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1</span><span class="br"></span> the earth lie great marshes and huge navigable lakes; and just as seas pour into vast spaces of the earth and form long extended waters in valleys,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL450_221_1" id="target_note_LCL450_221_1"><sup>1</sup></a> so, they suppose, the interior of the earth abounds in fresh waters that extend no less widely than do our ocean and its gulfs, indeed all the more widely because the earth extends farther down. Therefore, the rivers we are talking about rise from that abundance of water deep down. Why should you be surprised if the earth does not feel that those rivers have withdrawn, since the seas do not feel that they have been added?</p>
<p>9. Others favour this explanation: they say the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1</span><span class="br"></span> earth has within itself deep cavities and a great quantity of air which is of course cold because compressed by the thick darkness; then the inert and uncirculating
air ceases to maintain itself and changes into water. Just as above the earth a change in the atmosphere makes rain, so beneath the earth it makes
a river or a stream. The air above us cannot remain<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> inactive and heavy very long. At times it is rarefied by the sun, at times expanded by the wind, and so there are long intervals between rainfalls. But under the earth the conditions, whatever they are, that change air into water are always constant:
