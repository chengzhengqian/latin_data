and it is agreed that two winds act at the same time, why can it not happen that one agitates the upper atmosphere, the other the lower regions?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL457_165_1" id="target_note_LCL457_165_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>13. In the same group you may place Aristotle<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL457_165_2a" id="target_note_LCL457_165_2a"><sup>2</sup></a><span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1</span><span class="br"></span> and his student Theophrastus, a man not of divine eloquence, as he seemed to the Greeks, but nevertheless of a smooth and clear eloquence without effort. I will set forth the theory they both liked; from the earth there is always some sort of evaporation which is sometimes dry sometimes mixed with moisture. This emanates from the depths of the earth; when it has risen as far as possible and does not have a higher place to go, it is carried back and is rolled up on itself. The conflict of air moving back and forth hurls aside all obstacles and, whether it is blocked or struggles out through narrow openings, it causes a movement and a disturbance of the earth.</p>
<p>Strato is of the same school.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL457_165_3" id="target_note_LCL457_165_3"><sup>3</sup></a> He especially cultivated<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> this branch of philosophy and was an investigator of the nature of the universe. His decision is this: cold and heat always change into opposites.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL457_165_4" id="target_note_LCL457_165_4"><sup>4</sup></a> They cannot exist together. Cold flows into the place from which the force of heat has departed, and in turn heat exists in the place from which cold has been driven out. It will appear to you from the following that what I say is true and that both move contrary to each other.</p>
