<p class="noindent">it rages, and after beating against these barriers a long time the air pulls them apart and hurls them aside, becoming more violent the stronger the obstacles with which it has struggled. Then when it<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> has wandered around all that restrains it and is still unable to get out it rebounds from where it received the greatest impact and is either dissipated through hidden openings made here and there by the consequent movement itself of the earth or erupts through a new wound. Thus the great force of air cannot be checked, nor does any compact structure hold this wind. For it loosens any bond and carries every weight away with it and makes a space for itself, pouring through the smallest fissures. By the indomitable force of its nature air frees itself, and especially when agitated it asserts its rights for itself.</p>
<p>But moving air is an unconquerable thing; nothing<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span> will exist which</p>

<span class="line">Represses by authority</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Or restrains by chains and prison</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">The winds when they struggle</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">And the storms when they roar.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL457_181_1" id="target_note_LCL457_181_1"><sup>1</sup></a></span><span class="linebreak"></span>

<p class="noindent">Undoubtedly the poets wanted this place where<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span> the winds lie shut in under the ground to be considered a prison. But they did not understand that what is shut in is no longer wind and that which is wind cannot be shut in. For whatever is in an enclosure is at rest and is stationary atmosphere; all wind is in flight.</p>
<p>And now to these arguments is added an analogy<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">6</span><span class="br"></span> which makes it obvious that an earthquake is brought about by moving air: our bodies also do not tremble
