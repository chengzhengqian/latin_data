days shorter; for, from the equinox it immediately inclines and gives more space to the night. It hides the stars. Although the sun is much larger than the earth it does not burn it up but fosters it by controlling its heat in an alternately more intense and more subdued degree. It never causes the moon to be full unless it is opposite, nor dims it by phases unless it is oblique. Yet we do not note these things as long<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span> as the usual order is preserved. If something is disturbed or flashes out beyond the customary we look at it, ask about it, point it outâ€”so natural it is to marvel more at the new than at the great.</p>

<p>There have been many great men of this opinion;<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">7</span><span class="br"></span> they believe that stars are packed together from a hard substance and feed on fire that is not their own.
