it will not be so bad for you if infinite swiftness forestalls your sensation of dying, if your death is followed by sacrificial ceremonies, if you are not unessential even when you die but a sign of some great event. Surely it is not a terrible fate for you if you are buried with lightning. But you shake at a crash in the sky,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">11</span><span class="br"></span> you tremble at a hollow cloud, and whenever there is any flash, you expire. Then why? Do you think it more glorious to die from diarrhoea<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL450_197_1" id="target_note_LCL450_197_1"><sup>1</sup></a> than from a lightning bolt? So, rise up all the more bravely against the threats of heaven, and when the universe burns on all sides think that you have nothing to lose in so glorious a death. But if you believe that disturbance<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">12</span><span class="br"></span> in heaven, that discord of tempests, is being prepared against <span class="italic">you;</span> if clouds pile up, collide, and roar on <span class="italic">your</span> account; if such a great fiery force is being scattered around for <span class="italic">your</span> destruction, then reckon it a comfort that your death is valued at so much. But there will be no time for this thought.<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">13</span><span class="br"></span> An accident of this sort bypasses fear and among other things presents this advantage: it comes before it is expected. No one has ever feared any lightning except that which he has escaped.</p>
