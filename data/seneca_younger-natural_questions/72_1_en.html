their senses entirely. We call them “thunderstruck” because that sound in the sky has unbalanced their minds.</p>
<p>The noise can also happen this way: air which is<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span> enclosed in a hollow cloud and rarefied by its own motion expands. Then, as it seeks more space for itself it resounds from what envelopes it. But why? Just as hands clapped together produce applause, so there can be sound from clouds colliding together; but the sound is loud because large masses collide.</p>
<p>28. “We see clouds struck on mountains,” he says,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1</span><span class="br"></span> “yet no sound occurs.” First of all, clouds do not make a sound when struck just any sort of way but only if suitably arranged for producing sound. Clap the backs of your hands together. They do not make the sound of applauding. But the palms of the hands struck together make the clapping noise. Also, it makes a great difference whether hollow clouds strike together or flat and extended ones. Finally, the clouds should not merely move together but be driven together violently and tempestuously. Besides, a mountain does not split a cloud but<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> merely disperses it and scatters successive front layers. Not even a bladder pops if it releases air just any sort of way. If it is sliced with a knife, the air escapes without any audible evidence. In order to make a popping sound it should be burst, not cut. I maintain it is the same in the clouds. Unless they burst asunder with great force they do not make a noise. Now add that clouds driven against mountains are not broken up but flow around and are so split among the various parts of the mountain, tree-branches, bushes, and rough projecting boulders,
