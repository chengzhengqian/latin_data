<p>19. Anaxagoras says that all these phenomena<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1</span><span class="br"></span> occur as a result of some force that descends from the upper atmosphere to the lower regions. So fire that is struck against by cold clouds makes a sound; but when it cleaves through them it makes a flash.
A weaker force of fire produces lightning flashes; a stronger, lightning bolts.</p>
<p>20. Diogenes of Apollonia<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL450_131_1" id="target_note_LCL450_131_1"><sup>1</sup></a> says that some thunder<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1</span><span class="br"></span> comes from fire, some from air. Fire makes the thunder which it precedes and announces. Air makes the thunder which produces noise without a flash.</p>
<p>I agree that sometimes one exists without the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> other. None the less, they happen in such a way that their powers are not independent; one can be produced by the other. Who will maintain that air carried with great force will not also produce fire when it produces sound? Moreover, everyone will agree also that sometimes fire can burst through clouds and yet not dart from them; for example, if it has split a few clouds but is buried by a great mass of them. In such cases the fire will pass into the air and lose its flash, yet the air will cause fire while it violently cuts a path inside the clouds. Now add<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> an inevitable consequence: when the blast of the lightning bolt strikes the atmosphere with such a great impact it both sends ahead and drives in front of itself blasts of air, and also pulls wind behind itself. Thus, before things are struck by lightning they
