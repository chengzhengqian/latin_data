whatever is required; for inequality to disturb the things which stand in balance a surplus must be added to one element or the other. A surplus will be added to water. At present it has the power to surround the lands, not the power to submerge them. Whatever you add to water necessarily overflows into another place strange to the waters.</p>
<p>Surely then the earth must be diminished, and<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">6</span><span class="br"></span> when weak it will succumb to a stronger element. It will therefore begin to decompose, then loosen and liquify and wash away in a continuous melting. Rivers will leap out from the base of mountains and by their impetus cause the mountains to shake; and the waters will then pour out of the openings they gained. The soil everywhere will ooze water; the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">7</span><span class="br"></span> tops of mountains will gush it out. Just as a disease corrupts healthy bodies and as sores infect the adjacent areas, so all that is closest to the liquifying soil will wash away and dissolve and finally run off; and in many places the rock will split open, the strait will leap and join the seas to each other. There will be no Adriatic, no strait of the Sicilian Sea, no Charybdis, no Scylla; a new sea will wash away all the fables and the existing ocean which encircles the land, though allotted the outside parts, will come into the centre.</p>
<p>Well, then, what is next? As if this were not<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">8</span><span class="br"></span> enough, winter will hold strange months, summer will be prohibited, and all the stars that dry up the earth will have their heat repressed and will cease.
