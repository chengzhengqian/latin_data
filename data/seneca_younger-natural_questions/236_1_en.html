<p>In the wintertime, when there is cold on the surface<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> of the earth, wells are warm, and caves, and all the recesses under the earth, because heat gathers there yielding to the cold which possesses the upper regions. When the heat penetrates to the lower regions and accumulates there, as much as it can, it becomes stronger as it becomes denser. Here it<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL457_167_1a" id="target_note_LCL457_167_1a"><sup>1</sup></a> comes upon other air which necessarily yields to it, packed as that cold air is and compressed into a corner. The same thing happens in an opposite way<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span> when a great quantity of cold is carried down into the caverns. The heat that hides there gives way to the cold and withdraws to the narrow passages and is driven along with great impetus because the nature of the two does not allow harmony or delay in the same place. Therefore, the air in its flight and desire to escape in any way pushes back and tosses about all that is close to it. And so, before the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span> earthquake a roaring noise is usually heard from winds that are creating a disturbance underground. Otherwise it could not happen—as our Virgil says:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">The ground bellows under our feet</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">And the high ridges move—<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL457_167_2" id="target_note_LCL457_167_2"><sup>2</sup></a></span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">unless this were the work of winds.</p>
<p>Then this conflict of the winds goes through the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">6</span><span class="br"></span> same phases alternately. There is an accumulation of heat and again its eruption; then what is cold

The translation here, based on Oltramare’s conjectural emendation of <span class="italic">huic alius</span> of the MSS., gives the sense required. If <span class="italic">huic</span> is right, <span class="italic">alius</span> wrong, Gercke’s <span class="italic">frigus</span> for <span class="italic">alius</span> provides the right sort of noun as subject to <span class="italic">supervenit.</span> Another possibility is, not <span class="italic">algus,</span> but <span class="italic">algor</span> “cold that is felt”; another, which assumes the loss of a noun, is, not <span class="italic">alsus</span> but <span class="italic">alsius</span> (“feeling cold”). However, <span class="italic">supervenit</span> looks as if its subject is heat, not cold.
