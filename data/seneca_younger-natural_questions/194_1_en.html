a rush of air, when things which were dense and stationary are rarefied and so struggle, as they must, towards a roomier space? I do judge that this is sometimes the true explanation; however, there is a far stronger and more accurate theory: air has a natural force for moving itself. It does not take this force from elsewhere; but just as it has within itself other properties so it has this power of moving itself. Or do you suppose that we have been given<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> strength to move but air has been left inert and immobile? Water, also, has its own motion even when the winds are quiet; otherwise it would not produce animal life.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL457_83_1" id="target_note_LCL457_83_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Yet, we see moss produced in water, and various forms of vegetation floating on the surface. Therefore, some principle of life exists within water.</p>
<p>6. Why am I talking about water! Fire, too, which<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1</span><span class="br"></span> consumes everything, creates certain things. It seems unbelievable that animals are generated by fire, and yet it is true. Air has some sort of similar power; and that is why air sometimes makes itself thick, sometimes expands and eliminates impurities, and at other times contracts, separates, and disperses itself. Accordingly, there is the same relationship between air and wind as there is between
a lake and a river.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL457_83_2" id="target_note_LCL457_83_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Sometimes the sun by itself is the cause of wind, when it makes the stiff air flow and expand from its dense and compressed state.</p>
<p>7. We have talked about winds in general. Now let<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1</span><span class="br"></span> us undertake to discuss them individually. Perhaps
it will be clear how they are formed if it is clear where they come from, and when.</p>
