Women whose wombs do not hold a pregnancy customarily seek these waters. As far as I am concerned, I put such beliefs among unfounded rumours. It has been believed that some waters, whether taken internally or externally, cause scabs on the body, others cause sores and unpleasant blotches in place of white skin.
