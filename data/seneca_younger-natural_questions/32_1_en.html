<p>Aristotle says that after the autumnal equinox a<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">6</span><span class="br"></span> rainbow occurs at any hour of the day; in the summer it does not occur except at the beginning or end of the day.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL450_65_1" id="target_note_LCL450_65_1"><sup>1</sup></a> The reason is clear. First, because at midday the sun is very hot and overcomes the clouds. It is impossible for the sun’s image to be reflected by clouds which the sun tears apart. But in the morning or when it sinks to its setting the sun has less strength and so can be resisted and reflected by the clouds. Secondly, the sun does not usually produce a rainbow<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">7</span><span class="br"></span> unless it is opposite the clouds in which it produces one. When days are shorter the sun’s rays are always oblique; so, at any time of the day, even when the sun is highest, it has some clouds which it can strike straight on. But in summertime the sun passes overhead. Thus, it is very high at midday and looks down on the earth in too vertical a line to be able to be met by any clouds. For the sun then has all the clouds beneath it.</p>
<p>As our Virgil says:<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">8</span><span class="br"></span></p>

<p class="noindent">when rain is approaching. But it offers different threats depending on where it appears. When it rises in the south it will bring a great rainstorm; for the rains cannot be dispersed by the strongest sun, so great is their force. If it shines towards the west there will be dew and a light shower. If the rainbow rises in the east, or thereabouts, it promises clear weather.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL450_65_3" id="target_note_LCL450_65_3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
