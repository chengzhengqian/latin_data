This, then, is the classification of waters, as it<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1</span><span class="br"></span> seems to some: of the waters that are later<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL450_255_1" id="target_note_LCL450_255_1"><sup>1</sup></a> than the ocean some are celestial, others are terrestial. Celestial waters are discharged by the clouds. Some terrestial waters swim on the surface, so to speak, and creep along the top of the ground; others are hidden; and of these I have already given an account.</p>
<p>24. Several explanations are given why some<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1</span><span class="br"></span> waters are hot and some even boil so much that they cannot be used unless they either dissipate their steam in the open or become tepid by mixing with cold water. Empedocles<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL450_255_2" id="target_note_LCL450_255_2"><sup>2</sup></a> thinks that the water is heated by fires which the earth covers and conceals in many places, especially if the water lies under earth such as waters can pass through.</p>
<p>We commonly construct serpent-shaped containers,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL450_255_3" id="target_note_LCL450_255_3"><sup>3</sup></a><span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> cylinders, and vessels of several other designs, in which we arrange thin copper pipes in descending spirals so that the water passes round the same fire over and over again, flowing through sufficient space to become hot. So the water enters cold, comes out hot. Empedocles conjectures that<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> the same thing happens under the earth. The
