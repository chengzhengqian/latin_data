<p>8. It requires no lengthy thought that in nature<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1</span><span class="br"></span> certain things exist which have violent movement and enormous force; yet nothing becomes more violent but by tension; and equally, by Hercules, nothing can be in tension from another object unless it has tension in itself. In the same way we say that nothing can be moved by another object unless there
is the capacity of mobility in it. But what is more likely to have tension within itself than air? Who will say that air does not have tension when he sees it toss about lands and mountains, houses and walls, great cities and their peoples, seas with their entire coastlines?</p>
<p>9. The velocity and expansion of air show its tension:<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1</span><span class="br"></span> the eyes send their sight instantly over many miles, a single sound at one moment resounds through entire cities, light does not creep forth gradually but in an instant pours over all things.</p>
<p>Moreover, how could water be in tension without<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> air? Take the jet of water that grows from the bottom of the centre of the arena and goes all the way to the top of the amphitheatreâ€”do you think this happens without air tension? Yet neither the hand nor any sort of mechanical device can emit or force water out the way air can. The water responds to the air. It is raised up by the air, which is inserted in the pipe and forces it up. Although water naturally flows down, it struggles mightily against its nature and rises. How about ships laden with<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> cargo? Do they not show that it is the resistance of air, not of water, that keeps them from sinking? Water would give way and be unable to maintain the weight if it were not itself sustained by air.
