<p>22. <span class="italic">I</span> do not agree with our Stoics. For I do not<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1</span><span class="br"></span> think that a comet is just a sudden fire but that it is among the eternal works of nature.</p>
<p>First of all, all things the atmosphere creates are short-lived, for they are produced in an unstable and changeable element. How can anything remain the same for long in atmosphere when atmosphere itself never remains the same for very long? It is always flowing and its periods of rest are short. Within a brief moment it changes into a condition other than the one in which it had been; now rainy, now clear, now a varied mixture between the two. Clouds—which
are closely associated with atmosphere, into which atmosphere congeals and from which it is dissolved—sometimes gather, sometimes disperse, never remain motionless. It cannot happen that fire may reside securely in an unstable milieu and cling as pertinaciously as something which nature has designed so that it might never be shaken loose.</p>
<p>Second, if fire clings to its fuel it should always<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> descend, for the atmosphere is thicker the closer it is to the earth. A comet never descends all the way to the lowest regions of the atmosphere and does not approach the ground.</p>
<p>23. Furthermore, fire either goes where its own<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1</span><span class="br"></span> nature leads it, that is, upwards, or in the direction that its fuel attracts it, to which it clings and on which
it feeds. None of the ordinary fires in the sky has a curved path. It is characteristic of a planet to follow a curve. And yet did other comets do this? I do not know. The two in our time did. Next, everything<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> which a temporary cause sets afire quickly dies out. Thus Torches gleam only while they pass across the
