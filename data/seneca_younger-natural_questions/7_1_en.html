<p>The fires have many different shapes. Aristotle<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> calls one kind a Goat.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL450_15_1a" id="target_note_LCL450_15_1a"><sup>1</sup></a> If you ask me why, you should first explain to me the reason some are called Kids. However, it is best for us to agree that one will not ask the other such questions, which he knows the other cannot answer. It will be more appropriate to investigate the phenomenon itself rather than to wonder why Aristotle has called a ball of fire a Goat. Actually, that was the shape of a fire which did appear, about the size of the moon, when Paulus was waging war against Perseus.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL450_15_2" id="target_note_LCL450_15_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Also, we have more<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span>
