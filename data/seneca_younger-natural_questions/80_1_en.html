left so in suspense by the immortal gods that they turn to our advantage if prayers are directed to the gods, if vows are undertaken. As a result this is not opposed to fate but is itself also in fate. A person<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> says: “Either it is to be or is not to be. If it is to be it will happen even though you make no vows. If it is not to be it will not happen even though you do make vows.” Such a dilemma is not valid because you omit an alternative between the two: this is to be, but only if vows are made.</p>
<p>38. “This also,” he says, “needs to be included in<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1</span><span class="br"></span> fate: either that you make vows or you do not.” Suppose I yield to you and agree that it is also in-included
in fate that vows are surely to be made. So for this reason they will be made. It is fate that<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> so-and-so will become eloquent but only if he has learned literature. But by the same fate it is required that he learn. So, he must become learned. Another man will become rich but only if he has gone to sea. But in that order of fate wherein a great fortune is promised him it at once is also decreed that he go to sea. So, he will go to sea. I maintain the same principle in regard to expiation. A man will escape danger if he has expiated the threats foretold by divinity. But this also is in fate: that he expiate. Therefore, he will expiate.</p>
<p>Such reasoning is usually presented to us in order<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> to prove that nothing is left to our free will and that all control of action is handed over to fate. When this matter will be discussed I will tell how something may exist in man’s choice while fate remains
