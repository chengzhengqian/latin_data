mirrors cost a woman more than the dowry of ladies of long ago, the dowry which was given at public expense to the children of penniless generals. Do you believe the daughters of Scipio<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL450_95_1" id="target_note_LCL450_95_1"><sup>1</sup></a> had a mirror set in gold when their dowry was only heavy brass money? Happy the poverty which gave opportunity for such<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">9</span><span class="br"></span> great glory! They would not have received that dowry if they had owned such a mirror. But whoever the man was for whom the Senate took the place of a father-in-law, he realized that he had received a dowry which he would not have the right to render.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL450_95_2" id="target_note_LCL450_95_2"><sup>2</sup></a> That dowry which the Roman people proudly bestowed is not enough now for the little daughters of freedmen to buy one mirror.</p>
<p>Luxury, encouraged by sheer opulence, has<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">10</span><span class="br"></span> gradually developed for the worst, and vices have taken on enormous growth. All things are so mixed up by the most various refinements that what used to be called the ornament of a woman is now a man’s accoutrement; I mean all men, even soldiers. Is a mirror now used only for the sake of good grooming? There is no vice for which it has not become indispensable.</p>
