same way that they receive this one colour from their contact with the passing sun, what prevents them from deriving many colours from the sun even though they do not have the properties of a mirror?</p>
<p>“Among the arguments above,” he says, “you<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">9</span><span class="br"></span> propose that a rainbow is always produced opposite the sun because an object is not reflected even by a mirror unless it is directly in front of the mirror. This is a theory we have in common,” he says, “for just as the object whose image the mirror transfers to itself must be placed opposite the mirror, in the same way the sun must be placed suitably for this effect in order that the clouds can be tinted. For the light does not produce the same effect irrespectively of the direction whence it has shone forth. The angle of the rays as they strike must be appropriate for this.”</p>

and others who conclude that such a phenomenon is produced in the manner of a mirror reply as follows: “If there were any colour in a rainbow it would persist and be seen more clearly the closer it is; whereas the image of the rainbow, distinct at a distance, fades away when you come close to it.”</p>
<p>I do not agree with this refutation, even though<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">11</span><span class="br"></span> I do approve of its principle. Why? I will tell you: the cloud is actually coloured but in such a way that the colour is not apparent from ail sides. Actually, a cloud itself is not visible from all sides; for no one
