Have you fear from that quarter where you see such great turmoil, while floods of water burst forth with great blast from the sea?</p>
<p>Nature has put water everywhere so that she can<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> attack us from all sides when she chooses.
