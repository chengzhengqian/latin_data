for within our own memory lands have been torn apart by internal movement and regions have been separated and plains have disappeared.
Now I will explain how I believe that this happens.</p>
<p>25. When moving air with great force completely<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1</span><span class="br"></span> fills an empty space under the earth and proceeds to struggle and think about a way out it repeatedly strikes the side-walls within which it lurks, over which cities are sometimes situated.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL457_199_1" id="target_note_LCL457_199_1"><sup>1</sup></a> These “walls” are sometimes so shaken that buildings placed above them fall down, sometimes to such an extent that the walls which support the whole covering of the cave fall into the vacant space underground and entire cities collapse into the immense depths.</p>

Then the Peneus River flowed away and dried up the swamps (from which Thessaly used to suffer) by carrying off in itself the waters that had once formed stagnant pools, since they had no way out. An earthquake poured forth the Ladon River, which is midway between Elis and Megalepolis.</p>

That air<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> accumulates under the earth in vast caverns (for what else should I call empty places?). Unless this were so, great expanses of the earth would be shaken and many regions would be disturbed at the same time. As it is now, only small areas suffer and an earthquake
