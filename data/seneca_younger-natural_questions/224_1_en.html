Let us investigate why the earth sometimes trembles, sometimes collapses and sinks, now is divided into sections and gapes open; why in one place it preserves for a long time the gap caused by its destruction, in other places it quickly compresses it again. Why at one time does it channel within itself rivers of noteworthy size, and at another time causes new rivers to appear. Why does it sometimes open veins of hot water, sometimes makes the water cold, and sometimes emits fire through a previously unknown opening of a mountain or a rock, but at other times
