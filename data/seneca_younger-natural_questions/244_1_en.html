except when some cause disturbs the air inside, when it is contracted by fear, grows weak in old age, becomes feeble with sluggish veins, is paralysed by cold, or is thrown from its normal course under an attack of disease. For, as long as the air flows without<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">7</span><span class="br"></span> damage and proceeds in its usual way, there is no tremor in the body; when something happens which inhibits its function, then it no longer is strong enough to support what it had maintained in its vigour. As it fails it causes to collapse whatever it had sustained when it was intact.</p>
