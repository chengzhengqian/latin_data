Greeks call them “parhelia,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL450_69_1" id="target_note_LCL450_69_1"><sup>1</sup></a> either because they are commonly seen near the sun, that is, alongside it, or because they are near to some resemblance to the sun. They do not resemble the sun entirely, only its size and shape. Moreover, dull and feeble, they have nothing of the sun’s heat. What name to give them?

Is anyone of us surprised if he sees an image of the sun in some fountain or placid lake? As I think, no. Yet the sun’s image can be reflected on high just as it is on our earth if only the material is suitable for reflecting it.</p>
