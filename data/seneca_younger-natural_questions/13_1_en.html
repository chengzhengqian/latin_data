<p>Sometimes halos gradually dissolve and fade away.<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span> Sometimes they break on one side. Sailors expect a wind from the direction where the circle of the halo broke. If it has parted on the north side, there will be a north wind; if on the west, a west wind. This is proof that these halos occur in that portion of the sky where winds also usually exist. The upper atmosphere has no halos because it has no winds.</p>
<p>To such arguments add this also: a halo is never<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">6</span><span class="br"></span> formed unless the air is stable and the wind inactive. Otherwise a halo is not usually seen. Air which is not moving can be driven, drawn out, and fashioned into any shape. But moving air is not affected even by light. It offers no resistance and takes no shape because it is scattered layer by layer. Therefore,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">7</span><span class="br"></span> no star will ever exhibit such an image around it except when the atmosphere is dense and motionless, and for that reason preserves the configuration of the round light falling on it. Nor is this an unreasonable theory. Remember the analogy I proposed a little while ago. A pebble thrown into a fishpond, or a lake, in short any still body of water, makes innumerable little circles; but it will not produce the same effect in a flowing stream. Why? Because swiftly moving water scatters every configuration. The same thing happens in the atmosphere. Stationary air can be shaped, but air that is carried along at high speed does not yield; it scatters every blow and shape-bringing impression that comes from it.</p>
