after an earthquake.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL450_227_1" id="target_note_LCL450_227_1"><sup>1</sup></a> But it is also conjectured<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> that other causes also intervene which elicit waters in other ways or stop them in their course or turn them aside. Mt. Haemus was once lacking in water, but when a tribe of Gauls, who had been hemmed in by Cassander,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL450_227_2" id="target_note_LCL450_227_2"><sup>2</sup></a> took refuge there and cut down the woods, a great supply of water appeared, which evidently the groves were appropriating for their own nourishment. When the trees were uprooted, the moisture overflowed, since it ceased to be consumed in the vegetation. Theophrastus says<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span> that the same thing happened around Magnesia also. But—to disagree respectfully with Theophrastus—this
is not likely, because the shadiest areas are generally the most humid, which would not be the case if trees dried up the water. Trees get their nourishment from the immediate vicinity; but the supply for rivers flows up from deep down and is derived from far lower than roots can spread. Besides, when trees are lopped more moisture is required, for not only do they draw up the moisture for living but also for growth.</p>
<p>Theophrastus says that around Arcadia, which<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span> was a city on the island of Crete, fountains and rivers ceased to exist because the earth ceased to be cultivated after the city was destroyed; but after the
