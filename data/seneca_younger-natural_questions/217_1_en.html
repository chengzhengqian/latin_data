complain about. Naples also lost many private dwellings but no public buildings and was only mildly grazed by the great disaster; but some villas collapsed, others here and there shook without damage. To these calamities others were added: they say that<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> a flock of hundreds of sheep was killed, statues were cracked, and some people were deranged and afterwards wandered about unable to help themselves. The thread of my proposed work, and the concurrence of the disaster at this time, requires that we discuss the causes of these earthquakes.</p>
<p>It is necessary to find solace for distressed people<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span> and to remove their great fear. Yet can anything seem adequately safe to anyone if the world itself is shaken and its most solid parts collapse? Where will our fears finally be at rest if the one thing which is immovable in the universe and fixed, so as to support everything that leans on it, starts to waver; if the earth loses the characteristic it has, stability? What hiding-place will creatures find, where will they flee in their anxiety, if fear arises from below and is drawn from the depths of the earth? There is<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span> panic on the part of all when buildings creak and give signs of falling. Then everybody hurls himself headlong outside, abandons his household possessions, and trusts to his luck in the outdoors. What hiding-place do we look to, what help, if the earth itself is causing the ruin, if what protects us, upholds us, on which cities are built, which some speak of as a kind of foundation of the universe, separates and reels? What solace—I do not say what help—can<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">6</span><span class="br"></span> there be for you when fear has lost a way of escape? What, I say, is adequately defended?
