Then it rears up to an astounding height and overtops those safe little refuge-places of men. Nor is this difficult for the waters, since they ascend at a height equal to the lands. If the high points are<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span> flattened down the seas are level. For the earth itself has the same elevation everywhere (its hollows and plains are a very little below the level, but through these it is about equalized into the roundness of a sphere), but in part of it are also the seas, which combine into the uniformity of a single ball. But when we look out over a plain the ground deceives us as it curves down gradually. In the same way we do not realize the curvature of the sea; whatever is visible appears flat. The sea is so level with the land that, to overflow, it does not need to rise with any great effort. To come over what is equal in level it is enough for the sea to rise only slightly. It does not flow from the shore, where the sea is lower, but from the middle, where the accumulation is.</p>
<p>Therefore, just as the equinoctial tide following<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">6</span><span class="br"></span> the conjunction of the moon and the sun usually rises higher than at any other time, so the tide which is sent to overwhelm the lands is more violent than the greatest of ordinary tides and carries more water and does not ebb before it has risen above the peaks of the mountains which it intends to flood. In some regions the tide runs up harmlessly for a hundred miles and maintains regularity; for it rises to its intended limit and subsides again. But at the time<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">7</span><span class="br"></span> of the deluge the tide, freed from its laws, advances without limit. “On what principle?” you ask. In the same principle in which the conflagration will occur. Both will occur when it seems best to god for the
