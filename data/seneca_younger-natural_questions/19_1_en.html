these objections you have stated, and other objections which no less demand refutation, I need only say that nothing is more deceiving than our eyesight, not only in the case of objects which distance prevents the eyesight from accurately examining, but also in the case of objects which the eye perceives close at hand. An oar is covered with shallow water and gives the appearance of being broken. Fruits are much larger when seen through glass. A colonnade, as it grows longer, merges its columns together without spaces between.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL450_39_1" id="target_note_LCL450_39_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Go back to the sun itself. Although reason proves<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">10</span><span class="br"></span> it is larger than the globe of the earth, our sight has so contracted it that philosophers have contended that it is the size of a foot.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL450_39_2" id="target_note_LCL450_39_2"><sup>2</sup></a> We know it is the swiftest of heavenly bodies, but no one of us sees it move. In fact, we would not believe it moved at all except that it obviously has changed position.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL450_39_3" id="target_note_LCL450_39_3"><sup>3</sup></a> Not one of us perceives that the universe itself moves, gliding along at headlong speed, unrolling its risings and settings within a moment of time. Why are you surprised if our eyes do not separate the raindrops of a shower, and if from a great distance an observer fails to distinguish distances between minute images?</p>
