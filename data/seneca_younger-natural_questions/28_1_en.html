not tell me from what source it gets its particular shape unless you point out some model on which a rainbow may be formed. But there is no model other than the sun When <span class="italic">you</span> also admit that colour is given to a rainbow by the sun it follows that its shape also is given to it by the sun. In short, you and I agree that these colours, with which the region of the sky is painted, are from the sun. There is one point we do not agree on: <span class="italic">you</span> say the colour is real, <span class="italic">I</span> say it is only apparent. Whether it actually exists or only seems to exist, it comes from the sun. You will not explain why this colour disappears suddenly while all other atmospheric lights are dispersed gradually. Both the rainbow’s sudden appearance and its<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span> sudden demise are on my side of the argument. For this is the peculiarity of a mirror: a reflection is not built up in sections but is immediately formed in its entirety. Every image in a mirror is abolished with as great a speed as it is formed. For to produce or to remove such an image nothing is needed other than that the object be displayed or withdrawn. Accordingly, there is not an actual substance in that reflecting cloud; there is not a corporeality but only an apparition, a similarity without reality. Do you want to be quite certain that this is so? The rainbow will cease to exist if you hide the sun. I say place another cloud in front of the sun; the multicolours of the rainbow will be gone.</p>
<p>“But the rainbow is considerably larger than the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span> sun!” I have already said there are mirrors which increase every object they reflect. I will add that everything is much larger when you look at it through water. Letters, however tiny and obscure, are seen
