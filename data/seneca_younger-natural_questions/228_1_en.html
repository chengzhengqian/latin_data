Throughout the entire earth, one of them says, run many different kinds of water.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL457_151_1a" id="target_note_LCL457_151_1a"><sup>1</sup></a> In some places there are perpetual rivers large enough to be navigable, even without the help of rains. For example, there is the Nile, which carries great quantities of water all summer. Elsewhere, rivers flow midway between the pacified and the hostile; for example, the Danube or the Rhine, one checking the attacks of Sarmatians and marking a boundary between Europe and Asia,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL457_151_2" id="target_note_LCL457_151_2"><sup>2</sup></a> the other keeping back the Germans, a nation eager for war.
