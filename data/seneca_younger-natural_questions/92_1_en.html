<p>But we will return to these matters when at leisure.<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> Perhaps it will be good to show how all these investigations have stemmed from philosophy, the parent of the arts. Philosophy first examined the causes of things and observed their effects, and compared the outcome of events with the beginning—which is a far superior method in the investigation of lightning.</p>
<p>54. Now I will return to the theory of Posidonius.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL450_185_1" id="target_note_LCL450_185_1"><sup>1</sup></a> From the earth and all terrestial things are exhaled<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1</span><span class="br"></span> certain elements, some humid, some dry and smoky. The dry and smoky elements are the nutriment for lightning bolts, the humid for rain. Any dry and smoky element that reaches the atmosphere does not permit itself to be enclosed by clouds but breaks through the enclosures; hence comes the sound which we call thunder.</p>
<p>In the atmosphere itself anything that is rarefied<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> immediately dries up and becomes hot. If inclosed, this, too, seeks an outlet and escapes with a noise. Sometimes it makes a total eruption and thunders all the more vehemently; at other times it escapes in parts, little by little. Therefore, this air produces<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> thunder either while it bursts clouds or flies through them. Moreover, the turbulence of the air in an enclosed cloud is the most powerful type of friction. Thunder is nothing other than the sound of disturbed air, which cannot occur except where either the air causes friction or is burst apart.</p>
<p>55. “But if clouds collide with each other,” he says, <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1</span><span class="br"></span> “this is the only blow that you need.” But not completely, for entire clouds do not run into entire
