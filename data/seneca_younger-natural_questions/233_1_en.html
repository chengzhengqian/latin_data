part of the earth moves away or is torn away. In the first place, all things totter from length of time and nothing is safe from age; age wastes away even these very strong and solid objects. Accordingly, in old<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> buildings when some sections have more weight than strength they fall even though they are not knocked off. The same thing happens in this whole body of the earth: its parts are loosened by age, and once lossened they fall and cause a tremor to the parts above them. The parts first do this when they give way, for nothing big is cut away without moving whatever it adhered to; then when they fall they meet something solid and rebound like a ball. When a ball falls it leaps up and bounces repeatedly, as many times as it is sent back from the ground into a new flight. Moreover, if parts of the earth have been carried down in stagnant waters, this fall by itself shakes the vicinity with a wave ejected by the sudden mass which has been shot down from above.</p>
<p>11. Some, indeed, attribute earthquakes to fire but<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1</span><span class="br"></span> give different explanations. When heat grows intense in many places it necessarily rolls up an enormous cloud of vapour that has no way out and causes strain on the air by its force. If the vapour exerts excessive pressure it breaks through all that opposes it; but if it is fairly moderate it causes nothing more than a movement of the earth. We see water foam up when fire is put under it. What happens in the case of a small quantity of enclosed water we may believe happens much more when violent, extensive fire stirs up great quantities of water. Then by the vaporization of the billowing water the fire causes whatever it strikes to shake.</p>
