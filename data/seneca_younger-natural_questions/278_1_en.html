appear only after long intervals it is difficult to compare them. Even at the time of their appearance there is no agreement among observers regarding their looks. According to whether an observer’s eyesight is sharp or weak he asserts that the comet is bright or red and its hair is compressed within the interior or flowing on the sides. But whether or not there are any differences in them, comets are necessarily produced in the same explainable way. This one description ought to be generally agreed upon: an unusual star of strange appearance is seen trailing fire streaming around it.</p>
<p>12. Some of the ancient scholars<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL457_251_1" id="target_note_LCL457_251_1"><sup>1</sup></a> favour this<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1</span><span class="br"></span> explanation: when one of the planets has come into conjunction with another the light of both blends into one and presents the appearance of an elongated star. This happens not only when planet touches planet but even when they only come close. For the space between the two planets lights up and is set aflame by both planets and produces a train of fire.</p>
<p>We will give this answer<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL457_251_2" id="target_note_LCL457_251_2"><sup>2</sup></a> to their theory: the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> number of planets is fixed. Moreover, planets are usually visible when a comet also is seen to appear. Consequently it is obvious that a comet is not produced by a conjunction of planets but has its own existence and in its own right. Besides, frequently a planet<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> passes under the track of a higher planet. Saturn is often above Jupiter, and Mars looks vertically down on Venus or Mercury. And yet no comet is produced as a result of this coming together of planets, when one passes under the other. Otherwise, a comet
