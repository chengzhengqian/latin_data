deceptive, as a result of the marvellous art of nature which starts with the similar and ends with the dissimilar. Therefore, what do the two colours of light and dark do in this case, when an explanation must be given for innumerable colours?</p>
<p>Other authorities theorize that a rainbow is<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span> formed as follows: in the region of the sky where it is already raining each little drop of falling rain is an individual mirror; in each mirror, therefore, is reflected an image of the sun. Finally, many, even countless, images both sinking and falling rapidly are mingled together. In this way, they say, a rainbow is a fusion of many images of the sun. They<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">6</span><span class="br"></span> amass the following analogies. Set out a thousand basins of water, they say, on a clear day. All will reflect the sunâ€™s image. Put drops of water on separate tree-leaves. Every drop will show a reflection of the sun. However, a large pond will not show more than one image. Why? Because every smooth surface that is circumscribed and surrounded by its own boundaries functions as a mirror. So, divide a large fishpond by installing partitions. It will have the same number of images of the sun as it has compartments. Leave it just as it was, with its surface extended. It will reflect only one image for you. It does not matter how scanty the area of moisture or the body of water is. If it has boundaries, it is a mirror. Accordingly, the countless drops which falling rain carries are so many mirrors, having so many reflections of the sun. To the observer, these reflections appear fused together. The intervals which separate one from the other are not distinguishable since distance prevents close scrutiny. Then,
