noun has six but because no noun has more than six. Those who say there are twelve winds follow<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> this reasoning: there are the same number of winds as there are sectors of the sky. The sky is divided into five circles which pass through the cardinal points of the universe. In these five circles are the northern circle, the summer solstitial circle, the equinoctial circle, the wintry circle, and the one that is opposite to the northern.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL457_111_1" id="target_note_LCL457_111_1"><sup>1</sup></a> To these is added a sixth circle, the one which separates the upper part of the universe from the lower (for as you know, half of the universe is always above us, half below us). The line (that is, this circle) which exists between the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> visible and the invisible sector is what the Greeks call the horizon line; some of us call it the limiter line,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL457_111_2" id="target_note_LCL457_111_2"><sup>2</sup></a> others call it the limiting line. We still have to add the meridian circle, which cuts the horizon at right angles. Out of these some circles run transversely and split the other circles by intersecting them.</p>
<p>Moreover, there must be as many divisions of the lower sky as there are parts. Accordingly, the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span> horizon, or limiting circle, splits those five belts, whose location I just described, into ten sectors, five in the east and five in the west. The meridian circle, which meets the horizon, adds two more sectors. In this way the lower sky gets twelve sectors and produces the same number of winds.</p>
<p>Some winds are associated only with certain<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span> localities. They do not convey ships to another region but bring them only into their own neighbourhood.
