<p>3. I would make too rash a statement if I assured<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1</span><span class="br"></span> you that hail occurs in the same way as ice does on earth, except that a whole cloud is frozen. And so I consider myself one of those witnesses with a secondhand brand of information, who say that they themselves did not actually see it. Or I may do as historians do. After they have lied to their own satisfaction about a lot of things, they are unwilling to guarantee some one point and toss out: “The verification will be found among my sources.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL457_47_2" id="target_note_LCL457_47_2"><sup>2</sup></a> So,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> if you have too little confidence in me, Posidonius guarantees you his authority both on the point he omitted<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL457_47_3" id="target_note_LCL457_47_3"><sup>3</sup></a> and on what follows: for he will assure you, just as though he had been present at the process, that hail is formed in a cloud that is not only full of water but has already changed into water.</p>
<p>Moreover, you can learn even without a teacher<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> why hail is round when you observe that every kind of drop becomes globular. This appears on a mirror which collects moisture from the breath, or is obvious from drops scattered on cups or any other
