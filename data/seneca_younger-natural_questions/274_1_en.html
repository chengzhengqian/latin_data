<p>8. Now let us refute the following theory of his<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1</span><span class="br"></span> (for he uses both theories). The earth exhales dry and humid elements; when they combine, the very discord of the elements turns the air into a whirlwind. Then that force of revolving wind sets on fire by its very motion whatever it catches within itself and lifts it on high, and the gleam of the fire that is forced out remains as long as the nutriments last. But when the fuel fails the fire itself also subsides.</p>
<p>Whoever says this sort of thing does not notice<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> what kind of movement whirlwinds and comets have. The motion of whirlwinds is rapid and violent and swifter than winds themselves, that of comets is slow and one which conceals how much they have traversed in a day and a night. Finally, the movement of whirlwinds is unpredictable and erratic and—to use a word of Sallust’s—eddying, but that of comets is regular and sticks to a route which has a destination.</p>
<p>Would any one of us believe that the moon or<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> the five planets are carried along by the wind or revolved by a whirlwind? No, I think. Why? Because their motion is not irregular and uncontrolled. Let us transfer this same observation to comets. They do not move confusedly or chaotically to such an extent that someone might believe they are driven by turbulent and irregular forces. Besides, even if<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span> those air turbulences could contain earthy and humid substances and could force them from below to the heights they still could not carry them above the moon. All their force is on this side of the clouds. But indeed, we see comets mixed in with the stars, gliding through the upper regions. Therefore, it is
