It is well established that in the reign of Cleopatra the Nile did not flood for two successive years, the tenth and eleventh of her reign.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL457_33_2" id="target_note_LCL457_33_2"><sup>2</sup></a> They say that this was a sign of the loss of power for the two rulers of the world, for the empire of Antony and Cleopatra did fall.

<p>But now I will come to a study of the explanations<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">17</span><span class="br"></span> of why the Nile rises in the summer, and I will start with the most ancient of them. Anaxagoras says that melted snows from the peaks of Ethiopia run down as far as the Nile.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL457_33_4a" id="target_note_LCL457_33_4a"><sup>4</sup></a> All antiquity was of this same opinion; Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides report it.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL457_33_5" id="target_note_LCL457_33_5"><sup>5</sup></a> But it is patently wrong on the basis of many arguments.</p>
<p>First of all, the burnt colour of the people indicates<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">18</span><span class="br"></span> that Ethiopia is very hot, and so does the need of the Trogodytae<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL457_33_6" id="target_note_LCL457_33_6"><sup>6</sup></a> to have their homes underground. Rocks become as hot as though they had been heated over fire, not only at midday but even in the evening. Human feet cannot endure the hot dust.
