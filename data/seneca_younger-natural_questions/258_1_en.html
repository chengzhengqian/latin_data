in an earthquake since I have described how mountains were separated from mountains and the ground itself was disrupted all the way from its depths.</p>

<span class="line">By vast destructive forces.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">So much</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Is the long duration of time</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Able to change things.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">They say the lands leaped apart,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Although from the very first</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Both had been one.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">The great sea came with enormous violence</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">And split Italy from Sicily</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">And flowed with its narrow channel</span><span class="linebreak"></span>

<p>You see entire regions torn from their places and<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> what had been close by lying on the other side of the sea. You see cities and nations split asunder when part of nature is aroused and has driven the sea, or fire, or air forwards to some point. Their strength is astounding since it comes from the whole; for although it rages only in one section it none the less rages with the force of the universe. For example,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> the sea also ripped Spain from its connection to Africa. Also, Sicily was cut off from Italy<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL457_211_2" id="target_note_LCL457_211_2"><sup>2</sup></a> by that flood which the greatest poets celebrate. But the currents which come from underground have considerably greater force, for a struggle through narrow areas makes things more violent.</p>
