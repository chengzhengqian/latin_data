But what prevents them from being as numerous as there are clouds suitable for showing an image of the sun? Some authorities are of this opinion: they judge that whenever two such copies exist one of them is an image of the sun, the other an image of an image. Even in our own experience, when several mirrors are so arranged that one has a
