inhabitants of Baiae,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL450_257_1" id="target_note_LCL450_257_1"><sup>1</sup></a> whose baths are heated without fire, can attest that Empedocles is right. Warm air flows from a hot place into the baths; here it circulates through conduits and heats the walls and basins of the bath just as if fire had been applied. In short, all the cold water is changed to hot water in transit, and because it flows through enclosed conduits it does not take on any flavour from a steam pipe.</p>
<p>Some suppose that water passing through places<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span> full of sulphur or nitre takes on heat from the properties of the material through which it flows. The water indicates this by its special odour and taste, for it reproduces the quality of the material which made it become warm. If you are surprised that this happens, pour water on quicklime; it will boil.</p>
