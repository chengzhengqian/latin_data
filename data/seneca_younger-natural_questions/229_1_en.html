If this is so, it must be<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span> that sometimes under the earth a river becomes swollen and, leaving its banks, violently attacks anything in the way. Thus there will be a movement of the earth at some place which the river has attacked. The river will lash at it until the river decreases. It can happen that the flowing stream eats away some region and in so doing drags down a certain mass; at its collapse the surfaces above are shaken.</p>

Also, there the sea occupies as much or perhaps more space than here because the upper regions had to be shared by so many living creatures. Whereas, the hidden regions are deserts without owners and are more freely accessible to water.</p>

Down there also the sea below can rise up and
