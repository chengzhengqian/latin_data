<p>Some of these flashes pass by abruptly like shooting<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> stars, others remain in a fixed position<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL450_79_1" id="target_note_LCL450_79_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and emit only enough light to dispel the darkness and give the illusion of daylight until, having consumed their fuel, they first become dimmer; then, in the manner of a fire which collapses upon itself, they steadily diminish and are reduced to nothingness. Some of them appear in the clouds, some above the clouds when the dense air has driven all the way to the stars the fire which it had maintained for a long time closer to the earth. Some of them do not last long. They dart<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> past or they are extinguished as soon as they glow. These are called Flashes, because their appearance is brief and dying. Yet their descent is not without harm, for often they accomplish the damage of lightning-bolts. We call objects hit by them “star-struck,”
