and damages with light marring, or burns up, or sets afire. All these cause burning but they differ in type and degree. Whatever is burned up is, of course, also burnt, but what is burnt is not completely burned up. Likewise, whatever is ignited (for something<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span> can be burned by the mere passing of fire)—well, everyone knows that something can be burnt and yet not glow but that nothing glows which is not also burnt. I will add this one point: something can be burned up but not set on fire and something can be set on fire but not burned up.</p>
<p>Now I pass on to the type of lightning which blackens<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">6</span><span class="br"></span> the objects it strikes. This lightning either colours objects or discolours them. To each process I will grant the difference due to it. Something is discoloured when its colour is blemished, not changed. Something is coloured when its appearance becomes other than it was, blue, for example, or black, or whitish.</p>
<p>41. The views up to this point are common to both<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1</span><span class="br"></span> Etruscans and philosophers. They disagree on this: namely, that the Etruscans say lightning is sent by Jupiter and they assign to him three types of equipment.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL450_167_1a" id="target_note_LCL450_167_1a"><sup>1</sup></a> The first type, so they say, gives a gentle warning and is sent by a decision of Jupiter himself.

word <span class="italic">manubiae</span> and explains it as a sort of synonym for <span class="italic">praeda</span>—booty taken <span class="italic">manu</span> “by hand.” In Ammianus Marcellinus
17.7.3 <span class="italic">fatales manubias</span> are “deadly lightning bolts.” Cp. Serv. <span class="italic">ad Aen.</span> 11.259 and 8.429. Pliny 2.138: in the litera- ture of the Etruscans nine gods send eleven kinds of <span class="italic">fulmina,</span> of which three kinds are sent by Jupiter. Only two of these deities, Pliny says, are retained by the Romans, who attribute <span class="italic">fulmina</span> in the daytime to Jupiter, <span class="italic">fulmina</span> at night to Summanus.
Pliny also says (2.82) that lightning bolts are fires falling to earth from the three upper planets, which are those of Jupiter; thus the origin of the myth that lightning bolts are javelins hurled by Jupiter.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL450_167_1a').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
