It is generally lower than the clouds, certainly never higher. But on the contrary the higher part of the sky displays Beams. And so, Beams never stood so as to block off the clouds. Besides, a whirlwind<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> is carried along more rapidly than any cloud and spins in a circle; in addition it ceases suddenly and breaks itself apart by its own force. But beams do not run or fly across the way Torches do, but stay and shine in one part of the sky.</p>
