water bursts forth it carries with it an immense mass of creatures that are ugly to look at, disgusting, and poisonous to taste. Certainly, in Caria, near the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> city of Idymus, when such waters leaped forth, all died who had eaten the fish which were discharged by a river which was new and unaccustomed to the daylight before that time. And no wonder. Their bodies were full of oil and swollen as from long inactivity; moreover, they had been fattened in the dark without exercise and deprived of the light from which health is acquired.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL450_247_1" id="target_note_LCL450_247_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Yet let a proof that fish can be born in those depths of the earth be the fact that eels are bred in secret hiding-places; and they themselves are a heavy food because of lack of exercise, especially if a deep layer of mud has hidden them entirely.</p>
