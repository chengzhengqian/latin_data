produce lightning bolts, just so the less you compress clouds, or compress smaller clouds, the weaker the bolts they will emit.</p>
<p>Aristotle gives an explanation along these lines:<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">7</span><span class="br"></span> the terrestrial globe exhales many different particles, some wet, some dry, some hot, some suitable for starting fires.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL450_19_1" id="target_note_LCL450_19_1"><sup>1</sup></a> It is not remarkable if the evaporation of the earth is of all different types and diverse, since in the sky, too, there appears not just a single colour of things. The red of the Dog Star<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL450_19_2" id="target_note_LCL450_19_2"><sup>2</sup></a> is brighter, that of Mars weaker, while Jupiter has no red, with its gleam extended into pure light. In the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">8</span><span class="br"></span> great quantity of particles which the earth ejects and forces into the upper air it is necessary, therefore, that some nutriments of fire reach the clouds, which not only can burn in colliding but even when breathed on by rays of the sun. Even in our own experience, shavings sprinkled with sulphur attract fire from a distance. It is probable that such matter collected<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">9</span><span class="br"></span> among the clouds is easily kindled, and lesser or greater fires result insofar as there was more or less energy present.</p>
<p>Yet it is the stupidest thing to suppose that stars actually fall, or jump across, or that anything is taken or rubbed away from them. If this were so, the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">10</span><span class="br"></span> stars would have perished. Yet every night very many seem to fall and to be carried off in different directions. Still, each star is found in its usual place
