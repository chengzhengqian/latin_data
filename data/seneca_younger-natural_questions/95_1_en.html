heat and smoke emitted from the earth meets the clouds and is rolled about in their hollows for a long time it finally bursts forth and, because it has no strength, is only a flash. But when those flashes<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span> have more matter and burn with greater force they do not merely become visible, they fall to earth. Some think that the lightning bolt returns to the clouds, others that it settles on the ground when the fuel has weighed it down and the bolt has been carried down by a rather feeble blow.</p>
<p>58. But why does lightning make a sudden appearance<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1</span><span class="br"></span> and is not prolonged as a continuous fire? Because being swift and indeed having amazing speed, it breaks through the clouds and sets fire to the atmosphere at the same time; then the flame stops with the cessation of motion. The passage of the air is not continuous enough so that the fire can be extended. But when the air sets itself vigorously afire by its own violent agitation it undertakes the impetus of flight. Then when it has escaped and the conflict is ended it is, for the same reason, sometimes carried as far as the earth; and sometimes, if pressed down by an insufficient force, it is dissipated beforehand.</p>
<p>Why does lightning move obliquely? Because it<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> consists of moving air (the air is oblique and twisting), and, because nature summons fire upward, violence pushes it downwards. Moreover, the path tends to become zigzag when neither force yields to the other and the fire struggles towards the upper regions but is depressed towards the lower.</p>
<p>Why are the tops of mountains frequently struck<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> by lightning? Because they are exposed to the
