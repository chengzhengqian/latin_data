<p>21. Now let us dismiss our teachers and begin to<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1</span><span class="br"></span> move on our own as we pass from what is agreed upon to what is doubtful. What is agreed upon? It is generally agreed that a lightning bolt is fire and so is a lightning flash, which is merely fire that would have become a lightning bolt if it had acquired more force. They differ not in their nature but in their force. Its colour shows that a lightning bolt is fire,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> since such colour is not present except in fire. Its effects prove it. Often a lightning bolt is the cause of great conflagrations. Forests and sections of cities have been reduced to ashes by it. Even the objects which are not struck are seen to be scorched; in fact, some are coloured as though with soot. And, what about the fact that everything struck by lightning has the odour of sulphur? So, it is generally<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> agreed that both a lightning flash and a lightning bolt are fire and that both differ from each other only in their range of movement. A lightning flash is a lightning bolt that is not carried all the way to the earth. Conversely, you could say that a lightning bolt is a lightning flash that is carried all the way to the ground.</p>
<p>I do not drag out this point at length just to play<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span> with words, but to prove that these phenomena are related and are of the same category and nature. A lightning flash is almost a lightning bolt. Let us turn it around: a lightning bolt is something more than a lightning flash.</p>
