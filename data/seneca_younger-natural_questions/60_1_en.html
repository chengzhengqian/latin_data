Even among those who propose a preliminary fire there is no agreement; some collect it from one source, others from another. Some say that as the rays of the sun go in and bounce back they are often accumulated and kindle the fire. Anaxagoras says that fire is distilled from the upper atmosphere and that from the great heat of the sky many fiery particles fall which the clouds inclose and retain for a long time.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL450_121_2" id="target_note_LCL450_121_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

Each emanates something from itself. Vapour from the earth is dry and like smoke; it makes winds, lightning bolts, and thunder. The exhalation of water is moist and changes into rain and snow. But when that dry vapour from earth<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span> (from which winds have their origin) has accumulated it is violently struck on one side by its collision with clouds. Then as it is more widely expelled it will strike adjacent clouds. The blow is struck with the sort of sound that is produced in our fireplaces when flames crackle because of imperfections in green wood. The air in the wood, having some element of moisture, is accumulated and breaks out in
