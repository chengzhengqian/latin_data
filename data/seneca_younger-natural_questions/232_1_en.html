<p>Other authorities also conclude that the cause of<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> earthquakes is fire, but for a different reason: buried fire breaks out in many places and as it blazes away it burns everything near it. If ever the places fall when they have been eaten away, then there follows a movement of those parts of the earth which are deprived of the support which lies underneath, and they slip until they collapse since nothing rushes in to receipt their weight. Then chasms, then vast gulfs are opened or, when they have hesitated a long time, they settle down over those things which are still standing under them. We see this happen also<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> right in front of us when a section of a city suffers from fire. When beams are burned through or the members which gave support to the upper stories are destroyed, then the roofs, after trembling a long time, collapse, and waver for some time in their descent until they come to rest on something solid.</p>
