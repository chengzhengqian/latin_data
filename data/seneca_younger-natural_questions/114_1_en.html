earth got back its cultivators, it also recovered its waters. He proposed this reason for the dryness: namely, that the constricted earth became hard and while it was not being stirred it was unable to transmit rainwaters. So why do we see very many springs in the most uncultivated areas? Moreover, we find<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">6</span><span class="br"></span> more areas that began to be tilled on account of their water than began to have water because they were tilled. For it is not mere rainwater which carries along great rivers suitable for large ships right from their source, as you may realize from the fact that the flow from the fountainhead is equal in winter and summer. Rainfall can make a torrent but is not able to form a river gliding along with even flow between its banks. Rains do not make a river; they only make it flow faster.</p>

If the wind is flowing air, a river is likewise flowing water. I gave it enough power, and more than enough, when I said, “It is
