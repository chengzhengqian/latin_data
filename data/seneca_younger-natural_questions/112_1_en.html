of all the elements. What is lost to one passes over into another. And nature balances its parts just as though they were weights on scales, lest the equilibrium of its proportions be disturbed and the universe lose its equipoise. All elements exist in all things.<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span> Not only does air pass over into fire but air is never without fire. Take away its heat: it will become rigid, immobile, hard. Air will change into moisture but air is yet not without moisture. Earth creates both air and water, but the earth is never without water any more than it is without air. And so the transition from one thing to another is easier because the elements are already mixed in the things into which the transition must be made.<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span> Therefore, the earth contains moisture and forces it out. The earth contains air, and the darkness of winter cold condenses it so that it makes moisture. The earth by itself is capable of changing into moisture; and it makes use of its own capabilities.</p>

<p>In our experience it usually happens that rivers<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> which have lost their channels at first simply overflow, then because they have lost a route, they make one. Theophrastus says that this happened on Mt. Corycus where the flow of new springs emerged
