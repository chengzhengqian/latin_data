<p>These winds are much greater and longer lasting<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> if several of them have flowed together into one and have also absorbed within themselves other gusts rushing along for the same reason. In the same way, rivers are of moderate size as long as they are separate with their own streams, but when many have combined their currents they exceed the size of regular and constant rivers. It is believable that<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span> the same thing also happens in storms: they are of brief duration as long as they are single, but when they have combined their forces, and the air, driven from many sections of the sky, has massed itself into one place, the storms acquire both force and duration.</p>
<p>Therefore, the breaking up of a cloud makes wind.<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span> The cloud is broken up in several ways: sometimes by a current of air scattering the cloudâ€™s mass, sometimes by the struggle of air that is enclosed and striving for an exit, sometimes by heat produced either by the sun or by the simple ramming together and friction of large bodies.</p>
<p>13. At this point, if you like, we may ask why a<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1</span><span class="br"></span> whirlwind occurs. In the case of rivers it usually happens that as long as the rivers move along without obstruction their channels are uniform and straight. When they run into some boulder projecting on the side of the bank they are forced back and their waters twist in a circle with no way out. Thus they are swirled around, sucked into themselves, and form a whirlpool. In the same way the wind blows in<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> full force as long as nothing obstructs it. When it is
