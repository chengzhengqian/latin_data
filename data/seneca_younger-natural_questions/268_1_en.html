For, they say, flame by itself would scatter unless it had something to hold to and by which it was held; and if flame were merely massed together and not set within a stable body, then surely the universe by its own whirling motion would already have scattered it.</p>
<p>2. It will be worth while in this investigation to<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1</span><span class="br"></span> inquire whether comets have the same nature as the planets and stars I spoke about above. A comet seems to have certain things in common with them: rising and setting, the same appearance, although a comet is scattered and extends farther. It is also fiery and bright. And so, if all planets are earthy<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> bodies, comets will also have the same condition. But if comets are nothing but a pure fire which remains for six months at a time and they are not broken up by the turning and speed of the universe, then stars, too, can consist of thin matter and are not scattered by this continuous rotation of the sky.</p>
<p>Also, it will be relevant to investigate these matters<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> so that we may know whether the universe travels around while the earth stands still or whether the earth turns while the universe stands still. For there have been people<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL457_231_1" id="target_note_LCL457_231_1"><sup>1</sup></a> who say that we are the ones whom nature causes to move, even though we are unaware of it, and that rising and setting does not happen from a motion of the sky but we ourselves rise and set. The subject deserves study so that we may know what our status is, whether we possess the most inactive abode or a very swift one, whether god causes all things to move around us or causes us to move around.</p>
