Some lightning bolts mean nothing; as also that of which the very occurrence escapes our awareness, such as the bolts scattered throughout the vast sea or in desert solitudes. Their significance is either nil or is lost.</p>

It does not affect every material in the same way. It shatters the stronger materials rather violently because they resist. Sometimes it passes through yielding materials without causing damage. With stone and iron and all extremely hard substances it is in conflict because it must find a way through them by sheer drive; and so
it makes a path by which it may escape. On the other hand, it spares thin and fairly porous substances, although they might seem suitably inflammable, because when a way through is open the lightning is less destructive. And so while boxes
