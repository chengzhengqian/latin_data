assemble their strength for tension. But if the atmosphere is cut up into atoms it is scattered. Moreover, separated bodies cannot be in tension.</p>
<p>Inflated objects, so inflated that they do not<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> yield to a blow, will demonstrate to you the tension of atmosphere. Heavy objects will show it—ones which have been moved over a great distance with only the wind supporting them. Voices will show it, which are faint or clear accordingly as the air vibrates. For what is voice except the tension of air formed by the tongue striking it so as to become audible? Well, what about running and all<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span> motion? Are they not the effects of air in tension? This is what gives strength to sinews, speed to runners. When air is violently agitated it twists upon itself, carries off trees and woods, snatches up entire buildings and shatters them. Air stirs up the sea, which is quiet and motionless by itself.</p>
<p>Let us turn to lesser effects. What song can be<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span> sung without the tension of air? Horns, and trumpets, and instruments which by water pressure<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL450_109_1" id="target_note_LCL450_109_1"><sup>1</sup></a> form a sound greater than that which can be produced by the mouth—do they not accomplish their function by tension of the air? Let us examine things which produce great hidden force, such as very tiny seeds whose thinness finds a place in the joints of stones, and grow so powerful that they dislodge huge rocks and demolish monuments; while very thin, minute roots split crags and cliffs.
