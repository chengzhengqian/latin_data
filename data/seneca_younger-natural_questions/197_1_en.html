<p>Moreover, the sunrise creates wind not only by its<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> heat but also by its pressure. For the light which precedes the sun, as I said, does not yet make the atmosphere warm but only strikes it. When the atmosphere is struck it gives way to one side. And yet I certainly would not concede that light is without heat, since light is derived from heat. Perhaps<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span> light does not have as much heat as appears from contact. None the less it accomplishes its task and separates and rarefies dense things. This is why places which are so shut in by some imbalance of nature that they are not able to receive sunshine become warmed even in cloudy and bleak light and are less frozen in the day than at night.</p>
<p>Also, heat by its very nature dispels all clouds and<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span> drives them away; therefore the sun, too, does the same thing. And so, as some think, the wind blows only from the direction of the sun.</p>
<p>10. That this is wrong is obvious from the fact that<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1</span><span class="br"></span> the breeze blows vessels in every direction and a ship can be navigated with full sails against the sunrise. This would not happen if the wind were always coming from the direction of the sun.</p>
<p>Also, the Etesian winds, which are brought into the discussion by some authorities, do not help the theory too much.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL457_89_1a" id="target_note_LCL457_89_1a"><sup>1</sup></a> First, I will tell you what their opinion<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> is, then why I disagree. The Etesian winds do not exist in the winter, they say, because in a season of very short days the sunshine ends before the cold

The Etesian winds of the Mediterranean blow from the north in summer, as Seneca knows, and from the south in winterâ€”a fact which he seems not to know.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL457_89_1a').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
