driving the sea against its mouths.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL457_37_1" id="target_note_LCL457_37_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Beaten back in this way, it runs back on itself and does not actually increase; but when a way out is blocked it stops and, accumulating upon itself, next breaks out wherever it can. Euthymenes<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL457_37_2a" id="target_note_LCL457_37_2a"><sup>2</sup></a> of Massilia tells an eyewitness account: “I have,” he says, “been on a voyage in the Atlantic. The Nile flows from there, and in greater volume as long as the Etesian winds are blowing in season, for at that time the sea is hurled out of itself inland by the pressure of the winds. When the winds subside, the sea is quiet and the descent of the Nile has correspondingly less force. Moreover, the taste of the sea is fresh and its monsters are like the ones in the Nile.”</p>
<p>But then if the Nile flood is provoked by the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">23</span><span class="br"></span> Etesian winds why does it begin before them and last after them? Besides, the Nile does not become higher the more violently the winds blow, nor does it fall back or rush forward in accordance with their blast, which it would do if it flooded because of their exertions. Also, there is the obvious fact that the Etesian winds whip the Egyptian coast and the Nile flows against them, whereas if the Nile flood originated from the Etesian winds it would come from the same direction as the winds.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL457_37_3" id="target_note_LCL457_37_3"><sup>3</sup></a> Besides, if it came from the sea it would flow clear and blue, not muddy as it does now.</p>
