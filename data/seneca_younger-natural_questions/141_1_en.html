<p>Some are satisfied that the sea will be displaced<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> and hence they derive the cause of the great calamity. Such a great shipwreck of the world cannot come about from the damages of torrents, rains, or rivers. I would concede that when that catastrophe threatens and it is decided that the human race is to be changed, continuous rains will fall and there will be no limit to the floods; the north winds, and the south winds too with their drier air, will be checked and clouds and streams abound. But up to this time the effect is mere damage:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">Crops are flattened to the ground</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">And hopes lie mourned by farmers</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">And the labour of a long year perishes,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Worthless.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL450_283_1" id="target_note_LCL450_283_1"><sup>1</sup></a></span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p>The land ought not to be merely damaged but<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> submerged. And so, when the prelude has occurred through these disasters, the seas will swell far beyond usual and send waves past the last watermark of the most violent storm. Then, when the winds surge up from the rear, the seas roll out a great expanse of water which is broken far from the sight of the old shore. Then, when the shore has been shifted forward two or three times and the sea stands in a place that is not its own, just as though an obstruction were removed the tide will rush forth at close quarters from the deepest recess of the sea. For,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span> like the air and the upper atmosphere, the element water also has a great reserve, and more plentiful in hidden regions. Once this reserve is moved by the fates (not by the tide—for the tide is only an agency of fate) it lifts the sea in a vast fold and drives it ahead.
