that the Chaldaeans place comets in the category of planets and have determined their orbits; Epigenes,
on the contrary, says that the Chaldaeans have no understanding of comets but that to them comets seem to be on fire from some sort of turbulence in aroused and twisted atmosphere. Therefore, first of all, if it seems all right to you, let us set forth Epigenes’ theories and refute them.</p>
<p>The planet Saturn seems to Epigenes to exert the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> greatest power on all the motions of the celestial bodies.

In<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> addition, he says, lightning bolts have one material, lightning flashes another. For the evaporation of water and of all moisture produces only flashes in the sky, threatening but not actually delivering a blow. However, the warmer and drier exhalation of the earth forces out lightning bolts. But Beams and Torches, which differ from each other only in size occur this way: when some globe of air, which we<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span> call a whirlwind, shuts up moist and earthy elements within itself, wherever it travels it presents the appearance of an extended fire which lasts as long as that tangle of air remains, carrying within itself a great quantity of moist and earthy elements.</p>
