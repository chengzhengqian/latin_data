Add now the fact that even if it reached<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span> the highest region, where the stars have their path, a whirlwind would be especially broken up by the motion which carries along the universe. For what is more rapid than the turning of the world? By means of this rotation the force of all winds, even if gathered in one place, would be dissipated, and so would the solid and powerful structure of the earth, to say nothing of a little bit of twisted air.</p>
