“heat lightning.” We speak of thunderings in the plural. The ancients said <span class="italic">tonitrus</span> a thunder or <span class="italic">tonus</span> a thunderpeal. I find this statement in Caecina, a talented man who would have had at one time a name in eloquence, had not the shadow of Cicero suppressed him. Also, the ancients used to use a<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> short syllable in that verb <span class="italic">fulgere</span> which <span class="italic">we</span> use with one of the syllables long; for we say <span class="italic">fulgēre</span> just as we say <span class="italic">splendēre.</span> But to designate the eruption of sudden light from the clouds it was their habit to use a shortened middle syllable, so that they said <span class="italic">fulgĕre.</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL450_189_1" id="target_note_LCL450_189_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>57. You ask what I think. Up to this point I have<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1</span><span class="br"></span> lent a hand to the opinions of others. I will tell you. There is a heat-flash when a light shines suddenly and over a wide area. This happens when the atmosphere is changed to fire by the rarefication of clouds and does not find the strength to leap out over a rather considerable distance. You are not surprised,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> I presume, if motion rarefies the atmosphere or the rarefication sets it afire in the same way that a ball of lead hurled from a sling liquifies<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL450_189_2" id="target_note_LCL450_189_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and lets fall drops from the friction of the air as though from fire. Thus, there are more lightning bolts in the summer because there is more heat.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL450_189_3a" id="target_note_LCL450_189_3a"><sup>3</sup></a> Moreover, fire starts more easily from the friction of warm things.</p>
<p>A lightning flash, which only shines, and a lightning<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> bolt, which is discharged, occur in the same way. But a lightning flash has less force and less fuel and—to say briefly what I think—a lightning bolt is a lightning flash intensified. So, when the substance of
