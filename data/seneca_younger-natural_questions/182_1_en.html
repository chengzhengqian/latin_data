Sun’s heat twice); third, because upper regions are blown around more, while all lower regions are less lashed by the winds.</p>
<p>9. The theory of Democritus1 belongs to the above<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1</span><span class="br"></span> reasons. “The more solid an object is the more quickly it absorbs heat and the longer it retains it. And so, if you place a bronze vase and a glass vase in the sun, the heat will communicate itself more quickly to the bronze vase and cling to it longer.” Next, he adds why he thinks this happens. “In objects which are harder and more compact,” he says, “the openings are necessarily smaller and in each opening the air is thinner. It follows that just as smaller bathtubs and smaller containers become hot more quickly, so those openings which are concealed and too small for the eye to see feel the heat more quickly and, because of this same littleness, lose more slowly whatever they receive.” This long preamble leads up to the point to be discussed next.</p>
<p>10. The closer all air is to the earth, the thicker<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1</span><span class="br"></span> it is. Just as in water and in all liquids the dregs are at the bottom, so in air all the thickest particles settle downward. But it has already been proven that all things which have thick and solid matter preserve more faithfully the heat they receive. The higher the air is, the farther it withdraws from the pollution of the earth, the less contaminated and purer it is. And so it does not retain the sun’s heat but transmits it as through a vacuum. Accordingly, it becomes less warm.</p>
