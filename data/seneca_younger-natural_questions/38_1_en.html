gone than where it is. So, it marks the entire route<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span> as though by a continuous flame because the slowness of our vision does not follow the successive instants of its flight but sees at the same instant where it started and where it ended. The same thing happens in lightning. Its fire seems continuous to us because it quickly leaps along its route, and the space through which it falls appears a unity to our eyes. But its shape is not extended through the entire space it crosses. Such long and thin bodies are too weak for the effort.</p>
<p>How, then, do they get started? The fire is ignited<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span> by the friction of the air and propelled violently by a wind. Yet it is not always caused by wind or friction. Sometimes the fire is generated by certain favourable conditions in the atmosphere. For in the sky there are many elements, dry, hot, earthy, among which fire originates and flows down following after its own type of fuel; consequently, it moves at great speed.</p>
<p>But why does it have various colours? Because<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">6</span><span class="br"></span> it makes a difference what element it is that is set ablaze and the quantity and force by which it is set on fire. Falling lights of this sort indicate wind; and, in fact, wind from the region where they started burning.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL450_77_1" id="target_note_LCL450_77_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>15. You ask: “The lights which the Greeks call<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1</span><span class="br"></span> <span class="italic">sela</span>—how are they produced?” In many ways, they say. It is possible for the force of the winds to produce them. The high temperature of the upper atmosphere can cause them. For since fire is extended far and wide there, it sometimes seizes the lower regions if elements there are suitably
