whirlwinds are pressed down to the earth from the upper regions while comets struggle up from earth to the upper regions.</p>
<p>7. Many arguments are stated against these views<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1</span><span class="br"></span> of Epigenes. First, if wind existed as a cause a comet would never appear without wind; whereas, a comet appears in a very quiet atmosphere also. Second, if a comet came from wind it would fall with the wind; and, if it began with the wind it would grow with the wind and would be brighter the more aroused the wind is. To these refutations add this also: the fact that a wind pushes forward many sections of the atmosphere while comets appear in only one spot. Also, wind does not come into the upper regions, but comets are seen higher than winds are permitted to reach.</p>
<p>Epigenes then crosses over to those comets which<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> he says have a more definite resemblance to stars and which move forward in the sky and pass by the constellations. These, he says, occur from the same causes as those which he called the lower comets. Yet they have this difference, namely that the exhalations from the earth carrying with them many dry elements seek the higher region and are driven by the North Wind into the more elevated parts of the sky.</p>
<p>But if the North Wind propelled them they would<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> always be driven towards the south in the direction the wind strikes. Yet comets run in various directions, some to the east, others to the west, all in a curve; a path which the wind would not provide. Finally, if the impetus of the North Wind lifted them from earth to the upper regions comets would not rise with other winds. Yet they do.</p>
