It follows, therefore, that air exercises its<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1</span><span class="br"></span> unique nature; whatever wants always to be in motion will at times put other things in motion. When does this happen? Whenever its path is forbidden to it. For, whenever air is not impeded it flows along calmly. When it is opposed and held back it rages and tears apart its barriers, like the River</p>
