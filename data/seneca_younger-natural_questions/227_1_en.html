waters exist as the cause of earthquakes and that the earth is agitated by these waters, he proposes this: in every great earthquake new springs usually break out, just as it also happens that if ships tilt and lean to one side they take in water. In the case of all heavy objects which water carries, if they are submerged considerably, the water either flows over them or at least the water rises on the right or left more than usual.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL457_149_1" id="target_note_LCL457_149_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>It need not take long to deduce that Thales’ theory<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> is false. For, if the earth were supported by water and sometimes shaken by it, there would always be earthquakes and we would not be amazed that the earth is shaken but that it remains at rest. Finally, the whole earth would be shaken, not just a part; for never is half a ship tossed about. As things are, a quake is not over the entire earth but on a part of it. Therefore, how can it happen that what is carried as a whole is not shaken as a whole if it is shaken by that which carries it? “But why do<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span> waters break out?” First of all, there has often been an earthquake and yet no new liquid flowed. Second, if water did burst forth for this reason it would pour around the sides of the earth, as we see happens in the case of rivers and the sea; just as when boats sink the increase of water appears mainly over the sides. Finally, no such scanty eruption of water as <span class="italic">you</span> say would ever occur, nor would it seep in like bilge-water through a crack, but a huge deluge would be the result of liquid that is infinite and supports all that the earth consists of.</p>
