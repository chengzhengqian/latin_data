<p>I myself saw a floating island near Cutiliae,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL450_263_1" id="target_note_LCL450_263_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">8</span><span class="br"></span> another floats around in the Lake of Vadimo<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL450_263_2" id="target_note_LCL450_263_2"><sup>2</sup></a> (the lake is in the Statonia region).<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL450_263_3" id="target_note_LCL450_263_3"><sup>3</sup></a> The island at Cutiliae has trees and grows plants; none the less it is supported on water and is driven in this or that direction not only by the wind but even by the breeze, and never has a position in one place day or night; it is moved by any light puff. There are<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">9</span><span class="br"></span> two explanations for it: the density of the water, which is full of minerals and for this reason heavy; and the movable material of the island itself, which is not composed of solid substance, although it does support trees. Perhaps the thick water caught and held light tree-trunks and their leaves scattered on the lake. So, even if there are any rocks on the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">10</span><span class="br"></span> island you will find them hollow and porous like those which hardened moisture has formed, certainly along the banks of mineral springs where the deposits from the water coalesce and the foam solidifies. Such deposits are necessarily light because they are an accretion of airy, empty substances.</p>
<p>An explanation cannot be given for some phenomena:<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">11</span><span class="br"></span> for example, why Nile water should make women more fertile, and so effectively that the innards of some women which have become closed by a long period of sterility have relaxed for
