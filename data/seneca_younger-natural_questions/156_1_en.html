personal life in public there will be many a Plancus.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL457_7_1" id="target_note_LCL457_7_1"><sup>1</sup></a> To be unwilling to accept praise is no remedy against this great evil.

He often used to say that we do not slam the door on flattery, we only close it gently, the way a door is usually closed on a mistress.

I remember hearing Demetrius,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL457_7_3" id="target_note_LCL457_7_3"><sup>3</sup></a> a distinguished man, tell a certain powerful freedman that he, too, had an easy road to riches on the day he regretted his high principles. “I will not begrudge any of you from learning this skill,” he said, “and I will teach any of you who considers profit a necessity how to make money, not by entering upon the dubious risks of the sea, nor the competition of buying and selling, nor by attempting the uncertain reliability of farming or the still more uncertain prospect of the forum, but by an easy and enjoyable method that robs happy victims.</p>

There is no evidence that a gladiator was ever pitted against an ape (<span class="italic">pithecus</span>). However, as Alexander points out, Kroll’s <span class="italic">pitheci</span> could mean a monkey (as in Plautus <span class="italic">Miles G</span>. 989 <span class="italic">pithecium</span>). And <span class="italic">compositi</span>
can mean “compared” rather than “paired” or “matched.” [If here in Seneca <span class="italic">pitheci</span> is right (and it is very doubtful) it does not matter what sort of primate mammal is meant. But usually a <span class="italic">Thr</span>(<span class="italic">a</span>)<span class="italic">ex</span> was pitted against another <span class="italic">Thr</span> (<span class="italic">a</span>)<span class="italic">ex.</span> So I am inclined to agree with Lips’s emendation <span class="italic">Thraecis cum,</span> with the implication not that any person in this context in Seneca is undersized but that he is of average height whereas Fidus and Apollonius were tall. Otherwise we ought to conclude that <span class="italic">thecisum,</span> as a corruption arising from <span class="italic">thraece</span> which follows, has irretrievably ousted what Seneca wrote here.—E.H.W.]</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL457_7_1').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL457_7_2a"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL457_7_2a" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">2</sup>Crispus Passienus was married to Domitia, Nero’s aunt, then to Agrippina, Nero’s mother.
