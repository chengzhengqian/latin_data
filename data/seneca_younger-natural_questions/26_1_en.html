who is inside a cloud can see it. Why is it surprising, then, if the cloud’s colour is not visible to someone to whom the cloud itself is not visible? And yet, although the cloud is not visible it is there; and so therefore is its colour. Thus, it is no proof that the colour is counterfeit because it ceases to be apparent as you get close to it. For the same thing happens in the case of clouds themselves, and yet they are not unreal simply because they are not discernible. Besides,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL450_53_1a" id="target_note_LCL450_53_1a"><sup>1</sup></a><span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">12</span><span class="br"></span> when you are told that a cloud is tinted by the sun you are not being told that the colour is branded, as it were, into a hard, stable, and enduring body but into a fluid, unstable body which receives nothing more than a brief impression. There are also certain dyes which show their qualities at a distance: for example, Tyrian purple. The better and richer saturated a cloth is, the higher you ought to hold it up so that it may reveal its brilliance. Simply because a cloth which has the best colour does not show it when unfolded in any chance way does not mean that thus it does not have the colour.</p>
<p>I am of the same opinion as Posidonius in that a<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">13</span><span class="br"></span> rainbow presumably is formed from a cloud fashioned like a concave, round mirror, the shape of which is that of a half-section cut out of a ball.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL450_53_2" id="target_note_LCL450_53_2"><sup>2</sup></a> This cannot be proved without the help of geometers, who demonstrate with arguments leaving no doubt that the rainbow is a rough representation of the sun, not an exact resemblance.</p>
