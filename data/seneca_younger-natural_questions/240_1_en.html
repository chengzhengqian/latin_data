stars whose number cannot begin to be counted, all this assembly of heavenly bodies (to omit other things), this sun which drives its course so near to us, much greater than the entire globe of the earth—all draw their nourishment from the earth’s substance and share this nourishment among themselves and are obviously sustained by no other means than by the exhalations of the earth. This is their nourishment, this is their pasturage. Moreover, the earth<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> would not be able to nurture so many things and of such great size, even larger than the earth itself, unless earth were full of breath which it pours forth day and night from all its parts. For there must be a great super-abundance in an earth from which so much is sought and consumed. And, indeed, it is produced for the occasion when it must be sent forth—for the earth would not have a perennial supply of air to nurture so many celestial bodies<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL457_175_1" id="target_note_LCL457_175_1"><sup>1</sup></a> unless these bodies in turn came running back and various dues were paid one for one purpose, one for another—but none the less it is necessary that the earth abounds in air and is full of air and emits it from hidden reserves. Therefore, there is no doubt that a great<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span> quantity of air lies within the earth and a widespread atmosphere occupies the hidden spaces underground. If this is true, it must needs be that that body (the earth) is often moved which is filled with an extremely movable substance. For surely no one can possibly doubt that nothing is more restless, more capricious and delighting in turbulence than air.</p>
