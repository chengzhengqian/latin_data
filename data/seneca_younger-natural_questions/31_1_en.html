<p>This argument is not very strong. Why? Because,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> although the sun is on the upper side it none the less strikes the entire cloud and therefore also colours it. And why not? The sun ordinarily sends its rays through and penetrates any density in the clouds. Furthermore, they make a statement contrary to their own proposition. For if the sun is higher and thus pours its light on to the upper side only of the clouds, a rainbow would never descend as far as the earth. And yet it does come down as far as the ground. In addition, a rainbow never exists<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> except opposite the sun. It does not matter whether the sun is higher or lower, because the whole side of the cloud is struck which is opposite the sun. Then, at times, a setting sun also makes a rainbow. Then, surely, when it is near the earth the sun strikes clouds on their lower side. But yet even then the rainbow is a half circle, albeit the clouds receive the sunâ€™s rays from a base and impure region.</p>
<p>Our Stoics, who insist that light is reflected in a<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span> cloud the same way as in a mirror, make the cloud hollow and a section of a ball cut in half which cannot reflect a complete circle because it itself is only part of a circle. I concede to the proposition but I do not agree with the argument. For, if the entire figure of a circle is reflected in front of a concave mirror, surely nothing prevents an entire ball from being seen in a semicircular mirror. I have already said that circles<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span> resembling a rainbow appear placed around the sun and the moon. Why is this circle joined, but never in a rainbow? Then, again, why do concave clouds always receive the sun, not sometimes flat or convex clouds?</p>
