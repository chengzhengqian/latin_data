it is probable that fire is produced, but a short-lived and quickly perishable fire because it does not arise from solid material on which it can stay fuelled. Therefore, it is transitory and has only the duration of its journey and route. It is hurled forth without fuel.</p>
<p>24. Somebody says, “How does a lightning bolt<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1</span><span class="br"></span> seek the earth when you say that it is the nature of fire to seek higher places? Or is what you said about fire not true; for its path is up as well as down?” Both can be true. By nature fire rises and ascends
in a straight line if nothing prevents it, just as water naturally moves downward. However, if some force comes along which moves the water around in an opposite direction it rises towards the place from which it was hurled down by a rainstorm. A<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> lightning bolt, then, falls down by the same necessity which forces water to ascend. The same thing happens to celestial fires which happens to trees whose tops can be bent down so that they point to the earth, even touch the earth if they are slender trees. But, when you release them they spring back into their original position. So, there is no reason for you to take notice of anything’s behaviour which is not voluntary to it. If you allow fire to go where it wants<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> to, it will go back to the sky, that is, to the dwelling-place
of all the lightest bodies. When there is something which strikes it and averts it from its true direction—that is not its nature, but its subjugation.</p>
<p>25. “You say that clouds produce fire by friction<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1</span><span class="br"></span> when they are moist, even wet,” he says. “How, then, can they generate fire, which is no more believably
generated from a cloud than from water?”</p>
