pushes strongly it obviously moves that part of the earth against which it carries the collected water. Sometimes the air is massed into subterranean passageways and in seeking an exit moves everything. Moreover, the earth is infiltrated by winds, and moving air is too subtle to be excluded, too violent to be resisted when it is aroused and swift-moving.</p>
<p>Epicurus says that all these things can be causes<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span> and he tries several other causes. Also, he criticizes those who insist that some single one of them is the cause, since it is difficult to promise anything certain about theories which are based on conjecture. Therefore, as he says, water can cause an earthquake<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">6</span><span class="br"></span> if it washes away and erodes some parts of the earth. When these parts are weakened they cease to be able to sustain what they supported when they were intact. The pressure of moving air can cause earthquakes; for perhaps the air inside the earth is agitated by other air entering, perhaps the earth receives a shock when some part of it suddenly falls and from this the earth takes on movement. Perhaps some part of the earth is sustained by a sort of column, and by a kind of piling, and when they receive flaws or give way the weight imposed on them trembles. Perhaps a warm quantity of moving air<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">7</span><span class="br"></span> is changed to fire and like lightning is carried along with great destruction to things that stand in its way. Perhaps some blast pushes the swampy and stagnant waters and consequently either the blow shakes the earth or the agitation of the air increases by its very motion and, stirring itself up, travels all the way from the depths to the surface of the earth.
