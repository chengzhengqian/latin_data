the skin keeps out the air, and air has no way in except by way of the parts through which it is breathed in, and even when it has been inhaled by us it cannot settle except in the relatively open part of the body. For it does not remain within the sinews or flesh but in the viscera and the wide cavity of the interior region. The same may be supposed about<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> the earth from the fact also that an earthquake is not in the earth’s surface or around the surface but underneath, from the depths. An indication of this is that seas of great depth are tossed about obviously from the motion of the ground over which the seas spread. Accordingly, it is probable that the earth is moved from far below and that air is formed there in huge caverns.</p>

So also air coming from outside causes the earth to shake.” This cannot happen to the earth at all. For the earth ought to feel cold so that the same thing happens to it as happens to us when an external cause produces a shuddering. I would agree that something similar to our condition occurs to the earth, but from a different cause. An interior injury has to afflict the earth deep inside. The greatest proof of my argument can be<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span> this: when the ground is opened by the enormous destruction of an earthquake, that gaping hole sometimes takes in and buries entire cities.</p>
