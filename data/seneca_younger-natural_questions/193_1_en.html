<p>4. “But,” you say, “since you argue that Democritus’<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1</span><span class="br"></span> theory is not true, how are winds formed?” Not in one way only. Sometimes the earth itself ejects a great quantity of air, which she breathes out from hidden recesses.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL457_81_1" id="target_note_LCL457_81_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Sometimes when the great and continuous evaporation from below drives into the upper atmosphere particles which the earth emits, the simple change of the earth’s exhalations mixed with these particles becomes wind.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL457_81_2" id="target_note_LCL457_81_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Here is a theory which I cannot persuade myself<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> either to believe or to remain silent about. In our bodies flatulence is caused by food. This flatulence is not emitted without great offence to our sense of smell—sometimes it unburdens the stomach noisily, sometimes more discreetly. In the same way, people think, this great nature of the world emits air in digesting its nourishment. It is lucky for us that nature always digests thoroughly what she consumes, otherwise we might fear a more offensive atmosphere.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL457_81_3" id="target_note_LCL457_81_3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>It is truer, surely, to say that many little particles<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> are constantly being carried up from all parts of the earth. When they are accumulated and then begin to be thinned out by the sun a wind develops because anything expanding in a narrow space needs more room.</p>
<p>5. What then? Do I think that evaporation from<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1</span><span class="br"></span> water and land is the sole cause of wind? Do I think that weight in the atmosphere is produced by these evaporations and that next there is set free
