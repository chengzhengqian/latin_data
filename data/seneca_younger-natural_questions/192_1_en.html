condition of the air is quiet and calm. For example, as long as only a few people are in a market-place or on a side-street they walk about without disturbance, but when a crowd comes running together into a narrow place people bump into each other and start quarrelling. The same thing happens in the space surrounding us. When many bodies fill a tiny space they unavoidably knock against each other and push, are shoved back, entwined, and squeezed. Winds are produced from these activities. The particles which are struggling with one another press hard and, after being tossed about and in confusion for a long time, start to move in one direction. Whereas, when only a few bodies are moving around in plenty of room they cannot ram each other or be pushed.</p>
<p>3. You can realize that Democritus’ theory is<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1</span><span class="br"></span> wrong from the fact that there is very little wind when the atmosphere is heavy with clouds; yet at that time many bodies have collected in a narrow space and as a result there is a heavy mass of thick clouds. Now<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> add the fact that around rivers and lakes there is frequent cloudiness from the particles that are closely packed together—and yet there is no wind. Sometimes, indeed, so much darkness surrounds everything that it cuts off the view of objects standing close by, which would not happen unless there were a great many particles packing themselves together into a tiny space. Yet there is never less wind than at a cloudy period. Now consider, on the contrary,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> that the rising sun thins out the thick and humid morning air. When the particles have been given room, and their close-packed crowd has been dispersed, then a breeze rises.</p>
