<p><span class="sc">Preface</span> 1. Lucilius, best of men, I realize how I, an old man,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL450_201_1" id="target_note_LCL450_201_1"><sup>1</sup></a> am starting the groundwork for a vast project, once I have decided to survey the universe, to uncover its causes and secrets, and to pass them on to the knowledge of others. When will I catch up with so much material, gather together such scattered fields of study, gain insight into such mysteries?</p>
<p>2. My old age should exempt me from this task and rebuke me with the years spent in idle pursuits. But let me strive all the more and let hard work make up for the omissions of a misspent life. Add night to day and cut other activities short, abandon concern for property that lies far from its owner. The mind should be entirely free for itself. Towards the very end, at least, it should look backward in contemplation of itself.</p>
<p>3. It will do so, and will urge itself on, and daily measure the shortness of time. Whatever has been lost the mind will recover by the diligent use of the life remaining. The most dependable change towards integrity comes from repentance.
