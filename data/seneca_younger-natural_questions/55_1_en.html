This is nothing but the tension of air, without which nothing is strong and against which nothing is strong.</p>
<p>That there is unity in air can be realized also from<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">6</span><span class="br"></span> the cohesiveness of our bodies. What holds them together? Air. What else is it that puts our soul in motion? What is the air’s motion? Tension. What tension can there be except from unity? What unity could this be unless it were the unity in the air? Moreover, what produces leguminous crops and slender standing grain-crops and forces up green trees and spreads out their branches or lifts them on high if it is not tension and unity in air?</p>
<p>7. Some authorities tear the air apart and separate<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1</span><span class="br"></span> it into particles in such a way that they mix void with air. They regard the easy movement of birds through air as proof that air is not a compact body but one that has numerous voids because there is a passage through it for the largest and smallest birds.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL450_111_1a" id="target_note_LCL450_111_1a"><sup>1</sup></a> But they are mistaken. Water has a similar trait, and yet there is no doubt about the unity of water, which accepts bodies in such a way that it always flows away from the bodies received. Our Stoics call this <span class="italic">circumstantia</span> [“encirclement”], the Greeks <span class="italic">antiperistasis</span> [“replacement”]. It occurs in air as well as in water, for air encircles every body by which it is displaced. There is therefore no need of an admixture of void. But this is discussed elsewhere.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL450_111_2" id="target_note_LCL450_111_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
