<p>No one can doubt that a rainbow is a reflection of<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">11</span><span class="br"></span> the sun formed in a moist, hollow cloud. This should be obvious to you from the following: the reflection is always opposite the sun, moving inversely high or low just as the sun has sunk or moved upwards. When the sun is sinking, the rainbow is higher, when the rainbow is lower, the sun is moving up. Often a cloud of that type is alongside the sun but does not produce a rainbow because it does not receive the image straight on. The multicolour occurs for no<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">12</span><span class="br"></span> other reason than that a part of the colour comes from the sun, a part from that particular cloud. The moisture produces now blue bands, now green, now purple-like, and yellow or fiery red, with the two colours, dark and bright, creating the variety. For, purple cloth also dyed from the same shellfish does not come out the same way. It makes a difference how long it has been soaked, whether it has assimilated a thick colouring matter or a watery one, whether it has been dipped and boiled several times or dyed only once. Since there are two things, the sun<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">13</span><span class="br"></span> and the clouds, that is, the object and the mirror, it is not surprising, then, that as many kinds of colour are revealed as can be intensified or greyed in numerous ways. For one colour comes from a fiery light, another from a duller and softer light.</p>
<p>In other matters concerning a rainbow research is<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">14</span><span class="br"></span> vague, where we have nothing we can get our hands on and mere conjectures must be applied extensively. But here it is obvious that there are two causes of a rainbow, sun and cloud, because a rainbow never occurs in a clear sky, nor in a sky so cloudy that it hides the sun. Therefore, it is certain a rainbow depends
