intervals like lightning, as often as the heat below overcame the weight of water lying above. Then<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span> rocks and boulders were hurled up. The air had expelled some of them before they were burnt, and so they were undamaged while others were corroded and changed to light pumice. Finally, the top of a burned mountain emerged. Afterwards, the rock gained height and grew to the size of an island. The<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">6</span><span class="br"></span> same thing happened again in our own time during the second consulship of Valerius Asiaticus.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL450_141_1" id="target_note_LCL450_141_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Why do I mention these curiosities? So it may be clear that fire is not extinguished even by a sea covering it and that its force is not prevented from bursting out even by an enormous mass of water. Asclepiodotus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL450_141_2" id="target_note_LCL450_141_2"><sup>2</sup></a> the pupil of Posidonius, says that the height of water through which the fire reached before it had broken through was two hundred feet. Well, if that enormous amount of water could not suppress the force of the flames that emerged from below, how much less can the thin, dewy moisture of the clouds impede fire? The moisture of the clouds is so far from affording any obstacle that on the contrary it is a cause of fire. We do not see lightning unless the sky is overhanging. A clear sky is without lightning.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL450_141_3" id="target_note_LCL450_141_3"><sup>3</sup></a> A bright day does not hold this threat, nor does a night unless it is dark with clouds.</p>
