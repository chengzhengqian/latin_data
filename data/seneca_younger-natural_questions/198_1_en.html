is overcome. As a result, snow piles up and freezes hard. In the summer the Etesians begin to blow when the day is extended longer and the sun’s rays are directed straight down upon us. Therefore, it is<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> probable that the snows struck by great heat exhale more moisture. Likewise when the earth is unburdened by snow and uncovered it breathes more freely. Thus more particles move out from the northern region of the sky and are carried down to our regions which are lower and warmer. In this way, they say, the Etesian winds get their start. And<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span> for this reason the Etesians have their beginning at the summer solstice. They do not blow strong after the rise of the Dog Star, because by then much of the cold section of the sky has been carried down to this region; and the sun, after changing direction, moves towards our region more directly and attracts one part of the atmosphere while repelling another part. Accordingly, the blowing of the Etesians breaks the summer heat and protects us from the severity of the hottest months.</p>
<p>11. Now, as I promised, I must tell why the Etesian<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1</span><span class="br"></span> winds do not help us explain morning breezes and do not contribute anything to the present subject of discussion. We say that a pre-dawn breeze is stirred before daylight and that it subsides when the sun’s rays touch it. And yet the Etesians, on the contrary, are called “sleepy” and “lazy” by sailors because, as Gallio<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL457_91_1" id="target_note_LCL457_91_1"><sup>1</sup></a> says, “They do not know how to get up in the morning.” The Etesians begin to come out at about the same time the most persistent pre-dawn breeze has stopped. This would not happen if the sun broke up the Etesians as it does
