own force to penetrate the atmosphere. Their shape therefore is absorbed and retained in rather solid and somewhat unyielding material. Air should not be so dense that it excludes or rejects the light striking it, nor yet so tenuous or spread out that it furnishes no obstacle to the incoming rays. The proper condition occurs at night when with a gentle light the heavenly bodies tranquilly and smoothly strike and tinge a surrounding atmosphere which is thicker than it usually is in the daytime.</p>

On the other hand, a rainbow does not occur at<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1</span><span class="br"></span> night, or very rarely,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL450_31_1" id="target_note_LCL450_31_1"><sup>1</sup></a> because the moon does not have enough strength to penetrate clouds and suffuse them with colour, such as they receive when touched by the sun’s rays. For thus do clouds produce the shape and varied colours of a rainbow.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL450_31_2" id="target_note_LCL450_31_2"><sup>2</sup></a> In clouds some parts are swollen, others are hollow, some too thick to transmit the sun’s rays, others too feeble to exclude them. This inequality mixes light and shadow alternately and produces the remarkable “multicolour” of a rainbow.</p>
<p>Another explanation of a rainbow is along these<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> lines: when a pipe bursts somewhere we see that the water which is forced out through a tiny hole and sprinkled against the rays of the slanting sun presents the appearance of a rainbow. Watch a fuller, if you like, and you will see the same thing happen
