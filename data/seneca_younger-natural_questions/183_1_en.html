<p>11. Some say, on the contrary, that the peaks of<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1</span><span class="br"></span> mountains ought to be warmer the nearer they are to the sun. They seem to me to be wrong because they believe that the Apennines and the Alps and other mountains famed for their great heights reach such an altitude that their elevation enables them to feel the nearness of the sun.</p>
<p>Such mountains are high as long as they are<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> compared to ourselves; but surely when you look at the whole earth, the lowness of all of them is obvious to everybody. Mountains are excelled or excel in size only in relation to each other. However, nothing is elevated so high that even the greatest parts have any proportion to the whole earth. If this were not so we would not usually say that the whole globe of the earth is a ball. A characteristic of a<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> ball is its roundness and a certain uniformity. However, take the uniformity which you see in balls used in games. The seams and chinks do not keep them from being spoken of as equal on all sides. In a ball of this type those areas do not interfere with the appearance of roundness; and in the same way the height of mountains projecting from the sphere as a whole even of the earth is brought to nothing by comparison with the whole world.</p>
<p>Anyone who says that a higher mountain ought to<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span> be warmer because it receives the sunâ€™s heat closer, could also say that a tall man ought to become hot sooner than a short man, and his head sooner than his feet. But anyone who judges the universe by its own measure and reflects that the earth occupies only the position of a pinpoint, will realize that nothing on earth can be so high that it can feel more
