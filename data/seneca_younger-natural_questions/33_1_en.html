<p>9. At this point mention should be made of Streaks,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1</span><span class="br"></span> which, no less varicoloured than a rainbow, we commonly accept as equally a sign of rain. Not much effort need be spent on them because Streaks are merely imperfect rainbows. They have the painted appearance of a rainbow but have no curve; they lie in a straight line. Generally, they form near<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> the sun in a moist cloud that has already started to dissolve. Consequently, there is in them the same colour which is in a rainbow; only the shape is changed because the clouds also in which they are spread out have a different shape.</p>
<p>10. There is a similar multicolour in halos; but<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1</span><span class="br"></span> they differ in that halos occur anywhere, wherever there is a celestial body; whereas a rainbow occurs only opposite the sun and Streaks only in the vicinity of the sun. I can differentiate between all three of them in this way: if you bisect a halo there will be a rainbow; if you straighten it out, a Streak. In all three there is a multiple colour varying from blue to orange. Streaks lie only close to the sun. Rainbows are solar or lunar. Halos belong to all celestial bodies.</p>
<p>11. Another kind of Streak also appears when<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1</span><span class="br"></span> thin, extended rays that are separated from one another are sent through narrow openings in the clouds. They, too, are a sign of rain.</p>
<p>Now, how am I to express myself in this section?<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> What should I call these things? Images of the sun? Historians call them “suns” and record that they have appeared two and three at a time.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL450_67_1" id="target_note_LCL450_67_1"><sup>1</sup></a> The
