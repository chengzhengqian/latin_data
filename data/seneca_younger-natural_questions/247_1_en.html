At any rate, Epicurus is satisfied that air is the main cause of earthquakes.</p>
<p>21. We also are satisfied that it is this moving air<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1</span><span class="br"></span> which can accomplish such things. Nothing in nature is more powerful than air, nothing more energetic.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL457_189_1" id="target_note_LCL457_189_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Without air not even the strongest elements have power.
