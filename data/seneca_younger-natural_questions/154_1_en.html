<p><span class="sc">Preface</span> 1. To judge from what you write, my excellent Lucilius, you like Sicily and your office of governor with its leisure time. You will continue to be pleased if you are willing to keep all this within its own limits and not try to turn what is only an administrative office into supreme power. I have no doubt that you will act properly. I know how uninterested you are in ambition, how devoted you are to leisure and letters. Let those who do not know how to tolerate themselves search for the hustle of people and events. You find the best company in yourself.</p>
<p>2. It is not surprising that this happens to so few people. We are demanding and troublesome to ourselves. We suffer at times from self-love, at times from self-weariness. Now we inflate our unhappy soul with pride, now we torture it with desire. Sometimes we relax it with indulgence, sometimes we burn it up with anxiety; and what is most pitiful of all: we are never alone with ourselves. Inevitably, there is continuous strife among such a great co-habitation of vices.</p>
