and its size remains constant. It follows, therefore, that the fires are produced below the stars and quickly collapse because they are without support and without fixed position.</p>
<p>“Why, then, do they not also flash across the sky<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">11</span><span class="br"></span> in the daytime?” Well, would you say that in the daytime stars do not exist, because they are not apparent? Just as stars are concealed and obscured by the brightness of the sun, so the Torches also race by even in the daytime, but the glare of the daylight hides them. If, however, a great energy ever lights up with flashes so powerful that they are able to display their brightness even against the daylight—which sometimes happens—their fiery shapes are visible. Certainly our own age has more than once<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">12</span><span class="br"></span> seen Torches in the daytime, some being swept from east to west, others from west to east.</p>

But if they are a sign of winds they belong in the region where winds come from, that is, in the atmosphere, which is right between the moon and earth.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL450_21_1" id="target_note_LCL450_21_1"><sup>1</sup></a> In a great storm, so-called<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">13</span><span class="br"></span> stars<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL450_21_2" id="target_note_LCL450_21_2"><sup>2</sup></a> usually appear to settle on the sails. Sailors in danger then believe they are being helped by the divinity of Pollux and Castor. But there is reason for a more realistic hope, because it is obvious that the force of storm is being broken and the winds are dying down, otherwise the fires would be swept along and would not be settling.</p>
