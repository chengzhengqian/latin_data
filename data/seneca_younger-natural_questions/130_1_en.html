used to be a pond in Sicily, and there still is one in Syria,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL450_261_1" id="target_note_LCL450_261_1"><sup>1</sup></a> where bricks float and no objects thrown in sink no matter how heavy they are. The reason for this is obvious. Weigh anything you like and compare it with water, provided the volume of both is equal. If the water is heavier it will support the object which is lighter and lift it as high above the surface as it is lighter. Objects heavier than the water will sink. But if the weight of the water is equal to the weight of the object you measure it against, the object will neither go to the bottom nor stick up. It will be in balance with the water and in fact will float but almost submerged and without any part sticking up. This is why some logs are elevated<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">6</span><span class="br"></span> almost entirely above water, others are halfway submerged, others go down to the point of equal balance in the water. For, when the weight of both is equal neither yields to the other, but objects heavier than water sink, the lighter objects are supported. However, heavy or light derives not from our own estimate but from a comparison with the water in which the object is to be carried. So, when<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">7</span><span class="br"></span> water is heavier than a man’s body or a stone it does not permit anything to sink which does not overcome the water’s own heaviness. Thus it happens that in some ponds not even stones go to the bottom. I am talking about solid, hard stones. For there are many light, pumice-like stones of which islands are composed, namely those which float in Lydia.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL450_261_2" id="target_note_LCL450_261_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Theophrastus is my authority for this.</p>
