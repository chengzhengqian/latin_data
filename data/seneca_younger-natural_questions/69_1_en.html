<p>26. Fire is produced from a cloud. First of all,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1</span><span class="br"></span> there is no water in clouds, but dense air which is ready to produce water. The air is not yet changed into water but is already prepared for and verging on the change. You should not believe that the water is first amassed and afterwards poured down. It is formed and falls simultaneously. In the second<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> place, even though I may concede that a cloud is moist and filled with secreted water, still nothing prevents fire from being drawn out of something moist also, even out of pure moistureâ€”which will surprise you even more. Some say that nothing can change into fire before it has changed into water. Accordingly, a cloud can emit fire from some part of itself while the water it contains is unaffected, just as frequently part of a log burns while the other part exudes moisture.</p>
<p>Yet I do not say that moisture and fire are not<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> contrary to each other or that one is not destroyed by the other. But when the fire is stronger than the water, it conquers. On the other hand, when the quantity of water is abundant, the fire is ineffectual. Consequently, green wood does not burn. So, it makes a difference how much water is present. A scanty amount will neither resist nor impede the force of fire.</p>
<p>Why not? According to Posidonius, an island arose<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span> in the Aegean Sea, in the tradition of our forefathers.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL450_139_1a" id="target_note_LCL450_139_1a"><sup>1</sup></a> The sea foamed during the day and smoke was carried up from the depths. Finally night brought forth fire, not a continuous fire but one that flashed at
