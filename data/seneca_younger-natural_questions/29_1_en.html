larger and clearer through a glass ball filled with water. Fruits seem more beautiful than they actually are if they are floating in a glass bowl. Stars appear larger when you see them through a cloud because our vision grows dim in the moisture and is unable to apprehend accurately what it wants to. This will be demonstrated if you fill a cup with water and throw a ring into it. For, although the ring lies on the bottom, its image is reflected on the surface of the water.

Even if the cloud does not yet have water it is already forming it; that is, there exists already the property of the water into which the cloud may be changed from its own property.</p>

A glass rod is commonly made which is striated, or protruding with many angles like a club. If it receives the sun’s rays obliquely it sends back such colour as is usually seen in a rainbow. So you know there is not an image of the sun here but an imitation of its colour, from reflection.”</p>
