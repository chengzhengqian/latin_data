He describes the region of Meroë and calls it Philae. Lucan (10.302–303; 312–313), Pliny (5.53), Ammianus (22.15.12), and, in fact, all ancient authors clearly distinguish between Meroe and Philae. It was from Meroe that Nero had the distance measured to Aswan (cf. below, Bk. 6.8.3–4). Lucan in the <span class="italic">Pharsalia</span> devotes many lines (10.190–331) to the source and the flooding of the Nile. Since he was Seneca’s nephew and closely associated with him in the court of Nero there was very likely some exchange of ideas. It is to be noted that in the identification of Meroe Lucan is right and Seneca is wrong.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL457_23_4').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
