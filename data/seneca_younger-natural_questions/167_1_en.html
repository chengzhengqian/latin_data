It brings both water and soil to the sandy and thirsty ground. For, when it flows down muddy it deposits all its sediment in the dry, gaping cracks, and smears over parched areas all the rich mud it carried down with it. It aids the fields for two reasons: it both inundates them and coats them with mud. And so, any area it does not reach lies barren and ugly. If it rises beyond what is needed it does damage.</p>
<p>Therefore the remarkable characteristic of the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">10</span><span class="br"></span> river is that while other rivers wash away the land and exhaust it, the Nile, much larger than the others, is so far from eating away or rubbing away the soil that on the contrary it adds to the soil’s vigour. The least good in it is that it conditions the soil; for when the mud is carried in it saturates and binds the sand. Egypt owes to the Nile not only the fertility of the land but the land itself.</p>
