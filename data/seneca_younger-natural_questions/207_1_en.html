Varro also uses the name Vulturnus. But Eurus is already Latinized and does not come into our speech as though it were a foreign word.

To show that some winds are called by different names in different places, Pliny says (2.121) that Argestes is called Sciron at Athens and Olympias in the rest of Greece. Aristotle (2.6.363b 23–24) gives the same explanation: Sciron and Olympias are called Argestes.
