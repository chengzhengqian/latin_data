But you sufficiently protect yourself if your definition is thus: “A wave is the motion of the sea in one direction.” Such is the case especially in the subject we are now examining. You will not be trapped if you so express yourself that you say: “Wind is air flowing in one direction,” or “wind is air flowing from a force pushing it,” or “wind is the force of air moving in one direction,” or “a rush of fairly forcible air in one direction.”</p>

No one says that water flows if it moves simply within itself, but only if it is carried in some direction. Accordingly, something can move and yet not flow; on the other hand, nothing can flow except in one direction.</p>
<p>If this brief definition is secure enough from<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span> captious objection let us use it; yet if you are a more precise person you should not avoid a word if its addition can eliminate all carping.
