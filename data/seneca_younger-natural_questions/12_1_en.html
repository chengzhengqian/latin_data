<p>When a stone is thrown into a fishpond we see the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> water spread out in many circles, the first circle very narrow, then a wider one, then others still wider, until the impetus fades and is absorbed in a level of smooth water. Let us suppose something like this occurs also in the atmosphere. When air is compressed it can react to a blow; the light of the sun or of the moon, or of any star, encountering it forces it to recede in circles. Moisture and air, and in fact anything which is shaped by a blow, is forced into the same shape as that which shaped it. Now, all light is round. Therefore, air also struck by light will go into this round formation. For this reason the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> Greeks called such shining lights “threshing-floors”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL450_25_1" id="target_note_LCL450_25_1"><sup>1</sup></a> because generally the places set aside for threshing grain are round. Whether we call them “threshing-floors”
or “coronas,” we must not imagine that these lights actually occur in the vicinity of the stars. They are far away from the stars, even though they seem to encircle them like crowns. An image of this sort is formed close to the earth. Our vision is misled by its usual weakness and thinks that the ring of light is actually placed around a star. In the vicinity of the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span> stars and of the sun nothing of this sort can possibly happen because only tenuous ether exists there. For shapes are usually impressed only on dense and thick matter. On very tenuous matter forms do not have a substance where they can impose or maintain a shape. In steam-baths a halo of this sort is frequently seen around a lamp, because of the obscurity of the dense air. The same phenomenon occurs very often with the south wind, when the atmosphere is especially heavy and thick.</p>
