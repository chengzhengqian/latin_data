tremors of the earth do and how they produce amazing sights. Then why is anyone astonished that the bronze of a single statue, not even solid but hollow and thin, has been shattered, when perhaps moving air in seeking a way out has shut itself up inside that statue? But who does not know this? We have seen buildings with their corners split move apart and come back together again. Moreover, some things that were not fitted in their place and were made rather carelessly and loosely by artisans have been fastened together by the repeated shaking of an earthquake.</p>
<p>But if an earthquake cracks whole walls and entire<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span> homes and splits the sides of great towers, however solid they might be, and scatters pilings that support great structures, what reason is there that anyone should think it worth noting that a statue has been cut equally in two from top to bottom?</p>

Obviously all the air had not yet left but was still wandering around, even though the greater part of it had been emitted.
