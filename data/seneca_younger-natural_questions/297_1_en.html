<p>29. “The slowness of comets is proof,” someone<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1</span><span class="br"></span> says, “that they are rather heavy and contain much earth-matter. Besides, their very orbit is proof of this, for generally they are driven towards cardinal points.” Both ideas are wrong. I will speak first about the former. All bodies are heavy that move rather slowly. What about this? Is the planet Saturn heavy, which completes its orbit the slowest of all planets? And yet the fact that it is higher than the others holds proof of its lightness. “But,” you<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> say, “it circles by a greater orbit and does not move more slowly than the others but over a longer distance.” It should occur to you that I could make the same statement about comets, even if their orbit were slow. But it is not true that they move slowly, for this last comet ran across half the sky in only six months. The previous comet withdrew in fewer months.</p>
<p>“But because they are heavier they are carried<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> lower.” In the first place, a thing is not carried down, if it is carried around. In the second place, this recent comet started its motion in the north and passing through the west it arrived in the southern region and its orbit passed out of sight as it was rising. The other comet, the one in the time of Claudius, was first seen in the north, and was carried continuously straight up and did not stop until it disappeared.</p>
<p>These are the matters pertaining to comets which have impressed me and others. Whether or not they
