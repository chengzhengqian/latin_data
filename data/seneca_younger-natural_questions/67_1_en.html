<p>22. Since it is agreed that the two are fire, let us<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1</span><span class="br"></span> see how fire usually occurs on earth, for it will occur above it also on the same principle. It is produced
in two ways: one, by striking it out, as from a stone, for example; another, it is acquired by friction, as when two pieces of wood have been rubbed together for some time. Not every wood will do this for you, but only wood suitable for eliciting fire, such as laurel, ivy, and other wood familiar to shepherds for this use. It can happen, then, that clouds also produce fire the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> same way, by percussion or by friction. Think of the great force which drives squalls, the great impetus which whirls tornadoes. Whatever gets in their way is scattered, snatched up, and hurled far from its place. What surprise is it, then, if such a powerful<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> force strikes fire from something else or even from itself? You see how great a heat bodies would be likely to experience when they are battered by the passing of these winds. This should not be assumed so much in the case of winds as of heavenly bodies also, whose enormous power is beyond question.</p>
<p>23. Perhaps, also, when the wind makes contact<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1</span><span class="br"></span> and presses lightly, clouds are pushed against clouds and will elicit a fire which glows but does not leap forth. For less force is needed for a lightning flash than for a lightning bolt. We have considered above<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> what a glow certain woods produce when rubbed together. When air, which can be changed into fire, is subjected to friction by a great force (for example, by its own force when it changes into wind)
