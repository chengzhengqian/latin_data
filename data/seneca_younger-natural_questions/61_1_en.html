flame. In the same way, the air, which I said a little while ago was pressed out by colliding clouds and hurled against other clouds, cannot be forced out or escape without making a sound. However, a<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">6</span><span class="br"></span> different crashing noise is made according to differences in clouds,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL450_123_1" id="target_note_LCL450_123_1"><sup>1</sup></a> some of which have a larger cavity, others a smaller. But air that has been forcibly driven out is fire, which has the name of lightning flash, kindled by a slight impact and without force. We see the flash before we hear the sound because our eyesight is swift and greatly outdistances our hearing.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL450_123_2" id="target_note_LCL450_123_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>13. The theory of those who preserve fire in clouds<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1</span><span class="br"></span> is erroneous, as can be inferred from many speculations. If the fire falls from the sky why does it not do so daily since it always blazes as much up there? Then, they give no explanation why fire, which by nature flows down, rises. The circumstances of our fires on earth from which sparks fall is another matter. The sparks have some weight in themselves. Fire does not descend this way; rather it is forced and conducted downward. Nothing analogous<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> to this happens in the case of pure celestial fire, in which there is nothing that might be pressed down. Otherwise, if any part of it falls the whole is in danger because whatever can suffer subtraction can collapse as a whole. But what about that falling fire? Is it light or heavy? Is it light? Then it cannot tumble because its lightness prevents it from
