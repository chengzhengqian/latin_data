improbable that a whirlwind continues over such a great space, for the larger a whirlwind is the more quickly it is broken up.</p>
<p>9. Let Epigenes, then, choose whichever alternative<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1</span><span class="br"></span> he wants: either a light force will be unable to rise very high, or a large and disturbed force will break itself up quickly.</p>
<p>Furthermore, as Epigenes thinks, these lower comets do not travel very high because they have too much earthy substance. Their own weight keeps them close to the proximity of the earth. And yet in those other comets, the ones that are longer lasting and higher, there must be more plentiful material. For they would not appear for such a long time unless they were sustained by a greater nourishment.</p>
<p>I was saying recently that turbulent air cannot<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> continue very long nor rise above the moon or grow up to the place of the stars. Obviously, it is the struggling of many winds among themselves which produces a whirlwind. Such a struggle cannot last long. For when wandering and irregular moving air has become convoluted the force of all the winds eventually yields to one wind. Moreover, a large<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> storm does not last. The more strength squalls have, the less time they have. Winds diminish when they reach their maximum. It needs be that all violence by its very impetuosity tends towards its own destruction. Consequently, no one has seen a whirlwind last an entire day or even an hour; its speed is startling and its brevity is amazing. Besides, on the earth and around it a whirlwind flies more violently and swiftly. The higher it is the less cohesive and compact it is, and for this reason it is
