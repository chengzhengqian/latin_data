instead of individual drops there appears a single blurred reflection from all the drops.</p>
<p>Aristotle thinks the same way.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL450_37_1" id="target_note_LCL450_37_1"><sup>1</sup></a> He says that the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">7</span><span class="br"></span> eyesight reflects its own rays from every smooth surface. Of course, nothing is smoother than water and air. Thus, even from dense air our gaze is reflected back to us. In fact, when vision is weak and dull it will fail at the slightest stab of air. Some people suffer therefore from this kind of infirmity—they see their own reflection everywhere and seem to be running into themselves. Why? Because their weak vision is not able to penetrate even the air nearest them, but rebounds. Thus, what dense air<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">8</span><span class="br"></span> causes in most cases, all air causes in their case. Any sufficient air at all is able to repel their weak vision. Water reflects our gaze much more because it is dense and cannot be penetrated. Our visual rays are stopped and sent back to where they came from.</p>
<p>Therefore, when there are numerous raindrops they act as so many mirrors, but because they are small they reflect only the sun’s colour, not its shape. Eventually, when the same colour is reflected in the innumerable drops that fall without interval, the reflection begins to be not that of many separate images but of a single, long, continuous image.</p>
<p>“How,” you ask, “do you assert that there are<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">9</span><span class="br"></span> many thousands of images there where I see none? And, although there is one colour in the sun, why are there many colours in its reflections?” To refute
