Why this happens can be<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">9</span><span class="br"></span> understood from the explanation I have already given. For, if the halo fades all round, it is obvious that the atmosphere is even and therefore calm. If the halo is cut away on one side, it is obvious that the air is pressing in from that direction; and accordingly that region will produce a wind. But one torn apart and split on all sides indicates that force is being exerted on it from all sides and that the atmospheric disturbance is assailing it from one direction or another. And so, from this agitation of air, with repeated assaults and struggles in all directions, it is clear that there will be a storm with several winds participating.</p>
<p>Such halos will be seen generally at night around<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">10</span><span class="br"></span> the moon and other heavenly bodies; but rarely in the daytime. Consequently, some Greeks argue that they do not occur at all during the day.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL450_29_2" id="target_note_LCL450_29_2"><sup>2</sup></a> However, records prove that they are wrong. The reason for their rarity in daylight is this: because the light from the sun is too strong, and the atmosphere, agitated and heated by the sun, is moving too freely. The force of the moon’s rays is weaker and so more easily resisted by the surrounding atmosphere.
