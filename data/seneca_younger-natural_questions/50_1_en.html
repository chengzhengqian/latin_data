<p>“Why,” you ask, “have you put the study of earth-quakes<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> in the section where you will talk about thunder and lightning?” Because, although an earthquake is caused by a blast, a blast is none the less air in motion. Even if the air goes down into the earth it is not to be studied there. Let it be considered in the region where nature has placed it.</p>
<p>I will say something which will seem even more<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span> surprising: in the section on astronomy it will be necessary to talk about the earth. “Why?” you ask. Because when we examine in their own section the properties of the earth, whether it is flat, unsymmetrical, and irregularly elongated, or resembles exactly the shape of a ball and organizes its parts into a globe; whether it confines the waters or is confined by them, whether it is an animal or an inert mass without feeling, full of air but not its own breath; and other questions of this sort, whenever they come to hand—all belong to geology and will be placed in the lowest category. But when we<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span> investigate what the position of the earth is, in what part of the universe it has settled, how it is situated in respect to the stars and the sky—such an inquiry will belong to the higher phenomena and attain a better status, so to speak.</p>
<p>2. Since I have talked about the categories into<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1</span><span class="br"></span> which the whole subject of nature is divided, I must make some general comments. First, this must be taken as a premise: atmosphere is among those substances which have unity. What this means and<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> why it must be grasped to begin with, you will understand if I go back over it a little more deeply and say that some things are continuous, some are
