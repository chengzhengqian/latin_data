with continuous rain. Moreover, crops could not<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> be gathered if the useless parts, which are mixed in with the parts worth saving, were not winnowed out by the wind; or if the wind did not stimulate the growing crop and uncover the hidden fruit by breaking open its wrappings (called “follicles” by farmers).</p>
<p>And, too, the wind has made communication<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span> possible between all peoples and has joined nations which are separated geographically. A great benefit of nature, if the madness of man did not turn it to his own destruction! As things are, however, it could be said of winds what was commonly said of Julius Caesar,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL457_115_1a" id="target_note_LCL457_115_1a"><sup>1</sup></a> as reported by Titus Livy; it is uncertain whether it was better for the state that Caesar had been born or not. Indeed, whatever is useful and necessary from the winds cannot be balanced by the things which the madness of mankind devises for its own destruction. Even if they do<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span> cause harm by the wrongdoing of men who use them evilly, not on this account are the winds evil by nature. Actually, Providence and that god who is the organizer of the universe did not arrange to move the atmosphere by winds and to distribute winds from all directions (lest anything become barren because of inactivity) only so that we might fill up our fleets with armed soldiers to seize part of the deep waters and only so that we might seek out an enemy on the sea or even beyond the sea!</p>
<p>What madness drives us and makes us ready to<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">6</span><span class="br"></span> destroy one another? We spread sails to the winds
