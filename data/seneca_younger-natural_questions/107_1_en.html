<p>2. All waters are still, or running, or collected, or<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1</span><span class="br"></span> occupy various subterranean channels. Some are sweet, others have flavours that are disagreeable in different ways; among them are the salty, the bitter, and the medicinal. In the last category I mean sulphur, iron, and alum waters. The taste indicates<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> the properties. They have many other distinctive qualities in addition. First, there is touch: they are hot or cold. Then weight: they are light or heavy. Then colour: they are clear, muddy, blue, yellowish. Then their effect on health: for some are wholesome, others are deadly. There are certain waters which thicken into rock, others are thin or fat. Some give nourishment, some pass through without any benefit to the drinker; and some waters, when drunk, stimulate fecundity.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL450_215_1" id="target_note_LCL450_215_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>3. The topography of the land causes water either <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1</span><span class="br"></span> to stand or to flow. On a slope, it flows down. On a flat, level area it is retained and becomes stagnant. Sometimes it is forced backwards by the wind; then
it does not flow but is driven. It is collected water when it comes from the rain. It is native when it comes from its own spring. However, there is nothing to prevent water from being both collected and native in the same place. We see this at Lake Fucinus, into which the surrounding heights direct whatever water the rain pours down. But the lake also has great sources hidden in its depths; thus it retains its usual appearance even when the winter torrents have ceased to flow.</p>
