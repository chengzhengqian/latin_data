it is obvious that no actual colour is formed but only the appearance of a counterfeit colour, the sort that the neck of a pigeon alternately takes on or puts aside whenever it changes position, as I have already said. This also is the case in a mirror, which assumes no colour but only a kind of copy of the colour of something else. I must settle only one thing: the image<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> of the sun is not seen in that glass rod. The rod is incapable of reproducing the image accurately. In fact, it tries to reflect the image because the material is smooth and suitable for this, but it cannot because it is shaped irregularly. If a suitably formed glass rod were made, it would reflect as many suns as it has knobs. Because the knobs are units separated from each other and are not sufficiently shiny to serve as mirrors, they only start images; they do not portray them distinctly. Because of their proximity the images are jumbled together and reduced to the appearance of a single colour.</p>
<p>8. But why does a rainbow not form a complete<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1</span><span class="br"></span> circle but appears as a half section of a circle even when it is extended and curved out to its greatest length? Some authorities have the following opinion:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL450_61_1" id="target_note_LCL450_61_1"><sup>1</sup></a> “Since the sun is much higher than the clouds, it strikes them only on the upper side; it follows that their lower side is not coloured by the light. Therefore, since they receive the sun only on one part, they reproduce only one part of the sun, which is never more than half.”</p>

Aristotle gives a lengthy explanation of why the rainbow can never be a complete circle (3.5.375b 16-377a 28; cf. 3.2.371b 18). Pliny (2.150) merely asserts that the rainbow is always a semicircle.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL450_61_1').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
