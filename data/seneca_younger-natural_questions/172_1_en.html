At that time there was opportunity for falsehood. Since foreign countries were unknown it was easy for them to send out fabulous stories. But now all the shores of the outer sea are touched by the ships of merchants. No one of them reports that the Nile begins there, or that the sea is of a different taste there. Nature forbids this last point from being believed because the sun draws off from the sea all the fresh water, since it is also the lightest. Besides, why does the Nile not rise<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">25</span><span class="br"></span> in the winter? At that time especially the sea can be stirred up by the winds, and actually by winds considerably stronger than the Etesian, for the Etesians
are moderate. If the Nile came from the Atlantic Ocean it would flood Egypt all at once.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL457_39_1a" id="target_note_LCL457_39_1a"><sup>1</sup></a> But in fact the Nile flooding is gradual.</p>

Therefore veins of water are dried up by the internal heat. But in other countries, he says, rivers are swollen by rains and the Nile diminishes because it is not supported by rainfall. Then it increases during the summer, at which time the interiors of the earth become cold and frost returns to springs.</p>

He is given credit by Pliny (5.51) and by Ammianus (22.15.8) for identifying
the source of the Nile in a mountain of lower Mauretania not far from the Ocean, and he brought back a crocodile from that area to prove his theory. According to Ammianus he obtained the information from Punic books. Lucan (10.255–257)
simply reports the rumour that the Nile comes from the Ocean, and makes no mention of Juba as an authority. It is curious that in what remains of Seneca’s “Nile” book and the résumé of Seneca’s sources given by Lydus there is no reference to Juba. Vitruvius (8.2.7) argues that the presence of crocodiles and other Nile creatures in springs flowing to the Western Ocean proves that the source of the Nile is in Mauretania.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL457_39_1a').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL457_39_2"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL457_39_2" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">2</sup>Oenopides of Chios was a contemporary of Anaxagoras.
