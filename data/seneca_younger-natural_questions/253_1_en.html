does not extend two hundred miles. That recent earthquake, which has filled the world with stories, did not travel beyond Campania. Why should I ex-when<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span> plain that when Chalcis trembled, Thebes stood firm; Aegium suffered, Patrae, so near it, only heard about the earthquake? The vast shock which smashed two cities, Helice and Buris, stopped around Aegium. Therefore, it appears that an earthquake spreads over only as much area as the cavity of empty space extends under the earth.</p>
<p>26. In order to prove this I could have used, or<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1</span><span class="br"></span> misused, the authority of great men who report that Egypt has never had an earthquake.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL457_201_1" id="target_note_LCL457_201_1"><sup>1</sup></a> They give the following explanation of this phenomenon: the fact that Egypt has grown entirely from mud. For, if there is any reliability in Homer, Pharos was as far away from the continent as a ship travelling with full sails could measure in one day’s journey.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL457_201_2a" id="target_note_LCL457_201_2a"><sup>2</sup></a> But Pharos has been moved up to the continent.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL457_201_3" id="target_note_LCL457_201_3"><sup>3</sup></a> The swollen Nile as it flows down carries with it a great quantity of mud and adds it from time to time to the existing land and by annual increment always carries Egypt farther out. Hence the land is a rich, muddy soil and does not have within itself any openings but grows into a solid as the mud dries. Its structure was compressed sediment when the parts were glued together; nor can any empty space intervene since liquid and soft substance is always added to the solid material.</p>
