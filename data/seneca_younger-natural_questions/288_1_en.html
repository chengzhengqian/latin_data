wards the upper regions, none the less when the fuel becomes insufficient a comet goes backward and sinks down by itself. Also, in the atmosphere it does not press to the right or left side—for it has no route—but
it crawls wherever a vein of its food leads it. It does not proceed as a star does but feeds as a fire does.</p>
<p>“Why, then, does it appear for a long time and is<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> not quickly extinguished?” The comet we have seen in the very happy principate of Nero displayed itself to our view for six months, moving in a direction opposite to the comet of Claudius’ time. The Claudius comet rose from the north into the zenith and moved east, always growing dimmer. The Nero comet began in the same place but as it started moving towards the west it turned south and there withdrew from sight. Obviously the Claudius comet found<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span> smokier elements, and elements more suited to its fires, which it followed. The Nero comet, on the other hand, found a richer and more abundant region, and so it descended to it, lured by its food not by its route. It is apparent that the two comets we saw had different routes since the Nero one moved towards the right, the other one towards the left. Moreover, all five planets have motion in the same direction, that is, contrary to the motion of the universe. For the universe revolves from east to west, the planets travel from west to east, and for this reason they have a double motion: one the direction in which they move and the other the direction in which they are carried away.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL457_271_1" id="target_note_LCL457_271_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
