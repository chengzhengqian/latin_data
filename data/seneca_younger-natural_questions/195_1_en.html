<p>First, then, let us look at the pre-dawn breezes, which are carried from rivers, valleys, or some bay. None of these breezes lasts long but falls when the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> sun becomes stronger. They do not pass beyond sight of the earth. This type of wind begins in the spring, does not last beyond summer, and comes mostly from places where there are mountains and an abundance of water. Plains, although they abound in water, lack these breezes. I mean breezes which are strong enough to be considered winds.</p>
<p>8. Next, how is that breeze formed which the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1</span><span class="br"></span> Greeks call <span class="italic">Encolpias</span> [“gulf breeze”]? All the exhalations of the swamps and rivers (which are, by the way, considerable and continuous) provide nourishment for the sun during the day. At night they are not drained off and since they are hemmed in by mountains they accumulate in one region. When they have filled this region and no longer have room they are squeezed towards some point and move in one direction. This becomes wind. Of course, it inclines towards any place where it is attracted by a fairly free exit with open space. The accumulated exhalations rush into that open space. A proof of this is that a gulf breeze does not blow in<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> the early part of the night, for the accumulation I recently mentioned has just begun to form. Towards daylight it is at the full stage. When it is overfull it searches for a direction in which to flow out and by preference leaves wherever there is the largest empty space and a big open area. Moreover, the rising sun strikes the cold air and applies a stimulus to the accumulation. For even before the sun appears even its light has power. It does not, it is
