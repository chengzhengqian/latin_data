the comet was split, since they must be two of the five planets?</p>
<p>17. Apollonius of Myndos has a theory different<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1</span><span class="br"></span> from Epigenes. He says that a comet is not one body composed of many planets but that many comets are planets. A comet, he says, is not an illusion or fire extending from the edges of two planets but is a celestial body on its own, like the sun and the moon. It has a distinct shape thus: not limited to a disc, but extended and elongated lengthwise.
