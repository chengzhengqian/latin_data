if nothing interferes, maintains a fixed period, as birth is ready in its proper month; so water has its cycles in which it withdraws and returns. However, some cycles are short and thus noticeable, others are longer but no less fixed. And what is remarkable<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> about this, when you see that in nature the sequence of events proceeds in accordance with established laws? Winter never misses, summer becomes hot at the proper time, the changes of autumn and spring come from habitual causes, the solstice and the equinox alike return on their proper dates.</p>
<p>There are also laws of nature under the earth, less<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span> known to us but no less fixed. Believe me that there exists below whatever you see above.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL450_239_1" id="target_note_LCL450_239_1"><sup>1</sup></a> There, too, vast caverns exist, and great recesses, and vacant spaces with mountains overhanging here and there. There are gulfs gaping into infinity which have frequently swallowed up cities that fell into them and buried the mighty ruins in the depths. These places<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span> are filled with air—for no void exists anywhere—and
there are marshes enveloped in darkness, and great lakes. Also, living creatures are born there, but they are slow and deformed since they were conceived in dark, heavy air, and in water made torpid by its inactivity. Many of these creatures are blind, like moles and subterranean rats who have no vision since none is needed. According to Theophrastus, fish are dug up from such depths in certain places.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL450_239_2" id="target_note_LCL450_239_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
