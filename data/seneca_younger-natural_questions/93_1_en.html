clouds, but only parts into parts. Nor do soft substances make a sound unless they collide with hard ones. Thus, a wave is not audible unless it is dashed against an obstacle.</p>
<p>“When fire is plunged into water it makes a sound<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> while it is being extinguished,” he says. Suppose this is so; it supports my argument. For the fire does not make the sound but the air which is escaping through the extinguishing water. I grant you that fire is both produced and extinguished in a cloud; but it is born from air and friction.</p>
<p>“Well, then,” he says, “is it not possible that<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> some of those shooting stars fall into a cloud and are extinguished?” Let us suppose that this, too, can happen sometimes. But we are now seeking the natural and usual cause, not the rare and accidental. Consider that I admit what you say is true, that sometimes after thunder fires gleam like shooting and falling stars. Thunder was not caused on this account, but when this happened thunder occurred.</p>

The parallel is incorrect. Such a gleam appears in the water itself. The one which occurs in the atmosphere bursts and leaps out of its element.</p>
