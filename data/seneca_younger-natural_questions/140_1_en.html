<p>Yet he reduced his great inspiration and subject to childish silliness:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">The wolf swims among the sheep,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">The water carries tawny lions.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL450_281_1" id="target_note_LCL450_281_1"><sup>1</sup></a></span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p></blockquote>
<p>It is not a sufficiently serious attitude to make fun<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">14</span><span class="br"></span> of the whole world now swallowed up. He spoke grandly and caught the image of such vast confusion when he said:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">The widespread rivers</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Rush through open plains.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">... Towers totter</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">And sink</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Under the flood.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL450_281_2" id="target_note_LCL450_281_2"><sup>2</sup></a></span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">This is magnificently said. If only he had not been concerned with what the sheep and the wolves were doing. But could anything be swimming in this deluge and destruction? Were not all beasts drowned by the same force which carried them off?</p>
<p>You conceived the great image you should have,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">15</span><span class="br"></span> with all the lands overwhelmed and the sky itself rushing into the earth. Keep it up. You will know what is fitting if you bear in mind that the entire earth is swimming.</p>
<p>28. Now let us return to the discussion. There<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1</span><span class="br"></span> are those who think that the earth can be damaged but not destroyed by excessive rains. Mighty things must be stricken by a mighty blow. Rain will make the crops bad, hail will knock down the fruit, rivers will swell in their channels but will subside again. </p>
