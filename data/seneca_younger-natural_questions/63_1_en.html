that some blocks of houses which have been growing hot for a long time catch fire spontaneously. It is much the same way in the upper atmosphere also; it is probable that something which has the capacity to attract fire is kindled by the heat of the atmosphere above it. For it needs be that both the lowest ether has something similar to atmosphere and the highest atmosphere is not dissimilar to the lowest ether, because a transition from different to different does not occur immediately. On the confines they mingle their properties so gradually that you cannot tell whether it is atmosphere or already ether.</p>
<p>15. Some Stoics believe that since air can be changed into fire and water it does not draw new causes of fire from an outside source. Fire kindles itself by movement. When it dissipates dense and compact masses of clouds, it necessarily emits a loud noise in the bursting of such large bodies. Furthermore, this conflict of the resisting clouds contributes somewhat to arousing fire. As an analogy, the hand contributes something to the knife in cutting but it is the knife that cuts.</p>
<p>16. What is the difference between a lightning<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1</span><span class="br"></span> flash and a lightning bolt? I will explain. A lightning flash is fire that has been spread out over
a wide area; a lightning bolt is fire that has been compressed and hurled violently. Sometimes we take up water in our two clasped hands and pressing our palms together squirt out the water the way a pump does. Suppose something like this occurs in the clouds. The constricted space of the compressed clouds forces out the air that is between them and by means of this pressure sets the air afire
