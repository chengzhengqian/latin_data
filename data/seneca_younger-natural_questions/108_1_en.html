<p>4. First then, let us investigate how the earth<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1</span><span class="br"></span> supplies the continuous flow of rivers, and where such great quantities of water come from. We are surprised that the seas are not affected by the addition of the rivers; it is equally surprising that the earth is not affected by the loss of the waters leaving it.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL450_217_1" id="target_note_LCL450_217_1"><sup>1</sup></a> What is it that has filled the earth up in such a way that it can either furnish great quantities from its hidden recesses or make good, as it does repeatedly, what it has lost? Whatever explanation we give of
a river, the same will be so of streams and springs.</p>
<p>5. Some think<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL450_217_2" id="target_note_LCL450_217_2"><sup>2</sup></a> that the earth receives back<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1</span><span class="br"></span> whatever water it has emitted; and for this reason the oceans do not grow larger because they do not assimilate the water which flows into them but immediately return it to the land. For, the water enters the land by hidden routes—openly it comes to the sea; secretly does it return. Sea water is filtered in transit<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL450_217_3" id="target_note_LCL450_217_3"><sup>3</sup></a> because it is battered by the many circuitous passages in the earth and sets aside its salinity and impurities. In the many different types of soil it sheds its disagreeable taste and changes into fresh water.</p>
<p>6. Some suppose that whatever water the earth<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1</span><span class="br"></span> receives from rain this it sends out again, and as proof they point out that there are very few rivers in those

Aristotle 2.2.255b 20–25: The old question why so great an amount of water disappears (for the sea becomes no larger even though innumerable rivers of immense
size are flowing into it every day) is quite a natural one to ask. Pliny believes (2.166) that the theory of veins carrying waters inside the earth explains why seas do not increase with the daily accession of so many rivers.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL450_217_1').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL450_217_2"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL450_217_2" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">2</sup>Aristotle (2.2.345b 2–23) presents and refutes the theories that rivers get their water from the sea.
