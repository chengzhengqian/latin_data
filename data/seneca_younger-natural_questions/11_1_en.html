<p>As Gylippus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL450_23_1" id="target_note_LCL450_23_1"><sup>1</sup></a> was sailing to Syracuse a star seemed<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">14</span><span class="br"></span> to him to have settled on the very point of his javelin. In Roman camps spears have apparently been burning, obviously because the fires have fallen on them.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL450_23_2" id="target_note_LCL450_23_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Like lightning bolts they often strike animals and trees, but if they employ comparatively little force they merely flow down and settle. They do not cause damage or wounds. Moreover, some are thrust out between clouds, others from a serene sky if the atmosphere has been ready to discharge them. In the same way, it thunders sometimes in a clear<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">15</span><span class="br"></span> sky for the same reason that it thunders in a cloudy sky, because the air collides internally. Even if the air is fairly clear and dry none the less it can concentrate and make a sort of substance similar to the clouds, which produce sound when struck. When do Boards occur, or Shields,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL450_23_3" id="target_note_LCL450_23_3"><sup>3</sup></a> or the shapes of vast fires? When the same cause, only more powerful, acts on matter of this sort.</p>
<p>2. Now let us see what causes that bright light<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1</span><span class="br"></span> which surrounds stars. It is recorded in history that the day the deified Augustus entered Rome on his return from Apollonia<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL450_23_4" id="target_note_LCL450_23_4"><sup>4</sup></a> a circle of varied colours was seen around the sun, colours that usually appear in a rainbow. The Greeks call it a “halo.” We can call it, very appropriately, a “corona.” I will expound how it is said to be formed.</p>
