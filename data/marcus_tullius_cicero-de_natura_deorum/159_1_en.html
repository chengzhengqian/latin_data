place towards which it travels by natural impulsion, one to the bottom, another to the top and another to the middle; such elements can cohere for a certain time, but cannot possibly do so for ever, for each must of necessity be borne away by nature to its own place; therefore no living thing is everlasting.</p>
<span class="innerMarginNote left">35</span><p>“But your school, Balbus, is wont to trace all things<span class="marginNote right">Fire is not specially essential to life;</span>back to an elemental force of a fiery nature, herein as I believe following Heraclitus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL268_319_a" id="target_note_LCL268_319_a"><sup>a</sup></a> although all do not interpret the master in one way; however, as he did not wish his meaning to be understood,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL268_319_b" id="target_note_LCL268_319_b"><sup>b</sup></a> let us leave him out; but your doctrine is that all force is of the nature of fire, and that because of this animal creatures perish when their heat fails and also in every realm of nature a thing is alive and vigorous if it is warm. But I for my part do not understand how organisms should perish if their heat is quenched without perishing if deprived of moisture or air, especially <span class="innerMarginNote left">36</span> as they also perish from excessive heat; therefore what you say about heat applies also to the other elements. However, let us see what follows. Your view, I believe, is that there is no animate being contained within the whole universe of nature except fire. Why fire any more than air (<span class="italic">anima</span>), of which also the soul (<span class="italic">animus</span>) of animate beings consists, from which the term ‘animate’ is derived? On what ground moreover do you take it for granted that there is no soul except fire? It seems more reasonable to hold that soul is of a composite nature, and consists of fire and air combined. However, if fire is animate<span class="marginNote right">but if it is the source of feeling, it must be destructible,</span> in and by itself, without the admixture of any other element, it is the presence of fire in our own bodies that causes us to possess sensation, and therefore fire itself cannot be devoid of sensation.
