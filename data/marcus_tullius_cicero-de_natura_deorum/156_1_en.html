indeed we suppose that the sun holds conversation with the moon when their courses approximate, or that the world makes a harmonious music,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL268_313_a" id="target_note_LCL268_313_a"><sup>a</sup></a> as Pythagoras believes. These faculties, Balbus, are the gifts of nature—not nature ‘walking in craftsmanlike manner’ as Zeno<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL268_313_b" id="target_note_LCL268_313_b"><sup>b</sup></a> says (and what this means we will consider in a moment), but nature by its own motions and mutations imparting motion and activity <span class="innerMarginNote left">28</span> to all things. And so I fully agreed with the part of your discourse<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL268_313_c" id="target_note_LCL268_313_c"><sup>c</sup></a> that dealt with nature’s punctual regularity, and what you termed its concordant interconnexion and correlation; but I could not accept your assertion that this could not have come about were it not held together by a single divine breath.
