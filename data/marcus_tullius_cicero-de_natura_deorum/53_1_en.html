I do not understand the doctrine, if you who maintain it understood it yourselves! How can you prove that the stream of images is continuous, or if it is, how are the images eternal? You say that there is an innumerable supply of atoms. Are you going to argue then that everything is eternal, for the same reason? You take refuge in the principle of ‘equilibrium’ (for so with your consent we will translate <span class="italic">isonomia</span>), and you say that because there is mortal substance there must also be immortal substance. On that showing, because there are mortal men, there are also some that are immortal, and because there are men born on land, there are men born in the water. ‘And because there are forces of destruction, there are also forces of preservation.’ Suppose there were, they would only preserve things that already exist; but I am not aware that your gods do <span class="innerMarginNote left">110</span> exist.

You fail entirely therefore to prove divine immortality.</p>
<p>XL. “Now let us consider divine happiness. Happiness is admittedly impossible without virtue.

In what then does his life consist? ‘In a constant succession of things good,’ you reply, ‘without any admixture of evils.’ Things good—what things?
