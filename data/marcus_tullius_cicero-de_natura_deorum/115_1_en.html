<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">Next in the mighty zone comes Capricorn,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Half-brute, half-man; his mighty bosom breathes</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">An icy chill; and when the Titan sun</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Arrayeth him with never-ceasing light,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">He turns his car to climb the wintry sky.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p></blockquote><span class="innerMarginNote left">113</span><p>Here we behold</p><blockquote><p>
<span class="line">How there appears the Scorpion rising high,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">His mighty tail trailing the bended Bow;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Near which on soaring pinions wheels the Bird</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">And near to this the burning Eagle flies.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p></blockquote>
<p>Then the Dolphin,</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">And then Orion slopes his stooping frame.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p></blockquote>
<span class="innerMarginNote left">114</span><p>Following him</p><blockquote><p>
<span class="line">The glowing Dog-star radiantly shines.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p></blockquote>
<p>After this follows the Hare,</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">Who never resteth weary from her race;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">At the Dog’s tail meandering Argo glides.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Her the Ram covers, and the scaly Fishes,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">And her bright breast touches the River’s<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL268_231_a" id="target_note_LCL268_231_a"><sup>a</sup></a> banks.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p></blockquote>
<p>Its long winding current you will observe,</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">And in the zenith you will see the Chains</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">That bind the Fishes, hanging at their tails. . . .</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Then you’ll descry, near the bright Scorpion’s sting,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">The Altar, fanned by Auster’s gentle breath.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p></blockquote>
<p>And by it the Centaur</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">Proceeds, in haste to join the Horse’s parts</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Unto the Claws; extending his right hand,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">That grasps the mighty beast, he marches on</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">And grimly strides towards the Altar bright.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Here Hydra rises from the nether realms,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p></blockquote>
<p>her body widely outstretched;</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">And in her midmost coil the Wine-bowl gleams,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">While pressing at her tail the feathered Crow</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Pecks with his beak; and here, hard by the Twins,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">The Hound’s Forerunner, in Greek named <span class="italic">Prokyon</span>.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
