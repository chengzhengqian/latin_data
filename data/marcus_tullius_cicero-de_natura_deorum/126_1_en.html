three things requisite for the maintenance of animal<span class="marginNote right">provision for the support of his life by food and air;</span> life, food, drink and breath; and for the reception of all of these the mouth is most consummately adapted, receiving as it does an abundant supply of breath through the nostrils which communicate with it. The structure of the teeth within the mouth serves to chew the food, and it is divided up and softened by them.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL268_253_a" id="target_note_LCL268_253_a"><sup>a</sup></a> The front teeth are sharp, and bite our viands into pieces; the back teeth, called molars, masticate them, the process of mastication apparently being <span class="innerMarginNote left">135</span> assisted also by the tongue. Next to the tongue comes the gullet, which is attached to its roots, and into which in the first place pass the substances that have been received in the mouth. The gullet is adjacent to the tonsils on either side of it, and reaches as far as the back or innermost part of the palate. The action and movements of the tongue drive and thrust the food down into the gullet, which receives it and drives it further down, the parts of the gullet below the food that is being swallowed dilating and <span class="innerMarginNote left">136</span> the parts above it contracting. The windpipe, or trachea<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL268_253_b" id="target_note_LCL268_253_b"><sup>b</sup></a> as it is termed by physicians, has an orifice attached to the roots of the tongue a little above the point where the tongue is joined to the gullet; it reaches to the lungs, and receives the air inhaled by breathing, and also exhales it and passes it out from the lungs; it is covered by a sort of lid, provided for the purpose of preventing a morsel of food from accidentally falling into it and impeding the breath. Below the gullet lies the stomach, which is constructed as the receptacle of food and drink, whereas breath is inhaled by the lungs and heart. The stomach performs a number of remarkable operations; its structure consists principally of muscular fibres, and it is
