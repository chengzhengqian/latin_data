violence from without; it therefore follows that every living thing is liable to death and dissolution, <span class="innerMarginNote left">30</span> and is divisible. For just as, if all wax were capable of change, nothing made of wax would be incapable of change, and likewise nothing made of silver or bronze if silver and bronze were substances capable<span class="marginNote right">(iii.) composed of elements themselves mutable and destructible,</span> of change, therefore similarly, if all the elements of which all things are composed are liable to change, there can be no body not liable to change; but the elements of which, according to your school, all things are composed are liable to change; therefore every body is liable to change. But if any body were not liable to death, then not every body would be liable to change. Hence it follows that every body is liable to death. In fact every body consists of either water or air or fire or earth, or of a combination of these elements or some of them; but none of these elements <span class="innerMarginNote left">31</span> is exempt from destruction; for everything of an earthy nature is divisible, and also liquid substance is soft and therefore easily crushed and broken up, while fire and air are very readily impelled by impacts of all kinds, and are of a consistency that is extremely yielding and easily dissipated; and besides, all these elements perish when they undergo transmutation, which occurs when earth turns into water, and when from water arises air, and from air aether, and when alternately the same processes are reversed; but if those elements of which every living thing consists <span class="innerMarginNote left">32</span> can perish, no living thing is everlasting.</p>
<p>XIII. And,<span class="marginNote right">(iv.) susceptible of pleasure and pain</span> to drop this line of argument, nevertheless no living thing can be found which either was never born or will live for ever. For every living thing has sensation; therefore it perceives both heat and cold, both sweetness and sournessâ€”it cannot through any of the
