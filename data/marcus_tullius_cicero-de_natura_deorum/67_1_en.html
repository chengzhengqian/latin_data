books it had come to his mind that there had been an irregularity when he took Scipio’s park as the site for his augural tent, for he had subsequently entered the city bounds to hold a meeting of the Senate and when crossing the bounds again on his return had forgotten to take the auspices<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL268_135_a" id="target_note_LCL268_135_a"><sup>a</sup></a>; and that therefore the consuls had not been duly elected. The College of Augurs referred the matter to the Senate; the Senate decided that the consuls must resign; they did so. What more striking instances can we demand? A man of the greatest wisdom and I may say unrivalled distinction of character preferred to make public confession of an offence that he might have concealed rather than that the stain of impiety should cling to the commonwealth; the consuls preferred to retire on the spot from the highest office of the state rather than hold it for one moment of time in violation of <span class="innerMarginNote left">12</span> religion. The augur’s office is one of high dignity; surely the soothsayer’s art also is divinely inspired. Is not one who considers these and countless similar facts compelled to admit that the gods exist?

But perhaps it may be argued that not all prophecies come true. Nor do all sick persons get well, but that does not prove that there is no art of medicine. Signs of future events are manifested by the gods; men may have mistaken these signs, but the fault lay. with man’s powers of inference, not with the divine nature.</p>
