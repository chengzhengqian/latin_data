<span class="line">Crouches the horned Bull, a mighty frame.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>

<span class="line">The Greeks were wont to call them Hyades,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p></blockquote>
<p>from their bringing rain, the Greek for which is <span class="italic">hyein</span>, while our nation stupidly names them the Sucking-pigs, as though the name Hyades were derived from the word for ‘pig’ and not from ‘rain.’ Behind the Lesser Septentrio follows Cepheus, with open hands outstretched;</p>

<span class="line">Andromeda, shunning her mother’s sight.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">The belly of the Horse touches her head,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Proudly he tosses high his glittering mane;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">One common star holds their twin shapes conjoint</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">And constellations linked indissolubly.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Close by them stands the Ram with wreathéd horns;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>

<span class="line">The Fishes gliding, one some space in front</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">And nearer to the North Wind’s shuddering breath.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
