<p>Yet this verse contains the seeds of every kind of mischief.</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line indent8">He with misguided mind</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">This day hath put the keys into my hand</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Wherewith I will unlock my utmost wrath</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">And work his ruin; grief shall be my portion</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">And sorrow his; mine exile, his extinction.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL268_351_a" id="target_note_LCL268_351_a"><sup>a</sup></a></span><span class="linebreak"></span>

<p>This gift of reason forsooth, which according to your school divine beneficence has bestowed on man alone, <span class="innerMarginNote left">67</span> the beasts do not possess; do you see then how great a boon the gods have vouchsafed to us? And Medea likewise, when flying from her father and her fatherland,</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line indent10">when her sire drew near,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">And now was all but in the act to seize her,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Her boy she did behead, and joint by joint</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Severed his limbs, and all about the fields</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">His body strewed: the same with this intent,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">That, while her father strove to gather up</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Her son’s dismember’d members, in the meantime</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">She might herself escape, so that his grief</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Should hinder his pursuit, and she win safety</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">By most unnatural murder of her kin.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL268_351_b" id="target_note_LCL268_351_b"><sup>b</sup></a></span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p></blockquote><span class="innerMarginNote left">68</span><p>Medea was criminal, but also she was perfectly rational. Again, does not the hero plotting the direful banquet for his brother turn the design this way and that in his thoughts?</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">More must I moil and bigger bale must brew,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Whereby to quell and crush his cruel heart.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL268_351_c" id="target_note_LCL268_351_c"><sup>c</sup></a></span><span class="linebreak"></span>

<p>XXVII. Nor must we pass over Thyestes himself, who</p>

<span class="line">Was not content to tempt my wife to sin—</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
