five planets that take place in the heavens every twenty-four hours, would any single native doubt that this orrery was the work of a rational being?</p>
<p>XXXV. These thinkers however raise doubts about the world itself from which all things arise and have their being, and debate whether it is the product of chance or necessity of some sort, or of divine reason and intelligence; they think more highly of the achievement of Archimedes in making a model of the revolutions of the firmament than of that of nature in creating them, although the perfection of the original shows a craftsmanship many times as great as does the <span class="innerMarginNote left">89</span> counterfeit. Just as the shepherd in Accius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL268_209_a" id="target_note_LCL268_209_a"><sup>a</sup></a> who had never seen a ship before, on descrying in the distance from his mountain-top the strange vessel of the Argonauts, built by the gods, in his first amazement and alarm cries out:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line indent14">so huge a bulk</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Glides from the deep with the roar of a whistling wind:</span><span class="linebreak"></span><span class="line">Waves roll before, and eddies surge and swirl;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Hurtling headlong, it snorts and sprays the foam.</span><span class="linebreak"></span><span class="line">Now might one deem a bursting storm-cloud rolled,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Now that a rock flew skyward, flung aloft</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">By wind and storm, or whirling waterspout</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Rose from the clash of wave with warring wave;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Save ’twere land-havoc wrought by ocean-flood,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Or Triton’s trident, heaving up the roots</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Of cavernous vaults beneath the billowy sea,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Hurled from the depth heaven-high a massy crag.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p></blockquote>
<p>At first he wonders what the unknown creature that he beholds may be. Then when he sees the warriors and hears the singing of the sailors, he goes on:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line indent10">the sportive dolphins swift</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Forge snorting through the foam—</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p></blockquote>
<p>and so on and so on—</p>
