And since this truth is almost universally accepted not only among philosophers but also among the unlearned, we must admit it as also being an accepted truth that we possess a ‘preconception,’ as I called it above, or ‘prior notion,’ of the gods. (For we are bound to employ novel terms to denote novel ideas, just as Epicurus himself employed the word <span class="italic">prolepsis</span> in a <span class="innerMarginNote left">45</span> sense in which no one had ever used it before.) We have then a preconception of such a nature that we believe the gods to be blessed and immortal.
