sanctified with divine honours for the purpose of promoting valour, to make the best men more willing to encounter danger for their country’s sake. This is the reason why Erechtheus and his daughters have been deified at Athens, and likewise there is the Leonatic<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL268_335_a" id="target_note_LCL268_335_a"><sup>a</sup></a> shrine at Athens, which is named <span class="italic">Leōcorion</span>. The people of Alabanda indeed worship Alabandus, the founder of that city, more devoutly than any of the famous deities. And it was there that Stratonicus uttered one of his many witty sayings; some person obnoxious to him swore that Alabandus was divine and Hercules was not: ‘Well and good,’ said Stratonicus, ‘let the wrath of Alabandus fall on <span class="innerMarginNote left">51</span> me and that of Hercules on you.’</p>

The rainbow itself is caused by some coloration of the clouds; and also a cloud is fabled to have given birth to the Centaurs. But if you enroll the clouds among the gods, you will undoubtedly have to enroll the seasons, which have been deified in the national ritual of Rome. If so, then rain and tempest, storm and whirlwind must be deemed divine. At any rate
