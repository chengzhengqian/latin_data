engage in wars and battles, and that not only when as in Homer two armies are contending and the gods take sides and intervene on their behalf, but they actually fought wars of their own, for instance with the Titans and with the Giants. These stories and these beliefs are utterly foolish; they are stuffed <span class="innerMarginNote left">71</span> with nonsense and absurdity of all sorts. But though<span class="marginNote right">True religion.</span> repudiating these myths with contempt, we shall nevertheless be able to understand the personality and the nature of the divinities pervading the substance of the several elements, Ceres permeating earth, Neptune the sea, and so on; and it is our duty to revere and worship these gods under the names which custom has bestowed upon them. But the best and also the purest, holiest and most pious way of worshipping the gods is ever to venerate them with purity, sincerity and innocence both of thought and of speech. For religion has been distinguished from superstition not only by philosophers but by our <span class="innerMarginNote left">72</span> ancestors. Persons who spent whole days in prayer and sacrifice to ensure that their children should outlive them were termed ‘superstitious’ (from <span class="italic">superstes</span>, a survivor), and the word later acquired a wider application. Those on the other hand who carefully reviewed and so to speak retraced all the lore of ritual were called ‘religious’ from <span class="italic">relegere</span> (to retrace or re-read), like ‘elegant’ from <span class="italic">eligere</span> (to select), ‘diligent’ from <span class="italic">diligere</span> (to care for), ‘intelligent’ from <span class="italic">intellegere</span> (to understand); for all these words contain the same sense of ‘picking out’ (<span class="italic">legere</span>) that is present in ‘religious.’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL268_193_a" id="target_note_LCL268_193_a"><sup>a</sup></a> Hence ‘superstitious’ and ‘religious’ came to be terms of censure and approval respectively. I think that I have said enough to prove the existence of the gods and their nature.</p>
