Cicero was aware that the objects of men’s worship were false. For after saying a number of things tending to subvert religion, he adds nevertheless that</span> these matters ought not to be discussed in public, lest such discussion destroy the established religion of the nation.</p>
<p>2. <span class="italic">Ib. ii</span>. 8. 10. <span class="italic">Cicero in discussing the nature of the gods says thus</span>: First therefore it is not probable that the material substance from which all things are derived was created by divine providence, but that it has and has had a force and nature of its own. As therefore the carpenter when about to build a house does not himself make timber but employs that which has been prepared, and the same with the modeller and his wax, so your divine providence ought to have been supplied with matter not made by itself but given to it ready-made. But if matter was not made by god, earth, water, air and fire also were not made by god.</p>
