He is said to have married Proserpina (really a Greek name, for she is the same as the goddess called <span class="italic">Persephone</span> in Greek)—they think that she represents the seed of corn, and fable that she was hidden away, <span class="innerMarginNote left">67</span> and sought for by her mother. The mother is Ceres, a corruption of ‘Geres,’ from <span class="italic">gero</span>, because she <span class="italic">bears</span> the crops; the same accidental change of the first letter is also seen in her Greek name <span class="italic">Dēmētēr</span>, a corruption of <span class="italic">gē mētēr</span> (‘mother earth’). Mavors again is from <span class="italic">magna vertere</span>, ‘the overturner of the great,’ while Minerva is either ‘she who minishes’ or ‘she who is minatory.’</p>

The name Apollo again is Greek; they say that he is the sun,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL268_189_a" id="target_note_LCL268_189_a"><sup>a</sup></a> and Diana they identify with the moon; the word <span class="italic">sol</span> being from <span class="italic">solus</span>, either because the sun ‘alone’ of all the heavenly bodies is of that magnitude, or because when the sun rises all the stars are dimmed and it ‘alone’ is visible; while the name <span class="italic">luna</span> is derived
