and a pyramid more beautiful than a sphere. Why, even in matters of taste you Epicureans have a criterion of your own! However, assuming that the figures which you mention are more beautiful to the eye—though for my part I don’t think them so, for what can be more beautiful than the figure that encircles and encloses in itself all other figures, and that can possess no roughness or point of collision on its surface, no indentation or concavity, no protuberance or depression? There are two forms that excel all others, among solid bodies the globe (for so we may translate the Greek <span class="italic">sphaera</span>), and among plane figures the round or circle, the Greek <span class="italic">kyklos</span>; well then, these two forms alone possess the property of absolute uniformity in all their parts and of having every point on the circumference equidistant from the centre; and nothing can be more compact than <span class="innerMarginNote left">48</span> that. Still, if you Epicureans cannot see this, as you have never meddled with that learned dust,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL268_169_a" id="target_note_LCL268_169_a"><sup>a</sup></a> could you not have grasped even so much of natural philosophy as to understand that the uniform motion and regular disposition of the heavenly bodies could not have been maintained with any other shape? Hence nothing could be more unscientific than your favourite assertion, that it is not certain that our world itself is round, since it may possibly have some other form, and there are countless numbers of worlds, all of <span class="innerMarginNote left">49</span> different shapes.
