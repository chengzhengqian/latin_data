in human form have furnished the poets with legends<span class="marginNote right">or personified forces of nature (this explains most of the gods of the mythology).</span> have filled man’s life with superstitions of all sorts. This subject was handled by Zeno and was later explained more fully by Cleanthes and Chrysippus. For example, an ancient belief prevailed throughout Greece that Caelus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL268_185_a" id="target_note_LCL268_185_a"><sup>a</sup></a> was mutilated by his son Saturn, and Saturn himself thrown into bondage <span class="innerMarginNote left">64</span> by his son Jove: now these immoral fables enshrined a decidedly clever scientific theory.
