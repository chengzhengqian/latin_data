Below this and nearer to the earth moves the star of Jupiter, called <span class="italic">Phaëthon</span> (the blazing star), which completes the same circuit of the twelve signs of the zodiac in twelve years, and makes the same variations <span class="innerMarginNote left">53</span> during its course as the star of Saturn. The orbit next below is that of <span class="italic">Pyroeis</span> (the fiery), which is called the star of Mars, and this covers the same orbit as the two planets above it in twenty-four months all but (I think) six days.
