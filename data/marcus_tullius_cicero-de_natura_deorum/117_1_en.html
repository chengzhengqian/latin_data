The air is enfolded by the highest part of the sky, termed the ethereal part; this both retains its own tenuous warmth uncongealed by any admixture and unites with the outer surface of the air.</p>

In the aether the stars revolve in their courses; these maintain their spherical form by their own internal gravitation, and also sustain their motions by virtue of their very shape and conformation; for they are round, and this is the shape, as I believe I remarked before,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL268_235_a" id="target_note_LCL268_235_a"><sup>a</sup></a> that is least capable of <span class="innerMarginNote left">118</span> receiving injury.
