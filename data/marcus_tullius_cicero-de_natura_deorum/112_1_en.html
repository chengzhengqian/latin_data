<p>and the latter’s extremely bright stars, visible to us all night long,</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">Our countrymen the Seven Triones<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL268_225_a" id="target_note_LCL268_225_a"><sup>a</sup></a> call;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>

<span class="innerMarginNote left">106</span><p>and the little Cynosure consists of an equal number of stars similarly grouped, and revolves round the same pole:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">Phoenician sailors place in this their trust</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">To guide their course by night; albeit the other</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Shines out before and with more radiant stars</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">At earliest night-fall far and wide is seen,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Yet small though this one is, the mariner</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">On this relies, since it revolves upon</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">An inner circle and a shorter path.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p></blockquote>
<p>XLII. Also the further to enhance the beauty of those constellations,</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">Between them, like a river flowing swift,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">The fierce-eyed Serpent winds; in sinuous coils</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Over and under twines his snaky frame.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p></blockquote><span class="innerMarginNote left">107</span><p>His whole appearance is very remarkable, but the most striking part of him is the shape of his head and the brilliance of his eye</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">No single shining star his head adorns,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">His brows are by a double radiance marked,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">And from his cruel eyes two lights flash out,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">The while his chin gleams with one flashing star;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">His graceful neck is bent, his head reclined,</span><span class="linebreak"></span><span class="line">As if at gaze upon the Great Bear’s tail.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p></blockquote>
<span class="innerMarginNote left">108</span><p>And while the rest of the Serpent’s body is visible all night long,</p><blockquote><p>
<span class="line">This head a moment sinks beneath the sea,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Where meet its setting and its rise in one.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p></blockquote>
<p>Next to its head however</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">The weary figure of a man in sorrow</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Revolves,</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
