make out their authors to have been not only not idiots, but actually philosophers. But as for your strained etymologies, one can only pity your misplaced ingenuity! Saturnus is so called because he is ‘sated with years,’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL268_347_a" id="target_note_LCL268_347_a"><sup>a</sup></a> Mavors because he ‘subverts the great,’ Minerva because she ‘minishes,’ or because she is ‘minatory,’ Venus because she ‘visits’ all things, Ceres from <span class="italic">gero</span> ‘to bear.’ What a dangerous practice! with a great many names you will be in difficulties.
