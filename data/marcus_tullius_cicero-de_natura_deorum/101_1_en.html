When we on the other hand speak of nature as the sustaining and governing principle of the world, we do not mean that the world is like a clod of earth or lump of stone or something else of that sort, which possesses only<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL268_203_a" id="target_note_LCL268_203_a"><sup>a</sup></a> the natural principle of cohesion, but like a tree or an animal, displaying no haphazard structure, but order and a certain semblance of design.</p>
