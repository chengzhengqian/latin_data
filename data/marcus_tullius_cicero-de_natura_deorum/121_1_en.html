it pounces on for itself. It is also recorded of this bird that it is in the habit of gorging itself with shell-fish, which it digests by means of the heat of its stomach and then brings up again, and so picks out from them <span class="innerMarginNote left">125</span> the parts that are good to eat. Sea-frogs again are said to be in the habit of covering themselves with sand and creeping along at the water’s edge, and then when fishes approach them thinking they are something to eat, these are killed and devoured by the frogs. The kite and the crow live in a state of natural war as it were with one another, and therefore each destroys the other’s eggs wherever it finds them. Another fact (observed by Aristotle, from whom most of these cases are cited) cannot but awaken our surprise, namely that cranes when crossing the seas on the way to warmer climates fly in a triangular formation. With the apex of the triangle they force aside the air in front of them, and then gradually on either side<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL268_243_a" id="target_note_LCL268_243_a"><sup>a</sup></a> by means of their wings acting as oars the birds’ onward flight is sustained, while the base of the triangle formed by the cranes gets the assistance of the wind when it is so to speak astern. The birds rest their necks and heads on the backs of those flying in front of them; and the leader, being himself unable to do this as he has no one to lean on, flies to the rear that he himself also may have a rest, while one of those already rested takes his place, <span class="innerMarginNote left">126</span> and so they keep turns throughout the journey. I could adduce a number of similar instances, but you see the general idea. Another even better known class of stories illustrates the precautions taken by animals for their security, the watch they keep while feeding, their skill in hiding in their lairs.</p>
