are attributes essential to our conception of deity. Yet both in the <span class="italic">Timaeus</span> and the <span class="italic">Laws</span> he says that the world, the sky, the stars, the earth and our souls are gods, in addition to those in whom we have been taught to believe by ancestral tradition; but it is obvious that these propositions are both inherently false and mutually destructive. <span class="innerMarginNote left">31</span> Xenophon also commits almost the same errors, though in fewer words; for in his memoir<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL268_35_a" id="target_note_LCL268_35_a"><sup>a</sup></a> of the sayings of Socrates he represents Socrates as arguing that it is wrong to inquire about the form of god, but also as saying that both the sun and the soul are god, and as speaking at one moment of a single god and at another of several: utterances that involve almost the same mistakes as do those which we <span class="innerMarginNote left">32</span> quoted from Plato.</p>

Antisthenes also, in his book entitled <span class="italic">The Natural Philosopher</span>, says that while there are many gods of popular belief, there is one god in nature, so depriving divinity of all meaning or substance. Very similarly Speusippus, following his uncle Plato, and speaking of a certain force that governs all things and is endowed with life, does his best to root out the notion of deity from our minds <span class="innerMarginNote left">33</span> altogether. And Aristotle in the Third Book of his <span class="italic">Philosophy</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL268_35_b" id="target_note_LCL268_35_b"><sup>b</sup></a> has a great many confused notions, &lt;not&gt;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL268_35_ca" id="target_note_LCL268_35_ca"><sup>c</sup></a> disagreeing with the doctrines of his master Plato; at one moment he assigns divinity exclusively to the intellect, at another he says that the world is itself a god, then again he puts some other being over the world, and assigns to this being the r√¥le of regulating and sustaining the world-motion by means of a sort
