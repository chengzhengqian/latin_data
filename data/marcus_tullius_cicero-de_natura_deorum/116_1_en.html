<span class="innerMarginNote left">115</span><p>Can any sane person believe that all this array of stars and this vast celestial adornment could have been created out of atoms rushing to and fro fortuitously and at random? or could any other being devoid of intelligence and reason have created them? Not merely did their creation postulate intelligence, but it is impossible to understand their nature without intelligence of a high order.</p>
<p>XLV. “But not only are these things marvellous,<span class="marginNote right">The world and its parts held together by centripetal force.</span> but nothing is more remarkable than the stability and coherence of the world, which is such that it is impossible even to imagine anything better adapted to endure. For all its parts in every direction gravitate with a uniform pressure towards the centre. Moreover bodies conjoined maintain their union most permanently when they have some bond encompassing them to bind them together; and this function is fulfilled by that rational and intelligent substance which pervades the whole world as the efficient cause of all things and which draws and collects the outermost <span class="innerMarginNote left">116</span> particles towards the centre. Hence if the world is round and therefore all its parts are held together by and with each other in universal equilibrium, the same must be the case with the earth, so that all its parts must converge towards the centre (which in a sphere is the lowest point) without anything to break the continuity and so threaten its vast complex of gravitational forces and masses with dissolution. And on the same principle the sea, although above the earth, nevertheless seeks the earth’s centre and so is massed into a sphere uniform on all sides, and never <span class="innerMarginNote left">117</span> floods its bounds and overflows. Its neighbour the air travels upward it is true in virtue of its lightness, but at the same time spreads horizontally in all
