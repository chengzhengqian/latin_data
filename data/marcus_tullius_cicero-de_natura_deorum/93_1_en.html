<span class="innerMarginNote left">65</span> it is he then who is addressed by Ennius in the following terms, as I said before<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL268_187_a" id="target_note_LCL268_187_a"><sup>a</sup></a>:</p>
<p>Behold this dazzling vault of heaven, which all mankind as Jove invoke—</p>
<p>more explicitly than in another passage of the same poet:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">Now by whatever pow’r it be that sheds</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">This light of day, I’ll lay my curse upon him!</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p></blockquote>
<p>It is he also whom our augurs mean by their formula ‘should Jove lighten and thunder,’ meaning ‘should the sky lighten and thunder.’ Euripides among many fine passages has this brief invocation:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">Thou seest the boundless aether’s spreading vault,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Whose soft embrace encompasseth the earth:</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">This deem thou god of gods, the supreme Jove.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL268_187_b" id="target_note_LCL268_187_b"><sup>b</sup></a></span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p></blockquote>
<span class="innerMarginNote left">66</span><p>XXVI. “The air, lying between the sea and sky, is according to the Stoic theory deified under the name belonging to Juno,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL268_187_c" id="target_note_LCL268_187_c"><sup>c</sup></a> sister and wife of Jove, because it resembles and is closely connected with the aether; they made it female and assigned it to Juno because of its extreme softness. (The name of Juno however I believe to be derived from <span class="italic">iuvare</span> ‘to help’). There remained water and earth, to complete the fabled partition of the three kingdoms. Accordingly the second kingdom, the entire realm of the sea, was assigned to Neptune, Jove’s brother as they hold; his name is derived from <span class="italic">nare</span> ‘to swim,’ with a slight alteration of the earlier letters and with the suffix seen in <span class="italic">Portunus</span> (the harbour god), derived from <span class="italic">portus</span> ‘a harbour.’ The entire bulk and substance of the earth was dedicated to father Dis (that is, Dives, ‘the rich,’ and so in Greek <span class="italic">Plouton</span>), because all things fall back into the earth and also arise from the earth.
