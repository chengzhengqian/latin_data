Where then do we find that happiness and that eternity which in your system are the two catchwords that denote divinity? When you wish to make this out, you take cover in a thicket of jargon; you gave us the formula just now<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL268_67_a" id="target_note_LCL268_67_a"><sup>a</sup></a>—God has not body but a semblance of body, not blood but a kind of blood.</p>
