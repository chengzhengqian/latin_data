<p>IX. ‘There is nothing in the universe superior to the world.’ No more is there anything on earth superior to our city; but you do not therefore think that our city possesses a reasoning, thinking mind? or, because it does not, you do not therefore consider, do you, that an ant is to be rated more highly than this supremely beautiful city, on the ground that a city does not possess sensation whereas an ant has not only sensation, but also a mind that reasons and remembers? You ought to see what you can get your opponent to admit, Balbus, not <span class="innerMarginNote left">22</span> take for granted anything you like. The whole of<span class="marginNote right">Zeno proves too much.</span> this topic of yours was expanded<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL268_307_a" id="target_note_LCL268_307_a"><sup>a</sup></a> tersely, and as you thought effectively, by the famous old syllogism of Zeno. Zeno puts the argument thus: ‘That which is rational is superior to that which is not rational; but nothing is superior to the world; therefore the <span class="innerMarginNote left">23</span> world is rational.’ If you accept this conclusion, you will go on to prove that the world is perfectly able to read a book; for following in Zeno’s footsteps you will be able to construct a syllogism as follows: ‘That which is literate is superior to that which is illiterate; but nothing is superior to the world; therefore the world is literate.’ By this mode of reasoning the world will also be an orator, and even a mathematician, a musician, and in fact an expert in every branch of learning, in fine a philosopher. You kept repeating that the world is the sole source of all created things, and that nature’s capacity does not include the power to create things unlike herself: am I to admit that the world is not only a living being, and wise, but also a harper and a flute-player, because it gives birth also to men skilled in these arts?
