<p>which the Greeks</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">Engónasin call, as travelling “on his knees.”</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Here is the Crown, of radiance supreme.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p></blockquote>
<p>This is in the rear of the Serpent, while at its head is the Serpent-holder,</p>
<span class="innerMarginNote left">109</span>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">By Greeks called Ophiúchus, famous name!</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Firm between both his hands he “holds the Snake,”</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Himself in bondage by its body held,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">For serpent round the waist engirdles man.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Yet treads he firm and presses all his weight,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Trampling upon the Scorpion’s eyes and breast.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p></blockquote>
<p>After the Septentriones comes</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">The Bear-ward, commonly Boötes called,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Because he drives the Bear yoked to a pole.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p></blockquote>
<span class="innerMarginNote left">110</span><p>And then the following lines: for with this Boötes</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line indent6">beneath his bosom fixed appears</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">A glittering star, Arcturus, famous name,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p></blockquote><p>and below his feet moves</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">The Virgin bright, holding her ear of corn<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL268_227_a" id="target_note_LCL268_227_a"><sup>a</sup></a></span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Resplendent.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p></blockquote>
<p>XLIII. and the constellations are so accurately spaced out that their vast and ordered array clearly displays the skill of a divine creator:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">By the Bear’s head you will descry the Twins,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Beneath its belly the Crab, and in its claws</span><span class="linebreak"></span><span class="line">The Lion’s bulk emits a twinkling ray.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p></blockquote>
<p>The Charioteer</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">Hidden beneath the Twins’ left flank will glide;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Him Helice confronts with aspect fierce;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">At his left shoulder the bright She-goat stands.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p></blockquote>
<p>[And then the following:]</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">A constellation vast and brilliant she,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Whereas the Kids emit a scanty light</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Upon mankind.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
