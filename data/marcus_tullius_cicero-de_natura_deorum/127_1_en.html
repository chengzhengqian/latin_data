The alimentary juice secreted from the rest of the food by the stomach flows from the bowels to the liver through certain ducts or channels reaching to the liver, to which they are attached, and connecting up what are called the doorways of the liver with the middle intestine. From the liver different channels pass in different directions, and through these falls the food passed down from the liver. From this food is secreted bile, and the liquids excreted by the kidneys; the residue turns into blood and flows to the aforesaid doorways of the liver, to which all its channels lead. Flowing through these doorways the food at this very point pours into the so-called <span class="italic">vena cava</span> or hollow vein,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL268_255_a" id="target_note_LCL268_255_a"><sup>a</sup></a> and through this, being now completely worked up and digested, flows to the heart, and from the heart is distributed all over the body through a rather large number of veins that reach to every part of the frame. <span class="innerMarginNote left">138</span> It would not be difficult to indicate the way in which the residue of the food is excreted by the alternate
