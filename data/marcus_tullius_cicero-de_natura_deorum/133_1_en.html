create the arts that serve either practical necessities<span class="marginNote right">man’s gift of speech and its organs;</span> or the purpose of amusement. Then take the gift of speech, the queen of arts as you are fond of calling it—what a glorious, what a divine faculty it is!

The flexibility of the joints enables the fingers to close and open with equal ease, and to perform every motion without difficulty. Thus by the manipulation of the fingers the hand is enabled to paint, to model, to carve, and to draw forth the notes of the lyre and of the flute. And beside these
