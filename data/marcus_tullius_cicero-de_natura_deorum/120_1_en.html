there was bestowed even a sort of craft or cunning: for instance, one species of the spider tribe weaves a kind of net, in order to dispatch anything that is caught in it; another in order to . . . stealthily keeps watch, and, snatching anything that falls into it, devours it. The mussel, or <span class="italic">pina</span> as it is called in Greek, is a large bivalve which enters into a sort of partnership with the tiny shrimp to procure food, and so, when little fishes swim into the gaping shell, the shrimp draws the attention of the mussel and the mussel shuts up its shells with a snap<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL268_241_a" id="target_note_LCL268_241_a"><sup>a</sup></a>; thus two very dissimilar creatures obtain their food in <span class="innerMarginNote left">124</span> common. In this case we are curious to know whether their association is due to a sort of mutual compact, or whether it was brought about by nature herself and goes back to the moment of their birth. Our wonder is also considerably excited by those aquatic animals which are born on land—crocodiles, for instance, and water-tortoises and certain snakes, which are born on dry land but as soon as they can first crawl make for the water. Again we often place ducks’ eggs beneath hens, and the chicks that spring from the eggs are at first fed and mothered by the hens that hatched and reared them, but later on they leave their foster-mothers, and run away when they pursue them, as soon as they have had an opportunity of seeing the water, their natural home. So powerful an instinct of self-preservation has nature implanted in living creatures.</p>
