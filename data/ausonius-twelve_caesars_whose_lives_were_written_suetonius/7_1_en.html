<h3><span class="ac"><span class="sc">XIV.—Trajan</span></span></h3>
<p><span class="sc">Trajan</span> comes to the throne in life’s prime, for war’s renown more eminent, for all else like his father. He also, lacking offspring, takes for his partner by hazard of choice such an one as we allow worthy, but disallow as equal.</p>
<h3><span class="ac"><span class="sc">XV.—Hadrian</span></span></h3>
<p><span class="sc">Then</span> Aelius succeeded, highly distinguished for the deeds of his mid-reign: repute more sinister marks its beginning and its end.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL096_343_1" id="target_note_LCL096_343_1"><sup>1</sup></a> He, too, is childless: with him shall be linked one to give proof how far adopted sons can excel the natural-born.</p>
<h3><span class="ac"><span class="sc">XVI.—Antoninus Pius</span></span></h3>
<p><span class="sc">Thereafter</span> that Antoninus receives the sway, who by general voice and by decree was called Pius,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL096_343_2a" id="target_note_LCL096_343_2a"><sup>2</sup></a> bearing a title which proclaims his worth. Fate gives him no son; but after the custom of his house he took from his country one to rule his country.</p>
<h3><span class="ac"><span class="sc">XVII.—M. Antoninus</span></span></h3>
<p><span class="sc">Next</span>, charge of the state is given to Marcus, who, nobler than his father Pius, applied Plato’s maxims<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL096_343_3" id="target_note_LCL096_343_3"><sup>3</sup></a> to the task of empire. Dying with a natural heir but an abandoned prince, the only wrong he did his country was to have had a son.</p>
