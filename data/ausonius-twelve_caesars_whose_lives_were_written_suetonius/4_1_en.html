<p>more illustrious still. His sway, long-lived and by danger never outraged, revealed him as a god placed upon earth.</p>
<h3><span class="ac"><span class="sc">III.—Tiberius Nero</span></span></h3>
<p><span class="sc">Nero</span>, who also bore the first-name Tiberius, in the early season of his youth ruled with applause. Vainly thenceforth secluded in his cave on Capri, he fancies place can conceal what vice betrays.</p>
<h3><span class="ac"><span class="sc">IV.—Caesar Caligula</span></span></h3>
<p><span class="sc">After</span> him, nicknamed after the soldier’s boot, Caesar succeeded—more cruel than that master of cruelty, with murders and incest thenceforth stained, and one who went farther than his grandfather besmirched with every vice.</p>
<h3><span class="ac"><span class="sc">V.—Claudius Caesar</span></span></h3>
<p><span class="sc">Claudius</span>, flouted in his private life, as emperor showed a pattern of ability. Even though he suffered his freedmen’s and his wife’s enormities, his guilt lay not in performance but in sufferance.</p>
