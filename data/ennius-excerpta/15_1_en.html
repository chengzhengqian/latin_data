Capitolini and Siculi indicate Publius Claudius Pulcher, son of Appius, grandson of Gaius, and Lucius Iunius Pullus, son of Gaius, grandson of Lucius, were consuls [249 BC]. Censorinus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL537_379_3" id="target_note_LCL537_379_3"><sup>3</sup></a> follows the Fasti. The meaning is: Roman soldiers multiplied funerals and deaths, created widespread carnage, brought bloodshed to the guards and soldiers of the garrison and vented their rage against them with the sword at bedtime and deep at night, when the consul Lucius Iunius Pullus attacked the wall tops of the citadel (thus called “Eryx” by the poet, a city in Sicily, since, of course, it is located on a high mound similar to a citadel; one should compare Polybius, Book 1) and already made the beginning of victory against the Carthaginians. This light and that medicine is offered by me to these shadows of Ennius and to this injury to him: others may make other suggestions.</p>
