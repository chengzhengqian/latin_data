<p class="noindent">Glossary of Fornerus [cf. F 16]: <span class="italic">pyrgophoros</span> [lit., “bearing a tower,” Greek], <span class="italic">torrĭdus </span>[“parched,” Latin]. Ennius in Book 5:</p>

Yet I am uncertain about the reliability of the collocation. “As an abnormal phenomenon,” says the honorable gentleman Joseph Scaliger [cf. F 23] in his letters to me, “I attribute a hoof to an elephant.” Indeed. For elephants do not have hooves, but “unformed toes, though five in number, yet undivided and slightly separated, and similar to hooves, not nails, and the forefeet larger,” says Pliny, Book 11,
