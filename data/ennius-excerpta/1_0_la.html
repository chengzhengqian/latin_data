<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">In their search for the remains of early Latin poetry, medieval and Renaissance scholars cast a wide net—and brought in a very mixed catch. Though a few fragments of uncertain pedigree found their way into the Ennian corpus (e.g., 9 </span>Ann<span class="italic">. F 8), a combination of questionable sources, problematic linguistic and metrical structures, and suspiciously close similarity to clearly genuine verses by Ennius or some other ancient author have kept most of these just outside its margins.</span></p>
<p><span class="italic">A large number of these dubious fragments come from the edition of Paulus Merula (Paul van Merle, 1558–1607), who in 1595 edited the fragments of the </span>Annals<span class="italic"> attested in antiquity and provided additional verses in an accompanying commentary. These latter do not appear to be genuine, but whether they are outright forgeries by Merula or were extracted by him from sources, now unidentifiable, that he trusted remains unknown (see Blok 1900; Goldschmidt 2012). A second group consists of lines found in the </span>Cornucopiae<span class="italic"> (first ed., 1489) by Nicolaus Perottus</span></p>
