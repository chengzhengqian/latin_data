<p class="noindent">The former is extant in the Glossary of the most respected gentleman Gulielmius Fornerus [cf. F 16]: <span class="italic">phoneusis</span> [“murder,” Greek], <span class="italic">funus</span>,<span class="italic"> caedes</span> [“death,” “slaughter,” Latin]. Ennius:</p>

<p class="noindent">The latter is read in Macrobius in Book 1 of <span class="italic">Saturnalia</span>, Chapter 4 [<span class="italic">Sat.</span> 1.4.17]: “But the other words,” he says, “that seemed novel to our Avienus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL537_377_1" id="target_note_LCL537_377_1"><sup>1</sup></a> have to be defended by us from the testimony of the ancients.

There, instead of <span class="italic">quam</span> one has to read <span class="italic">qua</span>, as Macrobius shows; but here, instead of <span class="italic">Galli</span>, <span class="italic">Pullus</span> has to be restored, and instead of <span class="italic">adorti</span> one has to write <span class="italic">adortus</span>; in this way:</p>
