<p class="noindent">Not just in a single place does Calpurnius Piso [cf. F 15] in the books <span class="italic">About the Subject Matter of the Old Poets</span> put forward <span class="italic">Annals</span> of our Ennius for enrichment, for the first verses here are quoted by Servius; to these two Calpurnius adds a third. . . . But my author: someone very close to death, whom (I emend “even”) dead, Ennius depicts with vivid colors, in the second book of <span class="italic">Annals</span>, where he writes as follows [Inc. <span class="italic">Ann.</span> F 36]:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">the head, torn from the neck, gapes on the plain </span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">and half-alive, the eyes twitch and seek the light</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">in vain, nothing of life remains in the body</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
