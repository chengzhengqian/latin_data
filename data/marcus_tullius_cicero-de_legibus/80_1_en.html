<p>XXVII. These, then, are the laws of your beloved Athenians. But let us turn to Plato, who referred the proper rites for funerals to the counsellors on religious matters; a custom which still holds among us. But he does state the following rules about graves:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL213_455_1" id="target_note_LCL213_455_1"><sup>1</sup></a> he forbids any piece of land which is in cultivation or capable of cultivation to be used for a grave, but provides that the greatest possible use shall be made of the sort of land which can receive the bodies of the dead without injury to the living. But land which is capable of producing crops and of supplying us with food like a mother should not be decreased in extent by anyone, living or dead. He forbids the erection of any loftier monument than could be completed by five men in five days. He also prohibits the setting up or placing upon the grave of a larger block of stone than is sufficient to contain the praise of the deceased, inscribed upon it in not more than four heroic verses—those which Ennius calls “long verses.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL213_455_2" id="target_note_LCL213_455_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Thus we have also the authoritative opinion of this eminent man on the subject of graves. He also fixes the expenditure for the funeral at from one mina<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL213_455_3" id="target_note_LCL213_455_3"><sup>3</sup></a> to five, in accordance with a man’s wealth. After this follows the famous passage on the immortality of the soul, the tranquil rest which awaits the good after death, and the punishments in store for the wicked.</p>
<p>This completes, I believe, my consideration of this whole subject of religion.</p>
