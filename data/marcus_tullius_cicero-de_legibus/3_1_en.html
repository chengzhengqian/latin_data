<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="italic">A.</span></span> Yet people ask, concerning many parts of the “Marius,” whether they are fiction or fact; and certain persons, since you are dealing with recent events and a native of Arpinum, demand that you stick to the truth.</p></div>
