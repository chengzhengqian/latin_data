<p>Now the law which prescribes <span class="italic">the worship of those of the human race who have been deified, suck as Hercules and the rest,</span> makes it clear that while the souls of all men are immortal, those of good and brave men are divine. It is a good thing also that <span class="italic">Intellect, Piety, Virtue, and Good Faith should be arbitrarily deified;</span> and in Rome temples have been dedicated by the State to all these qualities, the purpose being that those who possess them (and all good men do) should believe that the gods themselves are established within their own souls. For that was a bad thing which was done at Athens on the advice of Epimenides<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL213_405_1" id="target_note_LCL213_405_1"><sup>1</sup></a> the Cretan, when, after the crime of Cylon had been expiated, they established a temple to Disgrace and Insolence;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL213_405_2" id="target_note_LCL213_405_2"><sup>2</sup></a> for it is proper to deify the virtues <span class="italic">but not the vices.</span> The ancient altar to Fever on the Palatine and the one to Bad Fortune on the Esquiline as well as all other abominations of that character must be done away with. But if we must invent names for gods, we ought rather to choose such titles as Vica Pota, derived from Victory and Power, and Stata, from the idea of standing firm, and such epithets as those of the Strengthener and the Invincible, which are given to Jupiter; also the names of things which we should desire, such as Safety, Honour, Wealth, and Victory. And since the mind is encouraged by the anticipation of good things, Calatinus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL213_405_3" id="target_note_LCL213_405_3"><sup>3</sup></a> was right in deifying Hope also. We may also have as gods Fortune, or the Fortune of This Day, for that applies to every day, or Fortune, the Provident, that she may help us, or Chance Fortune, which refers particularly to the uncertainty of future events or First-born Fortune, our companion from birth.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL213_405_4" id="target_note_LCL213_405_4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
