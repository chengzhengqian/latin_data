<p>And what shall we say of this? Is it possible for us to call those chaste who are kept from lewdness by the fear of disgrace, when the disgrace itself results from the inherent vileness of the deed? For what can properly be either praised or blamed, if you have disregarded the nature of the thing which in your opinion deserves praise or blame? Are bodily defects, if very conspicuous, to offend us, but not a deformity of character? And yet the baseness of this latter can easily be perceived from the very vices which result from it. For what can be thought of that is more loathsome than greed, what more inhuman than lust, what more contemptible than cowardice, what more degraded than stupidity and folly? Well, then, shall we say that those who are sunk deepest in a single vice, or in several, are wretched on account of any penalties or losses or tortures which they incur, or on account of the base nature of the vices themselves? And the same argument can be applied conversely to the praise accorded to virtue. Finally, if virtue is sought on account of other advantages, there must necessarily be something better than virtue. Is it money, then, or public office, or beauty, or health? But these things amount to very little when we possess them, and we can have no certain knowledge as to how long they will remain with us. Or is it—the very mention of such a thing is shameful—is it pleasure? But it is precisely in scorning and repudiating pleasure that virtue is most clearly discerned.</p>
<p>Well, do you see what a series of subjects and ideas we have before us, and how closely they are connected one with another? Indeed, if I had not forced myself to stop, I should have been led on still further.</p>
