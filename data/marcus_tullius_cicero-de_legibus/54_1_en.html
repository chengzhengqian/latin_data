<p>XI. The Greeks and Romans have done a better thing: for it has been our wish, to the end that we may promote piety toward the gods, that they should dwell in our cities with us. For this idea encourages a religious attitude that is useful to States, if there is truth in the saying of Pythagoras,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL213_403_2" id="target_note_LCL213_403_2"><sup>2</sup></a> a most learned man, that piety and religious feeling are most prominent in our minds while we are performing religious rites, and in the saying of Thales,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL213_403_3" id="target_note_LCL213_403_3"><sup>3</sup></a> the wisest of the Seven, that men ought to believe that everything they see is filled with the gods, for all would then be purer, just as they feel the power of religion most deeply when they are in temples. For it is believed that perception of the gods is possible to our eyes as well as to our minds. <span class="italic">The groves in the country</span> have the same purpose. Nor is the worship of the <span class="italic">Lares,</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL213_403_4" id="target_note_LCL213_403_4"><sup>4</sup></a> handed down by our ancestors, established in sight of farm and homestead, and shared by slaves as well as masters, to be rejected.</p>
<p>Next, <span class="italic">the preservation of the rites of the family and of our ancestors</span> means preserving the religious rites which, we can almost say, were handed down to us by the gods themselves, since ancient times were closest to the gods.</p>
