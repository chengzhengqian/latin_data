makes his own advantage absolutely the sole standard of all his actions, to that extent he is absolutely not a good man; therefore those who measure virtue by the reward it brings believe in the existence of no virtue except vice.

In that case men are innocent and modest in order to be well spoken of, and they blush in order to gain a good reputation! I am ashamed even to mention chastity! Or rather I am ashamed of those philosophers who believe it honourable to avoid condemnation for a crime without having avoided the crime itself.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL213_353_3" id="target_note_LCL213_353_3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
