not yielded to it my country would not have had the benefit of my services very long. And the result proved that I was right; for who was there, not merely among the free citizens, but even among the slaves who were worthy of freedom, who was not devoted to my safety? But if the outcome of the services which I performed for the safety of the republic had not met with universal approval; if the hatred of a raging mob had been aroused against me and had brought about my exile; if the tribunician power had excited the people against me, as it was excited against Laenas by Gracchus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL213_489_1" id="target_note_LCL213_489_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and against Metellus by Saturninus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL213_489_2" id="target_note_LCL213_489_2"><sup>2</sup></a> nevertheless I could have endured it, my dear brother, and I should have been consoled not so much by the Athenian philosophers, whose business it is to supply such comfort, as by those illustrious citizens of Athens who, when driven into exile, preferred to give up an ungrateful city rather than allow it to continue in its wrongdoing.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL213_489_3" id="target_note_LCL213_489_3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>You say that you cannot fully approve of Pompey in this one matter; but it seems to me that you have hardly given sufficient consideration to this pointâ€”that he had to determine, not merely what was ideally best, but also what was practically necessary. For he realized that this office was indispensable in our republic; for when our people had so eagerly sought it before having had any experience of it, how could they dispense with it now that they had learned what it was? It was the duty of a wise citizen, in dealing with an institution not evil in itself and so dear to the people that it could not be combated, not to leave its defence to a popular leader, which would have had evil consequences.</p>
