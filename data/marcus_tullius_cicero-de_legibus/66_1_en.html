<p>XVIII. In my prohibition of <span class="italic">the consecration of land</span> I am in complete agreement with Plato, who expresses his opinion in about the following words, if I can translate the passage:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL213_427_1" id="target_note_LCL213_427_1"><sup>1</sup></a> “The earth, therefore, like the hearth in a dwelling, is sacred to all the gods; wherefore no one should consecrate it a second time. <span class="italic">Gold</span> and <span class="italic">silver</span> in cities, whether in private possession or in temples, are things which cause covetousness. <span class="italic">Ivory</span> also, which is taken from an animal’s dead body, is not sufficiently pure to be given to a god. Bronze and iron are suitable for war, not for a temple. Any wooden object, however, if made out of a single piece of wood, or anything of stone, one may dedicate at public shrines, and woven work, too, provided its production has not been more than a month’s task for a woman. White is the colour most suitable for a god, especially in woven work; no dyes should be used except for military standards. But the gifts best suited of all to the gods are birds, and pictures produced by a single painter in a single day; other gifts should be of this same character.” These are his provisions: as for mine, in other respects I have not laid down such strict rules as his, out of consideration for the faults of men and the resources of human life in our time; but regarding the land, I am afraid its cultivation will decline if any superstitions should grow up about its use or subjection to the plough.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL213_427_2" id="target_note_LCL213_427_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
