<p>I. <span class="italic">M.</span> I will follow again, then, as I did before, the example of that divine personage, whom I praise oftener, perhaps, than I should, such is the admiration I feel for him.</p>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="italic">A.</span></span> Of course you mean Plato.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="italic">M.</span></span> None other, Atticus.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="italic">A.</span></span> Surely you can never praise him too highly or too often; for even those friends of ours<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL213_459_1" id="target_note_LCL213_459_1"><sup>1</sup></a> who object to the praise of anyone outside their own company allow me to be as fond of him as I like.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="italic">M.</span></span> And they are certainly right in that. For what could be more appropriate to the good taste of a man like yourself, who in both his life and his language has achieved, in my opinion, that most difficult combination of dignity and refinement?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="italic">A.</span></span> I am very glad indeed that I interrupted you, since you have given me so fine a proof of your good opinion. But go on as you have begun.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="italic">M.</span></span> First, then, let us commend the law Itself with words of praise which are both merited and appropriate to its character.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="italic">A.</span></span> By all means, just as you did in the case of the law of religion.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="italic">M.</span></span> You understand, then, that the function of a magistrate is to govern, and to give commands which are just and beneficial and in conformity with the law.</p></div></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL213_459_1"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL213_459_1" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">1</sup>The Epicureans.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL213_459_1').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
