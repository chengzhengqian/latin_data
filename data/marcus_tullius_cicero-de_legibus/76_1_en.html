These provisions are praiseworthy and applicable in general both to the rich and the common people; for it is quite in accordance with nature that differences in wealth should cease with death.</p></div>
<p>XXIV. Other funeral customs likewise, which tend to increase grief, are forbidden by the Twelve Tables. One of these laws runs: “A dead man’s bones shall not be gathered up so that a funeral may be held later.” Here an exception is made in case of death in war or on foreign soil. These laws also contain the following provisions about anointing and [a dinner]; anointing by slaves is prohibited, and also any sort of drinking-bout. It is quite proper that these things should have been abolished, and the law would not have forbidden them unless they had actually occurred. Let us pass over the prohibition: “No costly sprinkling, or long garlands, or censers.” Obviously the principle on which these provisions are based is that only the rewards which have been bestowed as a mark of honour belong to the dead, for the law provides that a garland earned by bravery may be worn with impunity both by the man who earned it and also by his father.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL213_447_1" id="target_note_LCL213_447_1"><sup>1</sup></a> And I suppose that it was because the custom had grown up of making more than one funeral and preparing more than one bier for a single person, that these things were also forbidden by law. And whereas the same law forbids the use of gold, note what a considerate exception is made by another: “If a man’s teeth are joined with gold, it shall be no violation of the law to bury or burn his body along with that gold.” Note that in this case also burial and cremation are treated as different things.</p>
