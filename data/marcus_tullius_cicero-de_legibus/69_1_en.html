the man who acquires by possession<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL213_433_1" id="target_note_LCL213_433_1"><sup>1</sup></a> the ownership of the greater part of the property of which the deceased died possessed is bound by the obligation. In the fourth place, if nobody acquires any of the property of the deceased, then the obligation falls upon that one of the creditors who retains most of the estate. In the last place of all stands any person who owed money to the deceased and never paid it to anyone, for his position is considered the same as if he had received that money from the estate.</p>
<p>XX. This is what we learn from Scaevola, but the doctrine of the older authorities is differently stated. For their rule was expressed in the following terms: that men are bound to perform the rites in three different ways, either by being heirs, or by receiving the greater part of the property, or, in case the greater part of the property was bequeathed in legacies, by receiving anything whatever by that means.</p>
<p>But let us follow the pontiff. Now you see that all his rules depend on one principle, namely, the decision of the pontiffs that the rites are to go with the property, and that the holydays<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL213_433_2" id="target_note_LCL213_433_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and the ceremonies are to be assigned to the same persons. And the Scaevolae add that, when the will provides for a partition of the estate, but not for any deduction from legacies,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL213_433_3a" id="target_note_LCL213_433_3a"><sup>3</sup></a> in case the legatees voluntarily take less than what is left to all the heirs together, these legatees shall not be bound to the performance of
