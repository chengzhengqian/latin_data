<p>XVI. There are indeed four such balloting laws in existence. The first is concerned with the election of magistrates; this is the Gabinian Law,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL213_501_1" id="target_note_LCL213_501_1"><sup>1</sup></a> proposed by a man who was unknown and of low degree. That was followed two years later by the Cassian Law,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL213_501_2" id="target_note_LCL213_501_2"><sup>2</sup></a> which referred to trials before the people; it was proposed by Lucius Cassius, who was a nobleman, but—I say it without prejudice to his family—stood apart from the aristocracy, and, by favouring popular measures, was always seeking the fickle applause of the mob. The third law is that of Carbo,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL213_501_3" id="target_note_LCL213_501_3"><sup>3</sup></a> which applies to the adoption or rejection of proposed laws; this Carbo was a factious and mischievous citizen, who could not gain his personal safety from the aristocracy even by returning to his allegiance to their party. The method of oral voting, then, appeared to have gone out of existence except in trials for treason, which even Cassius had omitted from his balloting law. But Gaius Coelius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL213_501_4" id="target_note_LCL213_501_4"><sup>4</sup></a> provided the ballot even for such trials; however, he regretted to the end of his days that he had done an injury to the republic in order to destroy Gaius Popilius. And in fact our grandfather, during his whole life, opposed with the greatest energy the passage of a balloting law in this town,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL213_501_5" id="target_note_LCL213_501_5"><sup>5</sup></a> although his wife (our grandmother) was the sister of Marcus Gratidius, the man who was proposing such a law. For Gratidius raised a storm in a wine-ladle, as the popular saying goes, just as his son Marius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL213_501_6a" id="target_note_LCL213_501_6a"><sup>6</sup></a> did later in the Aegean Sea.
