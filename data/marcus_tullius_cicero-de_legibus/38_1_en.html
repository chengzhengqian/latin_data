<p>I. <span class="italic">A.</span> As we have now had a sufficiently long walk, and you are about to begin a new part of the discussion, shall we not leave this place and go to the island in the Fibrenus (for I believe that is the name of the other river), and sit there while we finish the conversation?</p>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="italic">M.</span></span> By all means; for that island is a favourite haunt of mine for meditation, writing and reading.</p></div>

And so, just as you, a moment ago, in your discussion of law and justice, traced everything back to Nature, in the same way Nature is absolutely supreme in the things that men seek for the recreation and delight of the soul.
