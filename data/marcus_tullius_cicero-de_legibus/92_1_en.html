<p>VIII. <span class="italic">They shall return home with honour.</span> For nothing but honour from enemy or ally should be brought home by good and upright officials.</p>
<p>Also, it is obvious at once that nothing can be more disgraceful than <span class="italic">the appointment of an ambassador for any other than a public purpose.</span> I will say nothing of the behaviour, either at present or in the past, of those who go out as ambassadors to claim legacies or enforce contracts, for perhaps that is due to a weakness of human nature. But I ask only this: what could be more disgraceful than the mere fact of a senator’s holding an appointment as ambassador without official duties, without instructions, without any public business whatever to attend to? In fact, when I was consul I should have been able to abolish embassies of this kind with the approbation of a full meeting of the Senate, in spite of the fact that the custom gave the Senate valuable privileges, if it had not been for the intercession of an irresponsible plebeian tribune; but I did limit the duration of such appointments, which had previously been unrestricted, to one year. And so the disgrace still persists, but with the allowance of time limited.</p>
<p>But now, if you please, let us leave the provinces and return to the city.</p>
