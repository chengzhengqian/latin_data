<p>VII. <span class="italic">M.</span> Well, then, these philosophers have considered whether it is best for the State to have one magistrate who shall be obeyed by everyone else. I understand that this was considered the best plan by our ancestors after the expulsion of the kings. But since the monarchy, which had formerly been approved, was later rejected, not so much through the fault of the kingship as that of the king, if one magistrate is to rule over all the others, it will seem that it was merely the name of king that was abolished, the institution remaining. Thus it was not without good reason that ephors were set up in opposition to the Spartan kings by Theopompus, and tribunes in opposition to the consuls among us. For the consul has the legal right to enforce obedience from all other officials except the tribunes, whose office was instituted later than that of the consul for the purpose of preventing what had taken place from ever happening again. For the existence of an official who was not subject to his orders was the first step in the diminution of the consulâ€™s power, the second being the fact that this same official upheld others also, private citizens as well as magistrates, in disobedience to the consul.</p>

For it was the institution of this office that brought about the decline in the influence of the aristocracy and the growth of the power of the multitude.</p></div>
