account of their merit.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL213_445_1" id="target_note_LCL213_445_1"><sup>1</sup></a> But just as the law forbids burial within the city, so it has been decreed by the college of pontiffs that it is unlawful for a grave to be made in a public place. You are acquainted with the Temple of Honour outside the Colline Gate; there is a tradition that an altar once stood on that spot, and, when a metal plate was found near it with the inscription “To Honour,” this caused the dedication of the present temple. But, as there were many graves in that place, they were dug up; for the college decided that a place which was public property could not receive a sacred character through rites performed by private citizens.</p><p class="lineGroup">There are other rules, too, in the Twelve Tables, which provide for the limitation of the expense and the mourning at funerals, which were borrowed for the most part from the laws of Solon.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL213_445_2" id="target_note_LCL213_445_2"><sup>2</sup></a> The law says, “Do no more than this: do not smooth the pyre with an axe.” You know what follows, for we learned the Law of the Twelve Tables in our boyhood as a required formula; though no one learns it nowadays. The expense, then, is limited to “three veils, a purple tunic, and ten flute-players”; the mourning is also limited: “Women shall not tear their cheeks, nor have a <span class="italic">lessum</span> at a funeral.” The older interpreters, Sextus Aelius and Lucius Acilius, admitted that they did not fully understand this, but suspected that it referred to some kind of a mourning garment. Lucius Aelius thought a <span class="italic">lessum</span> was a sort of sorrowful wailing, for that is what the word would seem to signify. I incline to the latter interpretation, since this is the very thing which is forbidden in Solon’s law.
