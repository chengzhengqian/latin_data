<p>XII. Next, our provision for <span class="italic">holidays</span> and festivals ordains <span class="italic">rest from lawsuits and controversies for free men., and from labour and toil for slaves.</span> Whoever plans the official year ought to arrange that these festivals shall come at the completion of the various labours of the farm. So far as the dates are concerned, in order that <span class="italic">the offerings of first fruits and offspring of the flocks,</span> which are mentioned in the law, may be maintained, care must be taken in arranging for the insertion of intercalary months, a custom which was wisely instituted by Numa,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL213_407_1" id="target_note_LCL213_407_1"><sup>1</sup></a> but has now become obsolete through the neglect of the pontiffs of later periods.
