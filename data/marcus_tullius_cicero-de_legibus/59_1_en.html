would the name of Attius Navius have been remembered all these years, had not all these people made many prophecies which were in remarkable agreement with the truth. But there is no doubt that this art and science of the augurs has by now faded out of existence on account of the passage of time and men’s neglect. Therefore I cannot agree with Marcellus, who denies that this art was ever possessed by our college, nor do I subscribe to Appius’ opinion that we still possess it. What I believe is that among our ancestors it had a double use, being occasionally employed in political crises, but most often in deciding on a course of action.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL213_413_1" id="target_note_LCL213_413_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="italic">A.</span></span> I believe that you are absolutely right, and concur in the view you have expressed, in preference to any other. But pray go on with the law.</p></div>
<p>XIV. <span class="italic">M.</span> I will do so, and, if possible, briefly. We come next to the law of war. My law provides that in undertaking, carrying on, and ending a <span class="italic">war,</span> justice and good faith shall be supreme, and that the State shall have its <span class="italic">official interpreters</span> of this provision. Also in regard to the <span class="italic">rites performed by the soothsayers,</span> to <span class="italic">expiations</span> and <span class="italic">purifications,</span> I think the law itself is clear enough.</p>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="italic">A.</span></span> I agree with you, since these are all matters of religious ceremonial.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="italic">M.</span></span> But in regard to what follows, I am wondering, Titus, how you can agree with me or how I can attack your position.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="italic">A.</span></span> To what do you refer?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="italic">M.</span></span> To <span class="italic">the performance of sacrifices by women at. night.</span></p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="italic">A.</span></span> But I am in agreement with you, especially as the law itself makes an exception of <span class="italic">the customary public sacrifice.</span></p></div>
