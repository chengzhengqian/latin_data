<p>X. <span class="italic">Q.</span> My dear brother, how quickly you have completed this important body of law! However, it seems to me that this religious system of yours does not differ a great deal from the laws of Numa and our own customs.</p>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="italic">M.</span></span> Do you not think, then, since Scipio in my former work on the Republic offered a convincing proof that our early State was the best in the world, that we must provide that ideal State with laws which are in harmony with its character?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="italic">Q.</span></span> Certainly I think so.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="italic">M.</span></span> Then you must expect such laws as will establish that best type of State. And if I chance to propose any provisions to-day which do not exist now and never have existed in our State, they will nevertheless be found for the most part among the customs of our ancestors, which used to have the binding force of law.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="italic">A.</span></span> Then present the arguments in favour of this law of yours, so that I may have the opportunity of saying, “As you propose.”</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="italic">M.</span></span> Do you mean that, Atticus? You will not dissent?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="italic">A.</span></span> There are certainly no matters of importance in regard to which I shall disagree; on minor points I will yield to your judgment, if you like.</p></div>
