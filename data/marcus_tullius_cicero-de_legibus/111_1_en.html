<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="italic">A.</span></span> Something of which it is most disgraceful for those concerned with public affairs to be ignorant. For you just mentioned the fact that we get the text of our laws from the State copyists; and, in the same way, I notice that many of those who hold magistracies, being in ignorance of the official powers granted to them by the law, know only so much as their clerks wish them to know. Therefore, if you thought the transference of the obligation to perform religious rites a topic worthy of special discussion after you had presented your laws on the subject of religion, surely you must discuss the legal powers of officials, now that your magistrates have been established by law.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="italic">M.</span></span> I will do so briefly, if I can. For Marcus Junius, your father’s friend, dedicated to him a long treatise on the subject,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL213_517_1" id="target_note_LCL213_517_1"><sup>1</sup></a> which was written with learning and care, in my opinion. Now we ought to investigate and discuss the law of Nature independently, but in regard to the Roman law we must follow precedent and tradition.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="italic">A.</span></span> I agree with you, and that is exactly the kind of treatment I am expecting.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL213_517_2" id="target_note_LCL213_517_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p></div>
