<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="italic">Q.</span></span> Can there be any question about that? I am afraid I am going to disagree with you again.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="italic">M.</span></span> I am sure you will not, Quintus.
