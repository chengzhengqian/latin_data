knowledge of the whole of it? Why so? For of what use to a pontiff is the law of house-walls or aqueducts, or, in fact, any part of the civil law at all except that which is connected with religion? And that is a very small part of the whole, including only the provisions in regard to sacrifices, vows, holidays, graves, and things of like nature, I believe. Why, then, do we make so much of these matters, when all the rest except this one problem of the rites amount to very little? Indeed, even this subject, which is of somewhat wider importance, can be reduced to one basic principle; namely, that these rites shall ever be preserved and continuously handed down in families, and, as I said in my law, that <span class="italic">they must be continued for ever.</span></p>
