constant need for the advice and authority of the aristocracy helps to hold the State together.</p>
<p>My provisions for priests omit no legitimate type of worship. For some are appointed to win the favour of the gods <span class="italic">by presiding over</span> (<span class="italic">he regular sacrifices;</span> others to <span class="italic">interpret prophecies of the soothsayers</span>—though not of too many of them, for that would be an endless task—and in such a way that no one outside the college of priests shall have knowledge even of those prophecies <span class="italic">which are recognized by the State.</span> But the highest and most important authority in the State is that of the <span class="italic">augurs,</span> to whom is accorded great influence. But it is not because I myself am an augur that I have this opinion, but because the facts compel us to think so. For if we consider their legal rights, what power is greater than that of adjourning assemblies and meetings convened by the highest officials, with or without <span class="italic">imperium,</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL213_409_1" id="target_note_LCL213_409_1"><sup>1</sup></a> or that of declaring null and void the acts of assemblies presided over by such officials? What is of graver import than the abandonment of any business already begun, if a single augur says, “On another day”? What power is more impressive than that of forcing the consuls to resign their offices? What right is more sacred than that of giving or refusing permission to hold an assembly of the people or of the plebeians, or that of abrogating laws illegally passed? Thus the Titian Law was annulled by a decree of the college of augurs, and the Livian Laws by the wise direction of Philippus, a consul and augur.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL213_409_2" id="target_note_LCL213_409_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Indeed, no act of any magistrate at home or in the field can have any validity for any person without their authority.</p>
