<p>XXII. Now graves are the objects of so much religious veneration that it is considered sinful to bury in them corpses not belonging to the clan or participating in its rites; in the time of our ancestors this was the decision of Aulus Torquatus in the case of the Popilian clan. Nor would the days of purification, which derive their name from death because they are celebrated for the dead,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL213_439_2" id="target_note_LCL213_439_2"><sup>2</sup></a> be referred to as holidays in common with the days of rest in honour of the celestial gods, unless our ancestors had desired that those who depart this life should <span class="italic">be included among the gods.</span> It is the law that those holidays are to be placed at such times that they shall not coincide with other public or private holidays. This whole body of pontifical law shows deep religious feeling and a respect for the solemnity of religious ceremony. It is unnecessary for me to explain when the period of family mourning is ended, what sort of a sacrifice of wethers is offered to the Lar,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL213_439_3" id="target_note_LCL213_439_3"><sup>3</sup></a> in what manner the severed bone is buried in the earth,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL213_439_4" id="target_note_LCL213_439_4"><sup>4</sup></a> what are the rules in regard to the obligation to sacrifice a sow,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL213_439_5" id="target_note_LCL213_439_5"><sup>5</sup></a> or when the grave first takes on the character of a grave and comes under the protection of religion.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL213_439_6" id="target_note_LCL213_439_6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

At the point where our manuscripts resume, the subject
is the offering of sacrifices in honour of dead relatives (<span class="italic">parentare</span>). Plutarch (<span class="italic">Quaest. Rom</span>. 34) states that, according
to Cicero, these offerings were regularly made by the Romans in February (originally the last month of the year), while Decimus Junius Brutus (consul 138 <span class="sc">b.c.</span>) made them in December.
