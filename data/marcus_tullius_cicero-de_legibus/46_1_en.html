<p>VI. <span class="italic">Q.</span> I understand you completely, and believe that from now on we must not consider or even call anything else a law.</p>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="italic">M.</span></span> Then you do not think the Titian or Apuleian Laws were really laws at all?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="italic">Q.</span></span> No; nor the Livian Laws either.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL213_387_1" id="target_note_LCL213_387_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="italic">M.</span></span> And you are right, especially as the Senate repealed them in one sentence and in a single moment. But the Law whose nature I have explained can neither be repealed nor abrogated.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="italic">Q.</span></span> Then the laws you intend to propose will, of course, be the kind that will never be repealed?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="italic">M.</span></span> Certainly, if only they are accepted by both of you. But I think that I should follow the same course as Plato, who was at the same time a very learned man and the greatest of all philosophers, and who wrote a book about the Republic first, and then in a separate treatise described its Laws. Therefore, before I recite the law itself, I will speak in praise of that law. I note that Zaleucus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL213_387_2" id="target_note_LCL213_387_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and Charondas<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL213_387_3" id="target_note_LCL213_387_3"><sup>3</sup></a> did the same thing, though they wrote their laws, not for the interest and pleasure of doing so, but for actual use in their own States. Clearly Plato<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL213_387_4" id="target_note_LCL213_387_4"><sup>4</sup></a> agreed with their opinion that it was also the function of Law to win some measure of approval, and not always compel by threats of force.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="italic">Q.</span></span> What do you think of Timaeus’ denial of Zaleucus’ existence?</p></div>
