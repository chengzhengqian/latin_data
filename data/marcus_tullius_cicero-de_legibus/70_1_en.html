the rites. In the case of a gift they give a different sort of interpretation: if the head of a family approves a gift made by a person under his authority, then the gift is valid; but if such a gift is made without his knowledge, it is invalid unless he gives his approval later.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL213_435_1" id="target_note_LCL213_435_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>From these principles many minor problems have arisen, but any intelligent person could easily solve them without assistance, simply by referring them to the basic principle. For example, suppose someone accepted less than all the heirs, in order not to be bound to the rites, and later one of this person’s heirs collected on his own account the amount which had been refused by the person from whom he had inherited; and suppose that the whole sum, including what had been collected before, amounted to not less than had been left to all the heirs; then it would be easy to conclude that the man who had collected this amount was alone bound to the rites, to the exclusion of his co-heirs. In fact the authorities even provide that, if a greater legacy is left to anyone than he can accept without the religious obligation, this person may release the heirs under the will from the payment of the legacy by going through the form of a sale, because in that way the property is freed from its character as a legacy, just as fully as if it had not been bequeathed at all.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL213_435_2a" id="target_note_LCL213_435_2a"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>XXI. Now with reference to this and many other matters, I wish to ask the Scaevolae, supreme pontiffs, and the cleverest of men in my opinion, a question: Why do you wish to add an acquaintance with the civil law to your familiarity with the rules

A’s heir, C, is bound to pay this legacy out of the estate. But B makes a contract with C by which he relinquishes
all his rights to the legacy in consideration of the payment to him of 10,000 sesterces by C personally. Then B has “sold” his right to the legacy, and, as he recoives nothing whatever from A’s estate, is freed from the obligation of the rites without pecuniary loss.
