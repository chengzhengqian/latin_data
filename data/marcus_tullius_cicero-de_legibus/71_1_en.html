of the pontiffs? For by your knowledge of the civil law you have to some extent nullified the rules of the pontiffs. For the rites are connected with the property by the authority of the pontiffs, not by any law. Hence, if you were pontiffs and nothing more, then the authority of the pontifical college would be maintained; but as you are also learned in the civil law, you use your learning to evade your own pontifical rules. Publius Scaevola, Tiberius Coruncanius, and other supreme pontiffs have decided that those who received as much as all the heirs together were bound to the rites. There we have the rule of the pontiffs. What addition has been made to it out of the civil law? The directions for the division of the estate are cleverly written, to the effect that a hundred nummi should be deducted;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL213_437_1" id="target_note_LCL213_437_1"><sup>1</sup></a> thus a method was found by which the property might be freed from the burden of the rites. Just as if the author of the will had not wished to guard against such an act, the legal consultant, this very Mucius himself, who is also a pontiff, advises the legatee to accept less than is left to all the heirs. Previously the pontiffs had said that he was bound, whatever amount he accepted; but now they free him from the rites. This other device of theirs, however, is taken directly from the civil law, and has nothing to do with the pontiffs’ rules—the scheme, I mean, by which the heir under the will is freed from his obligation to pay the legacy by a sale. This makes the situation the same as if the money had not been left as a legacy at all, provided only that the legatee makes a formal contract in regard to the legacy, so that the money is owed to him under the contract, and not [under the legacy]. . .</p>
