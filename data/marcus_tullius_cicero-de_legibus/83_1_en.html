Nothing, moreover, is so completely in accordance with the principles of justice and the demands of Nature (and when I use these expressions, I wish it understood that I mean Law) as is government, without which existence is impossible for a household, a city, a nation, the human race, physical nature, and the universe itself. For the universe obeys God; seas and lands obey the universe, and human life is subject to the decrees of supreme Law.</p></div>
<p>II. But to return to matters which are closer to us and better known: all ancient nations were at one time ruled by kings. This kind of authority was entrusted at first to those who excelled injustice and wisdom, as was notably the case in our own State while the monarchy lasted. Later the kingship was handed down to the kingâ€™s descendants, which is still the custom in present-day kingdoms. Now those who objected to monarchy desired, not to have no one to obey, but not always to obey the same man. But we, since we are providing a system of law for free nations, and have presented our conception of the ideal State in our six earlier books,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL213_461_1" id="target_note_LCL213_461_1"><sup>1</sup></a> shall now propose laws appropriate to the kind of State there described, which we consider the best. Accordingly we must have magistrates, for without their prudence and watchful care a State cannot exist. In fact the whole character of a republic is determined by its arrangements in regard to magistrates. Not only must we inform them of the limits of their administrative authority; we must also instruct the citizens as to the extent of their obligation to obey them.
