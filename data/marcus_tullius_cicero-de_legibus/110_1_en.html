We have no guardianship of the laws, and therefore they are whatever our clerks want them to be; we get them from the State copyists, but have no official records. The Greeks were more careful about this, for they elected “guardians of the law,”
who not merely kept watch over the text of the laws, as was formerly done at Rome also, but in addition they observed men’s acts and recalled them to obedience to the laws.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL213_515_1" id="target_note_LCL213_515_1"><sup>1</sup></a> According to my law this duty would be assigned to the censors, for I decree that the censorship shall never be vacant. And <span class="italic">magistrates, after completing their terms, are to report and explain their official acts to these same censors,</span> who are to render a preliminary decision in regard to them. In Greece this is attended to by publicly appointed prosecutors, but as a matter of fact it is unreasonable to expect real severity from accusers unless they act voluntarily. For that reason it seems preferable for official acts to be explained and defended before the censors, but for <span class="italic">officials to remain liable to the law, and to prosecution before a regular court.</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL213_515_2" id="target_note_LCL213_515_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Now our discussion of the magistrates is at an end, unless you have other questions in connection with them to propose.</p>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="italic">A.</span></span> But even if we are silent, does not the subject itself bring to your mind the point which still remains to be discussed?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="italic">M.</span></span> A point which remains? I suppose you mean the courts, Pomponius; that subject is related to that of the magistrates.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="italic">A.</span></span> But do you not think you ought to say anything about the law of the Roman people, as you planned to do?</p></div>
