promise, by which supreme power is granted to the people and actual authority to the Senate, will make possible the maintenance of that balanced and harmonious constitution which I have described, especially if our next law is obeyed. It is as follows: <span class="italic">That order shall be free from dishonour, and shall be a model for the rest of the citizens.</span></p>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="italic">Q.</span></span> That is certainly an excellent law, brother; but the provision that the order shall be free from dishonour is a very general one, and needs a censor to interpret it.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="italic">A.</span></span> Although that order is thoroughly loyal to you and retains the most grateful recollection of your consulship, with your permission I may say that the task of punishing its misdeeds would wear out all the judges as well as the censors!</p></div>
<p>XIII. <span class="italic">M.</span> We need not enter into that, Atticus. For we are not talking about the present Senate or the men of our own day, but about those of the future; that is, in case any of them ever are willing to obey these laws of mine. For as our law requires that senators be free from all dishonour, no one who is guilty of anything dishonourable will so much as enter that order. Of course this is difficult of accomplishment except through education and training; and on this point I may perhaps have something to say, if I can find the place for it and we have the time.</p>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="italic">A.</span></span> You will certainly have no difficulty in finding a place for it, since you are taking up the whole system of law in regular order, and as for time, the long day gives us that in abundance.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL213_493_1" id="target_note_LCL213_493_1"><sup>1</sup></a> But if you do omit this discussion of education and training, I shall insist on your returning to it.</p></div>
