(<span class="italic">describing what he sees happening offstage</span>) Terrified by his father’s blazing eyes, the child died before being wounded, fear snatched away his spirit. Against his wife now his heavy club is leveled; it smashed her bones, her head is gone from her truncated body, totally destroyed. Can you endure this sight, old age that has lived too long? If your grief is unbearable, you have a ready means of death. (<span class="italic">calling to Hercules</span>) Come, plunge your arrows into my breast, or turn on me that club, smeared with the blood of monsters: make away with this sham father, this blot on your name, lest he grate against your glory.</p></div><div class="sp"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">chorus leader</span></span><p class="lineGroup noindent">Why are you flinging yourself in death’s path, old man?
