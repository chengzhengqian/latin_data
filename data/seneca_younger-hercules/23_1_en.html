<p class="noindent">O highest power of the gods, o ruler and father of the heavenly ones, whose hurled weapons set the human world trembling, check the impious hand of this cruel king!—Why make vain prayers to the gods? Wherever you are, my son, hear me! </p>
<p>Why is the shrine rocking and shaking with sudden movement? Why is the earth rumbling? A thunderous noise comes from the depths, from the underworld. We are heard! It <span class="italic">is</span> the sound of Hercules’ step.</p>
