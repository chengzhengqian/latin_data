lies in the grip of black night. Just as once you took your stand, and by shattering the mountains you created a precipitous path for the rushing river, when Tempe was split open by your mighty onslaught—under your body’s thrust the mountains were forced apart, and the Thessalian torrent raced through the broken barrier on its new course—so, in quest of your parents, children, country, burst forth, taking with you nature’s boundaries; restore all that greedy time has hidden away through so many passing years, and drive out before you the self-forgetting throngs that fear the light. The spoils are unworthy of you, if you bring back only what was commanded!</p>
<p>But I speak too boldly, with no knowledge of my destiny. How can that day come, when I may clasp you and your right hand, and reproach you for so slow a return, so forgetful of me? For you, O leader of the gods, a hundred unbroken bulls will offer their necks; for you, lady of harvests,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL062_37_21" id="target_note_LCL062_37_21"><sup>21</sup></a> I shall perform the mystic rites: for you, under its vow of secrecy, silent Eleusis will wave the long torches. Then I shall think my brothers restored to life, and my father flourishing in command of his realm. But if some power greater than your own holds you imprisoned, we shall follow you. Either return safely and defend us all, or drag us all down.—You <span class="italic">will</span> drag us down, no god will rebuild our broken lives.</p>
