<span class="line indent3">Orpheus could sway the pitiless rulers</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">of the shades with songs and suppliant prayer,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">when he sought back his Eurydice.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">The art that had drawn trees, birds, and rocks,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">that had caused rivers to tarry,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">at whose sound beasts had stood still,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>

<span class="line indent2">True love hates delays and cannot endure them:</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">in hurrying to behold his prize, he lost her.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
