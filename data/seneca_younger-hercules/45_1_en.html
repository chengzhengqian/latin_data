<span class="line indent3">Free his spirit from such monstrosities,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">free him, you gods;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">guide and turn his mind to a better state.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">And you, o Sleep, subduer of troubles,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">rest for the spirit,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">sweeter part of human life;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>

<span class="line indent2">languid brother of hardhearted Death,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">who mingle falsehood with truth, at once</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">sure yet deceiving guide to the future,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">peace of the world, haven of life,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">rest from light and companion in darkness,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">who come equally to king and slave,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">and force all humans, fearful of death,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">to gain knowledge of the long night:</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">calmly and gently soothe his exhaustion,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">hold him bound in a deep coma;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">let sleep fetter his untamed limbs,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">and let it not leave his savage breast,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">till his mind regains its former tenor.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent3">Look, as he sprawls on the ground</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">violent dreams are whirling in his fierce</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">heart; not yet</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">is the powerful illnessâ€™ poison overcome.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">From his habit of resting</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">his head when weary on the heavy club,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">he searches for its mass with his empty hand,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">flinging his arms in fruitless movements.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">He has not yet expelled all the surging madness,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">as a sea buffeted by a strong south wind</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
