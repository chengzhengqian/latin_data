<span class="line indent2">her flanks bound with a gilded baldric,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">stripped the glorious trophy from her body,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">and her shield and the bonds of her snow-white breast,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">looking up at her victor on bended knee.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent3">What purpose drove you to hell’s abyss,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">to venture on irretraceable paths,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">and see the realm of Sicilian Proserpine?</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">There no southerly, no westerly wind</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">causes seas to rise with swelling waves;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">there no twin Tyndarids come to the aid</span><span class="linebreak"></span>

<span class="line indent2">The sea stands inert with its black flood,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">and when Death, pale-faced with ravening teeth,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">has brought innumerable throngs to the shades,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">one oarsman transports so many peoples.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent3">May you vanquish the laws of cruel Styx,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">and the irrevocable distaffs of the Fates.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">The king who here rules numerous peoples,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">when you were attacking Nestor’s Pylos,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">raised his baneful hands against you,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">wielding his triple-pointed weapon;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">once injured with a slight wound, he fled—</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">the lord of death terrified to die.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">Break through doom by force! For the gloomy </span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">underworld let a view of the light be opened, </span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">and let the impassable boundary </span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">give easy passage to the upper world.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
