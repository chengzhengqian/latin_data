Look, the victim stands at the altar, his neck bent, and awaits your hand. I present myself, willingly, insistently: perform the slaughter! What is this? Are my eyes failing, and grief dulling my sight, or do I see Herculesâ€™ hands trembling? His eyes are closing in sleep, his head sinking, his weary neck drooping. Now his knees bend and his whole body collapses on the ground, as heavily as an ash tree felled in the woods, or a mass of masonry dropped in the sea to create a harbor. Are you alive, or killed by that same frenzy which sent your loved ones to their death? It is sleep: his breath comes and goes regularly. He must have time for rest, so that deep sleep can overcome the violent sickness and relieve his burdened mind. Remove his weapons, slaves, lest he revert to them in madness.</p></div><div class="sp"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">chorus</span></span><p class="lineGroup"><span class="line indent2">Let heaven mourn,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
