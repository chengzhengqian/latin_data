I must travel on high to the lofty expanses of the cosmos, and make for the sky: the stars are my father’s promise. What if he should now refuse? The earth cannot contain Hercules, and at last yields him to the world above.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL062_93_52" id="target_note_LCL062_93_52"><sup>52</sup></a> See, the whole company of the gods spontaneously summons me and opens the doors, with one goddess forbidding it.

I shall carry rocks and trees, and grasp ridges full of Centaurs in my right hand. With a pair of mountains I shall now construct a pathway to the world above: Chiron must see his Pelion set beneath Ossa. Then Olympus, placed as a third step, will reach to heaven—or else be hurled there.</p></div><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL062_93_52"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL062_93_52" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">52</sup>Compare the megalomania of Tamburlaine: “I might move the turning Spheres of heaven, / For earth and all this airy region / Cannot contain the state of Tamburlaine” (Christopher Marlowe, <span class="italic">2 Tamburlaine</span> 4.1.118–20).</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL062_93_52').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
