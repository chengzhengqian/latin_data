<span class="line indent3">Hard Toil arises and bestirs</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">every care and opens every home.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">A herdsman, turning loose his flock,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">gathers them fodder white with frost;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">a calf, its brow not yet broken by horns,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">plays freely on the open meadow;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">dams replenish their empty udders;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">a boisterous kid wanders lightly</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">on an unsteady course in the soft grass.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">A sailor, risking life, entrusts</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">his canvas to the winds,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">as a breeze fills the hanging folds.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">One fellow, perched on eroded rocks,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">either prepares his concealed hooks</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">or in suspense</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">watches the prize with his hand kept firm;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">the line senses the quivering fish.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">​</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">Such are the guiltless lives of those</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">who have quiet peace</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">and a home that delights in its own small means.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">But in cities giant ambitions roam</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">and trembling fears.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">One man forgoes his sleep to court</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">the proud portals and hard doorways</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">of the mighty. Another endlessly hoards</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">rich resources,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">gaping at his treasures</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">and poor amid his piled-up gold.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">One is dazed by the people’s acclaim;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">the mob, more shifting than waves at sea,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">hoists him as he swells with an empty breeze.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
