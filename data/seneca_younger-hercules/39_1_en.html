<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">I</span> shall pronounce prayers, ones worthy of Jove and of myself. May heaven stand in its place, and earth and sea. May the eternal stars pursue their courses unhindered. May deep peace nurture the nations, may iron be used only in the harmless toil of the countryside, and may swords be hidden away. May no violent storm disturb the seas, may no fire streak down from angry Jove, may no river fed with winter snows ravage the uptorn fields. May poisons disappear, and may no deadly herb swell with harmful juices. May no fierce and cruel tyrants reign. If the earth is even now to produce some wickedness, let it come quickly; if she is furnishing some monster, let it be mine.</p>
<p class="noindent">But what is this? Midday is shrouded in darkness. Phoebusâ€™ face is obscured, though not by clouds. Who chases the daylight back and drives it to its dawning? Why is this strange night rearing its black head? Why are so many stars filling the heavens in daytime? Look, my first labor, the Lion, shines in a large segment of the sky, burns all over with anger and prepares to bite. Soon he will pounce on some constellation; he stands threatening with his huge jaws, breathes out fire and glows red, tossing the mane on his neck; in one bound he will overleap the signs brought round by unwholesome autumn and by chill winter
