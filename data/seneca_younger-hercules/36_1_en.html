<span class="line indent2">gloomy and sated by long life;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">others of better years are still running—</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">maidens not yet joined in marriage,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">ephebes with hair not yet shorn,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">and infants that have just learned the name of mother.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">For these alone, to reduce their fear,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">torches may be carried to relieve the darkness;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">the rest go sadly through the gloom.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">What is your state of mind once the light</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">is lost, and each has a sorrowful sense</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">of being buried beneath the whole earth?</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">Inert, that oppressive void—grim darkness,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">the sullen color of night, the lethargy</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">of a silent world, and empty clouds.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent3">Late may old age carry us there!</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">No one comes too late to that from which,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">once come, he never can return.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">What is the good of hurrying harsh fate?</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">This crowd that wanders the great earth</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">will all join the shades and set sail</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">on lifeless Cocytus. For you grows all</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">that the rising and setting sun beholds;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">be lenient, Death, we will come; we are groomed for you.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">You can be slow, we hasten of ourselves.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">The hour that first gives life, erodes it.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL062_85_48a" id="target_note_LCL062_85_48a"><sup>48</sup></a></span><span class="linebreak"></span>
