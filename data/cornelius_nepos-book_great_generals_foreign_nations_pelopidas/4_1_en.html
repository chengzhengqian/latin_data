that he was amply protected by the inviolability of ambassadors, since that was observed sacredly by all nations, he was arrested with Ismenias by Alexander, tyrant of Pherae, and thrown into prison. He was rescued by Epaminondas, who made war upon Alexander. After that experience Pelopidas could never be reconciled with the man who had outraged him, and it was for that reason that he persuaded the Thebans to go to the aid of Thessaly and free it of its tyrants.

Because of that exploit all the states of Thessaly presented the dead Pelopidas with crowns of gold and statues of bronze, and his children with a great amount of land.</p>
