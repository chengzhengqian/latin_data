and in order that his works might not be lost through the carelessness of the readers he gave orders that ten copies of them should be made each year officially in the copying-establishments and put in the libraries. He forbade any man to wear a garment made wholly of silk.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_315_1" id="target_note_LCL263_315_1"><sup>1</sup></a> He gave orders that his house should be destroyed and a public bath erected on the site at his own expense.

Even at a banquet there would be served a single cock, with the addition of a pig’s jowl and some eggs. In preference to all other greens he would indulge himself without stint in lettuce, which was served in large quantities, for he used to say that he purchased sleep by this kind of lavish expenditure. He especially liked the more bitter kinds of food. He took baths rarely and was all the stronger in his old age. He delighted greatly in varied and elaborate kinds of glassware. He never ate bread unless it was dry, but he flavoured it with salt and other condiments. He was very skilled in the handicrafts, fond of marbles, truly senatorial in his elegance and devoted to hunting.
