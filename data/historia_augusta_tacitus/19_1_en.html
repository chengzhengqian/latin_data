<p>XIX. The private letters, moreover, were as follows:</p>
<p>“From Autronius Tiberianus to Autronius Justus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_331_1" id="target_note_LCL263_331_1"><sup>1</sup></a> his father, greeting. Now at last it is fitting, my revered father, for you to be present in the most noble senate, and now to speak your opinion, for so greatly has the authority of that noble body increased that, now that the commonwealth has been restored to its ancient position, we name the princes, we create the emperors, we, in fine, give the Augusti their title. Now look to it that you grow strong, ready to be present once more in the ancient Senate-house. We have recovered the proconsular command, and to the prefect of the city have been restored the appeals from every office and from every rank.”</p>
<p>Likewise another letter:</p>
<p>“From Claudius Sapilianus to Cereius Maecianus his uncle, greeting. We have obtained, revered sir, what we have always desired; the senate has been restored to its ancient position. We now create the emperors and in our body is vested every power. All thanks to the Roman army, aye, Roman in truth I It has restored to us the power which we always held. Now away with retirement to Baiae and Puteoli! Present yourself in the city, present yourself in the Senate-house. Happy is Rome, happy the entire commonwealth. We name the emperors, we create the princes; and we who have begun to create are also able to depose. To the wise a word is sufficient.”</p>
