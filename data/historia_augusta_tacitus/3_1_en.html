that for six months, while a good man was being sought, the commonwealth had no emperor. What harmony there was then among the soldiers! What peace for the people! How full of weight the authority of the senate! Nowhere did any pretender arise, and the judgement of the senate, the soldiers and the people of Rome guided the entire world; it was not because they feared any emperor or the power of a tribune that they did righteously, but—what is the noblest thing in life—because
they feared themselves.</p>
<p>I must, however, describe the cause of a delay so fortunate and an instance of unselfishness which should both receive special mention in the public records and be admired by future generations of the human race, in order that those who covet kingdoms may learn not to seize power but to merit it. After Aurelian had been treacherously slain, as I have described in the previous book,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_299_1" id="target_note_LCL263_299_1"><sup>1</sup></a> by the trick of a most base slave and the folly of the officers (for with these any falsehood gains credence, provided only they hear it when angry, being often drunken and at best almost always devoid of counsel), when all returned again to sanity and the troops had sternly put down those persons, the question was at once raised whether any one of them all should be chosen as emperor. Then the army, which was wont to create emperors hastily, in their anger at those who were present, sent to the senate the letter of which I have already written in the previous book,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_299_2" id="target_note_LCL263_299_2"><sup>2</sup></a> asking it to choose an emperor from its own numbers. The senate, however, knowing that the emperors it had chosen were not acceptable to the soldiers, referred the matter back to them. And while this was being done a number of times the space of six months elapsed.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_299_3a" id="target_note_LCL263_299_3a"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
