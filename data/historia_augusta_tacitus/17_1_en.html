Many, indeed, declare that he was even foretold by the Sibylline books, and had he but lived longer the world would contain no barbarians.

His mother’s shade appeared in the daytime as though alive to Tacitus and to Florian as well—it is said, indeed, that they had different fathers.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_327_5" id="target_note_LCL263_327_5"><sup>5</sup></a> All the gods in their private chapel fell down, overthrown either by an earthquake or by some mischance.
