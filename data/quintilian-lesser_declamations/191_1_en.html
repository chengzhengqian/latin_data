<p>So where is the fraud? I think that law<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_389_7" id="target_note_LCL500_389_7"><sup>7</sup></a> was passed
chiefly because of the people who in the way of legal chicanery
had entrapped somebody with a cunning document.
But even if interpretation were to go further, yet there will
be no doubt that fraud is a cheat that could not be avoided,
that is, in which only the action of the party accused is to be
judged. So let us consider point by point. I asked you to
dinner (what fraud in that?), I poor, you rich. You came: I
thank you. You did me honor and you entered that humble
threshold and you came to the table, which approaching
we invoke the gods.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_389_8" id="target_note_LCL500_389_8"><sup>8</sup></a> There is a certain thoughtfulness in
our frugality: it gives you folk a sort of recreation and rest.
In you rich men’s banquets too, you don’t always serve
those items fetched from foreign seas and forests; sometimes
you call upon these inexpensive products from the
countryside, which we poor men can buy. However, you
made a cheerful meal; as you want us to think, you also
drank rather freely. But why my invitation? Because we
poor men need to stake a claim on you rich men’s power. If
somebody brought a charge against me, you would have
defended me. If I were afraid of some injury, I should have
asked your help, invoking the table we shared. So there’s
no fraud in my inviting you to dinner.</p>
<p>Other items have nothing at all to do with your accusation
and the law. So it follows that the next charge is that
my daughter was part of the service. Once more poverty
will be under fire. So what would you have us do? We can’t
buy. Even if anything was left over from our daily labors,
upbringing exhausted it. Should not we borrow then, and
imitate your elegances with other people’s servants, as far
