to whom you had given the money? For in decency a creditor
does not come to a sponsor except if he cannot recover
from the debtor. Your exaction is inhuman, your claim is
unjust. You have recovered the money you loaned; how is
not my concern. Whatever it was that came from you to
your debtor, you have it. A sponsor, moreover, is accepted
so that the creditor shall not be out of pocket. Would you
like to know how impossible it is for you to call upon the
sponsor? You can’t call upon the debtor. And since it must
be admitted that my case is the same as the debtor’s and
you do not wish it to appear otherwise, I want to deal with
you as though you were claiming from the debtor, never
mind that the sponsor’s persona is more respectable, leaving
aside that the debtor is an adulterer, that he has been
caught and punished. Let us imagine then that you are
claiming from the debtor whose sponsor I am. I want to reply
on behalf of your debtor: “You have recovered everything.
All that I possessed was transferred to you. Among
my possessions was what was owed you. You have it all; or
rather, more than all.”</p>

We are not challenging that law. But what is its content?
That the debtor’s property belongs to you. And what
property is that? As I suppose, the property of the person

Suppose the person you caught had another creditor: is
there any doubt that the creditor would have recovered his
money, although the adulterer’s money belonged to you?
Let us now suppose the debtor without any sponsor: I suppose
you would ask for an accounting: after all debt had
been deducted, all burdens on the estate, the law would
