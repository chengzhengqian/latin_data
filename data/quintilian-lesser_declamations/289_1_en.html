<p>There must be some reason and motive that caused the
rich man not to write down as heir the woman to whom he
wanted the inheritance to go.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_113_5" id="target_note_LCL501_113_5"><sup>5</sup></a> Some embarrassment must
have stood in the way: not at passing over one of his relations,
for he did pass them over; not at naming an outsider,
for he did name an outsider; not at passing down his property
to one of humble station, for that is what he did. Some
more interior reason must have inhibited: he could not
name her as his heir without embarrassment. Later I shall
approve to you the reason for this coyness and the mind of
the writer; meanwhile there was something that inhibited
the rich man from writing her down as his heir.</p>
<p>“What had you done,” he says, “to deserve that he made
you his heir?” That applies to both. I can ask you exactly
the same question. How had you deserved that he make
you his heir? For so long as you do not show a third party to
whom the inheritance might be due, the question is between
the two of us. If you had named one, perhaps I
should have said to him too: “What had you done to deserve
it?” But you neither name any outsider nor can you
claim the inheritance for yourself. “So answer us: what
have you done to deserve it?” &lt;What if&gt; nothing? Doesn’t
everyone know about the luck of wills? And perhaps it
would be in general unfair that we should be asked about
what is in someone else’s mind. Minds sometimes have irrational
impulses, sometimes gratuitous (to use the common
word) dislikes. How often we have heard a son saying:
“What did I do to deserve to be disowned by my father?”
Nothing is more often followed by surprise.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_113_6" id="target_note_LCL501_113_6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
