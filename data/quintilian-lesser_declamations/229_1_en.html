not home-born, nor yet purchased or left by will. His condition
therefore depends entirely on a loan. What follows?
That he is not &lt;a slave&gt;.</p>
<p>So much for the actual words of the will. Now I want to
scrutinize the intent of the deceased also, than which nothing
should carry more weight with us, nothing be more
sacred to our minds. Is it then credible that this is what he
meant, that he wanted even the man addicted for debt to
be free? Why he freed the slaves is clear. He was pleased
with their services, he wanted to repay their obedience.
One of them had cured him when he was ill, another had
followed him travelling abroad, another had kept watch on
his domestic &lt;affairs&gt; amid so many occupations,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_465_8" id="target_note_LCL500_465_8"><sup>8</sup></a> another
had practiced this very business of loaning money.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_465_9" id="target_note_LCL500_465_9"><sup>9</sup></a> He
wanted those he had loved and whom he believed had
loved him to be free. But what did he owe this man except
anger?</p>
<p>“But it seems hard and inhumane that only he should
be in bonds and servitude.” First of all, if there &lt;is&gt; any
harshness, it is in the law which ordered addicted persons
to be in servitude until they paid. Do you therefore require
me to say something on behalf of the law? It is not for a
humble person like myself nor part of my duty to try to defend
what our ancestors in their great wisdom determined.
All the same, if you care to look into it, what determination
can be more equitable or in what other &lt;way&gt; can your patrimonies
be safeguarded, your fortunes sustained? Or shall
a man squander borrowed money in all manner of vices
