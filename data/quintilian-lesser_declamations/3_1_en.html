<p>Shall the woman then sin with impunity, having used her
husband’s calamity as an opportunity? * * * thought five
years too short a period * * * but it was almost continuous
and perpetual. Let no one think that only an individual’s
adultery is now to be avenged; &lt;it concerns&gt; an example to
the whole community.</p>

<h2>245</h2>
<span class="label">&lt;Denier of deposit&gt;</span>
<p>Whoso denies a deposit, let him pay fourfold. A man who
was leaving behind a loose-living son deposited money
with a friend with instructions to return it to the son if
he reformed. The young man claimed the money &lt;but lost
the case. Later he reformed and the friend offered the
money&gt;.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_13_1a" id="target_note_LCL500_13_1a"><sup>1</sup></a> The other now sues for fourfold.</p>
<span class="label"><span class="sc">discussion</span></span>
<p>This young man seems * * * but a harsh exactor * * * since
we are presenting the persona of a friend, and a friend
proved such by the very thing here at issue. For it will be
easier for us to show that all he did was for the young man’s
own sake if even under prosecution he is at no point driven
into hostility.</p>

SB<sup>1</sup> in revision of Rohde’s supplement, and propose the following
sequence: Father deposits money with a friend, enjoining him not
to return it to his loose-living son after his death until said son
mends his ways. Father dies and Son demands the money. Instead of quoting Father’s instructions, the friend denies the deposit (for
his reason see s.6). Son brings suit and loses. Later he reforms and
the friend offers to return the money and returns it (s.7). Son sues
him for four times the sum as penalty for his denial. “Offered the
money” rather than “returned the money” as showing that the
initiative came from the friend—the son had not repeated his
demand.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL500_13_1a').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
