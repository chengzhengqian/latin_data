because the rapist has perished. No law makes that exception,
no written word provides it. So they rely on interpretation.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_265_2" id="target_note_LCL500_265_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Let us see what sort of interpretation. “The law,”
he says, “that allows an option between property and death
sufficiently signifies that the option is between two alternatives.
Since then one of them cannot now be opted for,
neither can there be any room for an option.” &lt;If&gt; we conceded
that this is the meaning of the law, so that the girl’s
option lay between two alternatives, I should argue nevertheless
that these <span class="italic">are</span> two, by nature and meaning. For if
the rapist has been withdrawn from us, it does not follow
that death itself is nothing. But how is it not enough that
one remains, since even if there were two, it would only be
possible to choose one?</p>
<p>〚And these two would be validly put forward by the
other side only if they were joint. But as it is, they are separated
by the very text of the law: “death or marriage”: so
they are two; simple, individual.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_265_3a" id="target_note_LCL500_265_3a"><sup>3</sup></a>〛 Moreover, &lt;if&gt; the law

gentlemen, to start with: if anything in the law is to be bent,
see to it that as little as possible of it be lost. For our opponent
complains that some interpretation of the wording is
lost, we complain that whole statute, the whole legal right,
is lost. For my contention with the opposition would be
