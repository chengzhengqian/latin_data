<span class="label">An exposer claiming ten thousand with a hero</span>
<p>Let the father of a hero receive ten thousand. A man who
appeared to have a son received ten thousand after the
same had become a hero. Later the natural father recognized
the young man and took him back after payment of
upbringing costs. He claims the ten thousand.</p>

<p>You claim ten thousand from me. By what right? For what
reason? Did you lend it or deposit it or does it belong to
you as price for the sale of some article? None of these.
There was no contract between us except that latterly you
owed me something.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_277_1" id="target_note_LCL500_277_1"><sup>1</sup></a> You produce a law under which ten
thousand is to be given to the father of a hero. If the obligation
in respect of that sum is not discharged, it can be
claimed, as I suppose, from the commonwealth. For although
it be now agreed which of us ought to have received
the money, I should like you to answer me, who ought to
have given it? If it is owing to the father, the commonwealth
owes it. We shall consider later on whether I properly
received it from the community: you cannot receive it
except from the community. But you say I received what
was owing to you. Suppose I admit that for the present.
Perhaps the giver will reclaim it. Meanwhile, nobody owes
you except whoever gave it to me.</p>
<p>But I want now to plead the commonwealthâ€™s case too
and reply to you as though you were claiming that money
from the magistrates. This is not the time for your action.
For when did your son become a hero? You will admit that
much time had elapsed prior to this action. I shall ask
