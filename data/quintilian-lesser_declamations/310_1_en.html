if the result was going to come to the same thing. Is there
any doubt therefore that if my client had been convicted of
injuries a third time, he would have lost his life? It is beyond
question. What then? Must &lt;not&gt; a man be held to be
&lt;capitally&gt; charged if the death penalty hangs over him
should he be convicted? He will not suffer a money fine,
nor a stigma, nor the loss of some right. What then was
going to happen? He was going to be put to death. What
difference does it make under what law, in what category
of trial? It is impossible that he stood in peril of his life and
that you did not make a capital accusation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, what do we think was the motive for
drafting this law? When we have shaken that out, it will
appear that adequate provision has been made in that direction
also.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_155_4" id="target_note_LCL501_155_4"><sup>4</sup></a> “Whoso brings a capital charge and fails to

on you at the same time. It is quite impossible that the
sanctity and strictness of the trial can be so cheated that
neither party is punished. When the man who was to have
lost his life was acquitted, it followed automatically that
you must pay the penalty.</p>
