<p>“But a rumor came in about my death.” She immediately
married another husband. What is this but a more
shocking adultery? Or are we content with a persuasion<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_287_1" id="target_note_LCL501_287_1"><sup>1</sup></a>?
That way, even if I were acquitted of homicide, I am still in
danger of losing all I possess: for my will has been read and
