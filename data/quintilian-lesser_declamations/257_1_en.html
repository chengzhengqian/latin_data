fight with his son.</p>
<p>However, he is not defended by any pretence of affection
and family feeling. “Yes,” he says, “I fought, but as
your commander ought to fight. You require one man’s
blood: I slew an army. You demand a matching pair of gladiators:
I brought back the victory of the whole community.
Count the prisoners, count the booty, and judge whether I
should be found guilty because I provided more. For what
items are demanded by the law? Only my personal fight.
All the same, the writer’s silent prayer seems to have been
that the enemy be killed too. I provided both: I fought and
he was killed.</p>
<p>“But the abandoned young man shall not get the scandal
he aimed for: that it seems as though his killing was a
crime, that he gave a spectacular outcome to his wickedness.
Let him lie in the multitude. I ask you folk who were
pressing for that sort of combat, which outcome did you
conceive of? Would the young man have beaten the old,
would the criminal have beaten the decent fellow? What
damage would the commonwealth have suffered, what
tears, what mourning, with her general lost, her soldiers’
spirit broken, hope for the future downgraded? Or would
your commander have killed that rash and criminal young
man? Was it worth it, that the spectacle of parricide should
be seen? Should we not have been afraid of the anger of
the gods, of a crop failure and epidemics and the rest of
it—the usual expiations of heinous crimes? Was this the
omen with which I would have joined battle?”</p>
