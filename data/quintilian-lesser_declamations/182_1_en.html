pimps.” You deserve to be disowned even if you <span class="italic">keep</span> a parasite.
You are counted among another man’s slaves, you are
taxed with loose living which is not even your own. Meanwhile
I say nothing about the kind of life from which you
passed into your present one, under what sort of father you
were trained. I conceal my own persona, put it out of the
way, as I disown a parasite. Do you think I am angry? I pity
you. The vices of the town clung to you, in which this
seems to be the first among things odious—rusticity. If you
had consumed your father’s goods, you would be justly disowned:
you have consumed liberty and freeborn modesty.
Who is that superior being whom you serve?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_371_7" id="target_note_LCL500_371_7"><sup>7</sup></a> I am
ashamed to name the price for which you have alienated
your heritage: you serve your stomach, and like dumb animals
when food is offered them you fell into your present
servitude. But food is relished after work. I see many different
ways of life, and not all of them to be approved; but
this one is novel and unheard-of, to turn insults to profit
and live off outrage. You love that residual drink, that
something untouched from a wealthy man’s dinner. You
kiss the hand that beats you and carry the iron.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_371_8" id="target_note_LCL500_371_8"><sup>8</sup></a> You’ll
starve to death if he doesn’t hurt you. Perhaps other parasites
have some skill to recommend them: but you,
wretched creature, what can you do except take a thrashing?
Rich exquisites have this godsent malady among
others, a hankering for everything unnatural.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_371_9" id="target_note_LCL500_371_9"><sup>9</sup></a> Deformity
is one passport to favor—the very infelicity of a twisted
body pleases. Another is bought because of his foreign
color. The fact is that this has become another new chic, to
keep a rustic among one’s fancy perversities. It’s risible—he’s
tough and clumsy and my son.</p>
