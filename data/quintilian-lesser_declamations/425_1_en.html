adopt a tyrannicide in place of his son because he could not
rouse his son to tyrannicidal courage. I say he was angry
with you: he disowned you. Fathers never flare up lightly.
And what was the reason? Because you had not killed the

good service: you have your reward from the commonwealth.
That should be the reward of courage, this is the
punishment of inertia. But when did you kill him? The will
roused you.</p>

be no greater injury done to him than if he shall have this
man as his heir.</p>
