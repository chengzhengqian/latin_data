now be forbidden to sue because he has confessed that he

<p>I sued. Suppose that on the very day on which I laid my
charge you were asked what I was doing. When I copied
the list,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_53_7" id="target_note_LCL500_53_7"><sup>7</sup></a> when I challenged the jurors, through all those
judicial delays, too long as they were and made up in the
interest of the guilty, what else did I do but sue? You will
not deny that I started to sue. Whoever begins to sue &lt;has
sued,&gt; because once for all * * *. When I started to sue, &lt;I
sued&gt;; for I could not have been seen to begin without
suing. So for however short a time, I sued; that I did not
finish is nothing to the contrary. You would not say that a
non-winner did not fight, or that an owner who received no
returns did not own, or that the survivor of a shipwreck had
not put to sea. “But he asked for a quashing.” I can use this
very argument as a sufficiently cogent proof that I had
sued. So when the quashing was being asked for, what was
I? A plaintiff, I imagine, and an accuser. What was he? A
defendant, I imagine. But that name never applies to a
person not being sued. What are you contending for today?
To prevent me starting to sue you. For the outcome,
as you would like it to appear, is in doubt and to the contrary
many things can still happen to prevent the trial itself
taking place. And yet you enter a demurrer to ban me from
suing, that is to say from laying charge against you and
legally constraining you. So, just as I am about to sue you
straight away, so I have already sued him.</p>
<p>But let us suppose that no action<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_53_8" id="target_note_LCL500_53_8"><sup>8</sup></a> is involved when a
trial is not concluded. If, however it was &lt;not&gt; my fault
