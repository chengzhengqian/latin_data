bachelor. If she was a wife and he a husband, I now ask:
whose husband was he, whose wife was she? “All the same,
&lt;I desiderate&gt; a wedding in the home.” Granted, if you
will, that a wedding is necessary in other cases (though the
law does not absolutely require even that, but there is a
reason—to show will, i.e. that the daughter is united with
you &lt;by will of her parents,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_33_7" id="target_note_LCL500_33_7"><sup>7</sup></a>&gt; or, in the case of a woman
who is her own mistress, by her own will): in this case the
option effected whatever a wedding effects. Let us see if
we can put it even more strongly and emphatically: there it
is a question of will, here of necessity as well. I should venture
to assert absolutely that no women in this category
of suit better deserve to retain marital inheritances than
those who have begun to be wives as a result of rape, since
after rape nobody is a wife except by her own benefaction.
And it may be that this is the origin of that law.</p>
<p>Now I want to answer the opposition’s challenge: is she
worthy to receive the title of wife? If I were merely to say
that she deserved the inheritance in return for the injury,
that inheritance might still be regarded as a sort of compensation.
The young man loved her; this element in this
suit ought to carry its proportional weight.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_33_8" id="target_note_LCL500_33_8"><sup>8</sup></a> He wanted
nothing more, even if he lived, than that this property
should be common. <span class="italic">He</span> made this law for his property.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_33_9" id="target_note_LCL500_33_9"><sup>9</sup></a>
“The young man had hopes of her,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_33_10" id="target_note_LCL500_33_10"><sup>10</sup></a> this is why he dared to
ask; &lt;he did not love her.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_33_11" id="target_note_LCL500_33_11"><sup>11</sup></a> I am sorry for this excellent
and too sensitive young man, that you should so interpret
his feelings.&gt;</p>
