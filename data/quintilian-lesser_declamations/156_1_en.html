<p>Let him choose for himself what sort of father he would
wish to be allotted, gentle or strong; let him select the
character, so long as he abides by his selection. Since you
killed the adulterer, you must needs be allotted a strict father.
I disown a rapist; I don’t yet say of whom,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_319_6" id="target_note_LCL500_319_6"><sup>6</sup></a> I do say this
at least: “You raped a virgin, you troubled the face of peace,
you did something for which you might justly have been
put to death.” You came to me, furthermore, and I was anxious
for you; I found it necessary to beg—a very hard thing

made me slip.” Do you want my forgiveness? Nothing goes
down better than when the label of strictness is removed
from a persona. I pardon your vices, you have a gentle, lenient
father. I forgive your crimes. Tell me now why you
killed your brother. What crime can be found so heinous
that it has to be avenged by parricide?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_319_9" id="target_note_LCL500_319_9"><sup>9</sup></a> Where are those
precepts with which I admonished you to be brothers in
