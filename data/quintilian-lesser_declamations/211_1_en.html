get herself talked about? Why should the malicious have
their material? Marriage could scarcely be found innocent
even if that jury had already pronounced against you. What
is going to happen if she is ready to marry and they pronounce
her your mother? And again: are you going to wed
her, young man, if the marriage is adjudged to you? If you
don’t marry her, there won’t be any test of parentage that
way; if you do, the test is made.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_429_26" id="target_note_LCL500_429_26"><sup>26</sup></a> 〚Dear, oh dear: a young
man like you marrying an old woman! I see your game:
“She’s my mother, she refuses.” So, mother or wife, doesn’t
it make any difference?〛</p>
<p>But the young man’s audacity is ready to hand; and at
her age no one would be surprised if she dies. For faith’s
sake, young man, opt for the property instead. She’s used
to frugal ways, she has lived a long while without a husband
amidst the heaviest of life’s calamities<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_429_27" id="target_note_LCL500_429_27"><sup>27</sup></a>—but not without a
consolation all the same: she obeyed her husband. And
now her life is at its end, and she doesn’t worry about what
she has to leave: she has no son.</p>

<span class="label">Accomplice by poison of a traitor</span>
<p>Let there be an action for complicity. Let a traitor be
tortured until he reveals his accomplices. A traitor twice
tortured persisted in denial. When he was about to be tortured
a third time, a friend gave him poison. He is tried for
complicity.</p>
