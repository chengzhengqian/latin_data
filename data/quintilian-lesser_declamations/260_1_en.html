cannot this legacy be claimed by one of the two, as intended
by the deceased?” Neither of you can say: “The patron
wanted this given to me.” He did me the compliment
of making it my favor. So he should deserve well of <span class="italic">me</span> and
not claim from me what he would not have claimed from
his patron.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_55_4" id="target_note_LCL501_55_4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>I shall unveil what my friend had in mind. He wanted it
given to the better man. This cannot be known from your
past lives; otherwise he himself would have known, and if
there had been any difference between you, he would have
named the legatee. With this legacy of your patron’s you
both have to live more carefully. To which shall I give it?
Which of you will have missed your patron more, which of
you will have lived more frugally, which of you will have
been the more respectful? Why should I keep you waiting
any longer? To which of you shall I wish? Meanwhile, you
are alike, you have the same case. I can no more judge
between you than could your patron.</p>
