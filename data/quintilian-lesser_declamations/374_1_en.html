what you will.” Greedy and avaricious though he be, which
is more?</p>
<p>But he avers that he never even had those rewards in
mind when he did it. “First of all,” he says, “I forgot my
safety, I looked at the good of the community, of everybody;
then, if I had any personal concern, at fame and
glory in time to come of this poverty that is sometimes
thrown in my teeth—it reared courage more easily.”</p>

<span class="label">The guardian of his son given in adoption</span>
<p>Let no action lie against a father except for dementia. A
man gave his son into adoption. Dying, he appointed his
natural father guardian. He acted as guardian, rendered
accounts. The son wishes to accuse his father of malversation.
The other enters a demurrer on the ground that no
action lies against a father except for dementia.</p>
<span class="label"><span class="sc">discussion</span></span>
<p>The nature of the case would perhaps allow that this father,
whom his son wishes to prosecute, be angry, and all the
more angry because he deserved well of his son, not only
by begetting him but also giving him into adoption. But
emotions are not always to be followed and often reasons
must be preferred to them. For although this father is
really angry, he ought to conceal it and play gentle, indulgent.
For when he demurs, he should make the jury believe
that he does so to avoid a more serious contest with
his son. Otherwise, if this is not the reason for his demurrer,
only lack of confidence can seem the reason.</p>
