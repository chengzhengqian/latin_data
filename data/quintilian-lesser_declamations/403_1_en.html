<span class="label">Fourfold of a stolen deposit</span>
<p>Whoso loses a deposit, let him take an oath and keep it.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_341_1a" id="target_note_LCL501_341_1a"><sup>1</sup></a> A
man lost a deposit by theft and took an oath. Later he convicted
the thief and exacted fourfold. The owner claims
this too.</p>

<p>The increment on my money belongs to me. What if my
attorney or my agent were to make the same answer?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_341_3" id="target_note_LCL501_341_3"><sup>3</sup></a>
Finally, what if the convicted thief had not paid the full
amount? I suppose that would have been my loss. Ought I
to feel the loss but not the increment? For I left you when
you took the oath. My business is now with the thief.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_341_4" id="target_note_LCL501_341_4"><sup>4</sup></a>
Whatever he pays belongs to me.</p>

<p>On the other side he will say that he acted on his own account,
investigated, worked. An effective point in his favor

the point made in s.2 init.: Socrus must claim her money as a loan,
