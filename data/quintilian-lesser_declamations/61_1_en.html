<p>I have no need to claim credit for this at length as
though it had not been understood. He did not waste his
good deed. The girl felt she could never repay him and her
father looked upon that benefaction as entitling his friend
to do with him and his whatever he wanted. So a rumor
arose in the community, not for the usual reasons;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_129_8" id="target_note_LCL500_129_8"><sup>8</sup></a> people

as a father, but giving his advice and opinion. Then he admonished
her: “Remember, this is the man to whom you
owe your life, who saved you from the dangers of the sea.”

What a happy home! Nothing was wanting to our
