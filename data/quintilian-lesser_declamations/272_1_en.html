for me to poison my brother? For nobody doubts,
gentlemen, that a plot to commit a crime does not simply
look at the means to accomplish what is planned and begun,
but also at that other means, even more necessary,
deeply embedded in the planning, how to deny what he<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_79_19" id="target_note_LCL501_79_19"><sup>19</sup></a>
has done. I give poison: and how do I know whether he will
collapse at once after draining the potion? My brother
comes to my table, expires among my guests. On whom am
I going to shift<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_79_20" id="target_note_LCL501_79_20"><sup>20</sup></a> the crime, whom of gods and men am I going
