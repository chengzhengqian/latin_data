property. It is equally evident that you were disowned.
What else is in question?</p>
<p>He says: “He wrote the tyrannicide as his heir, and I
killed the tyrant.” It makes no difference whether you acquired
some right subsequently; you forfeited your right
as a son. For the law that denies paternal property to
disowned sons removes them in perpetuity. Otherwise it
would be superfluous to remove a disowned son, who had
in any case lost the paternal home.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_383_1" id="target_note_LCL501_383_1"><sup>1</sup></a> So the law was written
in order to stop such from returning to the house under
any law. So tyrannicide though you be, it does you no good,
nor does any law bring back one whom a law has excluded.
And, gentlemen, a law that forbids always has more force

<p>“But my father,” he says, “wanted me to be his heir and
he wrote ‘tyrannicide’ because he knew I was going to do
tyrannicide.” You are mistaken: he did not want you, far
from it. For if he had wanted you, he would have written:
“Let my son be my heir if he does tyrannicide.” As it is, it is
