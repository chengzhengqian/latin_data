the wife I want,” he says. What then? Don’t you know that
marriages are for us<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_391_2" id="target_note_LCL501_391_2"><sup>2</sup></a> to decide? You fathers are not masters
of our affections; you cannot make me love or hate
whom you want by an order. Matrimony is in perpetuity
only if it is joined by mutual will. So when we are looking
for a wife for me, to share my bed, to be my life-companion
for every generation, <span class="italic">I</span> must choose her. Otherwise, what
do you gain by forcing me against my will? I shall divorce
her. “But the law<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_391_3" id="target_note_LCL501_391_3"><sup>3</sup></a> compels you to marry an orphan,” he
says. What? Are you her advocate? Let me answer her. Let
her force me by that law if she can. Meanwhile, don’t block
me with paternal majesty. But I’ll wager she can’t force
me<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_391_4" id="target_note_LCL501_391_4"><sup>4</sup></a> and that is why she doesn’t. Otherwise I should answer
her that orphans do have a law to themselves but that perhaps
it imposes marriage upon the available, not the already
bespoken.</p>
<p>“So what?” he says. “Don’t you marry an orphan?” I am
delighted, father, that you can pity the unfortunate. This
one too is an orphan, she too has lost her father. In fortune<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_391_5" id="target_note_LCL501_391_5"><sup>5</sup></a>
she is alike, in love closer. We were brought up in the same
house, I know her ways, I like her modesty, I like her family.
Add that she was commended to me by our father. Add
that he asked me. Add that I even took an oath. Do you
want me to go back on it? And to whom? Why, the man
who took me up, who was a father to me, who gave me you
as a father. How did he ask me?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_391_6" id="target_note_LCL501_391_6"><sup>6</sup></a> It’s no use your saying: “I
am forcing you.” It’s perjury all the same. And what sort of
marriage will it be, based on perjury?</p>
