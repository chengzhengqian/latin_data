it so much as in confirming our own. So let it not be
invalidated but convicted of over-amplitude. For we can
say: “A wife is a woman who, being handed over to a man
through a wedding, comes to share his life” but “wife” does
not apply exclusively to her (just as, if it were so defined: “a
wife is a woman who, being handed over into matrimony
by her parents through a wedding, has lived for many years
in partnership &lt;of life&gt;,” we should not deny that such a
woman is a wife &lt;although&gt; “handed over by her parents”
is not necessary in the definition of “wife”). These definitions
are not false, but after much has been detracted
she will still be a wife. For let us suppose that a marriage
has taken place and that death of one of the parties immediately
followed: she will surely be a wife, even by your
admission, although she was not in partnership of life. So
just as that added “partnership of life” is not a lie but
an &lt;un&gt;necessary addition, so also that phrase “placed
through a wedding” makes a wife, but this is not the only
qualification.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_29_2" id="target_note_LCL500_29_2"><sup>2</sup></a> For let us suppose that she has not entered
into any marriage but had intercourse for the purpose of
creating children: she will not be a wife, although she
has not been placed through a wedding. Let us see, therefore,
if these items are superfluous extras, &lt;what sort of&gt;
definition will suffice for this name.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_29_3" id="target_note_LCL500_29_3"><sup>3</sup></a> For you ought not to
