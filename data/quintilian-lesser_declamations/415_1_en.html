was wrong: he has made amends, he begs, he is wretched.

“You too he disowned,” he says. Leave judgment of her
grief to her, let her be &lt;her only&gt; avenger. But why should
she take any vengeance? She deserved to be disowned. She
had saved you; she deserved banishment. But suppose he
disowned her unjustly; he is her father. In a plight such as
his we don’t look at what he deserved. Finally, what will the
woman do when he comes to her door? And how little it is
that she gives!</p>
<p>Where shall the poor woman betake herself now? I suppose
she has to go begging with her father. However, she

<span class="label">Victor with the arms of a tomb</span>
<p>Let an action lie for violation of a tomb. A man took arms
from the tomb of a hero, having used up his own. Having
won a victory, he replaced them. He is accused of tomb
violation.</p>

<p>I could have denied the charge. Do you say that arms were
pulled down? I deny it. Am I lying? Let us go to the very
spot. I want to count; if anything is missing, I want to be
convicted. But I shall not tarnish my glory by concealing
how it was that I was honored as a hero. But what am I to
do? I am not allowed to tell that story.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_365_1" id="target_note_LCL501_365_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Envy is upon me
and it hates the thing to which it owes its survival.</p>
