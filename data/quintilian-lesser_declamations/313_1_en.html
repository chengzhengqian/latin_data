<p>This is that general topic, as I used to tell you, going with
text and intention.</p>
<span class="label"><span class="sc">declamation</span></span>
<p>But let us suppose (to indulge these fads) that under a like
law &lt;a like punishment&gt; is to be applied. What is like here?
For in that law we have a different class of actions, a different
