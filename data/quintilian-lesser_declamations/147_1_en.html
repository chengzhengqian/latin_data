than the rapist? For my wedding, my marriage is at risk, a
marriage not known for a single night, not the result of error,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_301_15" id="target_note_LCL500_301_15"><sup>15</sup></a> it may be, or injury, but chosen, approved, granted.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_301_16" id="target_note_LCL500_301_16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>In face of all this my father-in-law tries to deceive me
with hope and does not show publicly what she is going to
opt for.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_301_17" id="target_note_LCL500_301_17"><sup>17</sup></a> Thus in spite of all he flatters my affection (?). I
gladly believe it, gentlemen; she will remain married to
me. &lt;But&gt; I amsorry for the rapist and I amnot the first to
be.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_301_18" id="target_note_LCL500_301_18"><sup>18</sup></a> I amsorry for him. Perhaps he made a mistake. If the

about the one, the other relates to my fears.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_301_19" id="target_note_LCL500_301_19"><sup>19</sup></a> Still, I am
not mistrustful about my wife, I don’t doubt her feelings;
otherwise I should be less worried.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_301_20" id="target_note_LCL500_301_20"><sup>20</sup></a> I know that I deserved

that I fulfilled all maritial duties in complete fondness.
What I am doubtful about is what she may be capable
of when she is brought before the magistrates, when the
doomed man lies at her feet, when he produces his kinsfolk
and friends. Why should another man say to my wife: “I
love you and that is why I raped you?” Why should there be
someone to speak against me &lt;and say&gt;: “Have pity.” I am
afraid of public sentiment, the compassion of the community.
And what can be more unfair than that my wife be
