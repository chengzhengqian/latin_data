drove the knife through my children’s vitals, I that begot
and reared them. I believe you, and yet I hold you, yes you,
responsible for my bereavement. I estimate it from the
day of my grief.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_109_2" id="target_note_LCL500_109_2"><sup>2</sup></a> To be ignorant of some things is like
never having suffered them. I lost my sons when I realized
that I had lost them. Yes, Fortune had certainly inflicted
a great injury &lt;upon me&gt; by my hands; but she had placed
a remedy for this in my very mind during the period
when I seemed mad, driven by dementia. Quite often my
thoughts were such that I believed myself with all my children.
You took my ignorance of my misfortune away from
me. How much more pitiable I was from the day of sanity,
your gift! When I was mad, I did not strike myself so. It was
then that I began to tear my clothes and beat my face. All
this then ought not to be taken otherwise than as if you
yourself had killed my sons, as if you yourself had robbed
me of them. Ah, what a blessing it would be if you could
give me back that sickness, that madness!</p>
<p>The only thing I can do for these unhappy young men of
mine, do I will. Nobody shall be glad of their death, nobody
shall profit from my having killed my sons.</p>

<span class="label">Marriage between the children of enemies</span>
<p>A man who had a son and a rich man for an enemy was captured
by pirates. He wrote to his son about ransom. Since
the son had no money, when the rich man offered his
daughter, he married her and ransomed his father with
&lt;his father-in-law’s&gt; money. His father returns and orders
him to divorce her. When he refuses, his father disowns
him.</p>
