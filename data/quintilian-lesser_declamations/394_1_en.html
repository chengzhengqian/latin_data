<span class="label">She will die before she marries</span>
<p>A man who had a marriageable daughter caught his wife
talking to a handsome young neighbor. He asked her what
she had said. The women replied that she had talked about
their daughter’s marriage. The husband engaged the daughter
to him. The mother says: “She will die before she marries.”
Before the wedding day the girl died suddenly; livid
patches and tumors were on her body. The woman is accused.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_323_1" id="target_note_LCL501_323_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<span class="label"><span class="sc">discussion</span></span>
<p>The woman will say that she never liked the young man
and put up a resistance when it seemed the girl was intended
for him. He, however, was determined to have her
as his wife and came to make it all right. But then the
mother liked him all the less as a son-in-law. So when she
heard that her daughter had been affianced to him, she was
angry and after the everyday fashion of common folk she
said: “She will die sooner than she marries.” As to the girl’s
death she will make moan along with the accuser. Indigestion
is put up as the cause of death.</p>
