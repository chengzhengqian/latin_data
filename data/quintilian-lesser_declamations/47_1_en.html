<span class="label">Deserters to be excluded</span>
<p>There was war between two communities. Many deserters
used to come to one of them. Somebody proposes a law
that they not be received.</p>
<span class="label"><span class="sc">discussion</span></span>
<p>This type comes very close to Suasoriae;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_101_1" id="target_note_LCL500_101_1"><sup>1</sup></a> for the persuasion
or dissuasion of a law belongs to Suasoriae also. So the
proposer of the law will say that to receive deserters is discreditable,
that it does no good, perhaps &lt;actually does
harm&gt;, as regards the end of the war. Finally: the practice
on account of which the law is proposed is dangerous.</p>

<p>Even if the war were not in a state that allowed us to think
of appearances,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_101_2" id="target_note_LCL500_101_2"><sup>2</sup></a> yet to have done even with risk what is
best and conducive to reputation might look so well that
expediency should not seem to stand in the way. As it is,
doing the right thing brings less credit but a great deal
more security.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_101_3" id="target_note_LCL500_101_3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
