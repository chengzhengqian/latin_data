<p>All this I should have said if he had not been put to
death legally, if he had perished only by mistake. As it is, it
must necessarily be agreed between me and the other side
that no one bringing death to a guilty man can be accused
if he is one of those of whom I was speaking a little while
ago:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_223_4" id="target_note_LCL500_223_4"><sup>4</sup></a> accuser or witness or juror or informer. So let us see
whether the rapist was put to death legally; and let us pretend
that he is still alive, that we are still asking a question
about him: ought a rapist to be put to death? I do not bring
my other daughter before the magistrates, I do not tell her
what to choose. My daughter was violated, for that reason
she perished. I say that the rapist should be put to death.
And I am not yet relying on equity, so as to say how just it is
that he who did the injury should be killed since she who
received it has perished: I am speaking about the law itself.
It is included in the law that a raped woman opt for the
death of the rapist or marriage. As I suppose, the only object
of this law was that a decision about the rapist be made
according to the wish of the victim. Anyway,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_223_5" id="target_note_LCL500_223_5"><sup>5</sup></a> many things
may happen to prevent the victim from opting. Let us
imagine that a woman who is unable to speak is violated:
will he have done an injury with impunity because he has
done it to an unfortunate? I suppose one should look at her
nod or expression or some other sign of her mind. “But that
is not option, the words of the law will not be sufficiently
implemented.” All the same, the rapist would be put to
death if we understood that this was the victim’s wish. Let
us imagine that the victim fell ill so that she could not be
brought before the magistrates. The law will not be fully
satisfied, but she ought to be avenged all the more because
it will be credible that this very illness arose from the injury.
But if, as is clear from all this, it is not absolutely required
