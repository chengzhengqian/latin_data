have already stated the words of these three: what words
shall I state for these four? That they are in doubt, don’t
know what to pronounce, still therefore in suspense? Why
do you demand a dismissal if the judge is deliberating?
“The majority,” he says, “didn’t want me to die.” Then you
should pronounce what they do want. I want to state their
verdict, recite it as prosecutor to these jurors,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_351_6" id="target_note_LCL501_351_6"><sup>6</sup></a> so that they
have something to go by. “Two,” he says, “sentence me to

from one part, now by dividing the group, which if
united would hurt you, you extinguish it.” Two pronounce
exile, two stigma, do you want me to unite those who divide

these dissent from those four, so those four are at odds
among themselves. So you cannot unite those who do not
vote the same. Compare those who do vote the same. I
have three who pronounce death. Bring forward those
who pronounce exile: I win. Bring forward those who pronounce
stigma: equally I win. Can it be doubted that the
stronger part is that which when compared yields to
