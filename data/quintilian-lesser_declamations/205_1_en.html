offer the inquisitive young man this part of her tired body.
It would have served him right if in trying to get someone
else’s patrimony he lost<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_417_2" id="target_note_LCL500_417_2"><sup>2</sup></a> his reward into the bargain. But
being quite guileless (if she were capable of lying, she
would not have exposed<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_417_3" id="target_note_LCL500_417_3"><sup>3</sup></a>), the woman openly declares she
won’t do it. That’s enough for modesty; if you make it an order,
the blame lies with those who force her. Meanwhile,
what does that young man gain? If her refusal is prejudicial,
<span class="italic">his</span> option also could be an argument.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_417_4" id="target_note_LCL500_417_4"><sup>4</sup></a> Because of

drew nearer. My relations gathered to me in my
pregnancy, offering consolation. This I suffered at the suasion
of my husband, who made me his heir. Who can recall
that day without tears? I bore a living corpse in my bosom.
How near he came to dying in my hands! Then the one who
had given the order perished. How near I came to being
able not to expose him! What do I want with this inheritance?
It made me miss my son even more.” Disbelieve her
words if she married later! She was missing that baby.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_417_6" id="target_note_LCL500_417_6"><sup>6</sup></a>
