before heard of: a stepmother is said to love her stepsons
too much.</p>
<p>“She drank a drug causing sterility.” If you didn’t have
children, I could still say that she feared the danger, was
upset by certain examples of women unfortunate in childbirth,
perhaps had a bad opinion of the times we live in—she
saw such loose living, such vices, that it was well-nigh
madness to bring up children. Moreover, do you think of
nothing in a wife except fecundity? “She does not produce
a child.” But she gives obedience, gives loyalty. But now it’s
time she be defended by arguments special to her case.
She drank that drug when you had three children. I am not
defending this straight away by love and affection: for the
present I shall say on her behalf that she was eager to
shine. She wanted to escape the stories about stepmothers,
wanted to prepare herself too against ill chances, wanted
to have nothing in her home to make her jealous of her
stepsons. What if she did it not only in the spirit of an excellent
stepmother but of an excellent wife? She had found a
full home, a full will. “What had I to do with childbearing?”
she says. “Fortune had given me sons; and my husband is
not of an age that he can form a desire for new children.
Nor would the laws of brotherhood have remained the
same [among persons so dissonant, so discordant].<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_125_4" id="target_note_LCL501_125_4"><sup>4</sup></a> But
now she is expelled, and because she was a good stepmother,
she will have neither children nor husband.</p>
