<p>The time of my stigma and the bill’s passing is &lt;not&gt; the
same. For my failure came by nature before the bill was
passed. For if I had succeeded, the bill would not have
been passed; since I failed, it was. So my stigma preceded
the time of the bill. People decided in their own minds not
to comply with my opposition before they passed the bill.

were counted, I had already failed. 〚The bill had not
been passed before the vote of the people had been numbered.〛<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_167_6" id="target_note_LCL500_167_6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

this timing did not remit the whole of the stigma, yet the

those two, which make up the greater part of the stigma,
