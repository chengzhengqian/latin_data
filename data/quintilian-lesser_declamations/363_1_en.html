<p>I wish to prove that I was swindled before proving that I
was swindled by that man. I made a covenant. This covenant
is not being observed, nor can it be reclaimed. I spent
money under the covenant; and I can neither reclaim the
money nor do I have what I spent it for. I took ship, I toiled
(so I put it for the time being),<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_261_2" id="target_note_LCL501_261_2"><sup>2</sup></a> because something was
promised me. What was promised cannot be delivered. It
is a swindle.</p>
<p>So far my case has gained a foundation. What follows is
to prove that I have been swindled by him and swindled
most shamefully. You perceive, gentlemen of the jury, the
swindler’s confidence: “Someone else raped, someone else

with which you transfer the charge to your son-in-law and
your daughter will do you no good. For if it becomes plain
to the jury that all was done at your will, who made the
promise, it will be clear that he who trusted you has been
swindled by you.</p>
<p>So I prove that from the start you favored the rich man,
not by suspicions, but by what is credible.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_261_5" id="target_note_LCL501_261_5"><sup>5</sup></a> When your
daughter was captured, what stipulation did you make?
That she would go to the one who redeemed her. You
chose a criterion between two suitors which the rich one
could more easily meet. In this you were disappointed. I
redeemed her, I brought her back. In what other way than
