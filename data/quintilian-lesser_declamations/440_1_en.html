her assess damages. A rape victim opted for marriage then

She came to court a popular<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_415_2" id="target_note_LCL501_415_2"><sup>2</sup></a> lady. We too did not put
up a fight to prevent her winning—we wanted to know at
what figure she would assess the dowry.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_415_3" id="target_note_LCL501_415_3"><sup>3</sup></a> The jury said:

trial, an enquiry, anything rather than a litigation. “Let her
assess,” says the law. What a familiar, everyday word! If a
