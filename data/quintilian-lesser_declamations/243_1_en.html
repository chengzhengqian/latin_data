seems to have the force of truth compelled. So what do I
have to look at but his utterance? If I had heard it only
once, still the law would thereupon call on me. He said it
often, kept on repeating the same words. We shall see later
whether he was mad in other contexts: here he kept on
track, like a sane man. Therefore I punished the confessed
offender, and I am not concerned as to whether the person
confessing was guilty. For imagine that somebody somehow
made a confession and was executed by the magistrate,
and that it later appeared through some accident that
what he had said was untrue: can the magistrate be prosecuted?
The law which requires that a confessed offender
be punished leaves the verdict to the person himself.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_21_3" id="target_note_LCL501_21_3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>However, let us come down to the question: since he
has confessed, was he also a parricide? And I do not have to
say what has been said by the prosecutor: grant that he had
his reasons for bringing the charge, that he had his witnesses,
that he had evidence (and I am sure you believe
that a man would not have been charged with so terrible a
crime if the prosecutor had not been very confident): for
me the nature of the acquittal is proof enough. He was acquitted
by equal votes. In another kind of case this leaves
doubt, but in a parricide, which no one wanted proved,
where it was a thing to pray for that the charge be false, it
declared something different. A human being is charged
with murdering his father, of slaughtering with his own
hand the one to whom he owed the light of day, these benefits
of natureâ€”and half the jury believed it. For my part I
applaud them, but I am not surprised at those who acquitted.
However, half the jury declared that parricide was
committed, half that it was unbelievable. One half was
swayed by the fact that it could be proved, the other by the
