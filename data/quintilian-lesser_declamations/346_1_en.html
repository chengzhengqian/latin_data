<p class="noindent">So far, it’s a search for the truth by which she hopes you are
defeated if she is truthful. But when you repeat the torments,
when you bring the torturer back, what else are you
saying but “torture her until she lies”? You won a great,
great victory, upon my word: you beat down an old woman.
As her spirit fled, its voice was forced out: “Mercy! he is not
yours. Spare me now: I have told the truth.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_227_22" id="target_note_LCL501_227_22"><sup>22</sup></a> At this point,
I believe, the torturer was admonished to press hard, not
to let up, to bring such skill to his work that the woman die
while she speaks, while you, joyous victor, report to your
adversary<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_227_23" id="target_note_LCL501_227_23"><sup>23</sup></a> what you had done. I ask you, since the same
woman said two different things under torture, is it not
clear that you preferred<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_227_24" id="target_note_LCL501_227_24"><sup>24</sup></a> the one you believed?</p>
<p>To whom on earth is this whole charade not obvious?
Who does not see stepmotherly tricks and the wretched
old man’s bargain? For I shall pity him, even though he
hurts: &lt;he hurts&gt; because he must.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_227_25" id="target_note_LCL501_227_25"><sup>25</sup></a> Do you ask how he
felt when he yielded? Just as when he drove the young
man’s mother from the house, dissolved long-standing
matrimonial harmony without any obloquy, any suspicion,
brought a new bride into a bed still warm with the print of
his former wife, did not even do so much for his son as let
himself lose the case.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_227_26" id="target_note_LCL501_227_26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>Evidently those whom a brief passage of pleasure made
parents, whom extraneous factors attach to their children,
are in a different case; after another fashion loves she who
has given birth, who brings to you, gentlemen, the memory
