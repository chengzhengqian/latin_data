<span class="italic">when</span> was he drowned? While the pirates were pulling in
or before? Don’t you know yet? Are you so unconcerned? I
don’t believe this from a mother.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_435_21" id="target_note_LCL501_435_21"><sup>21</sup></a> &lt;It was not before.&gt; For
why did none of the tutors see it? If one saw, why did he not
go to help the boy in trouble? Then while they were pulling
in?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_435_22" id="target_note_LCL501_435_22"><sup>22</sup></a> It must needs be that he then got out of the waves<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_435_23" id="target_note_LCL501_435_23"><sup>23</sup></a>
and himself too escaped the pirates. Or does the pirate pull
in and the sea devour the boy at the same time? I ask you: if
he was safe before the pirate’s arrival, did he die <span class="italic">at</span> his arrival?
She says: “So why did nobody hear him shout?”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_435_24a" id="target_note_LCL501_435_24a"><sup>24</sup></a>
First, the noise of the raging waves close by shut out the
lesser sound from the hearers’ ears; then in such a tumult
of fugitives it is not surprising that a voice went unheard.
Why was he thus unheard? Don’t, I beg, blame the unfortunate
boy for holding himself so cheap, for the fact that he
was left behind, abandoned. Why did you not hear him?
You had fled too far. “But after a few days a body was expelled.”
No wonder, when pirates are abroad. Do you really
think the seas can always be crossed in safety? I can say
that it was someone else’s body as easily as &lt;you&gt; can say it
was your son’s. The features were battered. Or rather, it is
<span class="italic">more</span> likely to have been a shipwrecked sailor’s (for the
coast is pleasant, without dangerous rocks); definitely so,
since you say it was expelled after a few days; but that body
was not expelled, but washed up after a long time.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_435_25" id="target_note_LCL501_435_25"><sup>25</sup></a> And
