<p>The outrageousness of the thing leads me on. You gave
poison to a traitor. If I had not already seized on another
charge, I should accuse him of poisoning: he prepared the
poison, had it by him, gave it. And first I should like to ask:
why did you get the poison,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_435_9" id="target_note_LCL500_435_9"><sup>9</sup></a> against what contingencies
did you prepare it? You had it by you as though you might
be tortured yourself. Come now, I am not yet setting on
you as a traitor, for the present I ask you in the magistrate’s
name: why did you break into the prison? With what punishments
will you be able to pay for this poison? A traitor
had a good death.</p>
<p>But let us come back to the charge. You gave him poison
although you knew we were going to suspect you. How
you must have feared his confession, that you preferred to
face this inference. “He was my friend,” he says. What are
you saying? Still a friend? A good father would not look on
him as a son. Earlier on you might have been forgiven,
when you didn’t know: do you still approve of the traitor?
He a friend? Where a traitor is concerned, this is not compassion.
He’s a cruel man who can pity a traitor. So you did
not do it out of your friendship’s compulsion: already you
were being told of his last words.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_435_10" id="target_note_LCL500_435_10"><sup>10</sup></a> Would you like to know
how<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_435_11" id="target_note_LCL500_435_11"><sup>11</sup></a> you did not do this out of friendship? You did not
give it so that he shouldn’t be tortured. You let him be tortured
&lt;a second time&gt;. It now mattered very little to <span class="italic">him</span>
whether he be tortured a third time. A good thing that
great crimes are laid open by the very means that seem to
