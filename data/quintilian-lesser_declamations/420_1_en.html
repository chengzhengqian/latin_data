he beats me again in your sight and, mutilated now and
crippled, whole only in his rage, he rushes at a poor old
man. What if he had hands? In case anybody should think
him subdued by the penalty, he has become even more audacious:
he sets his heart on crippling me and directs his
anger especially at that part of my body<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_375_2" id="target_note_LCL501_375_2"><sup>2</sup></a> through which
he is alive. I confess, gentlemen, yes I confess that these
hands should have been cut off—but when they took him
up! I am not ashamed, gentlemen, to be reviled (the least
to be expected from <span class="italic">him</span>) and even accused of cruelty. Let
him call me cruel by all means, so long as he shows himself:
I am not afraid that this charge against me may be found
credible when my adversary is himself a living memorial of
my compassion. That the parricide’s father is here does not

it was destined that the fellow should discharge a
parricide.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_375_5a" id="target_note_LCL501_375_5a"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>So, cruel that I am, gentlemen, whom he calls “the one
and only<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_375_6" id="target_note_LCL501_375_6"><sup>6</sup></a> executioner,” I approached him with a gentle
face, pitied him, in fine I, a stranger, took him up whom his
father had cast forth, and, not content, had him in place of
a son. Do you ask what I gained by my indulgence? The

that actually occurred, the declaimer assumes that the natural father
exposed his son because paranormal indications had revealed that he would commit parricide. His beating of his adoptive father
