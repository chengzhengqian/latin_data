We shall have to see whether they are partners after

<p>“Let the losses and gains of partners be in common.” Perhaps
it may seem superfluous to praise the law. For it is evident
that our very prudent ancestors and founders of this
community legislated wisely, and since the community has
used this law so long, it has already been approved. However,
the case demands that we look also at the equity of
the law, not so that you may give your verdict in better conscience
but to make it evident how unconscionably my
partner is behaving. “Let the losses and gains of partners
be in common.” It is a sacred thing, a sort of brotherhood
of amalgamated minds. For chance may make co-heirs,
but when two men have combined all their fortunes, mingled
all chances, a kind of unity is created. What is more
just than that a fortune put together be treated as a unity?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_63_7" id="target_note_LCL501_63_7"><sup>7</sup></a>
You see, therefore, that both losses and gains ought to be in
common; and nothing is unfair that applies to both parties.</p>
<p>The event separated us; but &lt;the law&gt; speaks of partners,
&lt;not of partners&gt; operating in the same place. In the
proper place I shall take credit for the fact that he was always
at home, merely the custodian of the money, whereas
I am the one who travelled through distant lands and regions
unknown, I the one who had gone so far away that I
could not return to our country. So under this law I demand
that the assets be either in common or divided.</p>
