her one-time lover, while her blinder wants her overmuch
avenged. If he did that out of remorse, he would somehow
or other deserve our consolation; for we might have suspected
that this was the reason for that demand when he
blinded a prostitute whom he loved; but that the present
offering of his eyes is done for ostentation.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_361_2" id="target_note_LCL500_361_2"><sup>2</sup></a> &lt;But&gt; he says
that it would not do for a hero to give his hand to a prostitute
for to show her the way. &lt;But&gt; it is evident that she has
been blinded.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_361_3" id="target_note_LCL500_361_3"><sup>3</sup></a> However, this is only humbug, gentlemen.
Anyhow, the reason for that demand is clear: he sees that
the poor woman cannot long be resolved to blind him<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_361_4" id="target_note_LCL500_361_4"><sup>4</sup></a> and
it is not his object to suffer the worst punishment, but to
suffer neither—to keep his eyes, which she didn’t want to
gouge out, &lt;and not&gt; serve as guide, since he refuses.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_361_5" id="target_note_LCL500_361_5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>However, we have to answer these proposals and in
dealing with this cheat to act as though he wanted to
be blinded. We too shall recall even those points which
he himself has made much of: that he was a hero, that he
fought for the commonwealth, that his hands and eyes
were of signal benefit to us. For all this, I suppose,
amounts to saying that it is not necessary for him to be
blinded. And that highly creditable military service did
