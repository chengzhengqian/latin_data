son’s slave. I cannot be accused of negligence in the torture.
I &lt;overdid&gt; it.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_131_5" id="target_note_LCL501_131_5"><sup>5</sup></a> And in this zeal no suspicion attaches
to my other son. He himself, the murder victim, only he
applied the torture.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_131_6" id="target_note_LCL501_131_6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>“What then,” he says, “did he confess &lt;under&gt; the torture?”
Hard indeed are the terms of this interrogation
when the question is such that any answer is disbelieved!
For, Mr prosecutor, do you wish what I say to be accepted?
Do you wish the jury to believe whatever I reply? For you
give me liberty to invent; I must lose credibility from the
very fact that I am free to say whatever I like. “In another
role,” I say, “as backer I shall do whatever I can for my son;
as for giving evidence, he will excuse me.” “But you did not
even tell your son himself.” What? Do you infer that I was
unwilling to say something that was against him? What reason
did I have for saying nothing if I thought my son was
the perpetrator, what reason for saying nothing to himself?
If I am angry, I can take my revenge with this utterance<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_131_7" id="target_note_LCL501_131_7"><sup>7</sup></a>
against him that I have; or if I want to take credit with him
for indulgence, I shall have done more for him if he knows
&lt;that I know&gt; he did it. So why did I not answer? I think I
have already given the jury the reason. For this is how I
pleaded the case:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_131_8" id="target_note_LCL501_131_8"><sup>8</sup></a> “I don’t answer an over-inquisitive son.
For why should it be absolutely necessary to tell? I don’t
answer because he is so pressing.” I added: “I make no answer
because I know nothing for certain. I don’t answer
because I don’t believe anything he<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_131_9" id="target_note_LCL501_131_9"><sup>9</sup></a> said. I don’t answer
