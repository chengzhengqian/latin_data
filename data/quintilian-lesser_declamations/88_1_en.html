<p>And one way or another, what you did might make some
sense, however rash, if you had erred through an impulse,
led on by anger. No aggression is more odious to me than
one which thrusts out because the doer thinks himself
licensed. This very action too deserves hatred without
doubt—to hound one perhaps unfortunate, certainly not
without shame since he let himself &lt;be beaten&gt;. Grant
that he deserved further punishment: don’t use your own
hands, your own passion—or at least leave him an opportunity
to display his impudence.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_183_6a" id="target_note_LCL500_183_6a"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

at your blows. You may even have disturbed public ritual
by some noisy brawling. For how should we think you did
the beating, when you thought you were doing something
legal?</p>

<p>Let it not be legal to go to law twice about the same matter.
In a certain community a man found guilty of treason was
sent into exile. When the same community was struggling
in a war, exiles were recalled. The man found guilty of treason
became a hero. He asks<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_183_1" id="target_note_LCL500_183_1"><sup>1</sup></a> to plead his case again. His
prosecutor enters a demurrer on the ground that it is illegal
to go to law twice about the same matter.</p>
