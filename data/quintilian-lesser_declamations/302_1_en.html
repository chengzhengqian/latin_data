because he put an end at last to these calamities; the law
was written for him! He that drafted the law, was not this
what he said? “It is not enough that a man who relieves the
commonwealth of slavery, &lt;removes&gt; these monstrosities
under which freedom labors, kills those born for the harming
of gods and men, formed to be an example of crimes to
make us hate them the more—that such a man be honored
only in his lifetime. Offices do not suffice, distinctions<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_139_4" id="target_note_LCL501_139_4"><sup>4</sup></a> are
not enough: let some honor be paid to his death as well, let
a tomb be displayed in the Forum to be an example to posterity,
so that no man dare to be a tyrant, that all know by
his memorials the rewards that arm tyrannicides against
tyrants.” Shall <span class="italic">he</span> now be thus honored as a good citizen, as
the liberator of this community? So it is, upon my word,
gentlemen, so it is: if the community had not had him,

exaggerate his work this wise: “He killed a tyrant, not an
ordinary tyrant, guilty of the name only. Let us lay on
something special for him. He killed a very cruel and savage
tyrant, the ravisher not only of chastity and our private
fortunes and of the leaders of this community, but of all
temples and ceremonies, not more hateful to men than to
the immortal gods.” These things are true, gentlemen, but
if we wished to give the liberators of our community their
true credit, the gods killed him.〛 For not content with
this quibble about the law, the advocates opposing me actually
say that he deserved well of the community by killing
