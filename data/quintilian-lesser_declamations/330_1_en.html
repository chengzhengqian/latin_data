home and killed my adulterous wife, &lt;and wounded her
lover,&gt; and later saw you wounded here in the house, I
asked who had wounded you. I deserve death; I smeared
you with adultery. We had fallen in with robbers: I asked
you who had wounded you! Not, my son, with malice but as
many things are let slip by people who have had a shock. I
was so frightened that I didn’t know what I was doing. Bad
folk take it otherwise. I am angry with my hands because I
only wounded the adulterer: no ill fame would have attached
to you if I had killed him. As it is, there seems to be
a fit between these two items—falsely, to be sure, but it
seems so. I wounded somebody, you were wounded. It
doesn’t help us that she was your stepmother. We can’t
even use the hatred<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_195_10" id="target_note_LCL501_195_10"><sup>10</sup></a> to rebut people’s unfairness. If I had
not cured you, it would now be thought that I had killed my
son. I cannot bear this ill fame. Your situation is different.
You have a long life ahead of you. You will be able to establish
your innocence, when you have taken a wife, when you
have given her marital loyalty, when the strictness of your
whole life will exonerate you. As for me, even if I decide
not to die, I shall die before I find the adulterer.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_195_11" id="target_note_LCL501_195_11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>Would you like me to add further reasons for dying? I
am angry with you. Can you not find that somebody? My
old age should be forgiven for that: <span class="italic">you</span> have not so much
as looked.</p>
