things to different people. If I had to speak only of
greed, I should say: “You set your mind on a will, a rich
man.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_77_13" id="target_note_LCL501_77_13"><sup>13</sup></a> As it is, you set your mind on a will, with nothing to
expect except what you acquired by crime. Come! Are you
starting to take your measure<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_77_14" id="target_note_LCL501_77_14"><sup>14</sup></a> and trample on the lengthy
patience of our family? Don’t you know what you were a
little time ago? Money flowing around you, those slaves
and everything you got by crime, shall it now enrich you?〛</p>
<p>I am said to have given the poison at my dinner. Immortal
gods! It would have looked better to plead that<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_77_15" id="target_note_LCL501_77_15"><sup>15</sup></a> for the
defense. Did somebody give poison at his hearth, amid the
sacred rites of the table, with the immortal gods<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_77_16" id="target_note_LCL501_77_16"><sup>16</sup></a> whom
we both<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_77_17" id="target_note_LCL501_77_17"><sup>17</sup></a> worshipped in their garlands, cheerful giver to
cheerful taker? Did not the very fact that it was not credited
block my attempts?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_77_18" id="target_note_LCL501_77_18"><sup>18</sup></a>Would someone have given poison
with the household standing around, servants present,
to befoul that dinner party of his right away with a dead
body? As austere antiquity had handed down to us, tables
placated hostile feelings and men who had clashed
with arms and armies yet reclined in security; the faith
of the banquet was their intermediary. So it would have
been seemly for innocence to be defended. But since I am
speaking as an evil man, a suspect, put aside for the present
my feelings, my brotherhood, my past life. I speak as of a
poisoner. What place, what time would have been less suitable
