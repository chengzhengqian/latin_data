kind of cruelty. You ask why? You will know when he tortures
her again. He had exhausted the first torments and
her honesty had held in a single saying. She had cast his
own blood in his teeth. The torturer was recalled, the tortures
repeated. It was made clear to the wretched woman
that she would be tortured so long as she said the same
thing. But I am not angry with her: so long as she had any
strength, any spirit, she stuck to it, was not forced into a lie
until she was dying. The victor in these torments thought
there was no need for further enquiry, had no doubts. In
the torments (to say the very least) I claim a draw for us.
But I ask you to take this as relevant only to his<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_221_14" id="target_note_LCL501_221_14"><sup>14</sup></a> case.</p>

So the entire burden of proof recoils on the other party. My
opponent must prove many things: that he had a wife, that
his wife conceived, gave birth, gave birth to a male child,
gave birth at a time which fits in with the age of the subject
of our litigation, that he exposed him, that so exposed he
lived, that he was picked up by the man<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_221_16" id="target_note_LCL501_221_16"><sup>16</sup></a> from whom he is
