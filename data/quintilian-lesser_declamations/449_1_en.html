<p>“The first heir,” she says, “is dead.” If I am not mistaken,
gentlemen, the controversy lies in this, whether the boy
was submerged in the waves or carried off by pirates. If I
show that he did not die, then presumably he was carried
off; if I show that he was carried off, I tell you that he is still
alive. If he is alive, surely he is the one the freedman
found, the claimant<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_433_16" id="target_note_LCL501_433_16"><sup>16</sup></a> vindicated, the judge sent back, the
grandmother took back. However, to follow my proposed
sequence:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_433_17" id="target_note_LCL501_433_17"><sup>17</sup></a> I deny that he died in the sea. The beach is
noted for its amenity. The sea that washes it never rises
high.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_433_18a" id="target_note_LCL501_433_18a"><sup>18</sup></a> The shore slopes down gently in an even spread,
gradually sinking as the water covers it. It tires the walker
in its long stretch before it fails him. Further, was the water
calm when you went out or rough? &lt;The former&gt; is more
plausible. We naturally choose pleasant days for these diversions,
&lt;we avoid&gt; the horrid crash of breakers and the
threatening aspect of a sea in turmoil. And you, living conveniently
close to the beach, would wait for the right time,
not snatch at it; your location allows you a fastidious choice
even of calm days. But granted that it might have pleased a
person to offer herself to unfavorable weather and raging
billows: even this isn’t dangerous. The aspect of advancing
surf and rising water alarms before it seizes.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_433_19" id="target_note_LCL501_433_19"><sup>19</sup></a> A pity you
were not brought out in such weather, boy! It would rather
have been you who left your mother behind.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_433_20" id="target_note_LCL501_433_20"><sup>20</sup></a> Finally,
