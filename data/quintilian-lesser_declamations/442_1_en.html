<h2>385</h2>
<span class="label">A man who gave a prostitute a love philter
prosecuted by her pimp</span>
<p>Let an action lie for loss caused by injury. A young man in
love with a slave-girl prostitute to whom he had given
many presents gave her a love philtre. The girl seemed to
be in love with the young man. Her pimp goes to court with
him for loss caused by injury.</p>
<span class="label"><span class="sc">declamation</span></span>
<p>If anyone looks at both sides, he will surely realize on
which side is the loss. For we cannot wonder enough at the
impudence of the pimp, who, not content to hawk the slave
girl in his brothel, hawks her in the Forum to find more
lovers. But if a love philtre has any power, I admit it,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_419_1" id="target_note_LCL501_419_1"><sup>1</sup></a> <span class="italic">he</span>
drank it.</p>
<span class="label"><span class="sc">discussion</span></span>
<p>Since it is necessary to set out the order of events, with a
persona of this sort &lt;an advocate is needed,&gt; who does not
have to blush.</p>

But how would this “color” work for the defense? The change to
<span class="italic">meae</span> appears to me unavoidable. The magistrate had ignored the
allegation of the prosecutor (father of the first victim sacrificed) that his daughter was no virgin and should not be in the lottery.
The gods by rejecting the sacrifice had confirmed it.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL501_419_3a').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL501_419_1"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL501_419_1" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">1</sup>Not “I declare.” To drink a love potion knowingly (cf. s.6 fin.)
