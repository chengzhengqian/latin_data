<h2>263</h2>
<span class="label">Under stigma against three bills</span>
<p>Let him who has opposed three bills unsuccessfully be
stigmatized. A man has opposed two bills. He failed. A
third bill was going through in which stigma was lifted
from those who had incurred it. He opposed this bill too;
he failed. He is declared under stigma.</p>

<p>“Let whoso shall oppose three bills unsuccessfully be stigmatized.”
The law is clear. Perhaps it is superfluous to
argue further, but give me leave. The law is just. Who deserves
a bigger stigma than a troublesome fellow who has
three times obstructed public utility, who could not be
forced into silence a third time at least even by fear of
stigma?</p>
<p>So there can be no doubt about the law. Let us see
whether he falls within its scope. He opposed three bills.
Am I mistaken about the number? Am I making any false
statement against him? I don’t think even he himself will
dare to say that. He had opposed twice and failed twice.
Most recently he spoke: we know he failed. So if the law
says that he who opposes three times unsuccessfully be
stigmatized and he has opposed three times and failed,
