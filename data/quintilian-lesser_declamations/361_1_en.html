as a free woman. I should be saying all this even if the pirates
had merely asked for her as a substitute; but as it is,
they added that you should send a substitute to marry the
pirate chief, so it cannot be doubted that you sent her as a
woman who would in future be free.</p>
<p>So much as to the law, now as to deserts. She is worthy
to be free: she gave you back your son. If she had only been
the price of your son, she would still be thought to have
deserved well. As it is, how much she added to make her
story believed! She could have stayed with the pirates and
obliged them by the favor of telling them the truth.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_257_11" id="target_note_LCL501_257_11"><sup>11</sup></a> But it
was not only by her acknowledgment that she was taken to
be your daughter: how she embraced the chained captive,
how often called him brother, how genuine were the tears
she shed! She had deserved very well of you by the very
fact that she returned.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_257_12" id="target_note_LCL501_257_12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>

<p>Here the honor of the father must be touched, sparingly to
be sure, but touched all the same as a covetous, greedy
man out for that inheritance; not bitterly though or with
the knife out, first because he can be her master if the jury
so decide, second because we are dealing with somebody
we thank, by whose will we say we were at liberty.</p>
<p>In the final part of the declamation we call in the young
man too, who was returned thanks to us.</p>
