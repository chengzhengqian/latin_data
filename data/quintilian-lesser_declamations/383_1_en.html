<p class="noindent">So it is not dementia. Nor does it concern the present trial
or your verdict whether I am a hard father, whether I am
too strict. That is not the question. It is enough that I am
not crazy.</p>
<p>“I don’t win your pardon,” he says, “when I have committed
rape.” Are you surprised? This is what made you do
it. You still don’t know what you have done. I don’t speak of
things which are relevant to our matter that may seem to
you of slighter importance: you stormed a house, and you
tore a virgin’s gown and you brought a girl into an injury
than which war holds nothing worse. Having brought yourself
into a danger such that you have to get your father’s
pardon, are you surprised that you did not get it straight
away? If you had fallen upon those born in happier times,
in which virtue was more a common good, he would not
have waited for the law, he would not have waited for the
thirtieth day.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_301_7" id="target_note_LCL501_301_7"><sup>7</sup></a> As it is, you are right to despise me; you once
saw me weeping. You would not dare to accuse your father
if you were afraid of him. Had you happened upon the father
who cut off his son’s laurelled head or the one who was
content with the judgments of relations and friends,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_301_8a" id="target_note_LCL501_301_8a"><sup>8</sup></a> I
imagine you would have had time<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_301_9" id="target_note_LCL501_301_9"><sup>9</sup></a> to complain, time, I
won’t say to prosecute your father, but to entreat him at
length! They were truly brave, heroes; remembering that
they had procreated children for the sake of the commonwealth,
they believed them well sacrificed for the example.
I am content to say nothing. When you ought to be winning
my pardon, you behave to me as though even if I give you
