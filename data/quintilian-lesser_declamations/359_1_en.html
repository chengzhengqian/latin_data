were sealed to have been cheated. Suppose he was taken as
arbiter between two persons and gave judgment, his master
so willing: it<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_253_5" id="target_note_LCL501_253_5"><sup>5</sup></a> wished him to be free, so that the matter
which had been judged should have a conclusion. In fine, it
wished that nobody who had been in some shape of liberty
should revert to slavery except by his own misdoing and
fault. The lawmaker thought that even persons who had
been at liberty <span class="italic">not</span> by will of their master, such as those
who had done something as free men in the absence of
their masters on behalf of the children, were at liberty and
for that reason “whoso shall be at liberty by will of his master”
was added to the law. Therefore a man can be at liberty
without<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_253_6" id="target_note_LCL501_253_6"><sup>6</sup></a> his master’s will, but without his master’s will he
cannot be free. It is one thing to be at liberty, another to be
free.</p>
<p>So I say that the woman in question was at liberty by
our will. How do I prove it? By the only way it can be
proven: she did something as though she was free. I don’t
yet say “she went to the pirates,” I say nothing either about
why you wanted her to be at liberty; meanwhile, she was
dressed as a lady with you so willing and looking on. That
was enough even if nothing had followed later. Or do we
think that your turning a slave around<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_253_7" id="target_note_LCL501_253_7"><sup>7</sup></a> or telling her in a
simple utterance to be free counts for more than your giving
her the get-up, giving her the robe—which does not
happen even to all who are manumitted.</p>
<p>(At this point the following is usually placed:)</p>
<p>“Well then, if I put her on the stage and she comes forward
as a woman of standing in a mime role, can she be
thought to be at liberty by my will?” Now this is not similar;
for the stage itself witnesses at once that this is a fictitious
situation. That robe will belong to the mime, not the
