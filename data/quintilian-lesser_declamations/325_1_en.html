weapons for villainy, by which the minds of jurymen could
be led astray.</p>
<p>He says: “But in the actual trial in which he was convicted
I was not his advocate.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_185_3" id="target_note_LCL501_185_3"><sup>3</sup></a> Meanwhile, I propose to
take the line that I did no harm to the commonwealth.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_185_4" id="target_note_LCL501_185_4"><sup>4</sup></a>
Even so, this is enough: you were a traitor’s advocate. Let
us suppose that the trial was adjourned and that he was the
advocate only in the first trial: would not conviction follow
on the ground that he had been advocate at all? So we
ought not to look at the time but at the case, if the man is
the same, if the charge is the same, if the law is the same.
Let us suppose he was convicted by somebody else. For
this that you put to your credit<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_185_5" id="target_note_LCL501_185_5"><sup>5</sup></a> will do you no good. For
then you would have said: “I didn’t know and I was misled
by the same thing that misled the jury.” As it is, you knowingly
defended a traitor.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_185_6" id="target_note_LCL501_185_6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>I say nothing about the advocacy;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_185_7" id="target_note_LCL501_185_7"><sup>7</sup></a>I have lost my witness.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_185_8" id="target_note_LCL501_185_8"><sup>8</sup></a>
Such greed for gain? That is how traitors are corrupted.
The guilty man talked to his advocate like this to be
sure: “Yes, I was a traitor but I got a great deal of money—enough
for you too.” Do you ask, gentlemen, how much he
promised his client? The traitor was unable to pay. So as far
as this man is concerned, the traitor is alive,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_185_9" id="target_note_LCL501_185_9"><sup>9</sup></a> and not only
alive but plotting and driven thereto by the need to pay;
you added need for money to the guilty man.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_185_10" id="target_note_LCL501_185_10"><sup>10</sup></a> Whence
