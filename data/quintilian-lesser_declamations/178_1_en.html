him harm. He was a champion of the community. At one
time he had expended part of his pleasure on it.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_363_6" id="target_note_LCL500_363_6"><sup>6</sup></a> But his
very valor made him more arrogant. All the same, we cannot
be persuaded as yet<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_363_7" id="target_note_LCL500_363_7"><sup>7</sup></a> that a hero, whose love was no
secret, who had not been in any way injured by the prostitute,
intentionally gouged out her eyes. We think that was
Fortune; and if the law permitted abstention from either
vengeance, perhaps we should waive our right entirely. As
it is, we save his eyes the way we can.</p>
<p>The text of the law says that one who has blinded another
should either suffer eye-for-eye or discharge the
function of guide. The question lies between these two.
Before comparing them, I want to ask for whose sake do
you think the law was written? Unquestionably it was written
for the woman<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_363_8" id="target_note_LCL500_363_8"><sup>8</sup></a> who is to be avenged. Neither will
there be any question but that the option between these
two penalties (so to term them) is in the power of the person
exacting. For what else do we suppose the lawgiver had
in mind? He believed that the person who did the blinding
should in any case be punished, so much so that he did not
allow even the person who was avenged to waive the whole
law. This then was in his mind: he that gouged out eyes has
deserved to lose his own. If, however, he has a compassionate
victim, if he happens on one who might to some extent
come to terms with his anger,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_363_9" id="target_note_LCL500_363_9"><sup>9</sup></a> let him repay the same later
on. So the woman who has suffered a most grievous injury
ought to choose the punishment. Suppose the one
you refuse is the harsher: perhaps you should suffer it for
