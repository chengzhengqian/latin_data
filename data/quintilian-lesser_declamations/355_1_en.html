<p>We hold possession of an article that has not been declared
    with us. We will see about the nature of this right later on.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_245_1" id="target_note_LCL501_245_1"><sup>1</sup></a>
What has not been declared with the customs officers is
held as confiscated. The article as to which you are passing
judgment was not put in declaration. By every legal right
of claim it belongs to us. He says: “It’s mine.” That counts
for nothing against our right; otherwise everybody could
say about an undeclared object: “It’s mine.” “But the person
who passed it through passed through somebody else’s
property.” To begin with, no law provides that it is permitted
not to declare somebody else’s property; otherwise the
public interest goes by the board. &lt;If&gt; the laws should be
changed to allow passage of other people’s property &lt;undeclared&gt;,
still he ought to have declared a <span class="italic">stolen</span> article.
“But it is unfair that I should be punished when he has
done wrong.” Again I say: if our law is in some way unfair,
we shall see about that later; meanwhile, it is the law. It was
written not with respect to persons but with respect to
property. If we had been given a law empowering us to
take something<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_245_2" id="target_note_LCL501_245_2"><sup>2</sup></a> from a person who had passed an &lt;object&gt;
not &lt;declared&gt;, even so our case would undoubtedly be
the stronger, but still the dispute would &lt;not&gt; appear to be
about the object itself. As it is, the law lays down that we
keep an object that has been passed through and has not
been declared. What difference does it make who has not
declared it? The article has been surrendered to us.</p>
