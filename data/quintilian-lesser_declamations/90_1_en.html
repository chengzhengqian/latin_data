prosecute and that &lt;I&gt;, the defendant, &lt;do&gt; not object: who
would then say that I must not be prosecuted a second
time? So what you would be free to do with my consent,
will be necessary when I opt for it.</p>
<span class="label"><span class="sc">discussion</span></span>
<p>When these questions have been scrutinized, we shall
come to equity. We shall say that this is for my good and for
the good of the commonwealth.</p>

<p>I opt that I plead my case again. Nor am I unaware how
many choices I pass by that would be legally conceded me.
But who, pray, would believe me innocent and worthy to
associate with you people if I opted for anything else? It is
for my good. For then too I was not defended only to let me
remain in the community, be with you, but to prove that I
was innocent and had not plotted against my country. Now
too it is not enough if you have pardoned me, if public necessity
has made me your fellow citizen. No, if I was rightfully
found guilty, if I did anything like the verdict against
me pronounced, I do not accept your boon.</p>
<p>Supposing it is not for my good: but it is for the sake of
the community. If a man found guilty of homicide has been
recalled, even though he deserved to be in exile, it can be
said of him that he has been penalized enough. Let other
crimes receive an end to their punishments: but will you
let a traitor be in your community when wars occur so
often (I am not talking about that extremity of peril<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_187_5" id="target_note_LCL500_187_5"><sup>5</sup></a>)? Is
any man worth it?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_187_6" id="target_note_LCL500_187_6"><sup>6</sup></a> Struggling with all your heart against
the enemy, will you not look over your shoulder, not take
fright? It is for the good of the commonwealth.</p>
