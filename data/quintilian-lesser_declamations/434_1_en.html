<p class="noindent">That way we shall be expelled even on the most trivial of
pretexts and lose our wills just at our touchy fathers’ whim.

you could have waived that sort of thing. What is the crime
deserving so drastic a punishment?</p>
<p>“You don’t tell me what you spoke about,” he says. Suppose
I don’t want to: it’s allowed. The magistrate doesn’t
require it of me, neither does the country. If you think I am
a traitor, charge me. Some things are secret, gentlemen,
and minds are free of parental commands.</p>

<span class="label">Rich man brought to trial for murder
by temple-robbing parasite<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_403_1" id="target_note_LCL501_403_1"><sup>1</sup></a></span>
<p>A poor man and a rich man were enemies. The rich man
one day killed the poor man along with his wife on a charge
of adultery and threw him into the street. Later on a parasite
whom he had dismissed, caught in temple-theft and
tortured under the law, said that the poor man had been
wrongfully killed by the rich man, whose enemy he was.
The rich man is accused of murder.</p>

<p>Standing trial for murder, what is said against me? Offensive
behavior, rascality, fraud? Even the poor man did not
accuse me of such things; and my past life could not be hidden
with such an enemy, so bitter, as you people say, that I
had to slaughter him with my own hand.</p>
