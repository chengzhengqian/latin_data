“when?” I suppose when the matter was in dispute, being
argued.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_443_5" id="target_note_LCL500_443_5"><sup>5</sup></a> And we are not concerned with what was last but
with what <span class="italic">is</span> last. If both wills were legal, that one would
have been last which was made after; but when that was
cancelled, the remaining one became the last—as in a
race, if the last runner falls out, the runner next the last
takes his name and place. So if we admit that my will was at
one time not the last, it is the last now, and you made it the
last will by getting invalidated the one made subsequently.</p>
<span class="label"><span class="sc">discussion</span></span>
<p>So much as to the words of the law, now as to its intention.</p>
<span class="label"><span class="sc">declamation</span></span>
<p>What do we suppose guided the law that wanted the last
will to be valid? Not more than one could be valid and in
the changeable nature of human minds a dispute awaiting
decision was being left to different heirs. It seemed best
that in each case the most recent wish should hold; but this
one being cancelled, the sole remaining one necessarily
holds. My friend made a legal will when he made me his
heir. For his judgment at that time was sound. That is why I
am not much embarrassed by his change of heir. Someone
else is read in a document that had no legal standing, that
was not drafted conformably to the law, that was perhaps
invalidated partly because the heir appeared unworthy.</p>

<p>In the final comparison I shall not object to your comparing
these kinsfolk with friendship.</p>
