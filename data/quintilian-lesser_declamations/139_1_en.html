<p>Before I come to consider the charge and the special sum
and substance of this trial, I must needs say what meets the
eyes of each one of you, gentlemen of the jury: a boy is disowned.
Do not judge him from the fact that he is a husband.
In that respect, my principal fear, gentlemen, is that
in your minds you may suspect him of impudence and
think that at his age he played the grown man too soon. The
father gave him a wife when he was not into puberty. So
what could anyone of his age do to deserve so severe a punishment?
The law on disowning was established against
the unruliness of young men. But the weakness we have
here is so far from allowing the name of guilty that it hardly
allows the name of innocent.</p>
<p>If, however, you are determined to disown him as
though he was a young man, I too have no alternative but
to defend him as though he was a young man. Do you then
wish me, gentlemen, to make the pleas commonly used on
behalf of children in pretty well all disownment trials: “I
have not lived loosely, I have not had an affair with a prostitute,
I have not wasted my father’s goods on vices”? But if I
put this forward, the answer will be (for it can only be):
“You did not kill the adulterers.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_285_1" id="target_note_LCL500_285_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Let me also speak as though on behalf of a husband.
You have no right to disown on account of this act that the
law permitted him. I am afraid that this defense of mine
may deserve to be laughed at: as though he had a choice!
But suppose he did. A husband may either kill an adulterer
or take money and let him go. You cannot be angry because
of something that the law permitted him. Let a husband
consult his own mind, consult his own feelings, the particular
nature of his mind. If it is lawful to disown for this,
then what the husband did is not lawful. From another
