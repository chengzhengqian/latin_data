the case,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_371_2" id="target_note_LCL501_371_2"><sup>2</sup></a> he did not opt but appeared for the defendant at
the trial. The father is acquitted and disowns his son.</p>
<span class="label"><span class="sc">declamation</span></span>
<p>What have I done wrong to be disowned? Am I a coward
toward my country? Devoted to loose living, do I shirk
fighting? Am I unfilial toward my father? I think so.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_371_3" id="target_note_LCL501_371_3"><sup>3</sup></a>
Where do I fail in filial duty? He says, “You did not opt for
what I wanted.” Now you are going beyond your law.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_371_4" id="target_note_LCL501_371_4"><sup>4</sup></a> As a
father you ought to dictate to your son, but you can’t dictate
to a hero. Travel, yes; military service, yes; but not his
vote to a juror, his decrees to a magistrate, his reward to a
hero. For what does the law say? “Let a hero opt.” It names
me and it is right that this be mine. I fought.</p>
<p>Who is my adversary? My father. I must not strike a
note of defiance. On the contrary, I even leave to you the
hero’s option, provided you ask something fair. What did
you ask? That I opt for suppression. Remember, father,
that we<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_371_5" id="target_note_LCL501_371_5"><sup>5</sup></a> cannot ask for everything: we are given a reward,
not a monarchy. You don’t know how much it means to ask
for a suppression. To muzzle a prosecutor, exempt a defendant,
annul the laws. I would not have carried the point for
you and I would have wasted the reward. But suppression
for whom? “For me,” he says. Gentlemen, you observe in
some sort a man charged with parricide.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_371_6a" id="target_note_LCL501_371_6a"><sup>6</sup></a> I would rather
plead my case in court.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_371_7" id="target_note_LCL501_371_7"><sup>7</sup></a> This reward is disgraceful in the
first place and in the second superfluous. Disgraceful: you
