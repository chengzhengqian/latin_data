from enemies, or possessions squandered in
loose living and vices inappropriate to his age? Our house
lies open to this charge, if you change the defendant. Or is
it laziness you bring against me? I don’t feel the war, I don’t
understand the meaning of “enemy,” I don’t support the
country. He says: “You don’t opt for the reward.” Suppose I
can’t explain: dementia is not a matter of a single charge.
Even if this argued dementia, it is feeble because it is isolated.
〚Further, dementia is never caught in a single item.〛
Make other criticisms. But what if even this one cannot
hold? Do you call generosity dementia? It’s not in your interest,
young man, to introduce such a law. “You don’t opt.”
Come, is anybody who is not greedy demented? Characters
differ. Suppose I don’t want to opt, have no desire for
the reward. I don’t find anything to opt for; further, I don’t
want to burden my country, afflicted as she is by war; further,
good deeds should be gratuitous; further, my reward
is to see the people in my debt. I am allowed to defer. You
will allow that, even for your own sake: I opt for a wife for
you, honors.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_359_2" id="target_note_LCL501_359_2"><sup>2</sup></a> “Opt right now,” he says. Well, if I do, am I
sane? Behold a charge that can be squashed right away!
What do you want me to opt for? Statues? He frowns. Holidays?
He gets angry. Money? Well, if that’s what you want,
why were you not a hero? Go into battle. Or did I fight for
your sake? If you insist on soldiering in court rather than in
combat, I opt for annulment. Away with the trial!</p>
