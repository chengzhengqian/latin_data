<h2>343</h2>
<span class="label">Swindler of a poor man, father-in-law of a rich rapist</span>
<span class="label"><span class="sc">declamation</span></span>
<p>Let there be an action for swindling. A poor man and a rich
man were courting the same girl. She they were courting
was taken captive. The father made a stipulation to the
suitors, that she would go to the one who redeemed her.
The poor man set out and redeemed the virgin. His rich rival
raped her. Brought before the magistrates, she opted
for marriage. The father is accused of swindling by the
poor man.</p>
<span class="label"><span class="sc">discussion</span></span>
<p>We do not have to be concerned so much to prove that the
young man has been swindled as to prove that he has been
swindled by the father. For it is clear that he who redeemed
and brought her home, especially as he did so under
a covenant, has a legitimate complaint. From the other
side the persona of the defendant is eliminated: “That he
did not marry her was not the father’s doing: the rich man
raped, the girl opted, the father only promised.” How then
shall it be established that he was the swindler? If he<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_259_1" id="target_note_LCL501_259_1"><sup>1</sup></a>
proves that everything was done by his will. Otherwise, if
this is not granted us, we shall whine to the jury in vain.</p>
