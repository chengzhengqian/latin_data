seems to me not without foundation: they believe that
these Furies do not come from outside and that this dementia
has not befallen mortals by any impulse of the gods
but is born within; it is conscience that torments, the mind
that burns. Again I congratulate: well it is that, even if we
elude everyone else, we cannot escape ourselves. I challenge
you people, say it: “He was out of his mind when he
confessed.” But <span class="italic">I</span> think he was out of his mind when he
killed. So whatever sort of madness that was, it would seem
to have been either a punishment ordained by the immortal
gods or the confession of a guilty spirit. But let us look at
the manner of his madness. If he had jumped over a precipice,
I should say: “Some god drives him.” If he attacked
people who came in his way, I should say: “Matter for retribution
is sought.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_25_7" id="target_note_LCL501_25_7"><sup>7</sup></a> As it is, there is one and the same utterance

lunatics. “I killed you, father.” &lt;Don’t ask for more.&gt; A
confession so often repeated is lengthy.</p>
<p>Can you imagine the picture that made him do this? His
father no doubt was standing before his eyes, torn and still
bleeding, he was showing his vitals poured out. That whole
place was before his eyes, the whole crime scanned in
mind and thought. 〚It cannot be that he be thought out of
