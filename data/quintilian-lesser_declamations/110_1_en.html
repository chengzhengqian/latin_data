concocted by me for the occasion, because of my present danger,
is clear from the very fact that I killed the rapist in
another way; for if cause of death meant what they wish it
to be thought to mean, I could have avenged myself by this
law.</p>
<p>I know, gentlemen, that I have been dwelling all this
while on legalities and have gone back a long way from my
feelings as a father. So did I do nothing but what was legal
to avenge my daughter? Did I go to the magistrates, did I
command the girl to say the bolder thing<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_227_7" id="target_note_LCL500_227_7"><sup>7</sup></a> because it was
safe? No, I will come out with all my feelings: at that point
the law was not in my thoughts, I had no regard for legalities,
but went by the nearest way to avenge my unhappy
daughter that offered and followed it. It was lucky that it
was my right. Come, if I had not had someone to bring before
the magistrates by whose substitution I could avenge
myself, should I not have done so in public, in the Forum,
with these aged hands? Fortune, you will do what comes;
you cannot now make me sorry. I lost a daughter. I know
that this is the least of my misfortunes. Some hold that to
lose only sons is the worst, and since<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_227_8" id="target_note_LCL500_227_8"><sup>8</sup></a> they can look to no
solace of their calamity, their grief seems to have no medicine.
But this is worse, gentlemen, to lose one of twin
daughters. Every day the image of my bereavement comes
before me. The more my daughterâ€™s modesty and goodness
please me, the more powerfully the thoughts come upon
me: alas, such was she I lost. But if Fortune had brought
this stroke upon me, or chance, I should console &lt;myself&gt;
with the common condition of humanity. As it is, how, alas,
did I lose my daughter? To begin with, she was neither virgin
nor married. Wretch that I am, how bruised and torn<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_227_9" id="target_note_LCL500_227_9"><sup>9</sup></a>
