that very reason. You gouged a little woman’s eyes out, no
doubt about that, and add, if you will, a prostitute’s: all the
same, you were not entitled to gouge them. You do not deserve
to suffer the punishment of your choice.</p>
<p>This is what I should say if I were contending with you
harshly. As it is, first and foremost I am arguing with you
for the sake of the commonwealth. It is fair that these eyes
be safe and unharmed. Chance brings many things, war is
frequent. I shall now also reveal to you this little woman’s
feelings, to make you the more sorry for having done such
a dreadful thing. She could not blind you. She remembers
times gone by, remembers the pleasures she once had in
common with you, remembers your love. She deserves
that you lend her a hand. For this too the law laid down
most justly: let him that gouged eyes provide them, and
himself take the place of the organs he gouged. “But it’s

the gods? This deformity will not be as it would have been
if you had suffered it in battle. You refuse to be a prostitute’s
guide, but doesn’t it occur to you that your eyes will
be gouged out because of a prostitute? But this very shame
of yours deserves that we spare your eyes.</p>
