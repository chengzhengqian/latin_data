<p>“But I hired you,” says he. Suppose you did. I imagine
you hired me to be a tyrannicide as though you had hired
me to be a gladiator or an actor.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_413_2" id="target_note_LCL501_413_2"><sup>2</sup></a> If you had hired me to kill
a man, I suppose I too would be held responsible.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_413_3" id="target_note_LCL501_413_3"><sup>3</sup></a> “You
did not slay the tyrant of your own accord.” That can be
said to everyone: one man was fired by his sister’s rape, another
by his wife’s dishonor. Come, if you had encouraged
such to slay the tyrant, would you be claiming the reward?
But do you think I slew the tyrant for your price? Do you

I thought it was a trap and that you were put up by
the tyrant.</p>
<p>“What then? Will you take two rewards?” That’s why I
am a tyrannicide.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_413_5" id="target_note_LCL501_413_5"><sup>5</sup></a> You too already have your reward: your
property, your children, the tyrant’s death that you desired.</p>
