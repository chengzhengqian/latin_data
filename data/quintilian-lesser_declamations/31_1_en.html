<h2>252</h2>
<span class="label">The parasite who raped a candidate</span>
<p>Let an action lie for unwritten wrongdoing. Let the rapist
pay ten thousand. The daughters of a poor man and a rich
man were candidates for a priesthood. Rumor had it that
the poor man’s daughter would be elected priestess. The
rich man’s parasite raped her. He paid the ten &lt;thousand&gt;,
given him by the rich man, according to the law. The poor
man accuses the rich man of unwritten wrongdoing.</p>
<span class="label"><span class="sc">discussion</span></span>
<p>Most controversies under this law have two questions,
drawn from its actual words: is the alleged offense unwritten
and is it wrongdoing? &lt;But&gt; as I have often said, not
always both: for as a rule,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_69_1" id="target_note_LCL500_69_1"><sup>1</sup></a> when “unwritten” is established,
there is apt to be question about wrongdoing; whereas if
there is agreement about wrongdoing, the controversy is
about whether it is unwritten. A third question also must
be added in this controversy: whether it is <span class="italic">his</span> wrongdoing.
But in return for this, the middle question is eliminated.
For there can be no question as to whether it is wrongdoing;
for it is not in the Nature of Things for any mortal to
deny that something for which he claims a penalty was
paid was a wrongdoing. So we shall ask whether it is unwritten
and whether the wrongdoing is his.</p>
