temples. What if your claim is against the law? You have
now opted for one man’s life three times. I have compared
the public personae. Now let us compare &lt;the private&gt;.
You never opt except at someone else’s expense, I opt at
mine.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_403_4" id="target_note_LCL500_403_4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>And yet what do I care about the law, if only that perpetrator
of adultery and sacrilege comes to my home? He
shall know how much better a father he has than an enemy.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_403_5" id="target_note_LCL500_403_5"><sup>5</sup></a> Squire, give me a sword! I shall avenge that husband,
I shall avenge the temple. I have a hero’s law and a father’s.
I had an innocent son before this man became priest. Temples
were robbed for the first time under him. I used to
think that my young man’s behavior was madness: it was
confidence.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_403_6" id="target_note_LCL500_403_6"><sup>6</sup></a> Gentlemen, tending temples is much, but
protecting one’s own temples and burning the enemy’s is
more. For if your prayers do any good,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_403_7" id="target_note_LCL500_403_7"><sup>7</sup></a> why did your
protégé desert? The reward that I shall ask is my due. I can
even ask for your death, I can deprive you of the priesthood.</p>

<h2>305</h2>
<span class="label">Exiles forced to fight each other by rich man</span>
<p>Let it be lawful to kill an exile caught inside the borders. A
rich man caught two poor men, enemies of his, who had
been sentenced to five-year exile for involuntary homicide,
inside the borders and compelled them to fight each other,
giving them swords. Both died. He is accused of improper
punishment.</p>
