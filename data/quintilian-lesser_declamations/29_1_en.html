<span class="label">A barren rape-victim divorced</span>
<p>Let there be a license to divorce a wife who has not given
birth within five years. Let an action lie for unjust divorce.
A man divorced his wife whom he had taken after raping
her in accordance with option, not having given birth
within five years. She prosecutes for unjust divorce.</p>
<span class="label"><span class="sc">declamation</span></span>
<p>I accuse of unjust divorce. I do not believe anyone will be
so far estranged from good morals as to doubt that it was
unjustly done that a woman who had made him the greatest
of benefactions did not keep with her husband even
what she gave.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_65_1" id="target_note_LCL500_65_1"><sup>1</sup></a> So she resists the quibble,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_65_2a" id="target_note_LCL500_65_2a"><sup>2</sup></a> and denies that
the divorce which her husband has carried out with some
juridical support is just. For my part I do not adopt<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_65_3" id="target_note_LCL500_65_3"><sup>3</sup></a> the
interpretation of that word<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_65_4" id="target_note_LCL500_65_4"><sup>4</sup></a> which makes it refer to legalities,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_65_5" id="target_note_LCL500_65_5"><sup>5</sup></a> but I think our business is to look at justice. For an
unjust divorce is one that is contrary to justice.</p>
<p>All the same, if we were asked to consider those legalities,
nothing will apply to this lady. Let those perhaps enjoy
