<span class="label">Suit concerning the son of an exposer and a divorcée</span>
<p>A certain person divorced his wife, by whom he had or
was thought to have a youthful son, and married another
woman. There were frequent fights between stepson and

Furthermore, both aim at the same result, to
conciliate the judge. They differ thus: the job of proems is
to get the judge’s attention (the epilogue is let off this part

who has claimed paternity of the son. The son has been ceded to
him by the natural father (Father I) at the urging of his present wife, so the mother’s advocate contends, their motive being to get
