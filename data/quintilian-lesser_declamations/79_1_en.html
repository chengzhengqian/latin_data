nothing but a restitution of persons under stigma to their
original status. You were not yet in case to be restituted.
“But,” you say, “I became liable to stigma at the same time
as it was lifted.” Later on I shall speak of how thoroughly
you deserve that stigma; meanwhile I exclude you from
this calculation of time.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_165_3" id="target_note_LCL500_165_3"><sup>3</sup></a> For although the bill that you opposed
for the third time<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_165_4" id="target_note_LCL500_165_4"><sup>4</sup></a> was passed, it was passed before
you fell under stigma. For what says the law? “Let whoso
shall oppose a bill three times unsuccessfully be stigmatized.”
It speaks of time passed and perfect and already
spent. When the bill was in progress, you were opposing:
you were not yet under stigma, for it was not yet a bill. But
when the bill was passed, <span class="italic">then</span> you came under stigma
because you had failed.</p>
<p>I think I should add that no one ever deserved stigma
more than you. For we’ll see what sort of bills they were
that you previously opposed. Useful, certainly; for they
were passed and approved in the interest of the commonwealth.
Someone actually opposes this bill: so compassionate
a bill, so merciful, one that increases the number of
citizens! If anyone else had opposed, it would have been an
act of inhumanity. But <span class="italic">you</span> oppose restitution of persons
under stigma, you, a man in danger of it! Therefore you deserve
to suffer what you wanted everyone to suffer. Or do
we perhaps understand that this bill was passed as enacting
that nobodysoever in our community ever be under
stigma? But &lt;if&gt; that was what the people or the mover
wanted, he would rather have abrogated the existing law
