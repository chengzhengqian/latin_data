love of the enemy has driven into this betrayal. If there can
be no manner of similarity here in the view of any decent
man, we shall now see how she fell into the enemy’s hands
and under how great a compulsion she confessed. And
it would have been enough to say this first: she sent her
son into battle, her child and blood stood in battle, holding
nothing dearer than his country, as he strove to repel
the enemy by his courage or his blood, or finally to hold
them up with his very body, lost his life fighting for us, so
trained we may be sure, so taken leave of by his mother.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_241_5" id="target_note_LCL500_241_5"><sup>5</sup></a> Is
it fair that she be accused, a woman whom we cannot pity
enough? She went out by night. Who wonders at this emotion
in a mother, as though it was a novelty? But I will confess
more, things worthy perhaps of outright admiration.
She was not afraid of that night and darkness, she endured
the horrid spectacle of the very battlefield. Through human
blood and broken weapons and mingled bodies of
men and horses she sought her son and, lest it seem that
she fell into the enemy’s hands through absolutely no fault
of her own,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_241_6" id="target_note_LCL500_241_6"><sup>6</sup></a> she wailed and called upon the gods. I think
nobody so far is angry at her misfortunes. The rest cannot
be laid to her account. She confessed to the enemies—I
won’t say under torture: enough to say, a woman. Upon my
word, if at first the threats only, the fear of a recently victorious
army, had confounded her, a woman bereaved and
stupefied by her calamities, the thing would still have merited
forgiveness: but she confessed under torture. Where
will you find such strength of soul, so firm and solid a mind,
