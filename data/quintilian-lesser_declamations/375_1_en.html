<p>“Let no action lie against a father except for dementia.” It
is clear that I am being prosecuted on another charge. Nobody
will doubt that that is impermissible under this law, if
I am his father. And yet it also cannot be doubted that I <span class="italic">am</span>
his father. Or do you deny that it is I who begot you and
raised you, and (to bring an argument from the very fact
that is advanced against me)<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_285_1" id="target_note_LCL501_285_1"><sup>1</sup></a> that it is I who gave you into
adoption? If all this is not solid enough, read the will under
which you received your guardian. It gave your father as
your guardian. “Ah, but by the giving into adoption all
rights were transferred.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_285_2" id="target_note_LCL501_285_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<h2>347</h2>
<span class="label">In husband’s absence, rumor and wedding</span>
<p>Let it be lawful to kill an adulterer along with the adulteress.
A wife learned by rumor of the death of her husband,
who was abroad. Found to be his heir, she married a young
man and gave her house as dowry. The husband came
along at night and killed them both. He is charged with
homicide.</p>
<span class="label"><span class="sc">declamation</span></span>
<p>It is agreed that the adulterous couple were in matrimony;
no one denies it. Now matrimony cannot be legitimate
unless any prior marriage is dissolved. Matrimony is dissolved
in two ways, either by divorce or by the death of one
or the other. I did not divorce her and I am certainly alive.
So my marriage was still in being; theirs was illegitimate.</p>
