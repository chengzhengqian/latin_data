<h2>247</h2>
<span class="label">The property of a rich rapist</span>
<p>Let the wife get her husband’s property. A rich young man
committed rape. Before the girl made her option,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_27_1" id="target_note_LCL500_27_1"><sup>1</sup></a> he sent
his relatives to her to ask her to marry him. After hearing
their pleas, she wept in silence. The young man stabbed
himself. Before he died, she opted for marriage. The relatives
and the wife claim the property.</p>
<span class="label"><span class="sc">discussion</span></span>
<p>I have to show you the way. See what each side wants, what
each side says, and wrap it up as briefly and meaningfully
as can be done. Suppose the girl says: “I am his wife, for I
opted for marriage. By so opting I immediately started to
have him as my husband. For he was bound to be my husband
if he lived, and marriage does not happen by time but
by status.” The other side says: “You were not his wife. You
did not settle down with him. True, you were handed over
to him by your option, but he passed away immediately
after the word was spoken.” This must be wrapped up by a
definition: “a wife is a woman placed with a man through a
wedding who comes to share his life.” What does <span class="italic">she</span> say?
“A wife is a woman who has entered into matrimony with a
man.”</p>
<p>A definition is sometimes said to be false, sometimes incomplete.
We cannot say that the opposition’s definition is
false or incomplete, and we ought not to spend time in subverting
