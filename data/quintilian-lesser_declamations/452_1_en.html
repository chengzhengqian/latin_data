of character. Doesn’t his father’s freedman<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_439_32" id="target_note_LCL501_439_32"><sup>32</sup></a> recognize
him?—I am getting to the bottom of the case step by step.
We make freedmen of honest slaves. We get our family
by hap, we don’t choose them and we’re not at our own
disposal before we exist. Perhaps it’s a greater thing to
<span class="italic">make</span> one’s family.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_439_33" id="target_note_LCL501_439_33"><sup>33</sup></a> He is the freedman of your husband,
madam, of whose will you are so proud. The man who put
you down as alternate heir also made him free of your
son.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_439_34" id="target_note_LCL501_439_34"><sup>34</sup></a> What he gave you, he took from nobody: what he
gave him he took away even from his son. And it is easier
to please a husband than a master. “But he is lying for his
own sake.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_439_35" id="target_note_LCL501_439_35"><sup>35</sup></a> He recognizes his patron. Freed, he imposes
slavery<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_439_36a" id="target_note_LCL501_439_36a"><sup>36</sup></a> on himself. “To him,” says he, “I owe my hands,
my services, my will.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_439_37" id="target_note_LCL501_439_37"><sup>37</sup></a>” They generally buy their freedom
at a high price.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_439_38" id="target_note_LCL501_439_38"><sup>38</sup></a> “He was in collusion with the grandmother,”
she says. Good for you! In trying to overturn our
witness, you have given us another. “It was arranged between
them,” she says. Prove it. &lt;What&gt; did they hope to
achieve by the lie?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_439_39" id="target_note_LCL501_439_39"><sup>39</sup></a> What could they have said to one another?
“My grandson was drowned and has been buried.
But you, go along and bring some boy from the market, I’ll
recognize him.” It’s done: are they not afraid of being
found out? Not all the features were battered. If she hates
you, let her rather accuse<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_439_40" id="target_note_LCL501_439_40"><sup>40</sup></a> the will of dementia, say it
