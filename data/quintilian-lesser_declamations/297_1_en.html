enemy was a motive for killing; for not killing, the fact that
he was a brother, that he would be risking his own life, that
innocence in itself has sufficiently good reasons.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_129_4" id="target_note_LCL501_129_4"><sup>4</sup></a> So it does
not follow straightway that if one man has been stirred
up by some hostility toward another, he will also attack
him with steel. Is it not admissible that feuds are carried
on innocently even between nonrelatives, even between
persons unconnected? We see the Forum loud with daily
brawls, we see disputes all the time. What day but brings
shouting matches and insults? Crime arises from the nature
of a man’s mind, but my son had an additional reason
for keeping clear of crime—his quarrel with his brother
was no secret. Crimes of this sort are cautious and circumspect,
for no one is so abandoned, so self-injurious, that he
commits them without the intention of denying them. And

prosecutor has made so much, that he was killed in his bedroom,
in his bed! The last thing an assassin would do is to
let that be brought against him. Brigands do their robbing
far away from their lairs. It is said to be the nature of some
wild beasts to find their prey far from their dens. Does any
man kill a brother with whom he is at odds in the house, in
the bedroom, expecting to deny it?</p>

not carry much weight. * For I had no reason to torture the
slave if I thought my son had done it. So stop using this

being defended. I tortured the slave. Everyone knows this
happens to one who tells nothing. I tortured the slave, the
victim’s valet. I suspected nothing in the case of my other
