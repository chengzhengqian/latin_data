you had asked for the trial to be quashed.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_347_3" id="target_note_LCL500_347_3"><sup>3</sup></a> As it is, you are
claiming two rewards, not to stand trial and to kill a man.</p>
<p>So immediate killing is not necessarily involved in the
reward, and whenever no time is previously defined it begins
to be at the discretion of the granter; if you are asking
that the trial be quashed, that is a second reward. And what
sort of trial is it that you want quashed? We are not talking
about a private ruling, not about a dispute over money
(though even then I should put in a word for the laws and
judicial custom): you are asking not to be put on trial. It affects
the commonwealth in the highest degree. I say that
the people were betrayed, that a time was fixed. All you
have to do is to deny the charge. If you are in such a hurry,
the case could have been already conducted before these
gentlemen here, a verdict could have been pronounced in
this same period in which we stand adjourned. You have
nothing to be afraid of if you are innocent. And there is a
big additional factor working for you: you became a hero.
A new source of favor comes your way over and above the
power of your wealth. You could not have more effectively
tested how much favor your soldiering was for you: you
were able to get your opponent’s death. How comes it that
you don’t think your own life can be granted you by the
same favor?</p>

<p>In the final section this prosecutor speaks almost angrily.
He keeps putting in “if you gentlemen wish, if it is in your
interest; what does it matter to me? I am going to die.”</p>
