that communities have been turned upside down by orators.
If we care to look at the Athenian community, once
preeminent far and wide, we shall find that its strength was
crippled through the fault of public speakers. Or if we wish
to examine the status of the Roman People, were not the
worst seditions, the most turbulent assemblies, the work of
the most eloquent among them? Girt with these arms, as it
were, did not those Gracchi advance to the overthrow
of the commonwealth? Why tell of damage done by eloquence
to the community? It has harmed itself. Let us look
at the greatest orators in both areas. Do we not know that
Demosthenes was destroyed by his own poison and that
Cicero was exposed by his punishment<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_205_15" id="target_note_LCL500_205_15"><sup>15</sup></a> on the Rostra
where he had so often found favor?</p>
<p>What I have said would have been enough. If those
with whom I have contended bring nothing useful to the
community, it would have been enough that I alone am
left. However, I shall say something about medicine, not,
I assure you, to cry myself up but to commend the art
itself. We are told that its original authors were gods,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_205_16" id="target_note_LCL500_205_16"><sup>16</sup></a>

that mankind’s infirmity should have some succor and solace,
or whether our ancestors valued this art so much that
they could hardly believe that it was discovered by mortal
minds, or whether medicine itself is in itself a sacred thing.
Let us by all means be contending before the secure: but if
a sudden sickness lay hold of one of you (far be it from you
all!), will he consult an orator? Why should I now enumerate
how many of Fortune’s injuries medicine is called in to
combat—the sickness that breaks the breath, or that
