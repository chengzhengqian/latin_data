<p>“But this helped the enemy.” If I acted in order to help
the enemy, then certainly let me be tied to your law. But if,
when I did something for the entire commonwealth, it was
also of advantage to the enemy, I do not think we should
have competed in losses.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_97_10" id="target_note_LCL501_97_10"><sup>10</sup></a> Let us then consider whether
this was in the interest of the commonwealth. I am not saying
at this point what would have followed if I had not
done the dedication; meanwhile, I speak with your piety,
Athenians. I see a temple on our borders, not that ancient
one, that temple of the most present sanctity from
which our whole community derives authority, but a new
one, yet untried. I see it on our borders. It needs to be dedicated.
Such structures are mere buildings until they receive
their final authority of dedication. It is the dedication
that brings in the god, places him on his chosen seat. That
is why not just anyone is allowed to perform it; his hands
must be clean, his mind conversant with sacred things. The
dedication, as we have now learned,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_97_11" id="target_note_LCL501_97_11"><sup>11</sup></a> was permitted only
to the Athenians. 〚For my part I would believe that a divinity
is present in all our religious institutions.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_97_12a" id="target_note_LCL501_97_12a"><sup>12</sup></a> Hence I suppose
it comes, gentlemen, that we have often seen temples
of other communities, located in the cities themselves, collapse
and burn along with all their buildings, with no ensuing
vengeance, no religious sanction, no punishment of
the doers, whereas here the sacrilege was avenged by a
plague.〛 He<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_97_13" id="target_note_LCL501_97_13"><sup>13</sup></a> was purposing dedication; for he had reckoned
that otherwise it would not even be a temple unless it
was dedicated. I speak of any temple: shall I not dedicate
