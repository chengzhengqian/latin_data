<p class="noindent">Suppose someone had chosen to accuse you of poisoning
at that juncture (when to be sure there was too much else
to do): if he had produced my body, which could not be
aroused—I won’t say by the moving of it and the lamentation
of the household but by the hubbub of war and the
noise of signals and the commotion of the whole community,
would you have guaranteed that I would live?</p>
<p>I have shown that poisoning is proved by the expertise
and by the risk. I also want to speak of intent. To whom did
you give that poison? When did you give it? You gave it to
your stepson. If you had given it at another time, I should
think you were disappointed. As it is, you thought up a poison
that would kill me legally.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_23_5" id="target_note_LCL500_23_5"><sup>5</sup></a> For my part, if you ask me, I
don’t think I was alive at that time. For what &lt;was&gt; I, in
heaven’s name? Or in what part of nature did my stepmother
locate me? News of the war reached me, and I, a
man whom no foreign travel detained nor any absence
kept from the community’s peril—&lt;sleep bound me fast&gt;.
My comrades in arms told me what happened while I remained
within the walls. There was a tremendous battle, it
is said, fighting joined on both sides, victory often in doubt,
hope swinging to and fro: and all the while the warrior in
whom most trust was placed, who was thought most likely
to sway the issue, is reported as nowhere to be seen. What
greater advantage could the enemy have had if I had been
killed? I <span class="italic">heard</span> about the fighting just as though it had been
in the days of our grandfathers or great-grandfathers. But
if it were given me to redress the past, I only wish my stepmother
had given me a lethal sort of poison right away.</p>
