<p>Before we compare the two charges, I can plead thus: I
accuse you of poisoning, answer; I say you killed my son,
defend yourself. Suppose my charges are equal, they can’t
be taken in one trial. It is fair that the accused reply to what
is charged.</p>
<p>〚Suppose I drop my earlier accusation, don’t persevere
with it because of what I have charged.〛 It’s fair that life be
considered, that the greater &lt;matter&gt;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_57_1" id="target_note_LCL501_57_1"><sup>1</sup></a> be taken first. I
shall tell you later on what misgiving makes her want the
adultery trial taken first; meanwhile, you have two charges
before you, adultery and parricide: which of the two ought
to be tried first? Is it fair that she should be granted delay
of a most grave, most atrocious charge because she is also
an adulteress? If I had brought nothing against her previously,
she would answer to it immediately; since she came
to parricide because of her misgiving about the former
charge,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_57_2" id="target_note_LCL501_57_2"><sup>2</sup></a> she pulls that way, that being the reason for her
murder. I say that this woman killed my son: how long,
gentlemen of the jury, will you leave this in doubt? Meanwhile
she lives in the community, a woman who should be
categorized as a monster is among us, makes up the number
of the community, and she will live until she stands trial
twice, in this community too in which trials are long put
off. As for me, you certainly cannot be surprised if I hate all
delays, all deferments. Let me be permitted to avenge my
son while I am alive, before she moves from witness to
prosecutor.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_57_3" id="target_note_LCL501_57_3"><sup>3</sup></a> Can it seem fair or just to any of you to decide
