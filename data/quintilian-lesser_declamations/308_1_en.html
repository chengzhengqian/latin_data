ever the necessity,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_151_4" id="target_note_LCL501_151_4"><sup>4</sup></a> even if I offended and you are angry
because I did not ask you straightforwardly enough, I commend
the poor woman to you—not to take her back (I had
that hope once, and perhaps, if I were more fortunate,
it would still remain), &lt;but&gt; what I have to beg of your
mercy, needy and disowned as I am, that you give her food
even though you are angry. For what sort of life do you
think that poor woman has, asking for food every day and
always with the hunger of tomorrow? For my part, gentlemen,
I am afraid that after this calamity of mine, which
moreover the poor woman thinks came upon me because
of my compassion for her, she will end the life she has long
loathed and cease to take food, even if you give it. For if she
perseveres (I ask you gentlemen to forgive me, even if in
my father’s mind this would perhaps seem harsh), I shall
keep the poor thing company in her daily toil.</p>

<h2>331</h2>
<span class="label">Twice convicted of injuries, acquitted the third time</span>
<p>Whoso fails to convict on a capital charge, let him be punished
himself. Whoso be convicted of injuries three times,
let him be capitally punished. A man twice convicted of
injuries was prosecuted by someone for a third time and
acquitted. He goes to law with his accuser as though he had
been accused on a capital charge.</p>
<span class="label"><span class="sc">discussion</span></span>
<p>We ought to give an advocate to this twice convicted person,
for although he was recently acquitted, he has twice
been convicted.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_151_1" id="target_note_LCL501_151_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
