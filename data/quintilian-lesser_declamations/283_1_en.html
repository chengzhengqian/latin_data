Athenians, provided that our temples were demolished and
burned, surely we should not accept. Piety, public opinion,
the discipline of the community would have mattered
more to us. Alexander’s soldiery is dying: but a temple,
without a divinity, without sanctity, but a temple, is still behind
enemy lines; I cannot go to it, worship, acknowledge,
give thanks. Further, why do you want Alexander’s army to
perish, why do you want the plague to continue? Surely, in
order not to be at war. You are at peace. You have conferred
a benefit; the man we feared as a deadly enemy has
become a very powerful friend. Grant that hate is pertinacious,
Alexander had complied with the response; for what
concerned himself, he had rebuilt the temple, for what
concerned the second part of the response, he had given us
leave to dedicate. He gave the commonwealth the biggest
possible price.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_101_17" id="target_note_LCL501_101_17"><sup>17</sup></a> Do you think the immortal gods are so unjust
that they would not have thought about who was to
blame for the temple standing empty? For as I have said, if
the immortal gods had not wanted the plague to be ended,
they would either have given no response, or at any rate a
different one. Amends clearly shown<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_101_18" id="target_note_LCL501_101_18"><sup>18</sup></a> carry also the corollary
that they be accepted.</p>
<p>I am afraid, gentlemen, that I may be thought to be
making up a story under compulsion of danger, but my religious
conscience does not permit me to conceal what
happened. Do you suppose it was only Alexander who
counted with me, or any price? I thought he would withdraw
even if he did not bargain. It was the god, yes the god
(I call to witness the consciousness of his most present
divinity); he made me do it, he commanded it, he sent me
to this role. This was, in a manner of speaking, a second
response.</p>
