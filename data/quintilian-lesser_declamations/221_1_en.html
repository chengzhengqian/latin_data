by the very peril of my ignorance; she persuaded herself
that I had not acted out of random lust. And you can see
that I did not deny it with bad intention from the very fact
that I denied after she opted for marriage. I thank the jury
too. They put right the damage done by my contumacy. I
had lost a match with an excellent young lady if I had won.
