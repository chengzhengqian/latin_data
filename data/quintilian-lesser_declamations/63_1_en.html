back and is not content to charge her with what occasioned
the trial.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_133_12" id="target_note_LCL500_133_12"><sup>12</sup></a> “She lied,” says he, “to her father, lied about the
rape.” Shall I defend that, gentlemen? No, I would rather
be charged, so that our debt to the father be the greater.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_133_13" id="target_note_LCL500_133_13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>You were deceived: would you so much rather your
daughter <span class="italic">had</span> been raped? I want to defend the girl on the
assumption that it was her fault.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_133_14" id="target_note_LCL500_133_14"><sup>14</sup></a> Don’t you forgive her?

is, it is my idea. Forgive me, as is your way.” “Are you
ordering me to leave a husband like this? For what reason,
pray?” “He is poor.” “That did not use to count against him
with you. I shall &lt;not&gt; leave him nor do I call him poor. For
in marriage &lt;property is in a fashion common&gt;.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_133_17" id="target_note_LCL500_133_17"><sup>17</sup></a> She
married him on your advice, at your urging. Account for
