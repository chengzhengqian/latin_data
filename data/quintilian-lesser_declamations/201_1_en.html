cruelty. For how dire do you believe were the terrors
that made it expedient for them to join combat? What
a wretched situation! Freedom was overborne by terrible
duress. Then they pleaded until that cruel gladiatortrainer
said: “Mix it. You start this fight<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_409_13" id="target_note_LCL500_409_13"><sup>13</sup></a> knowing what
you are about. You won’t have the good fortune to die innocent.”
Think of the poor fellows’ hesitation between
two terrors. They were forced to kill those they pitied.
Why should I tell of the aspect of that miserable time, the
sounds, the blood, the groans? But at least, Fortune, you
managed for the best: each lies in one death. But, rich
man, I ask you: what would you have done about a survivor
if there had been one? Is this to have clean hands, do you
expect us to thank you for it in lieu of innocence?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_409_14" id="target_note_LCL500_409_14"><sup>14</sup></a> You
made misfortune itself guilty, and as though it was not
enough to exact penalty, you brought infamy on the very
punishments. You forced them to do what they could not
have defended if it had not been done under duress.</p>
<p>I prosecute you for improper punishment. I don’t have
to interpret the law. Every punishment is improper which
has not been imposed as the law provides. So tell me the
statute under which they should have died. “Let it be lawful
to kill an exile inside the borders.” It is enough that you
did not kill them. Whatever else was done is against the
law. Though it be something milder, something more merciful:
it is not permitted, nor shall you have license to pardon.
“Let it be lawful to kill an exile inside the border.” I do
not think that any of those who made our laws, gentlemen,
was so harsh and ferocious as to believe that so great a
crime would be perpetrated. For fear no doubt he<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_409_15" id="target_note_LCL500_409_15"><sup>15</sup></a> closed
