that previous period is incomplete, whereas if you assign
the first homicide its proper time, the exile begins his
exile for the second homicide only after five years. Explain
that middle two-year period to me. Or are you saying: “It
doesn’t matter?” 〚Tell me how he has been in exile more
than if he had killed once.〛 What is this illegal abridgement,
making that same two years the end of the earlier
punishment and the beginning of the later? I should
like to question him as though he were here present. On
whose account were you in exile during that middle period?
Whose was the death to which the law made this allocation?
〚For let us imagine that two men were killed right
away—or, as two, so more and up to any number: is there
no difference between a man who made a mistake in the
case of one and a man who owes satisfaction to more than
one? “Let a man found guilty of involuntary homicide be
in exile for five years.” On your reasoning he could return
at once after five years, if it is enough to say: “He committed
homicide involuntarily, he has been in exile for five
years.”〛</p>
<p>Let us see now what rationale the law followed in constituting
such a punishment—and upon my word it seems
to me to have so constituted more in mercy than in justice.
In requital for the life of an innocent person it constituted
an absence of just five years. For my part I cannot wonder
enough at the impudence of him—just that he was in such
a hurry to return to his country. A man may forgive himself
one accident, excuse himself for a single false step on the
ground that to err is human; but this man who repeated the
same offence for which he deserved exile added up the
days and the hours and merely looked at the law without
also numbering his crimes or adding anything in satisfaction
