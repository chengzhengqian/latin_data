heard the rich man say for the first time at this trial,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_127_4" id="target_note_LCL500_127_4"><sup>4</sup></a> chose
one house to cultivate, this one person to whom to give his
loyalty. And soon by his manners, his purity of life, his
blameless character, he made himself appear his dearest
friend even among all of those superior to him in fortune.
And so, upon my word, when the other decided to travel
abroad, the young man (though he was not ignorant of the
dangers of navigation) followed him none the less through
seas and tempests. We don’t complain too much of Fortune.
That shipwreck brought much fear, protracted distress,
a certain amount of loss, but it forced out something
very difficult, a test of loyalty. In the universal panic, when
each man was concerned for his own life without a thought
for his neighbor, and amid the waves and the menaces of a
sea in turmoil it seemed that hardly &lt;anybody could&gt; escape<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_127_5" id="target_note_LCL500_127_5"><sup>5</sup></a>
and everyone seemed to be for himself, upon my
word, I don’t wonder that even the best of fathers could
not pay attention to his daughter. For who would have
thought it possible that &lt;anyone&gt;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_127_6" id="target_note_LCL500_127_6"><sup>6</sup></a> should not only look to
his own survival but also be able to shoulder the burden of
another’s weakness and escape to land and overcome fears
of imminent fate?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_127_7" id="target_note_LCL500_127_7"><sup>7</sup></a> So no slave was so faithful, no freedman
so bound by the benefaction of his liberator that he could
brave this peril. Only the friend (he was not yet acting in
the role of son-in-law) took the girl over his shoulders and
carried her through so many difficulties and dangers without
a care for himself. This must surely be deemed some
kind of divine favor, not merely the work of man. Fortune,
