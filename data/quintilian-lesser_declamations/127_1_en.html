stigma.” I maintain that this law was first enacted against
persons taking money in promotion of an adultery and that
a stigma was added because they were thought to be doing
the job of a pimp. But even though persons receiving
money as penalty for adultery committed also fall under
this law, only one who <span class="italic">has</span> taken money falls under it. In my
case which do you contend? You will not show that I took
money when I let him go. Or if you thought that “take
money” meant your brother’s disowning, you would have
brought your charge straight away. I shall see later on for
what reasons he was let go; meanwhile, I deny that this is to
take money. Beyond question, what it is to take money is so
clear that it needs no interpretation. However, I am not
content with this defense unless I show that not even a
prospect of money was held out. For what did my father
promise me? That if I let my brother go, he would disown
him. Who was to stop him &lt;making&gt; even a son he had disowned
his testamentary heir &lt;or&gt; substituting another heir
in place of the disowned? So I cannot be thought to have
let him go because of money, even if I had let him go only
for that reason.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_261_1" id="target_note_LCL500_261_1"><sup>1</sup></a> But in fact how many reasons I had for letting
him go! If the fact that he was my brother was my only
motive, that would be a sufficiently complete defense—and that he was my younger brother and under a &lt;good&gt;
father, so that even if I were not sparing<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_261_2" id="target_note_LCL500_261_2"><sup>2</sup></a> himself I ought
not to have killed him for my father’s sake and my own. As
it is, who would doubt that I was right to be prevailed upon
when my father was begging? Let us suppose my father
had promised nothing, granted me no vengeance, who
would not have thought me undutiful, who would not have
