people intact,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_143_8" id="target_note_LCL500_143_8"><sup>8</sup></a> the dignity of citizens unimpaired! If we
judge by the yardstick of utility, how much better and
greater to have preserved the community in its proper
numbers and ranks! Or shall we caress with our applause
and attend at every show with our lavish adulation those
who maintain great families of criminals only to slaughter
them, while at the same time we pursue with the full rigor
of the law this young man, who sustains a part of our community,
in misery for minor offences, keeps them intact for
repentance—their own and the parents’? For what can we
perceive as so natural, more granted and permitted by
providence itself, than the nourishment and sustenance of
human beings? Dumb animals, for heaven’s sake, that can
come to hand and grow tame—to raise and feed them is
not only humane, it is a pleasure. What shall I say about a
human being? Does anyone do more for the public business,
not only of the community but of the whole Nature of
Things, than he that keeps going and prolongs this living
creature, closest to God, constituted for the contemplation
of all that has happened to the universe. A man has put his
wealth into the public if, when he is rich, nobody is poor,
nobody in want.</p>
<p>Sorry times! Does this have to be defended? The nobler
course, it would seem, is to drive from home children
we have recognized, already grown to be young men, and
forbid them the house, take no thought for their amendment,
punish them, with nobody allowed to come to their
rescue! “He takes the disowned in and feeds them.” You
say that as though they were temple-thieves, murderers,
brigands. If a youthful slip is so grave a crime, if at some
point to have offended fatherly severity is so inexpiable,
think out new laws and enact some harsher punishments.</p>
