was brought to her in the belief that she would give hasty
credence. But after he was seen through, the young man
began to slow down. Nothing drags out a trial more than a
claimant with cold feet. We finished our war before it was
over. Young man, I shall not cheat you of your glory. You
routed the enemy. Happy your parents, if you have any!
Would that your fiction had been believable! You made
her wish to acknowledge you. Here I want to address the
young man: “Yes, you became a hero, but physical courage
is a lesser thing; there is more to moderation of mind—not
to make a shameless claim, not to let it appear that you

generous out of booty. Witness the ancient lays in which
those early heroes were sung. To one a war chariot, to another
