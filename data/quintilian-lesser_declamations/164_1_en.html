<span class="label">Adulterer of a wife he had surrendered to his brother</span>
<p>A man who had two sons gave one of them a wife. When
the other fell ill and the doctors said the sickness was fatal,
the father came in sword in hand, threatening to die unless
he told the reason. When he confessed that he was in love
with his brother’s wife, the brother gave her to him at his
father’s instance. Finding her in adultery with her former
husband, he killed them. He is disowned.</p>
<span class="label"><span class="sc">declamation</span></span>
<p>I start my plea with a question: what kind of father do you
want? Stern and strict or easygoing and forgiving? I don’t
doubt that the young man, having just avenged his marriage,
prefers me to take a strict line. Such a father then
charges you with falling in love with someone. That only
comes of a lustful mind. What if this woman you love is
married? Did you look at another man’s wife otherwise
than as the law allows? Let us add, “your brother’s wife.” I
realize, gentlemen of the jury, that I cannot live up to this
fictive persona. So I shall be silent. You take the lead, you:
I’ll follow you. You were saying a little while ago: “He
dared to corrupt his brother’s wife, that’s incest.”</p>
<p>But maybe he’ll say: “A young man, I fell in love with a
girl who was in the house, whose constant company could
turn even unwilling eyes upon her.” Let us pardon love. So
charge you with killing human beings for the same reason
as caused <span class="italic">your</span> love. No human blood is so cheap that it
doesn’t stain the hand. Next, I could allow such severity
