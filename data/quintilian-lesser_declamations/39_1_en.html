pay no regard to present necessities. If the community had
strength enough to take on wars and break the tyrant’s onslaught,
we should not have been so long enslaved and our
bloody master would not have been killed by an individual
from ambush. And for my part, even if I saw a great deal
of strength in this community, I should think peace well
worth the life of a single member. It is easy to speak contemptuously
of such an attitude in popular assemblies and
gatherings. But let an enemy army be inside our borders,
let us see our houses on fire, our crops cut down, the flight
of country folk into the city, flocks driven inside the city
walls, let our battlements be assaulted, turrets shaken,
young men snatched from their mothers’ arms to join the
levy: how late will come regret for sparing one man at such
a cost! And if all the same the surrender of a tyrannicide
was going to damage the community’s image, as you people
keep saying, all that has been obviated by my bill. You are
freed from all embarrassment. You would not have surrendered
me against my will. So far as you are concerned, you
preferred to take on a war. But this is the main reason why I
thought to sponsor this bill. For so grateful a community,
for such a people, shall I not take any risk?</p>
<p>But it is not only in the interest of the commonwealth
that my bill be passed, it is mine too. Imagine whatever
outcome you like. I risk death. Well, have I not lived long
enough? Sure it is that the life of a brave man is not
bounded by a number of years, a life-span, but by glory and
fame and the immortality conferred by all posterity. May
the gods grant that even by my punishment I may be able
to give posterity a fine example! I shall think Fortune does
all I can ask of her to make my tyrannicide gain in glory.</p>
