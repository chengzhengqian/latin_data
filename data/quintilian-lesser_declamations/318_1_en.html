words are the same, and the law has not been changed
along with the personae.</p>
<p>Now to look at the intention of the testator: do you
think this is what he wanted? Did he enquire into my sincerity,
did he think it insufficient to believe in the tests of
life, did he break into my very heart and give my mind to all
men to be inspected down to its depth, just in order to
leave me what I had? “You<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_171_9" id="target_note_LCL501_171_9"><sup>9</sup></a> have a reason to open your will,
you have a reason to cut off all hope for the future.” My relatives
know that no other man was dearer to me, they know
that if I had other friends my whole heart was devoted to
one.</p>
<p>What does it matter to the mind how much if it is the
whole? “Heir to all my possessions:” whatever I had, whatever
I saved, whatever my long frugality left over. Had
some windfall accrued to this will, it would have been the
same. And I am not now asking for riches. I am used to
poverty, I know how to live frugally, I have no burdensome
need. I embrace that wording, yes, that: “all my possessions.”</p>
<p>If those below are conscious, then know my mind, as
was your wish. For you I lived, for no other was there any
place in this heart. This heart made you heir to all my possessions.
After this will, let some man say that he deserves!</p>

could authorize the opening of his will, which he would do in compliance
with the rich man’s stipulation. The advocate makes the
rich man assume what he did not know, that the poor man’s will
was in his favor. Opening it would make the poor man wealthy,
even though it would cut off any hopes he might have of inheriting
from others. Actually, adds the poor man, the relatives already
know how matters stand.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL501_171_9').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
