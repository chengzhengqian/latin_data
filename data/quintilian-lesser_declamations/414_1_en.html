has been doubly widowed, with her father a beggar.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_363_4" id="target_note_LCL501_363_4"><sup>4</sup></a> So
you take away her husband. And what a husband? One she
loved so much that she preferred him to the father. She
could have disputed with you about the marriage, which
was hers by legal right,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_363_5" id="target_note_LCL501_363_5"><sup>5</sup></a> if she had wanted to go back to an
ingrate.</p>
<p>What do you have against her? “She supports her father,”
he says. You’re accusing her of taking pity. It’s not
only right but necessary that a father be supported. “But
he wanted me to die,” he says. Don’t you forgive him, gentlemen,
if he hated such a man, knowing him beforehand?
For <span class="italic">she</span> did not know him.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_363_6" id="target_note_LCL501_363_6"><sup>6</sup></a> He had good reason for wanting
you to die: you had committed rape. The law was taking
your life, not my client’s father. But I am not defending
him; he did not come to you, he is not begging you; he asks
his daughter, your wife asks you. You could say that she
begs food for an old man to whom strangers offer it. What
is given isn’t much and she is compassionate. But you drive
her out and make her beg alms with her father. Are you not
ungrateful?</p>
<p>〚So you take her marriage away. Add that it is a marriage
of her own right.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_363_7" id="target_note_LCL501_363_7"><sup>7</sup></a> She could sue you for wrongful divorce,
&lt;if&gt; she wanted to &lt;go back&gt;. “She was supporting
my enemy,” you say. Are you surprised? She is compassionate.
Well, do you accuse that? Perhaps she did not judge
the person, but the plight. It is a foible of hers. Recently
she took pity on a rapist too. But what did he do so very
wrong that he deserves to die? “He wanted me to die,” he
says. You are copying what you accuse. So he did wrong?
You are doing the same. You both accuse cruelty and copy
