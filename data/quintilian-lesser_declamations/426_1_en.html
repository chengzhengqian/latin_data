<span class="label">Hero, son of a man accused of treason, brother of a
deserter</span>
<p>A father was accused of treason. One of his sons deserted,
the other fought heroically. The father asks him to opt for
suppression of his trial. He opted for impunity for his
brother and appeared for his father at the trial. The father
is acquitted and disowns his son. He speaks in opposition.</p>

<p>I admit it, I cannot bring against him the frolics that can be
forgiven his age. He is not loose-living, but contumacious:
these are faults less to be borne. You may say: “I am brave.”

even on the innocent.&gt; “But I opted for my brother’s life,”
he says. So don’t go on saying: “Suppression was superfluous.”
You preferred someone else to me, a guilty man
