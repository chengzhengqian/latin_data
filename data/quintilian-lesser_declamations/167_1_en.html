<p>I am said to have offered violence. Who complains, where
is the outcry? Did he leave the person responsible for his
death unpunished? If he was ashamed to lay information,
there were many other ways he could have complained: “I
am dying because of my host.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_341_3" id="target_note_LCL500_341_3"><sup>3</sup></a> Nor is it credible that one
who did not spare himself spared his host. But suspicions
are brought into play: “You promised lodging,” says the
prosecutor, “to a beauty.” Let that concern those who look
at everybody with lavish<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_341_4" id="target_note_LCL500_341_4"><sup>4</sup></a> eyes: to me at that time no Olynthian

why did he hang himself the same night?” What is surprising
about that—the act, the persona, or the time? Does
anybody wonder that an Olynthian could do that in Athens?
For that is the time for grief.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_341_8" id="target_note_LCL500_341_8"><sup>8</sup></a> Often danger itself
keeps us holding on to life. Fear returns after the enemy is
no longer upon us; then comes the thought of Fortune,
