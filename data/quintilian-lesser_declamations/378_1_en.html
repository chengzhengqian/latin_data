<h2>348</h2>
<span class="label">Prison burned along with traitors</span>
<p>Let the commanding general have supreme power in wartime.
A general threw persons suspected of treason into

Those who were in the prison perished. The enemy withdrew.
He is accused of having punished persons uncondemned.</p>

<p>If I could not be defended by reason, I should be defended

enquiry into happenings: in war there is no time to go into
individual items. To this consideration accrues another,
that the commanding general cannot conduct the war unless

conscripted soldiers into battle, to assign stations sometimes

the storming of enemy forts, takes more than good
