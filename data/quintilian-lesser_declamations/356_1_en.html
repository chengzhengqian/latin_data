<p>So much as to the law. “But the law itself<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_247_3" id="target_note_LCL501_247_3"><sup>3</sup></a> is unfair.” You
are changing the ground, making a different complaint.
Tell that to the commonwealth, tell it to the magistrate:
“The treasury of the Roman people is being filled with unjust
revenues and the provinces are being despoiled and
commerce abolished.” We bought the contract.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_247_4" id="target_note_LCL501_247_4"><sup>4</sup></a> But the
commonwealth too, to whom you will be able to address
your complaint, has an answer: first, that a community
must have revenues. The armies get their pay, wars are
waged every day against barbarous and very warlike peoples,
we defend riverbanks and boundaries and coasts.
Add this too: temples are a-building, religious ceremonies
draw large outlays, likewise shows cost money. Revenues
are needed. And among them what fairer can be found,
what causes less public complaint? How much more unjust
it may appear that the commonwealth claims part of an
inheritance! “But business contributes a lot to this tax.”
Whatever that is, it’s about profit in the future,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_247_5" id="target_note_LCL501_247_5"><sup>5</sup></a> besides
that nothing that is voluntarily incurred<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_247_6" id="target_note_LCL501_247_6"><sup>6</sup></a> can be thought
unfair. And the excise itself is necessary, not unfair. Is
this penalty<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_247_7" id="target_note_LCL501_247_7"><sup>7</sup></a> unjust, by which thefts are caught, by which
the law is vindicated, the fraud of those who pass items
through detected? Otherwise the revenue can’t hold.</p>
<p>I again return to the same point. The commonwealth
farms out under this system, we made our contract with
this requirement and our bid won. And in respect of what
sort of people did we make the contract? Though there is a
penalty, though articles that are not declared get
