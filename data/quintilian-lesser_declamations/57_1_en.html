award. We would have had to contend in arms and a terrible
wound and crime would have been branded upon this
otherwise most happy advancement of our house. Now I
see why you did not yield. It meant more to you than the
reward to duel with your father and commit parricide under
the law. Even in battle you doubtless thought of this,
and when you were imitating my valor, you had in view not
the right of option but the right of combat. Thus, so far as
lay in you, I was slaughtered, in the middle of the Forum
with the whole community looking on, by my son’s hand;
or, what is worse, I was the killer, you kept going when you
saw how my heart was set on it. I still ask you, were you going
to stand up against me? Tell me, yes or no. If you were
&lt;not&gt; going to keep on, ask yourself whether it is not an
even greater offence to have denied your father what you
could have granted.</p>
<p>Well then, keep that reward, whatever honor it carries,
but let it be enough for you to have called in the commonwealth.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_121_5" id="target_note_LCL500_121_5"><sup>5</sup></a> Leave my house. I am not doing it just for revenge
now, but also for security. My nights are sleepless and I am
afraid at every sound. 〚No night is free of fear for me.〛 I
have a son in my house who could have killed me. For the
sake of a reward you would have drawn your sword against
your father and committed parricide in the sight of the
community and people. To inherit sooner, to seize upon
my property, will so greedy a man as yourself not dare to
commit parricide in secret?</p>
<p>I am aware that the practice of almost all who are disowned,
when they have pleaded their case, is to turn to
entreaties and try to soften their fathers by begging. Can
you conceive that there is any possibility of your prayers
prevailing with me?</p>
