<p>Unquestionably this father is afraid that he too will turn
out a tyrant, but he ought not to throw suspicion on him;
otherwise he will be brought to trial. He will not be sent
into exile<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_325_2" id="target_note_LCL500_325_2"><sup>2</sup></a> if he is suspected.</p>
<p>“Let the tyrannicide opt for what he wants.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_325_3" id="target_note_LCL500_325_3"><sup>3</sup></a> First, the
common topic: that no exception is made. Particular to this
case is the point that this tyrannicide is more deserving in
that he is an old man and has killed two, and them his sons.
It would therefore have been invidious if he had asked for
anything savoring of self-congratulation.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_325_4" id="target_note_LCL500_325_4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<p>I begot tyrants: now I opt that my son be exiled. That<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_325_5" id="target_note_LCL500_325_5"><sup>5</sup></a> was
open to me even apart from the reward, but I ask it both as
my reward and for the young man’s sake. I say nothing
about our family fate, I don’t enter into the reason for my
fear, I am content to say for the time being: “Fears are uncalled-for, there is nothing impending. But sometimes a
weightier wisdom foresees such eventualities: how do you
think it is with parents and husbands?”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_325_6" id="target_note_LCL500_325_6"><sup>6</sup></a> I am afraid as a father,
whether my apprehensions are well-founded or (as I
fear most of all) it is the fate of our family. You will forgive
me if I pursue my sons beyond death: I had no fears about
the son who was the first tyrant; he was brought up on the
same precepts as you. When he was killed, it was not incumbent
on me to fear lest one of you should get the same
idea. Yet the second seized the castle, not altogether by his
own fault; it was difficult to resist those who flocked to him
