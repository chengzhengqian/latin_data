is the more credible, the easier. You had wanted to win my
pardon? How much more opportunely you could have
asked me somewhere else, at another time, when you were
first disowned, with kinsfolk and friends called in! How is
solitude good for pleas? Those are the instruments of parricide,
this the opportunity, this the place, this the time. If I
disowned you, were you going to die? I am accusing you of
parricide.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_307_2" id="target_note_LCL500_307_2"><sup>2</sup></a> What is left then but that you were going to
avenge this injury, as you called it?</p>
<p>“I did not kill,” he says. Nobody who is charged with
will to commit parricide but can be defended in this way. “I
did not kill,” he says. &lt;What&gt; if I were to say: “It was not as
easy as you thought. Crimes are more horrible when they
come close up”? Or if I were to say, “A supernatural force
stopped you, a silent awfulness of that lonely place”? But as
it is, it’s clear why you didn’t kill me: you put off that intention
until you should become my heir.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_307_3" id="target_note_LCL500_307_3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<span class="label">A tyrannicide in woman’s clothing</span>
<p>&lt;Let there be&gt; a reward for a tyrannicide. When a tyrant
ordered that somebody’s sister be brought to the castle, the
brother went up in his sister’s clothes and killed the tyrant.
By way of reward the magistrate put up a statue to him
dressed in the same clothes. He is accused of injuries.</p>
