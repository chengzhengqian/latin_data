king in peril. My role remained. I crave your pardon, immortal
gods, that I did not immediately assent to the terms
governing the dedication.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_95_7" id="target_note_LCL501_95_7"><sup>7</sup></a> For it was enough for Alexander
according to the response that he was allowing it.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_95_8" id="target_note_LCL501_95_8"><sup>8</sup></a>
Nevertheless I undertook this office for a great price: I
asked for peace. I got it: as though commanded by the
mouth of the god himself, he promised it and gave it. This
is the sum of my offences, gentlemen: we have both temple
and peace.</p>
<p>I am said to have brought aid to the enemy. I am not
yet giving reasons for my act nor shaking out the purpose
of the law itself: meanwhile, what do you understand by
bringing aid? For the question under this law is not simply
whether a person has been of help to the enemy. For
we do many things both unwillingly and inadvertently that
are useful to the enemy. For that reason the law did not
embrace this, but unsheathed itself against one who had
brought aid, meaning I think, one who had helped with reinforcements
or weapons or supplies. Not without good
reason: this is what the proper use of the word<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_95_9" id="target_note_LCL501_95_9"><sup>9</sup></a> implies.
&lt;For&gt; the law wished the question to be whether a person
had brought aid; in a manner of speaking it seized his hand
and convicted him in the bringing. As for the reason for
this law, who would not know it? The intention, I think, of a
person who wanted to help the enemy is punished. The law
was drafted against a traitor, an enemy of the commonwealth.
If these things are as I say, what have I done that
resembles them? I dedicated a temple. Never mind now
whether this helped the enemy. What matters in my case is
that what I did be known, not what came out of it.</p>
