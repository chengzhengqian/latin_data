<p class="noindent">If feeding these people is not permitted, disowning is
not enough. 〚Hear, hear you fathers, what considerations
moved an excellent young man to compassion and generosity,
and learn something.〛 None of them is charged with
preparing poison for his father or hiring an assassin to take
a parent’s life. Believe it, gentlemen. Otherwise I don’t
think they would suffer so light a punishment under parents

Young men born heirs to great patrimonies and in the
highest station, when suddenly evicted, I won’t say from
wealth but from things necessary to sustain life and the
