understanding of the jury, influence is nothing without

<p>Well, none of us denies that it is written in the law: “Let
him who has twice been found guilty of adultery be under
stigma.” Nor will it be denied that this man has twice gone
to trial and that the verdict has twice gone against him. But
if it will be clear that the law was not drafted so that this
