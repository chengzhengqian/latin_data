She was left heir to all his possessions by the pirate chief

<p>The questions are similar to the earlier division,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_251_2" id="target_note_LCL501_251_2"><sup>2</sup></a> the
definitions the same. The party who claims into slavery
says that he is at liberty by will of his master whom his master
wished to be free. Our side says that they who have
done something as though free men at the will of their
master are at liberty by will of their master. We have to refute
the other side’s definition, then to confirm our own.
The other side’s definition will be refuted thus:</p>

<p>“Whoso shall be at liberty by will of his master, let him be

had manumitted and wished to be free, it would have
been superfluous. For even with that law abolished there

Furthermore, that to be at liberty is one thing, to be free
another, is clear also because the law requires that persons
who have been at liberty be free. To whom then does the
law relate? To return to our definition: to those who at their
master’s will have done some things as free men. For example,
a slave has sealed something, his master so willing: the
law requires him to be free. For it will be unfair for the tablets
to be taken away<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_251_4a" id="target_note_LCL501_251_4a"><sup>4</sup></a> and he, whoever he is, for whom they
