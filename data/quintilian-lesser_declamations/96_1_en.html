for. I am not unaware, gentlemen, how many things are
often said against this profession by those whose freedom
of speech is not hampered by personalities. They call these
folk insincere and lazy and tied to that very self-aggrandizement
against which they are seen most forcibly to discourse.
But this is between me and my brother. So it is
