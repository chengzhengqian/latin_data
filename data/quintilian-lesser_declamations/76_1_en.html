against you. Don’t you understand that she who doesn’t
stand in your way<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_159_1" id="target_note_LCL500_159_1"><sup>1</sup></a> is no longer your wife? I am so far from
thinking that you can be defended by this sort of advocacy
that if you had dismissed your wife in any other way you
would have had a better case. An excellent defense, upon
my word; I say, “You divorced a chaste, obedient, loyal
wife”; you answer: “But I committed rape, I broke into another
man’s house.” You would appear a very bad husband
if you had turned your love toward some prostitute or if a
passion for slave girls called &lt;you&gt; away from the marriage
bed. You had already ceased to be a husband when your
mind was on anyone available. Even if you had acted only
out of lust and desire, the reason for the divorce would
have been at your door. What if it is not believable that you
did what you did except on the understanding that your
rape would be forgiven?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_159_2" id="target_note_LCL500_159_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Would you, a married man, have
taken so great a risk as to commit a rape, thereby adding
this discredit to your guilt?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_159_3" id="target_note_LCL500_159_3"><sup>3</sup></a> Gentlemen, unless you come
to the rescue, a way has been devised to divorce excellent
wives legally. All it needs is to find a virgin and rape her;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_159_4" id="target_note_LCL500_159_4"><sup>4</sup></a>
for the rest,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_159_5" id="target_note_LCL500_159_5"><sup>5</sup></a> we shall defend an act that is in no way legal
by the pretence of necessity.</p>
<p>Apart from all this, gentlemen, it will also be your duty
to ask yourselves how some punishment at least for this
man’s heinous offences come to pass. It would have been
outrageous in itself that a rapist went scot-free; it would
have been outrageous that a wife was wrongfully divorced.
There will be one penalty for both offences and a light one
