no deferment, it is now. So just as, &lt;if&gt; a day is set in advance,
there will be no right beyond that day, so if a day is
not set in advance, it is clear that the next is meant, nothing
is lawful beyond the next.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_297_8" id="target_note_LCL500_297_8"><sup>8</sup></a> Furthermore, what would be
clear in the case of any other law is more plain in this one.
For what does it say? “Let a raped woman opt for either the
death of the rapist or marriage.” Neither one is something
that should be deferred. If the rapist is a man deserving
death, he does not deserve an adjournment, whereas if the
rapist is pardoned, the wedding, as having begun already,
ought not to be delayed.</p>
<p>I should have said this boldly if you had brought him up
<span class="italic">almost</span> at once. As it is, you want to bring him up after the
wedding. So will you take your stand on law or on equity?
The law is clear from the very framing of the statute. For
when it prescribes that a raped woman be brought up in
order that she opt for death or marriage, it clearly shows
the woman brought up be free to opt either way. Moreover,
a married woman can no longer even be called a raped
woman. Just as the name of war ends at the legal time, just
as no one would refer to a woman as an orphan after her
marriage, just as the wedding night cancels the appellation
of virgin, so also a woman who has begun to have a husband
cannot be called raped. So suppose a raped woman
may be allowed to opt at any time, a married woman is not
allowed to opt. That is clear from the law, this from equity:
to start with, the law did not wish the terms to be so harsh
as to mean that a rapist should always be punished; and so
it left room for mercy.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_297_9a" id="target_note_LCL500_297_9a"><sup>9</sup></a> And that now applies not only to
