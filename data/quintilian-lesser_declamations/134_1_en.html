who had been conceived by a guilty woman? It is not credible
that the law looked out for a being to whom the Nature
of Things was not perhaps about to give the light of day,
who might or might not be born, who even deserved to be
hated on account of her who had conceived him. So why
was the law written? For the fathers, who have done nothing.
For it appeared unseemly that a son should be taken
from an innocent father, even though the mother had deserved
death. So if the law was written on my behalf, it cannot
be thought to operate against me. But in this woman’s
case pity for him, whatever was to become of him, cannot
move you. For who would acknowledge him, who raise
him, when it was clear that he had been conceived in
crime, in outrage, in something punishable by death? As
for the adulteress herself, she was so deserving of death
that no laws should ever have been more wroth with anybody.
A pregnant adulteress goes beyond the common run
of outrage. Did a woman, at a time when she would be
sleeping apart from her husband, keeping her modesty,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_275_6" id="target_note_LCL500_275_6"><sup>6</sup></a>
wallow with an adulterer? It is the nature even of dumb
animals, although their lust is &lt;not&gt; restrained by reason,
to eschew all sex after they have conceived: could not a
married woman be moved by modesty in respect to her delivery,
which you say was already imminent, to keep chaste,
if not for her husband, at least for her future son? So she
condemned her womb beforehand. But would he have
lived if I had not killed the adulteress? Do we not know the
modern ways of degraded women, how they hate giving
birth and abominate their children as evidence of their
age?</p>
