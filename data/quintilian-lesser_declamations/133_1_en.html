juror’s vote, the magistrate’s command.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_273_4a" id="target_note_LCL500_273_4a"><sup>4</sup></a> 〛 What if this
punishment actually cannot be deferred? For the law unquestionably
speaks of those who are at a given time<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_273_5" id="target_note_LCL500_273_5"><sup>5</sup></a> in
the power of the commonwealth. A man convicted is held
in public custody, in jail; the magistrate can exact punishment
on him when he wishes. But an adulteress discharged
does not return into her husband’s control. Nor
does the law only provide that the punishment of an adulteress
cannot be deferred, but it also provides that adulteresses
are not the only ones to perish. For when the law
permits me to kill an adulterer along with an adulteress, it
clearly indicates that they cannot be killed at different
times and that if the punishment is remitted to one of
them, the other too is to be given immunity. So not only
the pregnant woman’s punishment, to continue to use this
term, but that of the adulterer also would have to have
been not only deferred but eliminated altogether. What if
this too is &lt;not&gt; properly to be called a punishment? All
these names have their own proper function. A man &lt;deservedly
killed&gt; cannot always be said to have undergone
punishment. A punishment is not always found wherever
you have a penalty. It is the name given to public chastisement,
to penalty exacted by magistrates.</p>
<p>“To kill a woman who had become pregnant was unseemly.”
I won’t say at this point how much the graver was
her offence. Meanwhile, whom does he pity? The infant,
perhaps conceived from the adulterer? And, gentlemen, I
ask you for what reason you think the law protected one
