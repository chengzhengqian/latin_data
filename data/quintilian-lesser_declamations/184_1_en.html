<h2>299</h2>
<span class="label">A parricide’s bones dug up</span>
<p>Let parricides be cast away unburied. Let there be an action
for tomb-violation. A father on his deathbed charged
his daughter to avenge him, saying he was dying of poison
administered by his two sons. The girl brought an accusation
against them. During the delays one of them committed
suicide and was buried in the family mausoleum. She
convicted the other and threw him out unburied, after
which she also dug up and threw away the bones of the one
who had been buried. She is accused of tomb-violation.</p>
<span class="label"><span class="sc">discussion</span></span>
<p>Is it in any circumstances lawful to dig a person up after
burial? Was this not lawful for somebody who had the
power to forbid the burial? Or even if the burial was not
lawful? Then come special questions: does the law forbid
burial only of one convicted of parricide or of one who
in fact committed it? Was the person a parricide? In this
case there are two types of probative questions, one emotional,
the other juristic, that is the questions of feeling and
questions of law. Was the suicide condemned by his own
verdict?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_375_1" id="target_note_LCL500_375_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Was judgment passed on him as well when his
brother was convicted?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_375_2" id="target_note_LCL500_375_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Is it impossible for a dead man to
be convicted? Even if no one else, could not a person at
least who died while under prosecution? Last comes quality,
in which lies the force of the entire controversy: of what
quality was her fact, forgivable or condemnable? In handling
that, emotional indignation on behalf of the commonwealth
is in order.</p>
