<p>Nor does it escape us that the dispute seems topsyturvy.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_463_4" id="target_note_LCL500_463_4"><sup>4</sup></a> For if one of us were calling this man a slave, he
surely had many things to say for himself to show he was a
freeman. For what says the law? “Let one addicted for
debt be in servitude until he pays,” I think; not “be a slave.”
That’s very important. For we rightly speak of persons who
have fallen into pirates’ hands or been captured by the enemy
as being in servitude: what nature gave to the freeborn
cannot be snatched away by any injury of Fortune.
Although I expect that this is clear to every one of you, I
want to prove it by certain admitted arguments. First of all,
he has a name,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_463_5" id="target_note_LCL500_463_5"><sup>5</sup></a> is in the census, is in a tribe, none of which,

that a man who passes from slavery to freedom is in no
other situation than that of a freedman, while this man

before,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_463_7" id="target_note_LCL500_463_7"><sup>7</sup></a> clearly he is not a slave even today. There are a
number of other things you may look at if you will. A slave
is either home-born or left by inheritance or purchased. In
which category of slaves do you put this man? He says he is
