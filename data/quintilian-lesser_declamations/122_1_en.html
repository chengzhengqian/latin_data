sponsor. As it is, the estate has passed to you, you are now in lieu
of an heir. For what difference does it make whether it
comes to you as an inheritance by testamentary right from
him defunct or by law from him still living? If I am entitled
to claim the estate,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_251_4" id="target_note_LCL500_251_4"><sup>4</sup></a> I must necessarily go back to you. So

How far have you pushed your greed? Is it not enough that

a man living on someone else’s money fell into this particular
