<p>For the rich man the following color can be introduced:
the poor man is said to have been factious or turbulent and
to have had companions in such madness whom he placed
&lt;in&gt; ambush, showing himself only to excite a brawl but
keeping them to back him up in case the rich man started
something (and this is shown by the very facts of the case
since it is incredible that the poor man would have come to
jeer at the rich man alone and at night too. For why did he
keep quiet in the daytime? Why not abuse him in the Forum?
Evidently he waited for nightfall the more easily to
hide his companions). Therefore he came for a brawl with
a weapon. The rich man, suspecting nothing of the kind
and rather believing him to be mad, gave people to take
him away. But then the poor man flared up as though put in
custody and the others, his accomplices, came on the scene
and, wishing to rescue the poor man, raised a brawl, and
perhaps stealthily killed that poor man for fear lest he
might be arrested later on and forced to reveal the perpetrators
(and this is to be presented tentatively, which approach
is to be kept up in the rest of the case too. For we
should not assert anything positively, but only turn the
juryâ€™s suspicions in advance away from us to another quarter).
So the murder appears to have been committed by
those who are still in hiding, thanks to the timing.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_347_1" id="target_note_LCL501_347_1"><sup>1</sup></a> The rich
