stranger. Perhaps too he thought: “So I shall always live by
a stranger’s bounty.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, whether it was the fate of Olynthus or his
own hasty temper, nobody is more injured than I. I lost my
good deed and am under suspicion as well. I thought I
would have someone to take the place of children.</p>

<h2>293</h2>
<span class="label">Tyranny over a conquered community</span>
<p>Let there be a reward for a hero. A man becomes a hero. As
reward he asks to be tyrant of the defeated community.</p>
<span class="label"><span class="sc">declamation</span></span>
<p>I say that all things should be given to heroes, given not
undeservedly, at any rate when they come from the defeated.
I amnot disturbing the treasury. I am not snatching
at a priesthood: I ask that enemies be in my power. And
first of all, a question: who is this individual who says nay? I
would have had a right to ask that our enemies be destroyed.
And this I-don’t-know-who, he took no part in
the battle at the time.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_343_1" id="target_note_LCL500_343_1"><sup>1</sup></a> If they had won, they would have
avenged themselves with a tyranny. I want to put the case
as one who will be cruel; they have deserved it. You can
take your revenge without any odium; let them complain
about me—they already have a grudge against me—I want
to impose a tyranny. Worse still: I have killed a great many
from that community with this hand. But do I seem to you
greedy or libidinous? I was not brought up that way. So I
ask this for the same reason that I became a hero. This is
how we shall set a garrison on them: I shall be tyrant as
long as they are able to make war again.</p>
