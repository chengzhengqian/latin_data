with each other about the spoils of a ten-year
war?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_421_10" id="target_note_LCL500_421_10"><sup>10</sup></a> These are sacred merits, this is valor bonded together.
That was “whatever I want.” But if you abuse that
Phrase<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_421_11" id="target_note_LCL500_421_11"><sup>11</sup></a>unconscionably, the commonwealth herself will
answer you: “What boots my victory if it means I cannot say
no to anything? This is how a victorious enemy might talk
to me. What if you should ask for a temple to be burned,
laws to be put out of mind? In this fashion you might have
opted to marry your mother.” How much more justly will a
private woman answer: “You did not fight only for me: call
upon the commonwealth, call upon the magistrates. What
is owed by everyone cannot be given by a private individual.
This is what I should have said if you had fancied one
of my possessions. As it is, you ask for marriage, which cannot
be yours without the odium of greed.” But if the city
had been taken and she invoked her husband’s spirit, an
enemy would not have carried her off, he would have pitied
a woman who seemed to love the dead. How can you
and she agree? You would not have sought her hand in
marriage if you hadn’t sued her. Do you know what marriage
is? Look at that maiden there whom her father has
handed over as she walks on the festal day with the people
keeping her company.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_421_12" id="target_note_LCL500_421_12"><sup>12</sup></a> Nobody can give what is made out
of the will of two. It might be just as tolerable if you were
asking for a virgin who has never sighed for love, who still
owes the commonwealth matrimony. Old age has its privileges,
since every time of life does not carry every burden:
the consul does not summon the senator up to any age,
there is retirement for ambassadorial missions. When you
reach her age, you won’t be in the army any more.</p>
