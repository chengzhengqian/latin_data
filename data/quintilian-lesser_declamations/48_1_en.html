<p>So nobody would doubt that deserters are loathsome.
For let us look at the thing itself and not be deceived by the
appearance of expediency, and let us &lt;not&gt; decide &lt;because
it is&gt; an enemy who does it without realizing that our
own folk could have done the same. A bad example is never
to the good; even if it pleases, offering some advantage in
the present, in the future it does deeper harm. I think
those who receive deserters are next door to deserters.
Commission of a crime and approval of it are similar by nature.
If one of ours had deserted, you would not only judge
the man himself a thoroughly bad citizen deserving of
every punishment but those also who received him as deserving
of infamy, and you would censure<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_103_4" id="target_note_LCL500_103_4"><sup>4</sup></a> them as instigators
of crime, as teachers of dishonor. Shall we not turn the
same back upon ourselves?</p>
<p>Led by expediency, are we finally going to have those
we receive among our auxiliaries? Suppose the community
was in such a condition as to need auxiliaries: shall we take
these among them? I suppose that those who bent Fortune’s
way, although they saw their country and the memory
of their boyhood and all their personal ties on the other
side, will stand for us with an ampler<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_103_5" id="target_note_LCL500_103_5"><sup>5</sup></a> oath and a braver
spirit? Are they so much more easily found perpetrating a
crime than repenting it? So this is a useless sort of soldier,
one we are very far from needing. For even those who
&lt;say&gt; deserters ought to be received are saying that our
community has the upper hand; for they don’t desert for
love of us but from fear of imminent fortune. Or do we
think that our enemies will more easily give up their war
