caught his brother, who had returned, in adultery and
killed him, though their father interceded on his behalf.
He is disowned.</p>

<p>Should everything done against a father’s will be punished
by disowning? Should he be disowned for what he did
legally?</p>

<p>More fortunate fathers customarily get angry as follows:
“There is nothing you ought not to have done according to
my wish: I bring against you the gift of daylight.” That parental
power flaunts itself even against magistrates, even
against victors. I do not demand, however, that you do as I
order: I ask that you do as I have requested. “There is a law
permitting to kill an adulterer with an adulteress.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_317_3" id="target_note_LCL500_317_3"><sup>3</sup></a> He
does not say, as though talking to a father, “it was my duty
to kill,” but as though talking to an outsider, “it was my
right to kill.” That, as a defense, would serve him well—but
that it certainly is adequate cause for disowning.</p>
<p>Shall I handle this as a case of murder? If I were to do
so, I should be pardoned. Let those have greater freedom

wedding a punishment, to whom wives are escorted by a
lictor, you cannot avenge what is granted to you in such
a fashion. But to leave aside all else, you ought to have
thought of nothing except your father’s sentiments. Perhaps
you could be defended by other laws, but you cannot
be divested of what bound you to your father’s will. I disown
