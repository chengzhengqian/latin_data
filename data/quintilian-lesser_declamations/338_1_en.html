folk like to demolish from time to time, to change and
add something no doubt by way of experiment. You lost
your house: Fortune’s grievous injury, to live in a new one!
But you lost your wife. Even in her you don’t miss much.
For how you rich men remodel your marriages! Remodel?
Other pleasures carry you off, those servants, those boys
imitating women. So it comes about that you don’t even
love your children. Thus many things can encourage you
&lt;to live&gt;. Besides, consolations come: it’s easy for you to
find a wife and it’s easy for you to bring up other children.
So many pleasures all around you leave no room for sorrow.
I have suffered all this as a poor man. If I were to say:
“A poor man, I lost my house,” I should still look as though
I was stripped of my entire fortune. For how had it stayed
in my possession? Because it was my father’s. A poor man, I
lost my children; a poor man, I lost my wife. I am left alone,
forsaken. I have a rich man as an enemy. Until now I bore
up more bravely against his hatred, sharpened every day,
because of my hope in my children. They were already
my young men, they were already protecting their father.
Even if our rivalry in the Forum sometimes wore me out, I
had a wife to go back to. If the point of the entire suit was
whether it was hard for me to live, I could prove it with one
argument: my enemy wants me to live. This is the one satisfaction
for his hate on which he has so far<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_211_4" id="target_note_LCL501_211_4"><sup>4</sup></a> set his sights.</p>
<p>Why did I dare to say anything? Why did I find it suspicious
that our gallant soldiers were defeated? Why was I
aggrieved that men were twice stabbed from the back who
even twice beaten could still win a victory? I realize that
this part of my speech falls on deaf ears. For he won the
battle and is regarded as having deserved well of the commonwealth.
This too is a reason for death.</p>
