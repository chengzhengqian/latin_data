it barred action respecting something allowed under the
law?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_179_2" id="target_note_LCL500_179_2"><sup>2</sup></a> That no license is given to wrongdoing against persons
under stigma I think I shall prove by a single brief,
clear argument: someone whom it is lawful to beat it is lawful
to kill; but if anybody kills a person under stigma, he
will be liable under the law of homicide. Why? Because
this person’s action necessarily pertains to someone else.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_179_3a" id="target_note_LCL500_179_3a"><sup>3</sup></a>
Evidently, therefore, you were not licensed to do anything
against a person under stigma; but a person under stigma
has no license on his own behalf. So the person under
stigma will not bring an action for injuries against you, but
you will have committed injury all the same. That you will
escape punishment for your wrongdoing will be part of the
penalty he pays for his disreputable life.</p>
<p>That is what I should be saying if you had beaten a person
under stigma just anywhere. As it is, even though it is
not injury to have beaten a person under stigma in another
place, beating in a temple is injury. 〚For if both of us admit
that something clearly done illegally is injury, then even
though it was legal for you to beat a person under stigma
somewhere else (and I have already shown that such is not
the case), it was not legal to beat him in a temple.〛<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_179_4" id="target_note_LCL500_179_4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

from prosecuting his assailant, but the assault, as here argued, is
nonetheless a crime. Why then does somebody else not prosecute?
The question is not asked in the text, but the answer would
be that a prosecution would serve no purpose since the penalty
prescribed by law, a fine payable to the victim, would be inoperative
(whether specifically or by implication) if the victim was un- der stigma. To prove his point, the declaimer argues that the murder
of an <span class="italic">ignominiosus</span> can be prosecuted (the victim being dead)
and the penalty, death, imposed. In both cases the assailant has
