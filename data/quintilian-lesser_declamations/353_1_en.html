at liberty is at liberty? Someone has set his seal as though a
free man: if he did this by will of his master, for all the master
wanted him to be a slave at that time, it will be clear
that &lt;he was&gt; at liberty; the same applies to whoever has
done something as a free man. And yet this boy is not only
quasi-free but quasi-freeborn: he wore a praetexta. If I had
brought him before the jury so garbed, this would be a
symbol not only of freedom but of status too. Are you not
afraid you have committed a crime?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_241_4" id="target_note_LCL501_241_4"><sup>4</sup></a> And another perhaps
merely used liberty, <span class="italic">he</span> also had it approved. By whom?
By the customs, most meticulous persons, to say the very
least.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_241_5" id="target_note_LCL501_241_5"><sup>5</sup></a> In fine, I should like to show your whole retinue:
how were the slaves dressed?</p>
<p>“But I did not do it,” he says, “wishing him to be free
but to avoid paying the tax.” I have to keep on repeating it
(we even congratulate him if he is free against your will):
you did not want him to be free but you wanted him to be
at liberty. It makes no difference why you did it; that is to
say, to come closer to the words of the law, it makes no difference
why you wanted him to be at liberty. And yet that
reason you put forward deserves punishment. You wanted
to defraud the revenue of the Roman people, you wanted
to cheat the customs officer by the appearance of a boy in a
praetexta. I’ll say later what difference it makes to this boy:
meanwhile, I’ll say: “What difference does it make to you?
Did you not get what you were after? Did you not get away
with it?”</p>
