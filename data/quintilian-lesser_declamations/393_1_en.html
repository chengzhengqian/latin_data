ame. The stewards of both said under torture the opposite
of their masters. The suit starts afresh.</p>
<span class="label"><span class="sc">discussion</span></span>
<p>The claimant has to discredit his steward and say that he
has been bribed by his opponent, who has rejected the
claim in reliance on the steward’s promise to deny even under
torture. Hence arose from the opponent, when the
proceedings started: “let us torture the stewards.” He will
say that this other steward’s intention was honest, for he always
said openly that he had received the money and when
handed over to torture he has this intention right away:
“What? For what reward would I lie?” &lt;Therefore&gt; he
confessed.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_321_1" id="target_note_LCL501_321_1"><sup>1</sup></a> This too among common topics is effective:
“Your steward received the money, mine denies that he
gave it. The latter’s word is more valid, for the money can
also be thought to have been paid through someone else.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_321_2a" id="target_note_LCL501_321_2a"><sup>2</sup></a>
He<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_321_3" id="target_note_LCL501_321_3"><sup>3</sup></a> will say that initially he was pleased with the slave and
therefore put him in charge of accounts, but later he went
to the bad, what with his own license and the carelessness
of his master, who trusted him a great deal; he had taken
many bribes before this one and for that reason he himself
made the deposit. 〚This was his reason for depositing,
since he saw that his accounts were in a bad way.〛<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_321_4" id="target_note_LCL501_321_4"><sup>4</sup></a> This has
to be added because he is pressed by questioning as to
what reason he had for depositing.</p>
<p>The denier has to say that his steward wanted to end the
torments: he confessed to be let go.</p>

still be telling the truth, supposing the deposit was made by somebody
else, so that both can be believed. But that argument does
not cover s.2, where the denier’s steward says he received the deposit
openly, in which case he would know, and say, who made it. The claimant proceeds on the supposition that his steward was a
scoundrel.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL501_321_2a').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL501_321_3"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL501_321_3" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">3</sup>The claimant.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL501_321_3').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL501_321_4"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL501_321_4" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">4</sup>Either this or <span class="italic">et . . .
