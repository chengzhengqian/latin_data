this law, this benefit, who have married on equal terms,
parents consenting;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_67_6" id="target_note_LCL500_67_6"><sup>6</sup></a> but that law has nothing to do with
persons in whose case marriage was a necessity. They are
no more free to divorce than they would have been free not

the laws, whatever most cruel in the statutes, you seize
upon it. Would you have wished the girl to be so minded
when you were lying at her knees? She on the other hand
