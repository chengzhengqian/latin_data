convict. I don’t scrutinize what the lawgiver intended, for I
can’t; inquisition into bygones comes too late. Whether he
meant what he wrote or whether he had something else in
mind, this <span class="italic">is</span> what he wrote, this is the law we have lived
with, this is what we look to. Nothing should be more intolerable
in a community than for a law to deceive. I<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_11_5" id="target_note_LCL501_11_5"><sup>5</sup></a> prosecuted
an innocent man: it’s enough that I convicted him.
For the text of the law does not say that he who has prosecuted
an innocent man shall be capitally punished, but that
he shall be punished who has prosecuted and not convicted.
So just as a prosecutor who had failed to convict
would gain nothing if it was later discovered that the man
he accused was guilty, so something that happened later
ought not to damage a prosecutor who had good fortune in
the trial. This is the scenario set by the law for a trial in
which a defendant is prosecuted for homicide: verdict has
to be given against one side or the other; either the defendant
is to be convicted or the prosecutor. What do you
want? That both be convicted [or that this be fair (?), that
the defendant and the accuser be convicted]?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_11_6" id="target_note_LCL501_11_6"><sup>6</sup></a> “But that is
what the law intended.” I pass over that it is pernicious to
interpret a law and twist it to suit the ingenuities of both
parties and that what is written to preclude doubt should
become doubtful after it has been written.</p>
<p>I come down to this other contention<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_11_7a" id="target_note_LCL501_11_7a"><sup>7</sup></a> (not because it is
necessary or because it is relevant to your religious duty
nor because this factor<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_11_8" id="target_note_LCL501_11_8"><sup>8</sup></a> releases you from your oath, but
because as winner, successful in my case, it is easy and
agreeable to make the argument): the lawgiver did right
