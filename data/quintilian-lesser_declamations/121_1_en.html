allow you the residue of the property. So you must make
the same reckoning with yourself as you have made<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_249_2" id="target_note_LCL500_249_2"><sup>2</sup></a> with
another. For of an estate which is to pass to another owner,
it is required that first satisfaction be given to money
owed.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_249_3" id="target_note_LCL500_249_3"><sup>3</sup></a> You pay part as debtor, you recover part as creditor.
Once again, let us imagine other creditors and nothing left
in the estate. To put it more clearly and plainly, suppose
the person caught has possessions such as slaves and furniture,
and debt, which debt the contents of the estate would
be insufficient to pay off. Will you seize the slaves and the
furniture? As for the creditors, will you shake them off and
send them away empty? You yourself, the usurer, cannot
think that fair. So all visible items would have been transferred
to loan and debt. As for you, although you had the
law under which the property of the adulterer was owed to
you, you would have got nothing from the property of an
adulterer who had nothing. So your debtor speaks to you as
follows: “My property, that is, what is unencumbered in my
estate and properly mine, should pass to you under the law.
First, I pay—and what is the difference whether I pay or
you take?” Wherefore the man to whom you lent money
doesn’t owe you, much less do I, who am surely freed of obligation
if someone else has already paid. For what after all
do you want me to do? If you had preferred to claim from
me, when the debtor’s status was unimpaired, I should
have gone back to the debtor. If the debtor had deceased
and his property had passed to an heir, I should have gone
to the heir, that is, I should have claimed the property appertaining
to the estate &lt;of the person&gt; for whom I went
sponsor. The same person would have been sued from
whom I would have reclaimed anything I had paid as
