<p class="noindent">“Who told you people,” says the boy, “what land I had been
brought to? Is my grandmother alive?” So the boy had a
claimant,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_431_12" id="target_note_LCL501_431_12"><sup>12</sup></a> the claimant a sponsor, the foreigner backers,
while his face itself pleaded the cause of his free birth.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_431_13" id="target_note_LCL501_431_13"><sup>13</sup></a>
What else shall I say but that they recognized him as that
gentleman’s son? Not surprising: nothing was confused.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_431_14" id="target_note_LCL501_431_14"><sup>14</sup></a> I
admit that the names of absent persons helped a lot, when
we said: “He has a mother, he has a grandmother.” On one
point, gentlemen, we lied: we affirmed that his mother
would recognize him.</p>
<p>I claim his father’s possessions for the son. “But I am
the heir,” she says. But he is the first heir. “He died,” she
says. When? With his grandmother he had been healthy:
was he sent for to his death? Captives live longer with
pirates. “Pirates were sighted,” she says. “Left behind, he
was overwhelmed by the waves.” What are you saying?
Left behind? Do any fears drive out from your mind the
memory of your son? I don’t recognize a mother. Some animals
when in danger carry their cubs away in their own
mouths and love creates new hands for them. They soften
their bites, otherwise harmful, for this one office. Nests are
often changed if they become unsafe; and no creature is so
savage that it does not migrate with its progeny. So true it is
that to those to whom understanding of all things is denied
this one emotion is left. The founder of the Roman race<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_431_15" id="target_note_LCL501_431_15"><sup>15</sup></a>
divided his pious offices between father and son and since
the years of both lacked strength for flight, he carried one
and led the other by the hand. Mother, learn how to escape.
I think you are not surprised that a mother does not
receive a son whom she holds so cheap that she leaves him
like a corpse.</p>
