the writer is to be looked at. For words are ambiguous and
drawn into various interpretations, the reason for writing
laws was the intention. So the one thing to be looked at is
the reason why they were written. The meaning of this law
is clear: that there be punishment whenever the act for
which punishment is laid down is committed. No supplement
