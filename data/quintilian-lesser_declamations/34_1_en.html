throes of execution he will gain, counting as so much profit
the fact that his wrongdoing went further.</p>
<p>Therefore the only question remaining is whether you
believe it was not the rich man’s doing that he raped my
daughter, and did so at that time and after that popular verdict.
I shall not argue from the man’s character; although
what sort of a man he is, how dissolute, how loose-living
and abandoned, could sufficiently be proved by a single
piece of evidence: he had a parasite. Your hesitation, gentlemen,
as persons under oath, is I suppose located in
determining whether the parasite committed the rape of
his own volition or did it as a service to the rich man. “The
parasite committed rape.” What are you saying? Had he so
much time to spare? Was he so sated to overflowing in your
house that he had no interest in cheap harlots? Content as
he is with anything, would he have raised his eyes on his
own to freeborn ladies and virgins and candidates too for
an honor? I declare I shall never believe that his slavery
with you was so prosperous that he had impulses to illicit
lusts. This I say: the parasite only wants to rape this lady.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_75_5" id="target_note_LCL500_75_5"><sup>5</sup></a>
Come now, &lt;if&gt; you please, I will add something else:
whence came the gang that stormed us, so mighty, so extravagant
a commotion in the house, and finally where is
he going to get the money to pay what is owing under law?
If the counter-theory is unbelievable, for certain nothing
now remains except that he did it for you.</p>
<p>But let us analyze this part too. He suborned the rapist.
For he had a motive: the maidens were in competition for
the same honor, my daughter could not be eliminated any-how
