else. If the decision of the people had been in doubt
and their votes not openly professed, I should say that your
peace of mind, or your outrage, would have been worth the
price.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_77_6" id="target_note_LCL500_77_6"><sup>6</sup></a> No one is so arrogant in his self-esteem that when

Perhaps I gather this by items of evidence, think to prove it
by lengthy, difficult process of inference? Why, the people
spoke! If I had to defend some other rumor, never mind
what, I should still say, gentlemen, that it is well-nigh miraculous
that when a few witnesses are brought before you

of your good faith and oath, but when it is a consensus of
the entire community and all who live in this habitation
have said one sure thing, it is called a rumor. Perhaps such
indications can be belied in other contexts, but a report
which talks of itself speaks true. For who was talking? The
people. What about? Whom the people was going to elect.
When rumors about elections agree, each man says, “she
will win;” that is to say, “I shall vote for her.” That’s not
report: it’s election.</p>

money is not mistress of everything that makes up human
