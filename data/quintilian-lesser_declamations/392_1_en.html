would not have let the commonwealth be harried both by
the enemy’s arms and the counsels of an inexperienced
commander.” Fired by such words, he took up patriotic
arms for the salvation and freedom of all, and also added
his private resources. Issuing from the city, he surprised
our enemy, who was relaxed in the joy of victory and apprehended
nothing less than a sally. The commander, stirred
by this victory, as though against a rival, flared up in fierce
resentment. Saying that private armies were a bad precedent
and with the rich man’s friends all with the rich man,
he had no difficulty in persuading them to close the gates.
The soldiers, returning to be congratulated after wrapping
up the battle, were astounded to find the gates closed; but
after they were ordered to lay down their arms, their anger
blazed up considerably more violently as they protested
that they were being shut out like traitors and exposed to
the armed enemy unarmed. Wanting to heal this sedition,
the rich man asked for time, for entreaty as much as for deliberation,
and in those three days he did nothing but beg
his men, now individually, now collectively. They too felt

crush the commonwealth which he alone had defended.</p>
