containing many obscurities. It has not made it sufficiently
clear whether properties are to be equalized just for the
present moment or as often as one stands out. But if that
is truly the only remedy for the commonwealth, it ought
to be in perpetuity and for that reason the law is to be
rejected because it has not sufficiently made that discrimination.
〚If this is the force of your law, that it be about
equality of properties, that all be given the same amount,
almost every day and every season will have to be spent in
this apportioning, if one man lives more frugally and another
more lavishly.〛</p>
<p>Moreover, this law is written against all laws: for no law
is composed but with the assumption that each have what
is his and keep his hands from what is somebody else’s.</p>
<p>But it isn’t even practicable. For what will happen? I
pass over the point that some will do business, some will
make money, some will live frugally; what will be done
about leaving estates, about wills, when anyone coming
into an inheritance will at once have more than the rest,
and is not going to share with those who did not have the
same compliment<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_153_1" id="target_note_LCL500_153_1"><sup>1</sup></a> under the final testament of the deceased?</p>
<p>Let us add that the law is also inexpedient, principally
for two reasons: it will diminish the frugality of prospective
savers and will serve the extravagance of prospective consumers.
For why should anyone save when he will lose as
much by the extravagance of others as by his own? Why
should not everybody splurge?</p>
<p>This would have been enough said about the law itself,
irrespective of the times. Let us now see why it is proposed.</p>
