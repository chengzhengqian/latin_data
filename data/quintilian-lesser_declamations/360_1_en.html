human being. But if the same woman is in this dress and
comes out in the community, that same woman who is usually
an actress will none the less be in the status of liberty.
So by her dress she<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_255_8" id="target_note_LCL501_255_8"><sup>8</sup></a> has sufficiently borne witness to her
liberty. What if she did something as a free woman? She set
out—it is not enough to say as a free woman, but as a respectable
lady, as your daughter.</p>
<p>“But,” he says, “I did not do all this because I wanted
her to be at liberty.” The law does not send us to the reason
for your willing but to the willing itself. You wished her to
be at liberty; why you wished it does not concern the judge
nor yet your willing. 〚All the same, did you wish her not to
be at liberty? That was nasty of you, to say the least.〛<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_255_9" id="target_note_LCL501_255_9"><sup>9</sup></a> What
if it is credible that it was actually your wish that she be
free? For what did you want her to be? A slave woman?
Whose? Is there any doubt that your prayer was that she
pass as a lady, as your daughter? Did you not wish her to
be at liberty when you feared nothing more than that she
might be sent back to you as a slave? And yet, even if she
had been sent back, she would already have been at liberty
by your will.</p>
<p>But she went further. I was saying:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_255_10" id="target_note_LCL501_255_10"><sup>10</sup></a> “She put on the
dress of a lady, you so willing; she started her journey as a
lady.” With you willing she went to the pirates as your
daughter, with you so willing she passed herself off as free
and freeborn, with you likewise so willing she lived in marriage
as freeborn, she was left as heiress as free. In all these
situations the status must have arisen from your will, for
you wanted to send her away, you wanted to send her away
