yields and the woman who claims. The young man is

<p>Even if the suit lay for the woman, my client, against that
poor man,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_217_5" id="target_note_LCL501_217_5"><sup>5</sup></a> gentlemen of the jury, our side would seem to
be in a weak position and more deserving of help, both because
a woman is a weak thing and because the fact that
she has lost a husband adds no small weight to her natural
infirmity. Something special accrues to this, the fact that
what were her supports have been changed into anxiety.
For although she no longer had a husband and had been
driven from the house into which she had married as a virgin,
even so she could seem to be not without help, since
she had a youthful son. But since this is itself drawn into
the suit and at the present time brings his mother nothing
but anxiety, I confess it now, she is not in litigation with the
person you see on the benches opposite;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_217_6" id="target_note_LCL501_217_6"><sup>6</sup></a> a superior influence<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_217_7" id="target_note_LCL501_217_7"><sup>7</sup></a>
loads her down. This mother would at all events be
more fortunate in the suit if her husband had been content
with giving up his son. As it is, he has added the weight of
testimony and forced the hapless foster mother, whom he
twice tortured because she was speaking the truth, to lie<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_217_8" id="target_note_LCL501_217_8"><sup>8</sup></a>
against us. If her authority moves you, gentlemen, I am
content to say just this in the first part of my case, that her
words are read out by both sides.</p>
