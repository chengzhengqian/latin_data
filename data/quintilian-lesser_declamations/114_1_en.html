<p>〚This is what could be said by a good and loving
brother: Even if it be dangerous, it is worth it for me. I am
not so much motivated by military glory or the fame of victory:
I have to avenge my brothers. Or shall I, who a little
while ago bore arms under a lesser<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_235_4" id="target_note_LCL500_235_4"><sup>4</sup></a> oath (my country and

<p>I should follow your counsel if I were afraid. But there

blush for, is this: the poor man does not forbid his son to
fight. How much extra courage do you give him by your
fear! But perhaps this very confidence makes him more
