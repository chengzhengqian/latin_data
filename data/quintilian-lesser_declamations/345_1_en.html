all we have experienced in the community but all the stories
on the stage, how many are the works of this emotion,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_225_21a" id="target_note_LCL501_225_21a"><sup>21</sup></a>
how many the persons whom it has driven off course
as by a hurricane. When I say “he is the husband of another
woman,” I say two things at once: he has a reason both for
wanting to harm this one that he divorced and for wishing
to help the one he married. All this I should say if that
testimony were his. What does your witness say? That he
knows something. It follows that I ask his source: “that foster
mother.” So it is the foster mother’s testimony. Hearsay
is not evidence. Let us dismiss the husband for the present
(we shall bring him back in his place), let us speak of the
foster mother.</p>
<p>If she had lied from the outset, what I dare to say
against him I should dare all the more to say against her:
she is on her own. As it is, we have two separate torturings.
Let us see which is more likely to have told the truth. Under
torture she said he was your son. Let me add authority
to the torments: an old woman was tortured. Is not
one torturing sufficient, considering the sex and age? You
stretch limbs already failing by themselves and lacerate
with lashes a skin already falling apart, and you say: “you’re
lying.” Can she lie so long against your will? Even when the
stoutest are tortured, even when the harshest pain assails
the courageous, yet it makes a deal of difference what reply
the torturer wants to get. She holds out, I won’t say
against fire, I won’t say against stripes, but against &lt;you&gt;.</p>

Theseus in the <span class="italic">Hippolytus</span> is an apposite example. But is the declaimer not off at a tangent? S.28 makes love for the
present wife Father I’s motive (cf. also s.22). What he says about
the dramas could at least as well apply to that emotion, especially
in Euripides</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL501_225_21a').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
