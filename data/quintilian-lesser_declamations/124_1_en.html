placing &lt;himself&gt; above the laws he placed himself outside
them. Killing a human being is forbidden: killing a tyrant is
allowed. It is unlawful to break into a house: the best
among us will break into a castle. A plotter against a citizen
will pay a penalty to the laws even if he has not effected the
crime: but whoever does this same against a tyrant will be
praised, even if he is caught first. Your law applies to persons
who ought in general to be buried, and that is clear

hand that dragged his own, the strength his own: seeing
that his crimes and outrages have been condemned by the
immortal gods themselves, seeing that the deities did not
tolerate our patience and servitude, shall he be accorded
honor? Was that what he who hurled the bolt desired? Was
that in his mind when he attacked that accursed creature
with his sacred flames? Was it not enough that the tyrant
