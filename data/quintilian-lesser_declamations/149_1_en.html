have foreseen this ambush.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_305_1" id="target_note_LCL500_305_1"><sup>1</sup></a> The questions are as follows:
as regards the law of parricide, is it sufficient to prove that
this was the defendant’s intention? Was it his intention?</p>
<span class="label"><span class="sc">declamation</span></span>
<p>First answer me this, was your get-up that of a man about
to kill? It will do you no good to say, “I didn’t do it.” Intention
is never to be judged by outcome. Even somebody
who ran at his father with drawn sword and was restrained
could say: “I didn’t kill him.” If I had caught poison prepared,
you would say: “I didn’t kill him.” Indeed, if this defense
is allowed, even someone who has hired an assassin
can say that he didn’t commit murder.</p>
<p>It is enough therefore to prove parricidal mind. It remains
for you to consider whether this man had such a
mind. If an inference had to be made clandestinely, I
should say the young man was infamous, I should say, “He
was disowned, and if he was innocent, he will have the
more reason to be angry.” But why weaken my case by talking?
Imagine that you are on a watchtower, looking at what
took place. The disowned son is in a lonely spot, the spot is
opportune for an ambush. He has a sword, instrument of
parricide. He goes up to his father and raises his hand,
says, “I ask.” “Ask,” do I say? Rather, he orders; for there
are no pleas where there is no freedom to refuse. Look at
the minds of each of us, and, if you will, mine first. I did not
doubt that you were going to kill me and therefore I, the
stern father, could not say no. For the rest, question your
own minds, what an armed man who is asking will do if he
is refused. There are two possibilities, I think, between
which the question seems to lie: if he had not gained his
point, he would have either killed or died. I don’t say which
