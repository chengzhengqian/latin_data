<p>A man agreed with his elder brother that the latter take
over their common paternal land and settle all debts.
When a law was passed canceling debts, he claims half the
land. The other opposes.</p>

<p>The land which I say we held in common belonged to our
father. He left two children. Their legal rights were equal,
&lt;their properties were the same,&gt; their burden of debt the
same, that is to say, as things now stand, zero.</p>
<p>He says: “You made over to me.” If I had done so unconditionally,
if no reservation could be set against this
phrase of yours, I should say: “You cheated your brother
and it was not difficult—your younger brother.” But if I
made over to your single self, not constrained by any violence
or trick, all that our father had left us, you should be
grateful for my good intention. That would be how to talk
to a brother. But since you strip off that name and summon
us only to law, I made over under a condition; for let us talk
like non-relations. Let it be fair that we go by what I said
when we agreed to the bargain. And what was that? You
were to own the land provided, I think, that you paid your
father’s debts. So up to this point you have had no personal
ownership of this land because whatever items are handed
over conditionally can only become personal and peculiar
if the condition has been fulfilled. So the land was common
