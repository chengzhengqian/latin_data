youthful rashness I handed the commonwealth back to the
laws and the sovereignty &lt;of the people&gt;, I had no doubt
that a great deal of annoyance hung over me, whether from
the angry or the malicious. For this prosecutor does not
come to court in hatred of a future tyranny, nor do I believe
that I am in any danger from the charge that is leveled at
me. Therefore from the start of my plea and throughout
my address, what I think I have to do as much as anything is
to invoke public good faith. What you forgave, what you
thought best forgotten, let it not stop short merely at words
and the initial promise, but let it appear that you gave me
something that came from the depth (?) of your hearts and
minds.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_191_1" id="target_note_LCL500_191_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>As for the rest, it will be found to lie far from any suspicion
of plotting tyranny; rather, it will rather point to repentance
for times past. My tears * * *<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_191_2" id="target_note_LCL500_191_2"><sup>2</sup></a> since I still have to
win pardon in the minds of many and bear up against their
malignity. All this the castle did to me. Or can I <span class="italic">not</span> weep
whenever I think of my ancestors, of the fame of my house,
of the hopes that I ruined, as I perceive, for ever by the unhappy
rashness of youth and criminal ambition? For my
prosecutor has no need to try to bring up the past against
me under some sort of pretence,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_191_3" id="target_note_LCL500_191_3"><sup>3</sup></a> in oblique malignity. I
know, gentlemen, and confess that I did what I regret having
done, and as long as I live this will ever stick fast in &lt;all&gt;
