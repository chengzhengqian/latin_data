rich?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_213_6" id="target_note_LCL500_213_6"><sup>6</sup></a> Am I lying just in order to live with two tortured
slaves, if indeed they survive the torture, as I did in exile, as
I did when I was escaping the tyrant, or if not so, then
alone? If I am accusing my friend falsely, I can pay no
heavier penalty: I lose whatever I claim. And what reason
did I have for being angry with you? What harm did you
ever do me so serious that I am not content with your torments?</p>
<p>I know that the other side has a somewhat similar point:
what use will he have for the money? To begin with, this is
not similar, because to a poor man anyway and the father of
two children (something that exacerbates poverty) money
hidden away secretly at least brings security. You may not
acquire possessions, you may not buy slaves or live in a
larger house, but at least you are safe against fortune; the
money lets you be a poor man who does not have to worry.
Add that you think about times long ahead.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_213_7" id="target_note_LCL500_213_7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>In fine,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_213_8" id="target_note_LCL500_213_8"><sup>8</sup></a> you can at least see some sense in it, if you win;
but why should <span class="italic">I</span> go to law? To get something from you?
What do you have other than the deposit? I know, gentlemen,
that I have lost this money. For even if you find him
guilty, how am I going to put my hands on it? He will persist
in his pretence—a man who did not yield even to torture.
My whole reason for this suit is to defend my honor.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_213_9" id="target_note_LCL500_213_9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>But you now, find where I have hidden it. Don’t you
know? Search. These slaves did not leave me, they know all
