this could you prevent her marrying me? I say therefore
that it was by your will that your daughter was raped. How
do I infer this? The man who raped her did not love her.
Granted that he courted her: he did not redeem her, in
face of this stipulation he did not redeem her. Out with it!
He yielded her to me. So you cannot reasonably think that
he was urged by lust: he could do without her. I’ll add that
he would not have raped her unless he had felt safe. I say
nothing of paternal severity, nothing of the law’s menace
in defense of chastity, its threat of death: would he have
raped a girl intended for another man, engaged to another
man, unless he relied on you? It is not credible. But neither
is it credible that your daughter would have opted for

have been so ungrateful as to opt for marriage to a man
who had not redeemed her and desert her engagement to
the man to whom she owed liberty and life. I say this over
and above the distress of the injury, when she had suffered
in the community what she had not suffered among those
brigands, those barbarians. It is not credible, as I have said,
either that he did the rape without relying on you—a man
who did not love her and had every reason to fear—or that
she opted without your authority—a girl, against a man
who had deserved so well of her and in favor of one who
had despised her and raped her. I think your intention was
clear. If it is apparent, I was swindled by you.</p>
