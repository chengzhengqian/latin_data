<p>We have to establish two things: that he had an accomplice
and that he had this accomplice.</p>
<span class="label"><span class="sc">declamation</span></span>
<p>I know, gentlemen of the jury, that you may wonder why
this man is being examined in court. For the law had envisaged
that an accomplice<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_431_1" id="target_note_LCL500_431_1"><sup>1</sup></a> ought rather to be searched for
through torture. But since the law has been countered by
villainy, it remains that he stand trial.</p>
<p>And to begin with I say that it is impossible that the traitor
did not have accomplices. Look at nature,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_431_2" id="target_note_LCL500_431_2"><sup>2</sup></a> look at the
magnitude of the crime. To betray the people, the community,
the army, is not one man’s work. I need not labor this
point. The law which orders him<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_431_3" id="target_note_LCL500_431_3"><sup>3</sup></a> to be tortured until he
reveals his accomplices makes no doubt that there are accomplices.
For it saw how much loyalty (in a way) there
was among criminals, how long they kept silent. So the text
runs, not “let the traitor be tortured,” but “be tortured until
he reveals his accomplices.” So true it is that he who
has not yet “revealed” is still not considered as tortured.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_431_4" id="target_note_LCL500_431_4"><sup>4</sup></a>
Therefore, as our ancestors thought, he had accomplices.</p>
<p>Let us see whom he had. Let us suppose that no act was
detected, no sign of complicity, that he died before he was
tortured: let us ask whom he had as accomplices. Ought we
not to recommend this line of enquiry: whom did he have
as a friend? He should not have entrusted knowledge of so
great a matter lightly. Long intercourse, old friendship
