<p>This guardian will say<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_325_2" id="target_note_LCL501_325_2"><sup>2</sup></a> that there were certain enemies of
both who were aggrieved from the start that the guardianship
had not been left to themselves, and, having been shut
out from this plunder, put off their hopes until the final day
of the guardianship, in order to swindle the raw, inexperienced
youth of the ward by their frauds. Himself, however,
had duly rendered accounts of his trust. But fearing that
the ward, once he let him go, would be swindled by the
frauds and snares of his enemies, he had kept him in his
