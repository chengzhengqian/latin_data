on which the charge is based must be examined. I
brought my daughter before the magistrate. What does
this by itself have to do with bringing death? I told her to
opt for death. Take away the fact that he was a rapist, that
the law requires a rapist to be killed,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_221_3" id="target_note_LCL500_221_3"><sup>3</sup></a> that the girl opted for
death: what I did in itself could not bring death to a human
being. What did I do? Something harmless, if he had done
nothing. For imagine that the following could have happened:
I have brought my daughter forward, I have commanded
her to opt for death; let us assume he does not
know who the girl brought before the magistrate really is:
if he can say “I did no such thing,” what I did will have done
no hurt. So what was the cause of death for him? That he
committed rape, that the law lays down death. And this is
clear almost by the admission of my opponents: they are
not going to law with the girl who opted. Not that I am so
cruel and crazy as to put my daughter in my danger to save
myself, but I may use this argument since she too is safe.
For the same things that are said by me would be said by
her: “I opted for death; but would this have hurt if I had
done it against anyone else?” Imagine that somebody in
the crowd of bystanders is arrested; she opts for his death:
will he be killed? I don’t think so. So the option itself is not
a cause of death, but that on account of which the option
has force. My daughter is safe with this defense and by the
prosecution’s own admission, as I have said, secure. What
additional point do I have besides all this? One further
plea: not only do I say, “If he had not committed rape, I
would not have been a cause of death,” but this too: “If my
daughter had not obeyed me, I would not have been a
cause of death.”</p>
