policy if more desert? Not at all. For if those who don’t
have courage to wage war against us find no place in our
community, they will often advocate giving up the war. As
it is, they are privately taking counsel for their individual
selves. There is &lt;no&gt; great dynamic in individuals; but if
this hope<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_105_6" id="target_note_LCL500_105_6"><sup>6</sup></a> is cut off, all will advocate what individuals are
doing.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_105_7" id="target_note_LCL500_105_7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>I should say all this even if there were no danger from
these people. But as it is, I cannot help confessing my anxiety.
Whenever I cast my eyes around and measure particular
parts of our encampment, I see alien dress, alien arms,
just as though the enemy had invaded our rampart. They
come and go in our houses, our temples, our walls, right in
the very heart of the commonwealth. Whether they want
to do some harm I shall consider later; meanwhile, they
have the power. Done by individuals I considered that a
crime; done by a few, it’s a hope; done by a large number it
becomes a conspiracy. Upon my word, it’s a new sort of tactic.
No need to dig tunnels and excavate earth with enormous
labor so as to emerge all of a sudden through hidden
passages into the middle of the community, no need to buy
a traitor and barter money for crime: openly, open-eyed, or
rather gleefully, we have taken the enemy into our vitals.
You will judge whether their coming through in such numbers
one by one ought to make you suspicious: no one
would have let them in if they had come all together. Did
they all despair? Did they all choose to take counsel &lt;for
themselves&gt; and look ahead? Is it so much easier to desert
than just to go away? Did they all leave wives in their community
