uncompromised. The law is written publicly, that a person committing
injury in a temple pay ten thousand to the community.
This is enough for me. I am bringing action on the
community’s behalf. But the other side wants the whole
law read by us. “Ten thousand,” it says, “to the person injured,
ten thousand to the community.” And he is trying to
exclude the community on the ground that the person
injured is barred from bringing action himself: quite insolently
and audaciously, in line with his characteristic effrontery
towards your magistrates, an attempt to bar the
community as though it were under stigma. I imagine it
will readily be agreed that the legal status of the person injured
has nothing to do with our action. Let us suppose
that a person not under stigma had been beaten in a temple,
but had forgiven the injury or had not wanted to take
action because of some other impediment, shall the community
too on that account not maintain its right, with the
result that he<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_177_1" id="target_note_LCL500_177_1"><sup>1</sup></a> goes scot-free after all he has done?</p>
<p>But my opponent himself has less confidence in the exclusion
than in the actual interpretation of injury. He says
it is not injury because he beat a person under stigma, who
is barred from taking action. For my part, gentlemen, I
think there is a great gap between what it is lawful to commit
and what it is not lawful to punish. If action is not given
to a person under stigma, it does not follow that everybody
may do what he likes to such a person. To beat a person under
stigma is like committing a theft without a witness; he
cannot be condemned, but ought not to have committed it.</p>
<p>Why, from the very fact that a person under stigma is
not allowed to take action it is evident that the commonwealth
