not be deceived: they told the truth, there had been no violation.
They had thought they would be loved more than
ever; but they stumbled into offense. Or perhaps we are
being played with in our turn and the father is testing us
with a lie like our own &lt;and&gt; threatening us because we

be disowned. A somewhat bolder girl would have refused
even to marry except a man of her choice: this one submitted
herself to your command, married at her father’s discretion.
Matrimony already in effect should be championed

whom she came by laws and magistrates and oath.”</p>
