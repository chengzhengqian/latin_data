flocks of servants, the gold and silver. So the service came
from my own resources. For poor folk that is not unbecoming;
if you had happened in at some other time of day, you
would likewise have thought she was a slave: you would
have seen her spinning. Well then, my daughter waited on
us, as she usually does for me. If I had not been afraid of
your thinking that I was embarrassing you, if you had not
done me honor with frequent courtesies, <span class="italic">I</span> would have
been waiter. Here too, take away what you did.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_391_10" id="target_note_LCL500_391_10"><sup>10</sup></a> It is

committed rape, could I have been taxed with fraud? So
what you are demanding is that I be guilty not because of
what I did but because of what you did.</p>
<p>Come then, there is no guilt in the thing itself, but the
intention is suspect. Well, consider. Is it credible that I
acted with fraudulent intent? Did I invite you in order that
you should commit rape? For of course there could be no
doubt that you would ask who was waiting on us, and, when
you had asked, it was certain that a desire would immediately
enter your mind and that once you had formed the
desire you would rape!<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_391_14" id="target_note_LCL500_391_14"><sup>14</sup></a> If all this could not be foreseen by
