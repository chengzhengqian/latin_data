<p>“Whoso brings a capital charge and fails to convict, let him
be capitally punished himself.” This is the law governing
the trial, this it is under which I accuse this man. This it is
that shall take the life<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_153_2" id="target_note_LCL501_153_2"><sup>2</sup></a> of one or other of these two. So I accuse

to actual equity. Many things will therefore often be found
that are not covered by the words of laws but are covered
