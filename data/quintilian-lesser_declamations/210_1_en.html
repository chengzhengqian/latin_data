mother by arguing not only that she conceived, that she
picked up, but that a husband never tells a wife to expose a
child unless she is going to rear him.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_427_20" id="target_note_LCL500_427_20"><sup>20</sup></a> Assign her whatever
feelings you like: if she wanted to keep him, she recognizes
him, no problem; if she didn’t, she would have exposed
him in such a way that he would not be reared. And yet,

age has more blandishments.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_427_21" id="target_note_LCL500_427_21"><sup>21</sup></a> Oh, what torture she endured
from other people’s children! Some boy makes up to
her: “He’s like mine would have been.” Some handsome
lad is commended: “He’s like the one I lost.” The pain
grows daily: “He would now be seen in the Forum, now be

wife for him.” But now the hero applies goads at closer
quarters.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_427_22" id="target_note_LCL500_427_22"><sup>22</sup></a> Should she say he wasn’t hers? Mothers show
you to their children. I suppose she’s afraid that married
women wouldn&lt;n’t&gt; flock to him!<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_427_23" id="target_note_LCL500_427_23"><sup>23</sup></a> If she confessed to
being your mother, perhaps you would have opted for
something to honor her. It surprises me that she doesn’t
take advantage of your mistake; and she would, if she believed
it <span class="italic">was</span> a mistake.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_427_24" id="target_note_LCL500_427_24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>So when she refuses to marry, she realizes her age, sees
how ill-matched you two are. Even marrying may involve a
sort of wantonness. She would now be sleeping apart from
her husband, at all events if a son of this age came between.
If she is ever able to marry in any fashion at her time of
life, I shall say: “The woman is lewd, and she must be hurting
