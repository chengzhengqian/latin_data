<p class="noindent">Had that draught killed me, the entire community would
have borne me to the pyre, sung my praises. Even the time
gap would have brought much admiration. People would
have said: “We should never have borne all this<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_25_6" id="target_note_LCL500_25_6"><sup>6</sup></a> if he
had lived.” “Ah, but,” she says, “I meant well.” Take shame,
you mothers who embraced your children in arms but
are made unnatural now by the example of mine!<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_25_7" id="target_note_LCL500_25_7"><sup>7</sup></a> In the
whole community was found &lt;one&gt; more loving, one that
spared: my stepmother! I say nothing as yet of what followed,
nothing of the insult of that trial. But in the meanwhile,
could anything harder to bear have befallen me?
Gods and goddesses, what an opportunity I lost! God had
given me the opportunity to double my deserts. The day
had come to show that my former bravery was not Fortune’s
doing. Happy my comrades! You saw the enemy’s
back, trod on his corpses, brought back the public victory
in a shout of joy; but as for me, “when are we to fight?” I
asked, and after finally enduring that long night of my stepmother’s
making, I was unsteady in mind and feet and
my accuser informed me that my countrymen had won
the day.</p>
<p>I think that I already to a great extent established my
case at the recent trial. For how was I acquitted except by
telling my accuser: “I was held by force and a mind in
chains”?</p>
