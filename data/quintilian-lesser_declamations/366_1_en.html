The initiative is yours: you promised. If it was not in your
power, the swindle was immediate. No doubt I was a fool
to bring back a virgin, to take such good care of her modesty
that I could &lt;not&gt; be opted for. I shall not boast of my
self-restraint to you, gentlemen, as though it was the only
factor. Doubtless I wanted to bring her father a gift untouched
and not to taint what I gave, but the girl’s morals
counted for something. I saw that she was strict and
straightlaced. She would not have taken it even from me.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_267_9" id="target_note_LCL501_267_9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>

<h2>344</h2>
<span class="label">Prostitute redeemed by rich man for poor man’s son</span>
<p>Let there be an action for unwritten wrongdoing. The sons
of a poor man and a rich man were in love with the same
prostitute. Her pimp made a stipulation, that he would
hand over the prostitute to the one who was first to bring
the price. The rich man found the poor man’s son in a
lonely place weeping, with his sword drawn. He asked the
reason. The other said he wanted to die for love of the
prostitute. He gave him the price. The young man redeemed
the prostitute. The poor man prosecutes the rich
man on a charge of unwritten wrongdoing.</p>
