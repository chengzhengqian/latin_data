<p>But if he preferred to claim his son, the mere exposition
of the case would give him support enough. For he was at
one time desirous of children and for that reason married a
wife and congratulated her in the hope of imminent delivery
and brought up the child and without any misgiving
(which is enough) brought him to early manhood. The
husband has done my client grievous injury, gentlemen,
but I shall more willingly denounce the stepmother. She
knew what she was about when she broke into an old
man’s house, already occupied by a marriage, in which
there was a youthful son, she knew that his house could be
emptied. Don’t ask her plan, her method.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_219_9" id="target_note_LCL501_219_9"><sup>9</sup></a> [She is alone.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_219_10" id="target_note_LCL501_219_10"><sup>10</sup></a>]

any suit, first gave evidence against himself: he said he
had exposed the child, presumably to spare the other the
shame of being a bad father. I call the gods to witness, I call
your oath, gentlemen, to witness: this person, who himself
wanted to drive out his son, thought it was not enough &lt;to
