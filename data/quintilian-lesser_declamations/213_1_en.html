brings it about that someone comes into fellowship with
crime. So do you deny that you were the traitor’s friend? If
I now ask you why you gave the poison, you will answer: “I
could not watch the torments for a third time: I thought it
was my limbs, my flesh being torn.” For friendships are
joined by similarity of character; somehow or other the
eyes<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_433_5" id="target_note_LCL500_433_5"><sup>5</sup></a> of men’s minds see and recognize, and nobody can
love in another except what he silently approves. Nor is
this gregariousness found only in mankind: if dumb animals
are brought together, the species will still coalesce.
You were his friend, you shared work and play with him.
You cannot be thought not to have approved of things that
were within your knowledge (?).<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_433_6" id="target_note_LCL500_433_6"><sup>6</sup></a> You were a traitor’s
friend: that’s more than if you said you were his accomplice.
“But he was tortured twice and still denied.” You
give me a reason why you were so much his friend. Upon
my word, an example worthy of a nobler setting: you risked
your life to spare him further torture, he suffered torture
twice rather than give your name. He that does not inform
confesses that he was a friend. “Twice tortured, he denied.”
I’ll say nothing about the variety of the tortures.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_433_7" id="target_note_LCL500_433_7"><sup>7</sup></a> A
man who could still be tortured had not been tortured.
<span class="italic">That</span> would have been the examination you feared, that
would have been the one. 〚It is hard for sick bodies to endure
against pain, but easy when consciousness is unimpaired
to persist in a mind-set once assumed. That is why
the art was invented; those night thoughts torture, that remembering
of the past, that expectancy of things to come.
The examination is really serious when wounds are beaten,
