<p>At the beginning of the controversy is the common topic:
“I seek my reward as allowed by law without exception.”
Follows the point that it is just furthermore that a hero opt
for anything he wants. The second question is whether he
has license to opt against the law. Here we are accustomed
to say that no reward can be found which is not in conflict
with some law, and that the power of heroes is great because
it transcends all laws.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_185_2" id="target_note_LCL500_185_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Then we shall further set the
laws against each other and determine which it is more in
the public interest to preserve if one of them must necessarily
be invalidated. After that we shall come to another
question, whether that bar should always be valid absolutely,
that is, whether the provision against going to law
twice about the same matter applies in public cases also.
Here this will be said: in private suits, since they are of less
moment and more numerous, this law is a recourse,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_185_3" id="target_note_LCL500_185_3"><sup>3</sup></a> but
public cases are too important to fail by exception.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_185_4" id="target_note_LCL500_185_4"><sup>4</sup></a> Finally,
this will follow: we shall say that even if in other public
cases it is not legal to go to law twice about the same matter,
this is not so in a case of treason, since in all others perhaps
it is only the punishment and peril of the accused that
is in question, whereas in a case of treason the litigation
concerns a danger to the whole community. Let us &lt;also&gt;
ask whether this demurrer pertains only to adversaries,
and it is legal to go to law twice with the consent of the
accused.</p>
