<p>This is an action for unwritten wrongdoing.</p>
<p>Since my opponent puts most of his defense into his
denial that unwritten wrongdoing is involved, the matter
could have been settled by a brief stipulation: let him
say under what other law I could have taken him to court.
As it is, he comes up with a cunning strategy, old, long
since thought out: he refers the law,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_71_2" id="target_note_LCL500_71_2"><sup>2</sup></a> not to the defendant,
but to the offense, and, as though my only complaint was
about my daughter’s lost virginity, he recites the law written
against rapists. Now even if I were prosecuting the
man who did the rape, I could go to law to prove unwritten
wrongdoing, not content with the ten thousand I was paid.
For the law that required the rapist to pay ten thousand for
filched virginity was written against those who did nothing
else. But these cases differ as to personae and times and
places. A citizen who has been beaten will prosecute for injuries,
but if he is a magistrate he will tie the man up in a
charge of lese-majesty, if he is an envoy he will be avenged
by war or international law. And the same money stolen
from a private individual will be theft, but stolen from a
shrine or temple it will be sacrilege. By the same token, the
rapist of a female who will be avenging nothing but her virginity
will pay ten thousand, but the case of a man who
raped at the hustings or who raped a candidate for a priesthood
(or rather, not to be unthankful for the people’s favor,
one who, so far as lay in them, had already been given it)
will be different. It is a long argument, because I am&lt;not&gt;
speaking only of the injury done by the parasite to prove
this case. But you ought not to recite to me the law which
