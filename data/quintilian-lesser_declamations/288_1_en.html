at once: “To whom?” Academic<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_111_4" id="target_note_LCL501_111_4"><sup>4</sup></a> controversies have the
disadvantage that they cannot answer certain questions.
But some disadvantages of this sort sometimes even come
down to the Forum; and so we must make use even of the
difficulties.</p>
<span class="label"><span class="sc">declamation</span></span>
<p>So it’s not due to you. Remains that it’s due to somebody.
“It does not remain,” you say, “that it’s due to <span class="italic">her</span>.” The inheritance
was left to you in trust. What do we think was the
reason for so leaving it? The persona to whom it should be
restored must be weak. When I say “weak,” don’t I say
in the same breath “weaker than yourself”? Shall we not
judge from you of the weakness of the persona’s condition?
He made a poor man his heir. So a persona has to be found
who can be under your tutelage, to whom he would have
left the inheritance with less security than to you. So the
weak persona should be that of a woman, and if anything
can be additional to this weakness, a poor woman. I am
here for this woman. I have taken an inference from your
persona, I’ll take one from ours. I’ll say that the rich man’s
intention was to leave her his heir. To whom does he leave
on trust? He made the husband his heir. So if we can find
no weaker persona to be substituted for you nor any more
familiar to him than yours, it is credible that the will was so
written for that reason.</p>

<p>Some arguments are to be sought even from disadvantages.</p>
