me if she is not my mother.” The only origin of the falsehood
is that she admittedly did an exposing. Well, it’s seldom
that exposed children live. We humans are fragile
creatures at our beginnings. The offspring of wild animals
and cattle get going straight away, rush to the dugs, but
with us the baby has to be picked up and protected against
the cold. Even so there is often a slip between parents’
hands and foster-mother’s lap. How should we be so lucky
that death doesn’t come to a baby when invited?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_425_18" id="target_note_LCL500_425_18"><sup>18</sup></a> Put before
your eyes a boy, neglected from the start, who would
be better off dying at home; then his naked body under the

moved to tears. No mortal could forgive you if you had not
been doing as you were ordered. But it is a different story
with those for whom the poverty of their exposers seeks for

he claim the estate for you? Why is he silent about it for so
many years? Or is he waiting until he can’t prove it? Come,
what would have happened if the mother had died too?
