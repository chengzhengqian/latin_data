the rapist himself but also to the person who married, who
certainly did nothing wrong, who certainly could stay at
home.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_299_10" id="target_note_LCL500_299_10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>At this point I encounter the objection that he could not
have been brought up earlier. As though it mattered to the
case <span class="italic">why</span> the right lapsed: “The rapist had fled,” he says. I
know the easiest answer: he should have pursued him,
sought him out: if this distress, this indignation had been
genuine, he would not have let the thing go. The rapist did
not benefit by his flight but by your permission to return.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_299_11" id="target_note_LCL500_299_11"><sup>11</sup></a>
For perhaps you had been content with this very punishment
of exile, believed yourself sufficiently avenged. Nor
need we be afraid of allowing rapists the example of flight
if subsequent option against them not be possible. For this

who remains will still be able to hope for marriage even

suffer exile.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_299_12" id="target_note_LCL500_299_12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>

does not and thinks that the right is not against him at this
point.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_299_13a" id="target_note_LCL500_299_13a"><sup>13</sup></a> If I could not explain to you, gentlemen, how important
my claim is to me, I should still reply: “Nobody is
forbidden to speak on behalf of the law. Perhaps the two of
you have an understanding (that is what worries me most):
nevertheless, I shall speak for law, I shall speak for equity.”
But what if this, as I said just now,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_299_14" id="target_note_LCL500_299_14"><sup>14</sup></a> concerns me rather
