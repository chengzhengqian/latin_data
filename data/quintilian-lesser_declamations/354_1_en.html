<p>What will happen to this boy if he is returned to his master?
Doubtless &lt;the worst&gt;. We know this business of
yours, we see trials for this kind of injury in the Forum
all the time. Perhaps he was actually born free, perhaps
Fortune gave him back the praetexta after he had been
snatched from some shore. But there’s something that upsets
me more: the slave-dealer thinks the boy valuable, was
afraid that he would be assessed<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_243_6" id="target_note_LCL501_243_6"><sup>6</sup></a> at a high figure. Such
looks would be pitiable in any sort of slavery. We ask you,
gentlemen, to think how many things an angry slave-dealer
can do to a boy. Either perhaps he will stretch<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_243_7" id="target_note_LCL501_243_7"><sup>7</sup></a> his price by
cutting out his virility or because of his years, open as they
are to abuse, he will be sold into some brothel. We are
dealing with a man who doesn’t blush, who stops at nothing;
he is greedy even to the point of danger. What sort of
dress will he get—he that had a praetexta? In my support I
also bring you the very holiness of the gown: priests and
magistrates are clothed in it, by it we make the weakness of
boyhood sacred and revered.</p>
