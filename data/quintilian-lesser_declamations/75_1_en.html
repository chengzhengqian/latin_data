<p>It is clear that this man divorced his wife. It remains for
him to bring some charge against the woman he has divorced.
For divorce can only be rightful if the divorcée
has deserved it. The husband himself is not so impudent
(though he doesn’t lack audacity) as to make up any misdoing
against his wife. His defense is necessity.</p>
<p>I could say that &lt;necessity is one thing,&gt; right another.
For the law of wrongful divorce regards both parties,
and it is not enough to look at what the husband ought
to have done but we must also look at what the wife ought
to have suffered. Therefore, although you have divorced
her of necessity, she has been divorced wrongfully. This I
should say if the divorce had not happened through your
fault. 〚But I am surprised if in this community, so careful
of legality as it is, any law was written in conflict with any
other law, or if the very wise men who constituted our legal
system did not see this. How is anything necessary that was
not right?〛 “A woman was raped,” he says, “and opted for
marrying me.” This is not like saying “The tyrant forced
me” or like saying “Somebody empowered by the commonwealth
gave the order, the senate or the people considered
it to be in the public interest”: it was <span class="italic">your</span> doing
that the raped woman forced you to divorce, that you could
be forced. And you are out in your reckoning as to the actual
time of the divorce. Do you believe that your wife was
divorced when she was told to keep her own property and
leave the house? No, you divorced your wife when you
committed rape, when you gave this woman the power of
the law against yourself, when you acted so that she you
raped had as much license against you as against a bachelor.
“Let a woman raped opt for the rapist’s death or marriage”:
that was the power the woman you violated had
