victed more than once. They have their own forms,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_159_8" id="target_note_LCL501_159_8"><sup>8</sup></a> their
own number of jurors,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_159_9" id="target_note_LCL501_159_9"><sup>9</sup></a> their own president, their own
times,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_159_10" id="target_note_LCL501_159_10"><sup>10</sup></a> their own names. So tell me, you that contend you
were accused on a capital charge, under what law you were
a defendant. “Injuries.” Here I can ask the jury themselves
whether action for injuries is capital. But why should I ask
the jury? I ask you yourself: is a person convicted of injuries
put to death? I don’t think you will have the effrontery
so to contend. Anyway I shall say: you were convicted
once, you were convicted twice: that this was not a capital
trial is evident from the mere fact that you are alive.</p>
<p>“But the thing will have the same result,” he says, “as if I
had been convicted of a capital crime, and we must apply
whatever formulation comes closest, a sort of similitude of
the law.” Here this ceases to be a private dispute. For if a
prosecutor is allowed to constitute statutes and pass laws,
and if what could formerly be done only through the people
and the senate is now laid down among the benches<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_159_11" id="target_note_LCL501_159_11"><sup>11</sup></a>
according to individual passion and influence, votes will be
superfluous, as will all the campaigning that goes on in
constituting the law. The question before these gentlemen
is not whether it is fair. We have come to court only to examine
whether I am liable under this law. “But it is right
and just that like offenses be covered by like punishment.”
Call the senate, call the people. Perhaps the law should
be amended. Meanwhile, we live by this law and use it.
〚Many laws are deceptive, but they were not drafted to
mislead through ignorance.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_159_12" id="target_note_LCL501_159_12"><sup>12</sup></a>〛</p>
