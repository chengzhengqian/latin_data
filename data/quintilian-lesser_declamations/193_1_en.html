what cause had you to rape? It was her get-up that lured
you, I suppose! That is often an extra, on top of beauty.
Well, she waited on us so dressed that I had to lie and say
she was a slave.</p>
<p>But (you allow me some degree of freedom) were you
raping her as a slave? Would you have raped a slave belonging
to your dinner-host of a little while back? But no, you
didn’t believe she was a slave. You might perhaps condescend
so far as to not look down on poor folk, but your lust
will never stoop to chattels. And if by chance she had taken
your fancy, what need was there for force? Should you not
have tempted her with some little present? If she was contumacious,
wouldn’t you, courteous gentleman that you
are, have asked her master to let you have her? So you
could have known even before you started to rape her. But
in the actual assault was it not evident to you that she was
no slave? Didn’t she fight back like a free woman? Did she
not cry out “father”? Didn’t you hear a word that sounded
like a freeborn (?) girl? It simply had to break out—the
free birth that was to go before the magistrates.</p>
<p>I am much mistaken if this whole case has not been
judged. For if I had committed any fraud, you should have
spoken before the magistrate: “I was cheated, I thought
she was a slave.” But you acknowledged a rapist’s constraint.</p>
<p>I don’t suppose you bring it against me that she opted
for a wedding. But I don’t expect you to be grateful, just as
I don’t even take satisfaction in this marriage. A son-in-law
with whom I could live on equal terms and whose wife
would wait at table if I happened to be dining with him
would have suited me better. But you, what did you lose by
this “fraud”? You don’t have a rich wife: don’t you stand in
