part of it look to the persons themselves of whom I speak,
part to the commonwealth as a whole.</p>
<p>Against them I am content to say this: we went to war
against Philip for the freedom of all Greece, for the common
welfare. For although at the present time we appeared
to be championing a friendly community,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_235_5" id="target_note_LCL501_235_5"><sup>5</sup></a> with
which we had ties of long standing, yet the result of the war
concerned everybody. And this, Athenians, is our ancient
tradition, handed down by our ancestors, to take a stand
for the whole of Greece. So once and again we fought the
Persians, defending the public welfare with our private resources.
So from this it is surely already evident that you
ought to have fought with courage as great and spirit as
ardent as ever in the past. For we were not up against
some enemy &lt;from&gt; Greece, such that even vanquished
we should at least be under similar laws and the same
tongue; but a barbarian, cruel and hostile. But what need
to dwell on all that? It was our decision to fight and still is.
So in this battle, which as I have said, we had taken up on
behalf of the whole of Greece, I won’t say yet<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_235_6" id="target_note_LCL501_235_6"><sup>6</sup></a> how gravely
the cowardice of these men has damaged us; meanwhile,
take note of the outlook underlying it.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_235_7" id="target_note_LCL501_235_7"><sup>7</sup></a> In war to conquer is
far the happiest issue; the bravest, if victory is not granted,
is to die for our cause. There is, however, a third, intermediate
between honor &lt;and disgrace&gt;, to return at least to
one’s country and, if it be granted to win the day, to escape.
He that took that course can be believed to have reserved
himself for a second fight and laid up his courage, defeated
by adversity. But he that has given himself to the enemy
