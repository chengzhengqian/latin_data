tolerable if the question were whether the girl should have
made <span class="italic">this</span> option. As it is, they are out to stop any option,
and they rely on a novel and perverse plea, that the girl
ought not to opt for the rapist’s property because she cannot
opt for anything except the property.</p>
<p>“Well, but it is unfair that she should get the rapist’s
death <span class="italic">and</span> his property.” But that is to say that if she opted
for death she ought not to opt for the property. For if we
say that she got both the rapist’s death and his property, it

the rapist perished, although I could say “she made no option
and the law has not been satisfied,” his false quibble
would still have made some sense at least. As it is, what did
the girl do to cause the rapist’s death? So she is not so much
concerned to take the rapist’s property, she is somewhat
more concerned to show you what she would have opted
for if he had been alive. For the law unquestionably established
two penalties against the rapist, one &lt;cruel, the
other merciful&gt;, and the lenient and moderate penalty is
not always preferred to that cruel and sanguinary one. Today
anyway would she not deservedly be blamed by you
and by the community if by not opting for something else
she had shown that the rapist had done what she herself
had been going to opt for?</p>
<p>From this point they pass on to guesswork and want you
to suspect what they are unable to prove. “For,” they say, “it
is not credible that the rapist would have perished if he had
not known that the girl would opt for this.” To start with,
