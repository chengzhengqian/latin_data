what you ask you will owe more to someone else. That
better, gentler father, I suppose, will put my indulgence to
shame! But I should yield more readily if he were angry.
Has anyone whose daughter has been raped ever been
won over so soon? Who is that lunatic? What is that all too
cozy agreement between you? What does it mean that he
does not think he has received an injury? That he behaves
throughout as though he had been won over before the
thirtieth day?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_303_10" id="target_note_LCL501_303_10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>“So what?” he says. “Will you kill me?” I ought to. If
anything of a brave spirit shall be in me, anything of uncorrupted
virtue, I’ll do it. Only let my spirit hold, I shall not
fail, I shall not be turned aside. I am still brave, I still think
I can; but there are days remaining. I do not flatter you;
every day I exhort myself and goad my spirit and set the
whole ugliness of your offence before my eyes and try to
master that I don’t know what which resists my intention.
You do well to accuse me; I was faltering disgracefully,
wasting an example necessary to the community, on the
point of incurring a general suspicion that you might have
done it with my permission.</p>
<p>Go on then. Call me insane, call me crazy, call me a
man placed far from the understanding of his own blood.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_303_11" id="target_note_LCL501_303_11"><sup>11</sup></a>
Don’t beg.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_303_12" id="target_note_LCL501_303_12"><sup>12</sup></a> For what good will it do you to fall at my
knees, call in friends, weep into my bosom? I am insane, I
feel nothing. Go to that father of yours.</p>
