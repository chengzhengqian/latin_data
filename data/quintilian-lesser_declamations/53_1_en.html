please, as witnesses we do not give evidence at our father’s
discretion, we advise a friend as our mind dictates. But if a
son be allowed at times to act in things not otherwise
blameworthy even against his father’s wishes, yet in nothing
is freedom so necessary as in marriage. And I should
say this even if the question at this trial was whether I
should take some woman as my wife: <span class="italic">I</span> shall choose my lifepartner,
