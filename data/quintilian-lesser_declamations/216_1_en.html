<p>Therefore the question for our whole case, I think, lies
in this: didmy friend die intestate? In that regard I amglad
that nothing has been done so obscurely or secretly that I
have to offer proof. So I ask you, kinsfolk, whether the man
you say died intestate ever wrote a will. I ask you whether
this document produced from our side comes from a testator.
Do you understand the seal? Are you in the habit of

be the last which we may more properly call first. But just
as among several wills the last ought to be valid, so the
