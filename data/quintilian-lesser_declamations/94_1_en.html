me too late. How many tears do you suppose I shed before
I stepped down? For the rest, plotting tyranny implies
hope; such a charge goes with a mind on the alert, weeping
with one relaxed, tired. The behavior you represent as

that tears indicate. For I ask you, whence do you think
comes this weeping? For if I am plotting, if I hope, if I
think to return to something from which I stepped down
reluctantly, what cause is there for tears? But if what tortures
my spirit is that I stepped down from that height, that
I am living on level terms, how can I be plotting something
that I know cannot come my way?</p>
<p>My address must return to its starting point. I appeal to
public good faith, which is sacred among pirates, which
makes truce between enemies in arms, which conserves
the rights of communities after surrender. Whatever it
amounts to, you promised, you decreed. As for myself,
nothing. Life is a weariness to me now, these daily tears
have now come close to a prayer for death. It is for you to
see to it that if error or Fortune, if some plan or rash impulse
send a man against the commonwealth, you give
room for repentance, allow his amendment, want citizens
to become better.</p>
