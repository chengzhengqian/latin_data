<p>I have said that a wife is a woman of whom matrimony has
been made with a man. What more? For just as coition and
intercourse short of the law would not make a wife,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_31_5" id="target_note_LCL500_31_5"><sup>5</sup></a> so a
wife is still a wife even short of them. That can be established
by everyday examples that meet us head on. For to
begin with the &lt;words&gt; themselves, “to have married a
wife,” this comes before the night, comes before intercourse,
comes as soon as there is status. And perhaps in
other cases it could seem necessary to wait: in this one we
did &lt;not&gt; cohabit after the marriage.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_31_6" id="target_note_LCL500_31_6"><sup>6</sup></a> “True, the status of
matrimony has been completed, but all the same I wait,
both for coition and for combining of patrimony—which is
what you are claiming.” In a situation of this sort these
items are not to be waited for since they have already occurred.
If the rapist is not put to death, he is already husband.
That is also accepted thus: he who shall be a husband
is not a bachelor; she who shall be a wife is not a widow or a
spinster. So I should like to put a question to you about
both personae. Let us suppose that immediately after the
option you are asked about the young man: would you have
called him a bachelor? And if you said yes, you would face
the following: “All right, call him a bachelor. Can he marry
another woman?” You would not call <span class="italic">her</span> a spinster or a
widow—as for the latter there is no need to ask: if a spinster,
I ask whether there was anyone &lt;else&gt; whom the girl
could lawfully have married. I should therefore have believed
it agreed that neither was she a spinster nor he a
