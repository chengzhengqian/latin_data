himself after hearing the response. Now even if I confessed
that he did the commonwealth a great service by
this death, yet I would not count the end of an injury as a
benefaction. As it is, however, who but knows how many
compulsions drove him to exact punishment from himself?
If I were only to say this: “When deliverance had been offered
to the community at this price (?), that the tyrant be
killed, which of us would not have rushed to the castle,
which not have set fire to it, which not have wished to burn
