He would say: “I would rather he had: his death would
have been a light sorrow to me. Fortunate are they who
weep for their children at the grave. The worst evil of bereavement
is the missing. But it is an intolerable thing to
mourn a living son, to weep whenever he comes in one’s
way, to lead a kind of daily funeral procession for his good
name.” Suppose I concede you the part in which you infer
that he would have died.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_271_3a" id="target_note_LCL501_271_3a"><sup>3</sup></a> I shall not argue at length about
whether he would have died for love; those that have loved
live. Really? What can be less rational than for a man to
want to die who has something to live for?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_271_4" id="target_note_LCL501_271_4"><sup>4</sup></a> “But I found
him all by himself with his sword drawn.” Now you are telling

ardent rush into death. Those things are not done except of
a sudden, and nobody, especially where there is no grave
prior cause, lays down his life with calculation. Already
trying the point against his throat, already leaning forward,

Nothing of the kind. “Weeping,” he says.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_271_5" id="target_note_LCL501_271_5"><sup>5</sup></a> I should have
thought the danger greater if he was weeping <span class="italic">before</span> he
started drawing his sword.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_271_6" id="target_note_LCL501_271_6"><sup>6</sup></a> So it is no use your saying that
you did for my sake what I would not have done.</p>
<p>And now, gentlemen, this would have been enough. It
is unwritten and it is wrongdoing. Whatever your motives,</p>
