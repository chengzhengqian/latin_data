<span class="italic">this</span> temple? How many things there are that I do not press
as yet! I say nothing about the wishes of the gods, the instructions
of the response, I leave room for human counsels:
shall I not dedicate? Let me go further: if Alexander
had merely withdrawn from the siege of Athens, should
we not have built, should we not have restored? 〚For my
part I would believe there is deity in all our sacred objects.
〛 This is due to the Athenian community, due to our
ancient race, due to the soil for which immortal gods<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_99_14" id="target_note_LCL501_99_14"><sup>14</sup></a> are
with good reason believed to have contended. However, in
other matters we trust opinion and infer by conjecture; but

power. Add that &lt;the gods&gt; willed it to be dedicated &lt;by
