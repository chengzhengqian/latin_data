no risk, and you brought your brother into such a dangerous
situation that even a parasite was able to kill him.</p>
<p>I tax you in that you brought a third party to the dinner.
If this underhand proceeding<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_355_1" id="target_note_LCL500_355_1"><sup>1</sup></a> stems from family affection,
it should have been secret. I tax you in that you brought a
parasite of all people: did the unfortunate man, the exile,
have time for dining with a parasite?</p>
<p>As to other matters, I realize that they are irrelevant to
the present disowning. There are charges of earlier date,
deserving of their own laws; but you should get away with
them because they did &lt;not&gt; fall in your father’s way.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_355_2" id="target_note_LCL500_355_2"><sup>2</sup></a> I tax
you with a plan to murder your brother. If I were prosecuting,
if I were asking the sack<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_355_3" id="target_note_LCL500_355_3"><sup>3</sup></a> for you, this is what I should
have said: “The persona fits the crime. You have a parasite.”
And the motive for the murder is clear; you are coheir
with your brother. Opportunity aided the plan: he can
be killed inside the borders. An agent was not lacking: the
parasite is in your power. As for other things, who cannot
see them? Would the parasite have dared insult your
brother if you had not willed him? A man born to flatter,
whose starvation only your godlike favor deferred, would
never have done anything he thought might offend you.
You’re asleep (let’s believe you on that for the present): did
he think it could not be reported to you? And yet it’s unbelievable
that you were asleep at that time, in that place: it
was a dinner. And what sort of a dinner? Your brother was a
guest.Would he have dared such abuse if he had seen you
an affectionate brother? I believe that the parasite even insulted
my son’s condition. “Hold your tongue, exile!” said
