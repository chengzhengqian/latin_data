<p>That what I charge is unwritten is not denied. What law
could have embraced this sort of injury, which did grievous
harm under the guise of generosity? So all these pleas put
up by the other side, as “I gave him money and saved him”
and “what law forbids?”, only go to show that what I charge
is unwritten.</p>
<p>This part defined and established, let us pass to what remains
and show wrongdoing. I say nothing as yet about the
rich man’s intentions, I don’t yet bring forward his motives
for doing what he did: only believe that my son was in love
with a prostitute and that he redeemed the prostitute. I say
this is wrongdoing and the most grievous of all wrongdoings.
Those that devastate patrimony are slight, as also
those that are devised against the person: is this that rages
against the mind not to be avenged by the might of the
law? Do you say then that it is not an ugly and injurious
thing to have a prostitute in one’s home or do you say that
whoever brings about an ugly and deleterious thing is not
included in the law of wrongdoing?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_269_2" id="target_note_LCL501_269_2"><sup>2</sup></a> It would have been
grievous for anybody alive to have a prostitute in his home.
The thing so called in its own place is perhaps only ugly,
but transferred to the home it is dangerous as well. Shall I
now speak of the hope of grandchildren cut off, my son’s
reputation befouled, the hope even of future years cancelled?
Therefore he that did this cannot but have committed
a wrongdoing.</p>
<p>“But,” says he, “he would have died if I had not done it.”
I know what the role of the sterner sort of father would be.
