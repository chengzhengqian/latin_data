<p>The most difficult point in this controversy is that fear of
military service operates in the same way both for parricide
and for death.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_401_15" id="target_note_LCL501_401_15"><sup>15</sup></a> If we deny it, we had no reason to
want to die ourselves; if we admit it, we had a reason to
want to kill the father. So we have to strike a balance.</p>

<h2>378</h2>
<span class="label">Peacemaker to be disowned</span>
<p>When the community was defeated in two battles and a
third battle line drawn, a young man promised peace if he
were permitted to speak with the enemy commander. After
their meeting ended he gives his father no information
and for that reason is disowned.</p>
<span class="label"><span class="sc">declamation</span></span>
<p>I do not see a special law given to fathers<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_401_1a" id="target_note_LCL501_401_1a"><sup>1</sup></a> (do I lie?). I do
see that children are given the right to respond and that a
judge holds a hearing on the disowning. I say then that
there are certain things that fathers may order, travel by
sea, military service; and certain things excepted, vote of
senator, magistrate, juror; and that &lt;we&gt;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_401_2" id="target_note_LCL501_401_2"><sup>2</sup></a> are free <span class="italic">qua</span> citizens;
but that this is a new law, making silence an offense.
Whereas truculent effrontery is disowned, under this father
one is not allowed to hold one’s tongue. Suppose you
ask what advice I gave to a friend with a problem: will you
force it out of me? Or why as a juror I found a defendant
guilty? Or for what reasons I gave a vote in the senate?</p>
