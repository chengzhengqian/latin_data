me. And why would he, knowing as he did not only my
innocence but my valor even? For shame! Amid brilliant
military exploits I am charged with private impiety, I the
guarantor of public safety! Vices and virtues do not belong
in the same heart. I amused to fighting even for other people’s
fathers.</p>
<p>But perhaps the case would weigh down innocence not
only pure but shining.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_395_2" id="target_note_LCL501_395_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Had you disowned me, and taught
me first to strip off natural affection? Was it even out of
greed to inherit that I wanted to kill you, loaded no doubt
with immense sums lost in loose living? Or had I fought on
your orders unsuccessfully and was I afraid of punishment
for cowardice? “No, but,” you say, “you fought unwillingly.”
So is that the way of it? Whoever fears the enemy
kills his father? So I am a coward. And yet a parricide ought
to be not just bold but temerarious. &lt;I served&gt; unwillingly.
What then? Can I not beg, resort to entreaties, not poison?
Can I not call in friends once again? Finally, &lt;if&gt; you insist,

give all your orders to your son lovingly. Your fatherly feeling
is greedy for glory: I am a raw recruit and rather timid.
Are you offended if I praise you? But don’t I spare even
such a father?</p>
<p>How do I propose to kill you? Shall I hire an assassin,
ambush you travelling abroad? Nothing of that sort. I stain
