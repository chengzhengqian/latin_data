<p class="noindent">We shall first infer this from the text itself. For it would not
have been difficult for the composer of this law to have
written thus: “Whoso by will of his master shall be free.” As
it is, by writing “Whoso shall be at liberty” he has sufficiently
shown that it is one thing to be at liberty and another
to be free. Let us also shake out the reasons for this
law. The lawmaker thought it improper to bring back into

the question is not whether he was free by your will but
whether he was at liberty by your will. If he had been free
by your will, why should we claim him? Dislodged from
this contention, he shifts to denying that the boy was even
at liberty. By what arguments shall we infer that he who is
