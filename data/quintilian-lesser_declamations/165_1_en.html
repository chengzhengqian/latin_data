in others: but you, who yourself loved, when you caught
them, did you not feel you were looking at the picture
of your own experience? Why do I put off the pain any
longer? You killed your brother. I know, gentlemen, that
there are some crimes so heinous that words cannot enlarge
them. You killed your brother, your rescuer, who
dissolved his marriage so that you might live. And, what
weighs more heavily, he was not far away; he was going to
be in the same house and he handed over to you a wife
whom he could not do without. And you call this adultery?
Is he an adulterer so and are you a husband? I once joined
that adultery with my own hands, myself called in the
soothsayers, prayed that they would live long in harmony.
The fire that is kindled with lawful torches burns stronger.

wanted children, you had matrimony in mind! Will you call
them adulterers as they lie on the conjugal couch? Upon
my word, they would appear insensitive if they had been
able to forget about their marriage so soon. The young man
was killed while he was doing the job of a good husband.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_337_3" id="target_note_LCL500_337_3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>I shall not be ashamed, gentlemen, after this terrible
blow to come down to another part of the case and charge
you with killing a wife who deserved well, whom you loved
so dearly. I am arguing about the innocence of the unhappy
pair as though this were a capital case. As it is,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_337_4" id="target_note_LCL500_337_4"><sup>4</sup></a> my
