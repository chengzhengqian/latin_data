not a very ancient law, citizens, enacted that persons having
given secret information pertaining to the commonwealth
should remain in the community, perhaps I should
think it necessary for me to speak of the influences and
enmities which weighed him down and drove him into
exile. But what need is there to repeat these things that
are in front of your eyes? As for his disposition, I think he
is sufficiently approved by you, in that, although found
guilty, although driven into exile, yet he could not be angry
with the commonwealth: he offered information. Whether
true, we shall consider later. Meanwhile it is clear that he
did not make anything up, since so many gave it absolute
credence. At what a disadvantage he spoke—a man convicted,
an exile, against a powerful and influential individual—no need to speak at length, since the result of the trial
was that there was no majority of votes for his opponent.
He was not defeated because of his case but because of the
Laws<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_91_7" id="target_note_LCL500_91_7"><sup>7</sup></a> and the humanity of the public—which itself urged
me to propose to you a bill for keeping a citizen in so
tender-hearted a community.</p>
<p>They say that a bill pertaining to individuals should not
be passed. I do think that this is to be observed in the case
of a law in perpetuity, written for all time. For I can be told:
“You are binding times to come in honor of one individual
and you will constrain everyone by the same compulsion.”
But when a bill is proposed only with a view to the present
time, it cannot even be proposed except about individuals.
If we abolish this practice, we shall not choose leaders for
armies or decree provinces or prolong terms of command.
For all these are finalized by bills pertaining to individuals.</p>
