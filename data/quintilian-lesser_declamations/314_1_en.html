trial: “He is not a person in whose case ruffianly behavior is
believable. He’s well-conducted, has never done injury to
anyone.” This is what was said: “Penalty for injuries is not
what is asked for here. He will be at risk of his life. Even if
he has done wrong, he has been punished enough.” With
just this worry you tricked the jury’s compassion; &lt;they
would not have acquitted,&gt; if they were about to kill the
other party.</p>

<p>In the final part it will be judged from whom retribution is
to be claimed and how much.</p>

<p>What is the retribution claimed? That written against homicides,
against those convicted of injuries three times.
Nor am I unaware what lies behind this intention of his. A
new hope has made this suit: a ruffian anyway, he is looking
for a way to kill<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_163_16" id="target_note_LCL501_163_16"><sup>16</sup></a> with impunity, to put universal license
in his hands. So are people convicted of injuries to
have the special privilege that they cannot be accused a
third time without peril? Can anyone in the world think
this equitable? The one that was convicted of injuries once
&lt;and again&gt;, that perished for the good of the community
by two parts out of three, whose ruffianism has already
brought him close to death—does he live, whereas the one
that brought the complaint is killed? How I wish I had the
good fortune to plead my case before the same jury that
acquitted him, those mild and compassionate folk who
preferred to save even the most infamous of citizens!</p>
