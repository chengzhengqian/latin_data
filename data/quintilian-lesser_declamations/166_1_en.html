indignation is sufficiently justified by the fact that you have
taken my son away from me—me, who sat beside you, and
came into your sickroom with a sword, in anxiety. I cannot
take the same food at the same table with you, not
look upon the hand that still seems to me to be steaming
with my son’s blood. I always see you as armed, you
never come before me alone. Before my eyes goes my lacerated
son, and beside him my excellent daughter-in-law,
my most obedient daughter-in-law. They seem to cry out:
“You killed us, you that wrongfully parted us before. What
need to dissolve the marriage? Your credulity was imposed
upon. The man who could kill did not love.”</p>

<h2>292</h2>
<span class="label">The noose of the beautiful Olynthian</span>
<p>After the Olynthians had been conquered,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_339_1" id="target_note_LCL500_339_1"><sup>1</sup></a> the Athenians
publicly assigned them billets. A person offered lodging to
a beautiful boy. The next day he hanged himself. The host
is accused as a cause of death.</p>
<span class="label"><span class="sc">discussion</span></span>
<p>The question is twofold, of law and fact. For even if violence
was offered, there is a question whether it was the
cause of death. The second<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_339_2" id="target_note_LCL500_339_2"><sup>2</sup></a> has more weight: did he die
because of the violence? That is about law, to be handled
by definition. For he should be accused as cause of death
who inflicted death. But when someone has died by his
own hand, the defendant should not only have made him
want to die, but made it necessary for him.</p>
