<p>I have said all this as though I was asking for immunity for
the deserter. In fact I abate nothing of the deserter’s punishment,
the question is only as to the executant, the hand.
It often necessarily happens that a hero does not kill the
deserter. Suppose somebody has deserted and nobody has
become a hero: will the deserter go free? Suppose somebody
has fought bravely, but has been crippled in the fight
itself, so as to lose his hand: isn’t it necessary for someone
else to take on this function? So much as to strangers. Furthermore,
the law which required a deserter to be killed by
a hero never thought of this compulsion. Some exceptions
are made by nature, even though they are not covered by
any intimation in the law. Would it have been considered
that a father kill his son? Or a brother kill his brother?
Surely nature herself hardly seemed to admit that in the
same battle a father should become a hero and his son
desert. So if I were not asking for this as reward, if you had
repaid me in some other way, I should refuse; I should say:
“I am not necessarily obliged to kill.” My option is additional.
The law has spoken of a deserter and a hero. Everything
has changed: my son deserted.</p>
<p>So this is what I have said so far: any reward is due to
me, even against the law; my law is more useful to the commonwealth;
I do not necessarily claim against the law,
since many things can happen to prevent a hero killing; I
do not claim against the law, since it is impossible that the
law intended a son to be killed by his father.</p>
<p>〚Commonwealth, I renounce. I am not using the established
honor. Let no man complain of the disproportion of
my reward, no man judge that I am making excessive use of
the fruit of valor. I did not become a hero. You are in error,
