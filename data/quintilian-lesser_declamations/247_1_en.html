<p>I claim a hero’s reward: I became a hero as an old man, I
became a hero when I was already a father, I became a
hero in the battle in which my son fled. “But your claim is
against the law.”</p>
<span class="label"><span class="sc">discussion</span></span>
<p>Again those commonplaces: that every law <span class="italic">ad hominem</span> is
against other laws, that rewards cannot be paid to heroes
without bending some law or other. These are now ready to
our hand for comparison: even though an option is against
a law, which law do we more want to observe, that which
gives honor to the well-deserving or that which lays down
a punishment for wrongdoers? Then in particular: that
which gives honor to a hero or that which lays down a penalty
for a deserter? On either subject the treatment is attractive
and open; for we can describe how difficult it is to
fight bravely and how fraught with danger, and excuse and
in some sort forgive.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_29_2" id="target_note_LCL501_29_2"><sup>2</sup></a> What wonder that there is someone
who spares &lt;himself&gt;? Here we have the shouting of both
armies, the missiles coming at mouth and eyes, the comrade
falling at our side, then the groans of the wounded
and the clash of arms and the gleam of steel. Then, when
we have compared the laws, let us nevertheless soften the
question. The law does not necessarily perish.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_29_3" id="target_note_LCL501_29_3"><sup>3</sup></a> Why? Because
many things can happen to prevent the hero killing
the deserter.</p>
