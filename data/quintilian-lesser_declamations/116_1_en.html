<p>“Let whoso gives away public counsels be capitally punished.”
I can marvel, gentlemen, that a defendant under
this law is a female; and I do not say &lt;so&gt; because an even
more severe punishment is not appropriate if we discover
in this sex a will to betray the commonwealth, to ruin
the community, but I cannot imagine how public counsels
came to the knowledge of a woman. I shall later defend
her with good cause on the plea of emotional constraint.
Meanwhile I want to defend her by the words of the law.</p>
<p>For even though I admitted that “counsels are given
away” in this fashion, sufficient punishment might seem to
have been meted out to her through the torture.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_239_2" id="target_note_LCL500_239_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Next, a

uninformed as to be ignorant. “Giving away” implies
intention and a mind not coerced, confession is necessity
imposed by much pain. But I realize that the persona of
the woman of whom we speak is such that more is needed
than to free her of the charge.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_239_4" id="target_note_LCL500_239_4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>I want to go through the points one by one; but first let
me ask you, gentlemen, whether you think that they whom
Fortune, violence, pain have forced to confess something
