when he is said to have known, it is implied that it can be
proved <span class="italic">how</span> he knew. For I ask you yourselves, my opponents,
how you infer that he knew, how this is clear to you.
If you have something, bring it to the jury too. Your only
proof is the fact itself, that he perished. Even if he did it
out of fear of death, &lt;he may&gt; have been timid by nature,
he&lt;may have&gt; perished even though he had been given
no indication to make him despair of life, out of confusion
and a spontaneous motion of his mind. But in reality, it is
not credible that anyone perishes because of fear of death.
For what more did he fear? Therefore I find it actually
more credible that he perished because he thought the girl
would opt for the property. For there are many who think
death preferable to poverty. After a pampered upbringing
(for much licentiousness<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_269_6" id="target_note_LCL500_269_6"><sup>6</sup></a> is a product of pampering), the
bare life before them, destitute of all they previously had
in plenty, would seem intolerable. This therefore is more
credible; and this is what the girl wanted<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_269_7" id="target_note_LCL500_269_7"><sup>7</sup></a> and in this she
perseveres.</p>
<p>And certainly nobody can find it tolerable or fair &lt;that&gt;
after a most grievous injury, by which she forfeited her virginity,
lost the flower of her youth, was robbed of what
would have been that first charm in her husbandâ€™s eyes, she
has neither opted for death nor gets the property.</p>
