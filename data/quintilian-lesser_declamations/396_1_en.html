trick. But after truer friends intervened and asked
what evidence he had to go to law with, and likewise took
the ward aside and enquired the grounds for his complaint,
then indeed the mutual error came to light; and he himself
got some more reliable information from his wife too. So
the enemies’ trick was discovered, the actions, unfounded
as they were, readily dropped, and the two reconciled. But
he himself has not yet escaped his enemies, by whom he
has been charged.</p>
<p>The prosecutor will not go wrong if he speaks against
the ward; for he will charge him with an offense of which
he will not want to clear himself.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_327_4" id="target_note_LCL501_327_4"><sup>4</sup></a> So he will say that the
young man stayed on in his guardian’s house because of
his love for the adulteress (for before the age of fourteen
the charge is unbelievable<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_327_5" id="target_note_LCL501_327_5"><sup>5</sup></a>)—he stayed on, therefore &lt;because
of&gt; his love, and that in keeping the ward the guardian
was not acting out of affection but from his bad conscience,
knowing that his accounts had been rendered
improperly and so he must not offend the ward. As for the
woman, she was given many gifts and granted anything she
wished. When these crimes were mutually known, at first
both flared up, but then the guardian with his guilty conscience
over the accounts preferred to forego vengeance
for his marriage rather than have both lose in their mutual
actions.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_327_6" id="target_note_LCL501_327_6"><sup>6</sup></a> So the accounts<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_327_7" id="target_note_LCL501_327_7"><sup>7</sup></a> were balanced and accepted.</p>
