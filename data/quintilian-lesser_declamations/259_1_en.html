is true is evident: the other claimed before you, thinking
himself the more deserving. When he claimed, you said
nothing. But he did not succeed in what he could not succeed
in under any law, in getting an uncertain legacy. “But
this very fact,” says he, “that when he claimed he lost,
shows that it’s due to me.” You are still not reading the
words of the will carefully. It was not written just that I
give to one of the freedmen but that I give to which of
them I wish, thereby leaving me freedom both complete
and (what irks you more) perpetual. So if it is not in the Nature
of Things that I should prefer to give to the one who

and adds no time clearly also intimates “You will pay
when you wish to which of the two you wish.” So far then
you are both rascals, both false claimants. How wise you<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_53_3" id="target_note_LCL501_53_3"><sup>3</sup></a>
had been to say nothing! Had you so persevered, I should
have thought you were the more modest, hoped that you
would take better care of the money that you had received
without grasping. As it is, I begin to think that the other
one was less to blame. He went to law before the test, before
the verdict: you don’t believe the jury. “So will neither
