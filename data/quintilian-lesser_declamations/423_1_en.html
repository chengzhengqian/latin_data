<p>Before parricide, I charge you with inertia. You did not go
abroad even when I went abroad. I was forced to take on
your role. But you will say that it would have been wrong to
commit the whole family into danger. Did you stay behind
to ransom me? Ransom me. You deserted your father in
captivity: a heinous crime, or rather parricide. So far as lay
in you, I was put to death and in terrible tortures at that. It
is no use for you to make lack of money your excuse: it was
lack of filial feeling. You delay, and what do you do? To tell
me that you had time to spare, you bring a prosecution.
Time for this? And whom do you prosecute? My wife.</p>
<p>He says: “She had violated a tomb.” What was that to
you? I was the injured party; I shall take action. But no, I
ought not either. She was right to violate. He says: “So that
you know she did wrong, she was convicted.” Are you surprised,
when her husband was away? I convicted you, my
wife, best of women. But I shall avenge.</p>

claims the property.</p>
