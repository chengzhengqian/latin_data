pare the ages. What reason had that old man, at the end of
his life, for plotting a tyranny?—unless perhaps he did it on
his son’s account. <span class="italic">He</span> is a young man. All appetites, all urges
more easily grow powerful at his age. There is a further
sense to the crime—if any crime admits this word: he tried
for something he could enjoy for a long time. So much for
comparison of ages, now of character. The father is<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_85_2" id="target_note_LCL501_85_2"><sup>2</sup></a> a man
of moderation. Even if he wanted to take a stern line, he
only threatened. This young man on the other hand, what
is <span class="italic">he</span> like? Suppose I tax him with nothing but what he has
confessed himself, what he stated before a meeting as a
boast: he could kill his father—whether innocent I don’t

put together a being who could crush the commonwealth
and deprive our country of freedom, what other mentality
could we give him? Let us imagine a bloody man, a cruel
man, a man with whom the laws of nature count for nothing.
There is an association between the crimes themselves,
so much so that both could be called by one name:
parricide.</p>
<p>So both their ages and their characters make it more
credible that tyranny was plotted by the young man than
by the old. What about other points? First, I ask you, if you
thought your father was plotting a tyranny, why did you kill
him before you accused him? Convicting him would not
have been difficult, no long delay of trial was to follow: the
preparation for tyranny was in the house. “But he would
