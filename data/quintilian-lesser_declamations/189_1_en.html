rich man, the poor man said she was a slave girl. As he was
leaving after dinner, the rich man raped her. Brought before
the magistrates, the girl opted for marriage under the
law governing raped women. The rich man accuses the
poor man of fraud.</p>
<span class="label"><span class="sc">discussion</span></span>
<p>Although the poor man is on trial, I don’t think he will go
against the rich man bitterly and vehemently. The rich
man is not only his accuser but his son-in-law, and we are
not angry: the raped girl chose marriage.</p>

<p>If I were pleading my case with another prosecutor, I knew
(and had recently so found)<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_385_1" id="target_note_LCL500_385_1"><sup>1</sup></a> that we have fair freedom of
speech even against the rich. But though I am being most
unwarrantably attacked, abuse is forbidden to me, not so
much by the law as by reason. I always longed for this man
as my friend; even before I was his father-in-law, I paid him
attentions and in having him as my guest I ventured somewhat
beyond what my means permitted. And I confess that
I did so primarily in order that my daughter might have a
patron.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_385_2" id="target_note_LCL500_385_2"><sup>2</sup></a> But now Fortune herself has given me as a son-inlaw
the man I liked more than anyone. So all that I am
about to bring forward to prove my innocence will not be a
defense so much as an explanation.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_385_3" id="target_note_LCL500_385_3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>Perhaps he belittles me, but I shall venture. He had
better not look down on us. True, I am not wealthy, but
how few are! My means are meager, but there is nothing
against me, no charge, no scandal; the rich man once
thought me not unworthy to be called his friend, someone
whom in his affluence and wealth he would even join at
