<p>A huge quibble! Upon my word, I am ashamed of my plea.
Am I now to deny?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_137_2" id="target_note_LCL501_137_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Come! If I show that the man who
robbed the community of freedom, abolished the laws, violated
the temples, provoked the anger of the immortal
gods by the injuries he did us, was not a tyrannicide, shall I
seem to have achieved much by my address anyway? Must
we interpret the intention of the law itself? What its author
had in view must we, as matters stand, deeply and diligently
search out, dig out? I think, gentlemen of the jury,
that I must say a few words on behalf of the lawgiver, so
that he may not be thought to have written this so obscurely
and cryptically: or is it not clear and manifest to all
that can attain to understanding of speech that when he so
drafted the law that whoso killed a tyrant be buried in the
Forum, he spoke of two individuals? Does anyone fail to
understand that the killer is one, the killed another? I
suppose we must find arguments, bring up other laws too
as examples. Shall I say now: “Let whoso beats anyone be
liable for injuries, but nobody who beats himself will be
liable”? For I think you will all laugh if I bring in the closest
parallel for an example and say that a man who kills himself
is not liable under any law. Moreover, it is clearly wrong to
think that rewards pertain to persons to whom penalties
&lt;do not&gt; pertain.</p>
