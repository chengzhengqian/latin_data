The tears are blamed. Perhaps I weep superfluously:
is this how you comfort me, this how you dry your father’s
tears? I would have good cause to weep today, even if I had
not done so before.</p>

<p>I don’t want anyone to criticize me for not giving you topics.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_41_7" id="target_note_LCL501_41_7"><sup>7</sup></a>
If you want to expand the declamation and exercise
your ingenuity, you will say what has nothing to do with this
man’s case, but may perhaps have something to do with
pleasuring the ear.</p>

<p>I don’t yet give private and particular reasons for the tears;
meanwhile, who wonders that a human being weeps? Infancy
starts from that, Fortune mostly leads into this compulsion.
For what day but threatens us with something
sad and lamentable? If we had no other reason for tears,
the survey of mankind and the consideration of mortality
could elicit weeping. These friendships, these family
bonds, these gatherings, these studies and achievements
will die and slip away in a brief moment of time. How few
days pass in which we do not see a funeral?</p>
<p>“You follow me weeping and you follow me in public.”
You don’t bring the charge in full: I did this before at home
for a long time. How brief a space of time it is in which you
see me thus! I weep in secret where bedchamber and night
and spirit is left to itself. “You follow me weeping.” What
can I do? For my part I admire those stalwart fathers who
cut back this mental anguish once for all and can weep
