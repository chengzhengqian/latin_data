<p>Here we give the words<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_411_8" id="target_note_LCL501_411_8"><sup>8</sup></a> of the mother as she approaches
her daughter and the latter’s fear as she panics.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_411_9" id="target_note_LCL501_411_9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>

<p>I certainly questioned her. “What is poison?” she said.</p>
<p>Why then did she say she was her accomplice? To
make me childless. Nothing is sweeter than vengeance to a
woman harmed. And to be sure she did not think this up
for nothing: if naught else, she is torturing her father<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_411_10" id="target_note_LCL501_411_10"><sup>10</sup></a> with
a trial.</p>

<p>Let him by whose doing a tyrant has been killed claim a reward.
A rich old man hired a strong young man with money
to kill a tyrant. The young man killed the tyrant. They dispute
about the reward.</p>
<span class="label"><span class="sc">declamation</span></span>
<p>“By whose doing,” says the law. “Doing,” I take it, implies
work, fighting, weapons. What “doing” are you talking
about? Counsel? But nobody is a tyrannicide just by
forming the notion of it. What good would your counsel itself
have been short of my hand? So the law requires “doing,”
allows a reward for that only. But if <span class="italic">this</span> is “doing,”
&lt;why&gt; did I fight?</p>
