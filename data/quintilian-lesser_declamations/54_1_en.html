on airs”? Don’t worry, father: I was wooed, I was bought.
“But he was my enemy,” he says. So far I choose to speak as
though hate lasts on both sides. But enmities should not be
immortal, and the human race &lt;can&gt; be safe and perpetual
only if love and loyalty are unforgettable while on the other
hand those feelings &lt;into&gt; which by some misadventure
they are changed quickly die and fade away. But I need not
dwell on this topic<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_115_4" id="target_note_LCL500_115_4"><sup>4</sup></a> for long; it had certainly been effective
enough with the rich man. Granted that he had the name
of “enemy” at one time (and I don’t enquire how undeservedly,
how unfairly), provided that I was able to become
friends with him again. But my father blames me only for
this, that in his absence I discontinued our feud with the
rich man. I suppose I did that in contempt of my father,
holding him cheap! Gentlemen, imagine that we go back
to where we were before this happened. My father has
been captured by pirates, he suffers bonds and ultimate
terrors, and present pains only exceeded by what threatens.
This I know, this I learned from his own letters, from
this he can be ransomed. Suppose the terms are harsh:
ought I not to accept them? Suppose the pirates had promised
to take me as my father’s substitute, I should not have
refused the chains. If it had meant getting tied up in a loan,
I should not have been afraid of debt in order to ransom
my father. I married a respectable, rich girl. However, if
my words get any credence, that was not what I thought of
in that marriage. <span class="italic">He</span> moved me; I did &lt;not&gt; want us to be
outdone in kindnesses. But he too approved nothing else
in me but my filial devotion. He saw my tears, the failing of
my whole mind and body. That was how I became a good
match in the eyes of a man to be counted among the leaders
of our community.</p>
