that would not have been difficult against an old man for
someone who killed the person he was about to accuse so
that he should &lt;not&gt; answer him. So he cannot be thought
to have done it for the sake of the commonwealth, which
he could better have served by another procedure. Now let
us shake out why you did it. First of all, I thank the magistrates
in that they were not content with discovering what
was shown there, they saw something for themselves. Also
I thank the providence of the immortal gods who have
