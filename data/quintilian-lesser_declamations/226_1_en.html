by fighting bravely he had shown that his character
was not such, his life was not &lt;such&gt; as to make these
charges credible in his case. But though he might have
opted for restitution, he preferred to opt to be prosecuted,
so that the truth might be sought. This he did not do without
a good conscience. Then why was he found guilty a second
time? Because he had been found guilty. The jurors
felt that the verdict of the previous jury ought not to be rescinded.
So a man accused after his reward was heard
