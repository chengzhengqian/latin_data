What worse could have befallen a man of my age? Fortune
seemed to reproach me for having taken a wife after my
son had grown up. From the fact that I caught her I also infer
that she had had a lover for a long time. I had just left
when, right away, a lover in the bedroom, as though she
knew I would not be coming back. How that grieved me
&lt;you can judge from this&gt;: I caught what the pair themselves
were ashamed of: they hid it in the dark like a crime.
Is that not enough to make one die? To think that my judgment
was so bad that I did not know the woman I married!
To think that I was so ignorant of what was going on in my
house that I would not have caught them if I had not escaped!

not kill the lover. Do you think I am only saying “because I
did not avenge myself”? I don’t know who he was—and
perhaps he is still here with me and rejoices at having escaped
these hands. Because I didn’t kill him? I wounded
him; so he is both safe and will live thanks to me. I am sorry
that I did not begin with the lover. I took time over my
wife, as though she was the more criminal; meanwhile, he
fled, a young man and a fast mover.</p>
<p>I wish to die because I don’t find the adulterer. Where
did he come from? Who in the world was he? Strange that
a wounded man is not found in the community. I called in
