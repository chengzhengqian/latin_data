surely no reason can be found why he should not be stigmatized.</p>
<p>He does not deny that he has fallen within the scope of
this law. But he contends that he has been released by the
same bill that he opposed; for he says it is the public will
that all persons under stigma should have it lifted. I don’t
wonder that he so often opposes &lt;and fails&gt;. He has too
little perception of the meaning of laws, he either pretends
not to know or doesn’t know what bills are about. Obviously
a bill cannot be put through whenever<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_163_1" id="target_note_LCL500_163_1"><sup>1</sup></a> some penalty
is remitted except concerning persons who are already
subject to that penalty. Let us consider that as it relates to
the thought of the mover of the bill and the judgment of
the people and the very nature of the thing. Could the
mover of the bill have any thought of a person not under
stigma? I think not. For he had not already opposed a bill
three times nor could it be divined whether he was going
to oppose a third time. So the mover of the bill had no
thought of him. When the people was sent into counsel
and was moved by compassion for their fellow men, they
thought of persons already under stigma. Perhaps they
were moved by the number, perhaps by the personalities,
perhaps by the cases. He could not be in the number (for
he had not yet joined the stigmatized) nor be pitied by reason
of his case, since he had not even been found guilty,
nor by reason of his personality. So neither the mover of
the bill nor those who passed it had any thought of him.
Now let us look at the very nature of the thing. What can be
remitted except what has been imposed?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_163_2" id="target_note_LCL500_163_2"><sup>2</sup></a> This bill was
