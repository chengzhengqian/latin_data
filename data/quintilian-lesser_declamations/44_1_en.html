<p class="noindent">He went to law an innocent<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_95_10" id="target_note_LCL500_95_10"><sup>10</sup></a> defendant; he was
found guilty. He charged a man clearly guilty of plotting to
set up a tyranny (so half the jury thinks): he lost because
public humanity stood in his way. Today<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_95_11" id="target_note_LCL500_95_11"><sup>11</sup></a> is he to fight<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_95_12" id="target_note_LCL500_95_12"><sup>12</sup></a>
without a bill, without the law you make, without the people’s
power? But as I have said,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_95_13" id="target_note_LCL500_95_13"><sup>13</sup></a> I think he had weightier
reasons to go back into exile. The defendant was acquitted,
it is true, but he has not yet persuaded his accuser of his innocence.
For my part I am not surprised that he is still
afraid for this community and that he wants to flee from
the avalanche, so to speak, that hangs over us all and avoid
the peril he foresaw. But that is all the more reason for
keeping him.</p>
<p>On another tack, let us suppose, irrespective of this bill,
that a law had been established such as it would be if its
purpose was that this man remain in the community. What
will the law say? “Let him who shall give secret information
pertaining to the commonwealth have the power to remain.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_95_14" id="target_note_LCL500_95_14"><sup>14</sup></a> Nobody will doubt that he has informed. Therefore
the words of the law are all in our favor. But we are
challenged to interpret its intention. For they do not think
anything secret unless it is certain and proved; they deny
that information is given except what is not in doubt. But I
conceive that our lawgiver did not lack the faculty of expression;
so that &lt;if&gt; he had wished an exile to remain in
