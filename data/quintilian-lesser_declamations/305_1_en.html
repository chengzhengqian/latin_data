<span class="label">Disowned-to-be, the feeder of an adulterous mother</span>
<p>A man divorced his wife, from whom he had a young son,
on a charge of adultery. The young man came to his father
and said he was in love with a prostitute. The father gave
him money. He started feeding his mother, who was in
need, without his father’s knowledge. The father learns of
it and disowns his son for that reason.</p>

<p>I am not unaware that in clearing myself (?) of this charge<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_145_1" id="target_note_LCL501_145_1"><sup>1</sup></a>
I am chiefly hampered by the fact that I am being disowned
by an indulgent father. So I cannot even make the
customary points that others have available at the beginning
of a defense: “Did I do any wrong? Have I lived
loosely? Have I wasted my father’s substance? Did I love a
prostitute?” I had to deal with a father who would forgive
all this. I only wish that my frugality was going to stand me
in good stead with my father. As it is, all the scenario of
trial, all the threat to my status, comes from the fact that I
gave money to a woman who was not a prostitute.</p>
<p>My father’s whole accusation, I think, divides as follows:
that I fed my mother, that she is what she is, that I did
so without my father’s knowledge, that I did so in the way I
did. I fed my mother. So far I am complimenting myself,
father. It was something that might have been praised in
me if you were taxing me with &lt;anything&gt; else. So I will
pass over this agreeable part of my defense in case I might
