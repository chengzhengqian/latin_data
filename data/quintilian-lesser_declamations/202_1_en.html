a great difficulty. You caught an exile inside the borders:

One day the guilt will haunt you, and the blood,
though unpunished, will flow right into your soul. What
squeamishness, that you wish to kill your enemies without
getting blood on your hands! “Let it be lawful to kill an exile
inside the borders.” If you had caught them and held
them captive, it would have been improper punishment.
No one made waiting for death one of an exile’s punishments.
That they watch your nod at length, bear your arrogance,
is improper punishment. You are not allowed to
hold a sword over their necks at length, you are not allowed
to move death slowly to their throats. Are you to detain
people within the borders who are not permitted to come
inside them? Kill them at once, or if you can put it off, pity
them. You forced them, I won’t yet say to join combat, but
to strike &lt;each&gt; the other’s neck as he offered it: it’s improper
punishment.</p>
<p>“They ought to die.” By what law? The law in which it is
written: “Let it be lawful to kill.” Suppose, gentlemen, a
case was brought to you this crazy: of two exiles caught inside
the borders, one was killed by the other. Right away I
want to prosecute him for improper punishment. “Who
gave you a sword? How can it be that a person ought to kill
who does &lt;not&gt; have to die?” No one, I think, will acquit. It
is impossible that if audacity is to be condemned duress is

the law permits but does not enjoin, should kill another exile
in the same circumstances as himself. But would it be illegal? The declaimer merely assumes that it would, and goes on to argue that
if the act was committed under compulsion by a third person, the
guilt and punishment transfer to that person.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL500_411_17a').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
