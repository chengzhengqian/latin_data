much” is settled by weight; it can be counted and a comparison
made. He wanted me to be given what he left, as
much as can be made of it. The nature of the thing is the
same.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_169_5" id="target_note_LCL501_169_5"><sup>5</sup></a> So if I had left him money in my will, I should ask
for the money and I should not tolerate you giving me
something of the same value instead of the money. If I had
left him a slave, you would owe me a slave and you would
not say to me: “Take as much as that is worth.” He ordered
that I be given what I gave him. And what was I giving him?
An inheritance. What do I claim? An inheritance. What
did I write? “All my possessions.” What do I claim for

then judge the law. Let us suppose that some poor man
wrote this about a rich man. How do we set out the case?
He made someone else his heir, but ordered that as much
be given to his rich friend as the friend gave himself in his
will. Suppose a will was found such as mine: would he<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_169_8" id="target_note_LCL501_169_8"><sup>8</sup></a> ask
of the heir as much as he himself possessed? I think not; for
it would not even be possible for it to be given. But this
would come to mind: “He ordered that you be given what
you were giving him in the words of your will; and you were
giving him the inheritance. You should not ask anything
beyond the inheritance.” And yet the law is the same, the
