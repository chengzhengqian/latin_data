father did not do it.</p>

<p>Whenever a definition has to be made, you will need first to
look at what each side wants and then to wrap up what each
side wants as briefly as possible. Why does the advocate for
the defense deny that it was poison? Because it did not kill,
it is not death-bringing.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_21_2" id="target_note_LCL500_21_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Why does the prosecutor say it
is poison? Because it is a drug and produces something
against nature. Therefore it is not enough that merely what
kills should be regarded as poison, but everything is poison
&lt;which&gt;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_21_3" id="target_note_LCL500_21_3"><sup>3</sup></a> * * * “According to your definition also that substance
will be death-bringing; for since you tried to make
me a deserter and death is the punishment for such, you
had added what this drug seemed to lack.”</p>

<p>I accuse of poisoning. I say that the woman who gave the
sleeping-draught is a poisoner. Where did you find poisons
to serve these purposes? Certain substances are well
known by their destructive effect and detected by experiment,
so much so that some of them are publicly administered.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_21_4" id="target_note_LCL500_21_4"><sup>4</sup></a>
What is this? What do you want it called? A poison
for the occasion, by which mind is taken away, body
weighed down, limbs paralyzed. In crime knowing the
right measure is often a virtue. When we see that it is &lt;a
particular&gt; quantity and a particular mixture that makes
the effect stop short of death, &lt;it is poison&gt; all the more.</p>
