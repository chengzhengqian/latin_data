father is angry. As for me, I don’t oppose for any reason
other than that I don’t want my father at home without
someone to watch him. So I shall not handle this case any
differently from the way I handled the other day, even
though my moderation in that one did me harm.</p>
<p>For a long while I put up with my father’s ailment, until
it became so obvious that I convicted him,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_351_1" id="target_note_LCL500_351_1"><sup>1</sup></a> albeit unwillingly.
His treatment was handed over to me. How conscientiously
I went to work you may judge. He seems to be
sane again now. It is no proof of sanity that he broke his
chains; he often used to do that very thing. For that he
charged the enemy, for that he asked a reward, I give
thanks to Fortune. He seemed sane.</p>
<p>What do you have against me? He says, “You went to
court to have me declared insane.” Suppose I had not succeeded,
still I was entitled; this legal right is given against a
father. The lawgiver looked out for old age; that is why he
ordered the sons to undertake the treatment. But since I
made him sane, &lt;why are you complaining&gt;? I might have
been thought undutiful if I had not taken proceedings.
Leaving madness to itself is not love. But I had him tied up:
if that was wrong, it would not be permitted. Then you will
lay to my charge that I did not keep him guarded. I call the
gods to witness, I never stopped guarding him until the
war called me away. But I opposed your reward: that’s like
what I just answered.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_351_2" id="target_note_LCL500_351_2"><sup>2</sup></a> But I won’t say: “Your recent services
got you your point; whether you should have got it
remains to be seen.” No, I shall not cease to hope that you
make this part of my case bad. May this mental composure
of yours be lasting. May you know whom to be angry with
and whom to love.</p>
