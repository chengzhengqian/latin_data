a hero and sought restitution by way of reward, even
two real offences would not have had any validity. So when
he opted to be accused a second time, he opted to be as
good as unconvicted. If therefore the previous trial gave
him this, and properly so *<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_457_4" id="target_note_LCL500_457_4"><sup>4</sup></a> 〚in fine, since the trial was

guilt was questionable, as if there had been no previous
trial〛. That he was found guilty in the second trial was irrelevant;
for he was already convicted. Choose which you

for if the view prevail that one was a verdict, the other is
&lt;not&gt; to be considered a verdict. Coming closer, at all
events make that conclusion thus: a man who, convicted
once of adultery, has his penalty is not unpunished. Let us
suppose it is a fine. Are you exacting a second—one which
had either been owed or paid in full in the former trial?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_457_6" id="target_note_LCL500_457_6"><sup>6</sup></a>

&lt;this&gt; part over. Why then was he found guilty repeatedly?
There were some considerations that might have moved
