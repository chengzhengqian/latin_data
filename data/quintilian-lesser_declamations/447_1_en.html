the unfortunate boy. You ask the reason? Because he is
alive.</p>
<p>Narrative</p>
<p>We had a young man: the best of relatives, the gentlest
of patrons, the most loyal of friends, as a husband even
<span class="italic">too</span> uxorious, something we forgave him: he had acknowledged
a son. The boy was at once transferred to his grandmother.
No doubt she forestalled his mother’s love, and
the other woman did not resent his removal. His whole
body came to be known to her, but I don’t claim the grandmother’s
knowledge further than this: every grandmother
knows her grandson best by his face. So on his deathbed
our relative wrote a will, short and straightforward; for he
did not have to think long about his first heir, having a
son, nor about the second heir, having a first.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_429_9" id="target_note_LCL501_429_9"><sup>9</sup></a> Nor did
we grudge her the honorable judgment<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_429_10" id="target_note_LCL501_429_10"><sup>10</sup></a> of her husband;
would that she had been grateful! Neither did the grandmother
think it right to hanker after the will of one for
whom she had destined her own. This is <span class="italic">our</span> story: let her
tell us about her pirates.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_429_11a" id="target_note_LCL501_429_11a"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>I won’t pursue her with malign suspicions, except that
she is better pleased to recognize her own when they are
dead. You have the boy’s story, you have the mother’s:
listen to a freedman’s.</p>
<p>After a while, a freedman of known probity, by the
power of the gods, I believe, which intervenes in mortal affairs
even where it is not apparent, set out on business
abroad. When he happens to see the boy among those on
sale, he both recognized him and was recognized by him.</p>
