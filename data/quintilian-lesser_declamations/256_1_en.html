suspense, thus delay frustrates sudden pushes on the part
of the adversary,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_47_3" id="target_note_LCL501_47_3"><sup>3</sup></a> thus we force the besieged, cut off from
supplies, to surrender from hunger. And therefore, upon
my word, we choose a strong young soldier but appoint
an old man commander. In the one only force of body
and hand is regarded, in the other judgment and reason,

be forced by any compulsion to fight with his son? Or
when he wrote “enemy,” does he not seem to have written
“stranger”? In this ultimacy of the noun he necessarily included
