suffered so much because of another man’s money. This at
least is clear, that your denial then gives you confidence to
deny now.</p>
<p>If you had not been tortured, that would be enough for
me: I had money, I had to deposit, there was nobody else
with whom I could well leave it, my slaves know. You
changed your mind after the torture.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_211_2" id="target_note_LCL500_211_2"><sup>2</sup></a> But if you think torture
carries great weight, let them be tortured too. To
be sure, it’s a sorry thing I am doing. I give slaves (as you
