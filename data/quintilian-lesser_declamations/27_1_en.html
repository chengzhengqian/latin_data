already commenced, only their commencement
at any future time. Action had been granted to the object
of your demurrer, and not only granted but actually begun:
you were both charged reciprocally. For come, do you
think action begins when the jury take their seats and the
pleader rises to speak? Not a bit of it. 〚For you did this because

purchased before his conviction.</p>
<p>Accordingly your demurrer is wrongly timed and a case
that originated before conviction cannot disappear.</p>
