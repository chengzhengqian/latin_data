When he said “I deposited the money with you” and got
the answer “Who’s your witness, what proof is there?” what
tempests surged in his mind! When he struck, don’t you
think he said: “Really? Didn’t I deposit?”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_7_5" id="target_note_LCL501_7_5"><sup>5</sup></a> Upon my word,
I think in such a crime<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_7_6" id="target_note_LCL501_7_6"><sup>6</sup></a> he might very appropriately have
exclaimed: “Go on, deny it now, take another man’s money
for your lusts: but you shan’t spend it.” So the mere fact of
the killing would have been proof. What further proof do
you want? He killed when he was going to die straight
away. Trials like this are often &lt;so&gt; conducted that if the
facts are said to be known to slaves, we see slaves tortured.
If the custom of the community and the rules of the service
had so allowed, he would have offered himself for torture
and demanded the other man. Do you not think he has
provided an examination of his conscience under torture?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_7_7" id="target_note_LCL501_7_7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>

<span class="label">Wrongly convicted of homicide</span>
<p>Let whoso prosecutes another for homicide and does not
convict him be punished himself. Let the punishments of
persons convicted be delayed thirty days. A man prosecuted
and convicted. The punishment<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_7_1" id="target_note_LCL501_7_1"><sup>1</sup></a> is deferred for
thirty days. The person who was allegedly killed intervenes.
The defendant claims the death of the prosecutor.</p>

<p>It will not be out of place to give this prosecutor an advocate.
He did something, to say the least, calling for regret.
