<p>It may be argued that this bill is illegal. If I were to admit
that, I should say nevertheless that in general there is
no need for a bill where there is a law. For why is it necessary
that the tribes be convened, the people assembled, if
the same result can be achieved by an ancient law long
since constituted? So if a bill is superfluous where there is a
law, it will not in general be possible for one to be proposed
which will not contravene the purpose of some law or
other. And yet before whom is the objector talking? For I
realize that I can be excluded from a trial by a demurrer,
and in matters small and peculiar let a judge entertain such
objections. But when the rights of the people are at issue
before the people, which has the right to change and contradict
and pass what laws it pleases and to accept what
bills it pleases, it will never diminish itself.</p>
<p>Yet how does this bill contravene the law which sent
this man into exile? He did not return under a new law but
under an old one long since constituted. He can remain
even irrespective of this bill.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_93_8" id="target_note_LCL500_93_8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>Before I speak to that point, I think I am compelled to
rebut an objection very frequently raised by my opponents.
“Why,” they say, “if he could stay by his own right,
did he wait for a bill?”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_93_9" id="target_note_LCL500_93_9"><sup>9</sup></a> Suppose his modesty does him no
good with you, suppose it even does his case a lot of harm,
to begin with I am not surprised that a man who has so often
had unfortunate experiences in trials and has so many
enemies in the community did not attempt anything privately.</p>
