clear intention of the law is that a will after which there is
no will is valid. Nor doubtless is it incredible that even
before the will that made me his heir he wrote other wills,
being a man who did this often. So a will can be seen as last
both if it has been written after other wills and, if it is the
first to be written, since anyway there is none &lt;written&gt;
subsequently that trumps it and has more validity, it is to
be considered the last.</p>
<p>They say that the former will was cancelled by a later
will; and I donâ€™t deny that if a will is legally made, that is, if
it <span class="italic">is</span> a will, the latest wish of the deceased is the most valid.
But I say that no subsequent will was made. For what is a
will? As I suppose, it is the wish of a person deceased
sealed according to the law and regulations of the community.
I would not call it a will if the number of signatures
falls short, I would not call a will something that does not
have a balancer and a buyer of the family<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_441_2" id="target_note_LCL500_441_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and what else is
legally necessary; it will be a document perhaps, a piece of
writing. And this, as I was saying just now,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_441_3" id="target_note_LCL500_441_3"><sup>3</sup></a> is clear by your
own admission, that that was not a will; for after it was
made you say that your relative was intestate. Let us draw
the conclusion at closer quarters. Let us suppose that the
will which you got invalidated was the only one made: will
there be any doubt that the property pertains to you, as
that of an intestate: that is, that you will be the heirs
as though he had never made a will? But if this is reckoned
as not having been made, then it cannot be seen as a will.
Let us make believe that it <span class="italic">was</span> the last will:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_441_4" id="target_note_LCL500_441_4"><sup>4</sup></a> we ask
