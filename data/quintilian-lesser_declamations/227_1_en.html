stigma? Take away his becoming a hero, take away his option:
there is no stigma. Nor yet was there &lt;savagery in the
punishment. He was only once an adulterer&gt;.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_461_9" id="target_note_LCL500_461_9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>

<p>Let one addicted for debt be in servitude until he pays the
money. One who had a person addicted for debt in his
house freed all his slaves in his will. The debtor claims his
freedom.</p>

<p>We<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_461_2" id="target_note_LCL500_461_2"><sup>2</sup></a> realize that we have nothing to be more afraid of in
this case than a common predisposition in favor of all who
claim their freedom. Against this we realize that we must
not only speak as primarily maintaining the law but also in
the sense that what we contend is no less to the advantage
of the person<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_461_3" id="target_note_LCL500_461_3"><sup>3</sup></a> whom we seem to be opposing, provided
that he fulfils his obligation. For the question today is
whether he is a slave.We make no complaint of the liberality
of the gentleman who made us his heirs. He freed
slaves. Is there any quarrel afoot? Are we reluctant and sad
to see them as part of the community? Debtors for us are
another story, freemen another.</p>
