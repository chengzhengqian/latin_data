<h2>380</h2>
<span class="label">Cross written for slave who would not give poison</span>
<p>Let it be lawful to appeal to the tribunes concerning unjust
punishment. A sick man asked his slave, to whom he had
left freedom in his will, for poison. On the slave refusing to
give it, he wrote down the cross.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_407_1" id="target_note_LCL501_407_1"><sup>1</sup></a> The heirs want to punish
him accordingly. The slave appeals to the tribunes.</p>
<span class="label"><span class="sc">declamation</span></span>
<p>He<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_407_2" id="target_note_LCL501_407_2"><sup>2</sup></a> says: “It is prescribed in the will.” Therefore the tribunes
investigate not whether it was written but why it was
written. The cross was written. Why? What had he done?
Let us examine his past life. I see that earlier on freedom
had been written for him. What did he do wrong so suddenly?
Did he want to give poison to his master so as to enjoy
his freedom the sooner? I have got it upside down.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_407_3" id="target_note_LCL501_407_3"><sup>3</sup></a> He
would be in no danger if he had given it. He says: “When
my master asked for poison I did not give it.”</p>
<span class="label"><span class="sc">discussion</span></span>
<p>Question: are all commands to be obeyed, are those of a
sick man, is this a command? Here first we say that he
should not have obeyed, then that he could not. Finally
comes a description of the punishment under the appropriate
placard.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_407_4" id="target_note_LCL501_407_4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
