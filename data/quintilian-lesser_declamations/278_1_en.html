temple * .<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_91_3" id="target_note_LCL501_91_3"><sup>3</sup></a> When the temple had been restored, an Athenian
priest dedicated it on a promise by Alexander to withdraw
from warlike operations if he did so. Alexander withdrew
from the siege. The priest is said to have brought aid to the
enemy.</p>

<p>The juryâ€™s mind must be filled with religious feeling to all
possible extent. For a priest is accused and the charge
against him is that he dedicated a temple and it is highly
advantageous to the case and also easy at this time; for it<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_91_4" id="target_note_LCL501_91_4"><sup>4</sup></a> is

<p>I call upon the immortal gods, gentlemen of the jury, but

what I am charged with only by respect for sacred things,
by piety, and by religion, they may will my priestly duty to
go unpunished; next (and this sometimes makes me anxious)
that they may be pleased to regard the spectacle of
this trial, in which the dedication of a temple is expiated by
mortal danger, without bitterness and wrath. Therefore I
beg and implore that, if possible, they will that I be not
convicted; if not, that I be not avenged, and that they protect
the community in this peace we have just begun to
have; or rather that they inspire your minds with the will
