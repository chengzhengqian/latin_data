his character with more care. A judge has no freedom unless
he is allowed to pronounce which way he likes.</p>

lacked wisdom, young as I was. I have no other obligation
than good faith. Were you litigating on condition that the
verdict had to go in your favor? That is what I should be
saying if I had given a verdict in just any case. &lt;I must
plead&gt; somewhat more forcefully since it was you who
chose me as judge. The liberty which you take from me
now you gave me at the trial.</p>
<p>But what did I pronounce and in what case? I acquitted
a woman on trial. I don’t say who she was or what she was
accused of. I do say this: generally judges are criticized for
excessive severity; verdicts never get to be quarreled with
except harsh ones. So public applause follows those acquitted;
people go away sad from a man convicted, and even
the winning side keeps silence. I acquitted. If this makes
me unpopular, a target for criticism, what defense am I to
think I could have had if I had convicted? I acquitted my
mother. This does not mean perhaps that I ought to have
remitted the charge. We often act in ignorance. I thought
my mother innocent. You taxed her with adultery. There
is no need to go into the case, especially since her right to
a defense has been taken away.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_381_2" id="target_note_LCL500_381_2"><sup>2</sup></a> But to me all the things
that were being said against my mother seemed unbelievable.
