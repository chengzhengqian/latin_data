you think it to borrow thus, the more to his credit that he
did it. He saw what could happen to him if he hired himself,
but he thought it more cruel a thing if his father lay
unburied: gladiators are buried. Those prosecutors would
have held it against Cimon that he ransomed his father’s
body with his own.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_399_13" id="target_note_LCL500_399_13"><sup>13</sup></a> But he gave the people to understand

<p>Let persons accused of treason plead their case in chains.
Persons who had been accused broke their chains and became
heroes. For reward they ask that they plead their
case free of chains.</p>
<span class="label"><span class="sc">discussion</span></span>
<p>Should a reward be given to persons under prosecution?
Or to persons accused of treason? Or to persons whom the
