reclaiming him, or, on the contrary,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_223_17" id="target_note_LCL501_223_17"><sup>17</sup></a> put in by this woman,
&lt;who&gt; previously was either barren or had lost her own
child. You will not say that she was barren: her husband believed
her. To say that she lost the child is not enough: it has
to be proved. All this we should be demanding in the case,
gentlemen, if &lt;it were&gt; about a slave or about money: but
you are trying to snatch a son from his mother, you are
plucking away part of her vitals, and against her maternal
groans you are content with the negligence of the other
parent.</p>
<p>“What motive do I have?” says he. “Why do I claim a
stranger?” Even though I do not yet explain why you are
going to court,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_223_18a" id="target_note_LCL501_223_18a"><sup>18</sup></a> that is just what I proposed to say: for if
you have no motive for claiming someone else’s son, neither
has she any for keeping him. Indeed the fabrication is
easier for a poor man. For what does it matter to your estate
in life whether you have an heir? But we shall explain
later on why you are fabricating: meanwhile, I want to analyze
the apparatus of your case.</p>
<p>“I rely,” says he, “on the testimony of the man you say is
his father.” Let us suppose that it <span class="italic">is</span> his testimony: he is one
man, he is angry,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_223_19" id="target_note_LCL501_223_19"><sup>19</sup></a> he is the husband of another woman.
When I say “he is one man,” I want you to recall the Catos
and Scipios<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_223_20" id="target_note_LCL501_223_20"><sup>20</sup></a> and so many illustrious names in our community.
When I say, “he is angry,” I want you to recall not only

exposed baby or his then wife, the present claimant, had found

hand, holds that the youth was the son of Father I and his client,
