since the Fates have withdrawn one of the two from punishment
he deserved, the other too gain impunity? Let us
suppose that the adulterer in consciousness of guilt has
taken flight, makes it impossible to get hold of him: will you
demand that there be no proceedings against the adulteress
because the adulterer has confessed that the charge is
true? No way can this appear just. 〚For he that says “you
should first sue the adulterer,” is saying “first sue the adulterer.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_51_4" id="target_note_LCL500_51_4"><sup>4</sup></a> Let us suppose that this demurrer is put up for us

and nowhere in its text does the law state explicitly that I
must sue to a finish. For even if the jury had sat and acquitted,
none the less I had sued. It is evident therefore that
suing does not consist in the end result of a trial but in its
initiation. Accordingly, if the man whom I declared to be
your adulterer had been acquitted, I should have been free
to sue you and your demurrer would have been void: shall I
