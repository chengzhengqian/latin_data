that I wanted to die because I had something on my
conscience.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_189_4" id="target_note_LCL501_189_4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>I wish to die. It is clear that I have done nothing wrong.
And I think I have already given reason enough.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_189_5" id="target_note_LCL501_189_5"><sup>5</sup></a> An old
man, I want to die. Life has its own limits; as long as the
limbs hold up and the forces do their function. How small a
part do I have of a living man! When I still had a wife, I was
matrimonially useless and it’s no wonder if she took a fancy
to a younger man. I could not kill the lover; if somebody
had seen me running away, he would not be surprised at
my wanting to die. How slowly I did it! I would have been
very fortunate if the robbers had killed me. There is another
thing: I have a son. I want to die while he is safe,
while I can leave him to survive me. Recently I almost lost
him; what would have happened if I had failed to heal him?
The gods<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_189_6" id="target_note_LCL501_189_6"><sup>6</sup></a> be thanked that his wound was slight! This will
not happen to me again. I know what I was thinking about;
if my son had come into greater danger, I should not have
waited for your permission to perish. I don’t yet speak of
adversities: the very answers to my prayers lead me to
death.</p>
<p>Let us come now to complaints. I am unlucky. I wanted
to go abroad: I fell &lt;upon&gt; robbers. I am surprised to be
alive. A grief ensued: I was separated from my son. I don’t
complain of <span class="italic">him</span>: all my case is directed against Fortune.
The robbers intervened. My son did not stay with me when
I was fighting for my life. I too did something criminal:
I returned alone, as though I knew my son was safe. A
different fortune followed: I found my wife in adultery.
