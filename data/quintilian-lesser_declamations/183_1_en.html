<p>Gods and goddesses, what things you despise! I realize
what sort of son I have to deal with. I shan’t recommend
honest toil to him and a good conscience every day and
work that serves even the towns. I shall plead my case with
the changes of the seasons, I shall number our products; I
summon my loose-living son to the delights that await him.
Have you a fancy for wild animals that cost a mint? You
crazy fellow, do your own hunting. You like your dishes
loaded with birds? Well, they infest our crops unless you
come to the rescue. Whatever is sumptuous over there, we
sent it. Fruits? We have them bending the branches, ready
to pick. Compare, if you will, my springs with your snows,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_373_10" id="target_note_LCL500_373_10"><sup>10</sup></a>
compare perennially flowing rivers with waters shut in between
walls. These big woods of yours, what of them?
What’s wonderful with you except imitation of the countryside?
To these delights I summon you, your father. I myself,
the old man, shall open up the soil—it’s hard from lying
fallow—with furrows and bend over the plough: you
only give the orders. Aren’t you sorry for the farm, your father’s
and your grandfather’s, overgrown with brambles?
All around is wealth of produce: we are criticized as lazybones.
How many years have we wasted! You live on another
man’s charity. But if you have no commiseration for
these things, you must forgive me: familiarity gives us a
certain affection for the land itself. You shall not sell my
little farm, you shall not make over your father’s and your
grandfather’s ashes and bones to somebody for the price of
a single dinner. Since I was unfortunate in the son I acknowledged,
I shall look for someone to till the soil.</p>
