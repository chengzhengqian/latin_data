we confess all our feelings, he drew up his last tablets in
such a way that he wanted my own sentiments towards him
to speak. Meanwhile, he deposited his property with this
man, until it could be known what I myself felt about him.
He ordered that I be given what I gave him in my will. If he
kept his thoughts within the narrowness of my means, it
did not much matter to him what I had written, except that
he might be seen as an ungrateful friend.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_167_2" id="target_note_LCL501_167_2"><sup>2</sup></a> My tablets were
read: the sincerity of my friendship was established, he was
left heir to all my possessions, and my feelings were all the
plainer because I made no reservation. So as far as I am
concerned I opened my heart and brought my conscience
into view; and so far as the Nature of Things allows, my
vitals are almost under your eyes. The heir has not so far
shown his will.</p>
<p>But I know that this is not the time to debate which of
us is deserving. The intention of the deceased is sufficiently
expressed in the tablets. You were made heir in the
first instance. I do not dispute that compliment with you.
The question today is, what do you owe me? If my dispositions
as regards my friend had stopped short at a legacy, I
should claim a legacy back from you. I made him heir to all
my possessions: I demand that I be that. Even if that had
not been written,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_167_3" id="target_note_LCL501_167_3"><sup>3</sup></a> gentlemen, it would have been unfair
that I be offered as much as I possess, as though the deceased
had ordered me to be given as much as I could have
given him. And there is an enormous difference between
these two: he ordered me to be given <span class="italic">what</span> I gave him in
