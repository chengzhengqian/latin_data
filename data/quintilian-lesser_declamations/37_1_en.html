<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_81_12" id="target_note_LCL500_81_12"><sup>12</sup></a>&gt; for those indignities with which he won favor:
you gave him ten &lt;thousand&gt; for committing rape. Unless
you owed it, you would even have wanted to punish him in
high indignation. For the man who raped a candidate for
the priesthood had injured you too by the example.</p>
<p>(So<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_81_13" id="target_note_LCL500_81_13"><sup>13</sup></a> we have unwritten wrongdoing against the person
&lt;prosecuting by the person under prosecution&gt;, wrongdoing
not only confessed but grave. It is evident from the
following: from the nature of the parasite, who would
never have gone to such a length of original audacity on his
own, and from the persona of the rich man, and from the
motives, and from the payment of the money, and finally
from the outcome.)</p>
<p>It remains for me to show what pushed him, what drove
him. &lt;Look now&gt; not &lt;at&gt; what the parasite got but what
the rich man himself got. Do you gentlemen ask what he
bought with his ten thousand? Look at his daughter opposite,
the priestess, look at the fillets, look at the honors.</p>
<p>	Perhaps I am acting haughtily and arrogantly when I
proceed against it as a private injury, a wrongdoing committed
against myself. For how small a part am I of this
outrage! Doubtless I have lost an honor, the poor man’s
most precious fortune; I have lost my daughter’s virginity
and for her for whom I was lately hoping a priestly office I
shall be hard to put to it even to find a husband. But the
people has lost its free choice in the bestowal of an honor, it
has elected a priestess whom a little earlier it did not want
to elect. Do what you will, exclude rich men from the campus,
