satisfaction of first of all thanking him on his daughter’s behalf.
He loved her so much that even with a sea voyage to
make he did not want her to be separated from him. When
she was brought before the magistrates, he thought he
should see to it that she was not tainted with the ill fame of
a man’s killing. He handed her over to his friend, &lt;and&gt;, as
can now be said, an excellent husband. Next after this, I

and modest young lady, received no injury, his
friend and son-in-law committed no crime. For if he could
have thought of such a thing, let it enter his mind, he had
the opportunity to violate her when he carried her shipwrecked
to shore.</p>
<p>The rest of my plea, gentlemen, looks not so much to
defense as to deprecation. Surely no line is safer than to remind
him of times gone by.</p>
