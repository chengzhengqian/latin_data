and impressively; but when it was going on he kept
mum. I do not think the father is so hostile to his son, although
he is disowning him, as to suspect anything shameful,
apart from that slander<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_291_8" id="target_note_LCL500_291_8"><sup>8</sup></a> which he hears himself, which
went no further than words. Rather, gentlemen, you will
deduce this boy’s gravity and purity from a significant and

refused to kill. I must go back again to the starting point of
my defense of him. Don’t you think of his age, don’t you see
how young he is? Don’t you put aside that charade of marriage,
an empty name and nothing more? Do you judge
him as a man, deserving to be disowned because he did not
kill a human being? Good father are you? Regardless of
