<p>You force me to speak more strongly. Not everybody is
entitled to a reward. The slave won’t claim, the foreigner
won’t claim. By claiming her as your mother you admitted
that your parentage is unknown. To be capable of opting
you have first to prove yourself her son. You persist? I’ll
pretend that you really want it. Marriage is not for you at
this time. You ought to be in the army, standing sentry,
keeping watch. Not even your mother ought to have led
you away from this choice.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_423_13" id="target_note_LCL500_423_13"><sup>13</sup></a> Or if you prefer retirement,
marry a wife to match. Forced marriage easily breeds contempt
even when the ages correspond. Perhaps it is that
nothing permitted brings pleasure or that satiety lies close
to what goes on and on, or that what is necessary is hard to
take. What if she brings disparate years? At that age even
old-established couples don’t love one another. You will
cover grey hairs with the marriage veil, so that when she’s

year that is to come. Closing age does not keep the same
pace; the end of life is not a decline but a collapse.〛 You
are not asking for herself<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_423_15" id="target_note_LCL500_423_15"><sup>15</sup></a> and it does not matter to you
whether she is wife or mother.</p>
<p>We have answered fictions long enough. Now I must
expose artifice. He is not targeting our conscience but our
modesty, to make it better for her to lie.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_423_16" id="target_note_LCL500_423_16"><sup>16</sup></a> So listen as
