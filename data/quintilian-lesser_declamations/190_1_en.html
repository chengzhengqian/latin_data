table. I had thought that it would be another factor making
for friendship if the poor man did a little dinner for the rich
man: not your slap-up affair, not such as <span class="italic">he</span> can lay on, with
a lot of servants—how’s that possible for the likes of us?
Everything to be out in the middle, especially as he knew
us quite intimately.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_387_4" id="target_note_LCL500_387_4"><sup>4</sup></a> Whatever there was to do, I &lt;myself&gt;
for the most part took care that the rich man should not
scorn us, I put it together and joined my guest late, only
after I felt comfortable. But I needed someone to wait on
us. That I had ready for me, not got by money, not by purchase,
but by taking a wife and bringing up this girl. I
thought he was surprised that a female should be waiting
on us, and I was therefore the more embarrassed to admit
that it was my daughter. For she wasn’t dressed accordingly,
and our acquaintance was still recent. 〚And all the
same, if he had asked me as well, I should have replied:
“We are your humble servants.”〛<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_387_5" id="target_note_LCL500_387_5"><sup>5</sup></a> All the same, I don’t persuade
myself that he believed. A slave girl would not have
provoked his so fastidious desires, and he did not do what
perhaps could have been done with a person of that condition:
    <a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_387_6" id="target_note_LCL500_387_6"><sup>6</sup></a> he raped her as if she was freeborn. So when he was
brought before the magistrates, he made no objection,
made no opposition to our law, unless perhaps he had another
reason—he thought he had nothing to worry about.
For how should we get up the courage to avenge ourselves
against <span class="italic">him</span>? How could poverty have born such odium,
had my daughter wanted to kill a young man who ranked
among the leaders of the community? Not, gentlemen,
that this can change the fact that I did him kindness.</p>
