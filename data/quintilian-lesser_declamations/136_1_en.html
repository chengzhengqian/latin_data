where you were. Even if a sojourn abroad detained you,
even if absence were the reason why you did not receive
the award, I shall say that many legal rights are limited by
time. But if you were in the community and present when
your son (as matters now stand) was honored, I ask why
you did not claim. As for why you did not receive, it is
enough to say: because you did not claim. You were not the
father at that time because you did not know that you were.
So the money was not owed to you at the time when the
commonwealth owed it.</p>
<p>I also ask how it came about that I received the reward.
I was the hero’s father. I must briefly show two things to the
judge, both that I was the father at the time when the ten
thousand was owing to the hero’s father and that you were
not, and for that reason did not receive it. For paternity is
not solely determined by nature and that first<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_279_2" id="target_note_LCL500_279_2"><sup>2</sup></a> step; appearance
is often enough to establish this legal status. Is
there any doubt that if I had died intestate before you recognized
him, he would have entered upon the inheritance
as though he was my son? Is there any doubt that if I were a
candidate for office, he would have counted in my favor<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_279_3" id="target_note_LCL500_279_3"><sup>3</sup></a> as
though he were my son? Is there any doubt that if he had
beaten &lt;me&gt;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_279_4" id="target_note_LCL500_279_4"><sup>4</sup></a> (something very far from his mind and manners),
he would not have fallen merely under the law of injuries,
or that if he had killed me, he would not have been
punished merely under the law of murder<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_279_5" id="target_note_LCL500_279_5"><sup>5</sup></a>? But if all this is
admitted, then the magistrates too made no mistake when
they gave the ten thousand to me. If you had died intestate,
your inheritance would have gone to others, no matter
