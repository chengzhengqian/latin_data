illegally will not stay long within the borders, whereas a
man who wittingly<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_41_2" id="target_note_LCL500_41_2"><sup>2</sup></a> returns illegally is trying to defeat the
law and is going to persist in his impudence.</p>
<p>Let us now see whether the man who was killed after
his return had license to come back at that time. “Let one
found guilty of involuntary homicide be in exile for five
years.” Do we understand this to mean that a five-year
term is constituted for each separate homicide? 〚No rationale
will be discovered whereby two homicides result in a
banishment for eight years.〛 If one found guilty of involuntary
homicide should be in exile for five years, that is not
to say that it makes no difference how many people each
person kills. So this is what I say: as often as homicide is
committed, so often the five-year period is to be posited.
And we can maintain this firmly enough by the example of
other items. Let us imagine a law providing that one who
steals pay fourfold *. And let us assume that there is a penalty,
no matter what, for a person found guilty of injuries: is
there any doubt that he will suffer that penalty as often as
he commits an injury? So if the punishment is constituted
against separate offences, this man has offended twice, he
should have been punished twice, he should have completed
his exile over ten years.</p>
<p>“But,” says the defense, “he completed five years from
the time he committed the second homicide.” It is no concern
of mine whether he failed to discharge the time he
owed the second homicide or what he already owed the
first. For if you count the five-year period from the three-year,
