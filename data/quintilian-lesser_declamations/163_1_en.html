that age. Suppose I did live loosely: still I was &lt;not&gt; insane,
and if I had challenged, I had a defense. But my relations
told me that my father would not persist. That was how I
came to suppress my sorrow in silence; shut in and become
part of my inmost thoughts, it took away my mind. But all
the same, to tell the truth, I had deserved it. How shall I
thank my father here? He brought me back without my
knowing it, used care and effort. Woe is me, I was cured. I
had the rites of my ancestors, my household gods, and
knew it. None of my friends &lt;but&gt; congratulated me. Now,
myself again, I am expelled. Fortunate are those who can
say to their parents throughout their lives: “What have I
done?” But I will say: “What have I done since? If loose
living is intolerable wickedness, you pardoned it.”</p>
<p>“I brought you back,” he says, “because you were demented.”
Where are you all that thought me unfortunate?
But I thank my dementia. I did not feel my father’s solicitude,
it is true, but neither did I feel the disowning. What
did I want with so rapid a remedy? Excellent father, that
rapid cure of yours deceives. I know what bitter mental
turmoil I endure within. Believe me, father, I now see
again certain similar visions. The former cause of my madness<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_333_1" id="target_note_LCL500_333_1"><sup>1</sup></a>
is back again. So I must beg you, if not for the present
time, yet for the future: help me, as you always do.</p>
