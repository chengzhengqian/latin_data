<span class="label">Summoned by father to join the army, mixing poison</span>
<p>Let action for parricide lie. A father summoned his son to
join the army. He returned to his father with decorations.
Calling in friends, he asked his father not to send him out
again; he was refused. A second time he fought heroically.

wickedness through contempt for men and gods. What is
this, gentlemen of the jury? I am charged with the greatest
of all crimes, and with that only. I have not cheated a
friend, &lt;not * &gt;, even the familiar charges against youth
don’t appear and, accused &lt;of parricide&gt; as I am, I don’t
have a bad reputation even for whoring. I shall promise

as testimony to character not just anybody from these
