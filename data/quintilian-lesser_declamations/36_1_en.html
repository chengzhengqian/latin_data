life. Your estate will grow wider, you won’t know your
households as they multiply, your houses will occupy a
large part of the community, a huge mass of &lt;gold and&gt;
silver will dazzle our eyes. But all this carries weight only
in a private context; when you come into the public, into
the campus, regard will be had to innocence and good
faith. Perhaps our very meagerness brings us no little favor
when poor men cast their votes. Then it is that the silent
thought of your haughtiness comes into each man’s mind,
the thought of all the wrongs you people do to individuals.
Even so, in other matters, when you are seeking magistracies

rendered, not in secret, in privacy (though no doubt
there has been that too), but openly before magistrates in
the middle of the Forum? We saw the ten thousand that

services rendered during a long slavery, it was not &lt;a consolation
