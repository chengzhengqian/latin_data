a stand against the interests of the commonwealth, had
rather everything here crashed upon my head than violate
such obligations by a single harsh word. But what should I
do in face of compulsion? The law gave the right to opt for
an advocate. The informer had opted for me. Tell me what
to do. The informer has the right. Public authority resists
all my excuses. Upon my word it might have been thought
that I was involved and feared that if that case found a
voice the crime would come into the open. Yes, I took the
case, and I was not afraid of winning. So you should not tax
me for what was forced upon me. As to what was in my
power, if you caught me, out with it—a hostile expression,
a raised voice, anything over and above what was necessary.
Not that I am taking credit for that; it was not in my
power and against your innocence there was no place for
talent. So I left the court happier than the defendant himself
and, having done my necessary job as it were, I ran to
offer congratulations.</p>
<p>And I do not exempt myself for time to come where he
is concerned. I confess I am in debt. Give me someone to
defend, to speak for. If we can find anything against that
villain of an informer, order what you will. My voice is
yours for however great a service.</p>
