young man to whom I was not related, of my own age. I
would have reflected: “How sad for his parents!” 〚A deserter
does not deserve blame as much as a hero deserves
praise.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_323_2" id="target_note_LCL500_323_2"><sup>2</sup></a>〛 Then you lay it up to my charge that I had no
misgivings about your innocence. I knew what kind of life
you had led, how I had pleaded your cause; for I defended
our family in the battle. A further point: a defendant once
charged cannot be acquitted unless he is prosecuted.
Everyone would have said, “the hero had no faith in his father’s
case.” I should have done no good. And what would
have been the result if I had got what I asked? You would
not have been acquitted. If I had not, you would have been
found guilty.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_323_3" id="target_note_LCL500_323_3"><sup>3</sup></a> I appeared for you. I don’t ask you to be
grateful, you were not acquitted on that account: your case
won, your innocence won. I don’t ask you to be grateful for
anything except that I was optimistic about your case.</p>
<p>So, father, don’t you congratulate yourself? All of us are
saved. For don’t despair about my brother; virtues often
come back. He now has an example at home. He was in
danger of death; he knows what it is to desert, what it is to
be a hero. I enjoin upon you, brother, wipe out that stigma.
A deserter does not deserve blame so much as a hero deserves
praise.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_323_4" id="target_note_LCL500_323_4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
