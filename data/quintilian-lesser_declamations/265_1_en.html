<p>What are you saying? That half of the property was lost
and lost to me; you add, lost by my fault. For the time being
I choose to admit all this: still, the loss is in common. He
denies that it is a loss and applies the name of penalty. I on
the other hand consider a loss to be the losing of things you
had; for there can be no doubt that we lost part of what we
used to have. He calls it a penalty. I need not deny that,
since a penalty is itself a species of loss. For I think the
