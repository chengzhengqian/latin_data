contrariwise, so that in this people are found some who—I don’t
know whether one should rather be angry at the outrageousness
or laugh at the folly of it—tax a human being
with a pestilence. And they think a remedy is due to the immortal
gods, but if we have suffered something<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_119_1" id="target_note_LCL501_119_1"><sup>1</sup></a> worthy to
be such a remedy, it is put down to our own infirmity.</p>
