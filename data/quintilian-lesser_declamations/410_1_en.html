<h2>366</h2>
<span class="label">An envoy, son of a traitor, killed</span>
<p>&lt;Let it be lawful to kill an exile caught inside the borders.&gt;
Let an envoy be sacrosanct. Let a traitor be exiled with his
children. A man whose son was an envoy was convicted of
treason. Someone killed the envoy as he was on his way
home. He is charged with murder.</p>
<span class="label"><span class="sc">discussion</span></span>
<p>The defendant confesses to the murder but defends himself
with the law.</p>

<p>“I killed an exile,” he says. When was he made an exile?
Who accused him? Who condemned him? Who expelled
him? But the father is an example that this is how a man becomes
an exile, and that is why he was called an exile,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_355_1" id="target_note_LCL501_355_1"><sup>1</sup></a> as

says, “was convicted of treason and the law orders that a
traitor’s children too be exiled.” If I grant that the law punishes
them all, yet his father’s conviction ought not to have
hurt him when he was unaware of it. Suppose he had traveled
for private profit: he will not be an exile before he
knows that he is an exile. Does anyone suffer a penalty of
which he is unaware, or is anyone in a status which he
doesn’t know he’s in? Have you ever heard of such a temple-
robber, such a homicide, such a poisoner? You are giving
us a new kind of criminal, so confident that he doesn’t
even know himself to be guilty. But I deny what I conceded
just now: the law does not punish them all, but the accomplices,
the partners in the crime: it is angry with those who
sin along with their father.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_355_2" id="target_note_LCL501_355_2"><sup>2</sup></a> For no law punishes the
