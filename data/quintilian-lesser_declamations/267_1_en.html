prove my charges, you will nonetheless forgive me for
thinking that I must first take account of my own defense;
not only because it concerns my honor but because I know
I shall carry more weight in my prosecution if I come to it
as an innocent man.</p>
<p>So the question is, gentlemen of the jury, whether I
gave poison to my brother or that man to a non-relative. I
am well aware of the name<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_69_3" id="target_note_LCL501_69_3"><sup>3</sup></a> he uses, and I ask you to know,
gentlemen, that the question today is just this, whether he
