robbery, the injury is special to the temple, whereas in the
conviction of a defendant the charge concerns someone
else.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_105_4" id="target_note_LCL501_105_4"><sup>4</sup></a> So in the latter case we have a reward, in the former a
consolation; in the one case the property is a gift, in the
other it is given back.</p>
<p>This would be a comparison if we were setting the
laws themselves in opposition. As it is, our law is prior in
time too. For he committed the temple theft before the
homicide. The prosecutor relies on the fact that he was
convicted of homicide before he confessed to the temple
theft. But we must not look at the time when the wrongdoing
revealed itself but at the time when it was committed,
at which time he earned the punishment in question. That
is both just in the very nature and also made plain by the
laws. For grant that in the homicide we must look to the
conviction, in the temple theft the time<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_105_5" id="target_note_LCL501_105_5"><sup>5</sup></a> itself is to be regarded.
Why so? Because your law is so written that he
who convicts takes possession of the property, whereas my
law is so written that the property of the temple robber
pertains to the god. Therefore as soon as he committed the
theft, he was devoted to this punishment and that property
began to pertain to the god before the law convicted him.
See how far you depart from the understanding of this law.
If he had committed the homicide before the theft, yet
since he had been convicted of the homicide later, the
goods would rather pertain to the god. It would not help
you that the time of the homicide was prior, since your law
does not pertain to the homicide but to the conviction. But
as it is, since the theft was committed before the homicide,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_105_6" id="target_note_LCL501_105_6"><sup>6</sup></a>
there’s no doubt that the property is the temple’s.</p>
