can be indicated by other means than words. If she
had put out her hand or assented by her expression, the girl
would have seemed to have given her word and confirmed
his hope. &lt;Will she not so seem&gt; when she showed her
emotion by her face, betrayed her pity in every look? She
wept; she did the same as the petitioners. At the mention
of danger, at the mention of the executioner, she shed
copious tears. I certainly do not see the emotion of a killer.
“But she said nothing.” Anyway,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_37_16" id="target_note_LCL500_37_16"><sup>16</sup></a> were you asking of one
who had recently been a virgin and only just lost that title
that she should speak of marriage when she did not have
to? “But she opted <span class="italic">after</span> the stroke.” There’s pity all the
greater: the poor girl undertook the treatment of her rapist.
Surely she complains of Fortune in that she wasted her
boon. For she could not pluck out the hand thrust in so
deep. Poor girl, she thought he had done it to win pity! All
the same, the joy of life granted did reach him in some
measure; pleasure is welcome even when brief. He certainly
raised his eyes when he heard her words. If nothing
else, he had the consolation of not dying as a man
condemned. The executioner did not assault him though
half alive and palpitating, did not drag him wounded and
bleeding before the public’s eyes, his head was not cut off
even after death to satisfy the law.</p>
<p>Ah cruel &lt;rapist&gt;, that made so sad an example out of
supreme mercy!</p>
