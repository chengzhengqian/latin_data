even if I am using my own discretion, I ought not to incur
the punishment of this offence.</p>

<p>The third question we ask is whether it is actually necessary
for heroes to fight. This question also has been handled
in many controversies. The letter of the law will be in
our favor.</p>
<span class="label"><span class="sc">declamation</span></span>
<p>“If more than one become heroes, let them contend in
arms for the reward.”We are ordered to fight, we are compelled,
even if I don’t want to. All we shall be doing is to
make my adversary think I am afraid. “But it orders you to
contend for the reward, and if the reward is waived, no
fight is necessary.” Ah, but the law itself has covered that
very point, that the reward <span class="italic">not</span> be waived, when it orders
us to contend in arms for the reward.</p>
<span class="label"><span class="sc">discussion</span></span>
<p>After this we shall say that this fight is actually to our credit;
we shall support our proposition by the judgment of our father
himself.</p>
<span class="label"><span class="sc">declamation</span></span>
<p>The first time you allowed your son to fight. A second time,
although you already had a sad experience (which you urge
against me at this moment), you nonetheless gave permission
to fight. Why do you think so poorly of me?</p>
<p>The whole reason for your disowning depends on your
fear. And it is hasty and self-contradictory that a son be
disowned because his father loves him and that anyone
should be without children out of fear of bereavement. But
I want to relieve you of this anxiety too.</p>
