show you gentlemen how unfairly I was swindled. I was engaged
to your daughter. I don’t say at what price: I was engaged.
Good faith is the highest bond in human affairs; it is
sacred among enemies, sacred (as I recently discovered)
among pirates, of such authority even among scoundrels
that although you did not want to hand your daughter over
to me, you did not have the gall to refuse openly. And at
what price was I engaged? That I should redeem her. I
don’t say from whom, I don’t yet say at what risk: &lt;how unfair
