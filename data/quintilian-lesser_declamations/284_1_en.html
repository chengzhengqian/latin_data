<span class="label">The property of a temple thief</span>
<p>Whoso convicts a defendant of homicide, let him take possession
of his property. Let the property of a temple thief
be consecrated to the temple. A man convicted of homicide
said under torture that he had also committed a sacrilege.
There is a dispute about the property. The priest
claims it for the temple, the prosecutor for himself.</p>

other for man. It is fair that the religious basis should have
priority.</p>

<p>Here can be introduced the commonplace in which we
praise this law.</p>

man to the prosecutor. Why so? Because in a temple
