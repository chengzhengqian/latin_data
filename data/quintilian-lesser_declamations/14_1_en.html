Right<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_35_12" id="target_note_LCL500_35_12"><sup>12</sup></a>). Think how great a boon she wanted to give, or
rather did give so far as in her lies: she forgave the injury of
raped virginity when the law allowed her to avenge it by
death. “But she gave this boon too late.” Even if this had
come of her tardiness, not his haste, don’t be surprised at
a modest girl if chastity could not all at once command
its anger. A rape-victim who does not opt quickly grants
enough. But you will say that she opted when he was already
wounded, knowing he was going to die—she was
after the inheritance. Was the rapist ignorant then from
the outset of the girl’s feelings?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_35_13" id="target_note_LCL500_35_13"><sup>13</sup></a> It says a great deal for her
clemency: she had the power to go before the magistrate
straight away, she was free to speak immediately the word
that would avenge herself and her injury, end the strain
upon her modesty, but she listened long to the petitioners.
First, this is a prior judgment by a woman who can be
induced to forgive; the wish to be asked is as good as persuasion.
Would it not be enough, gentlemen, if I simply
said: “She did not refuse”? After all, indignation breaks out
and anger is hardly ever contained in silence. 〚I am sorry
for this excellent and too sensitive<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_35_14" id="target_note_LCL500_35_14"><sup>14</sup></a> young man, that you
should so interpret his feelings.〛<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_35_15" id="target_note_LCL500_35_15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>It would have been enough to say: “She did not refuse.”
Gentlemen, I venture to say: “She promised.” &lt;For&gt; there
is more than one way of making a promise. People’s feelings
