my own hands and prepare poison so as to be caught. The
crimes of parricide are secret.</p>
<p>“So why did you have poison?” he says. Miserable indeed
is the lot of my youth, a youth I have to free!<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_397_4" id="target_note_LCL501_397_4"><sup>4</sup></a> Remedies
sadder than woes! I have to excuse myself for something
I had wanted to die rather than explain away,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_397_5" id="target_note_LCL501_397_5"><sup>5</sup></a> and my
last thoughts are brought before a jury. I am put on trial almost
beyond the grave. But not to deceive you, father, I
will reply in the words of my plight, I will reply as is my
habit, that is, no differently as a defendant than as a son: I
want to die. Oh how much easier it is for me to give you
reasons for death than for parricide! Or rather, I shall virtually
pass over those everywhere advanced and publicized.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_397_6" id="target_note_LCL501_397_6"><sup>6</sup></a>
I wanted to die. You ask why? Because I was born to
the miseries of mankind, fires, shipwrecks, wars. Happy
are they who die of their own choice! Scipio says: “It is
well &lt;with the general&gt;.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_397_7" id="target_note_LCL501_397_7"><sup>7</sup></a> I think because he was not going
to fight any more. What of Cato? Did he too do wrong? I
did<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_397_8" id="target_note_LCL501_397_8"><sup>8</sup></a> the same as Cato. This is the road to peace,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_397_9" id="target_note_LCL501_397_9"><sup>9</sup></a> a sweet
path to freedom from fear. You ask why I wanted to die?
Look, because I live, I am on trial. Why did I want to die?
For you see: I had spent my youth just as I would have
prayed. Nothing ever upset me, although sometimes even
successes<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_397_10" id="target_note_LCL501_397_10"><sup>10</sup></a> make against me. Whatever I asked of you,

of the reasons brought up against me publicly, i.e. cowardice.”
But that reason (singular) is staple to his defense and he has as
good as already given it (s.8). There are, however, other reasons
which he goes on to advance, the miseries of the human lot.
