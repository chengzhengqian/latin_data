they had so wanted it, it must be yours because you forced
them. If they had fought and lived, I should prosecute you
for improper punishment all the same. The loss of life is
easy: you took the reputation of innocence away from the
poor wretches and ordered them to die like the worst of
gladiators. You could not be acquitted if you had given discharge
to the unfortunates. Whom did you pit against each
other? Men of the same community, the same fortune,
with the same enemy. But in addition the most agonizing
feature is that they fought with you looking on; that is what
hurt most, that they gave satisfaction<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_413_18" id="target_note_LCL500_413_18"><sup>18</sup></a> at their enemy’s

be bound he urged them on and applauded the one who
stabbed first. But do what you might, neither one would
have killed his friend if he had not known that it was best
for both to die. If I well know the innocence of the unfortunates,
you did not get all you had hoped for; they ran together
with their flanks bare.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_413_20" id="target_note_LCL500_413_20"><sup>20</sup></a> For all your cruel devices,
they gave a good example.</p>
