without my adding entreaties, without my lowering
paternal authority? You would have much offended, even
if you had done what I asked.</p>
<p>But as it is, what had I asked of you? To yield the reward
to me. &lt;I was refused.&gt; I don’t speak of what was to follow.
Let us suppose the law was so framed that we contend in
court and a verdict about our valor be given with no danger:
would it not have been fair for you to yield, I don’t say
