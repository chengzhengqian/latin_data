be an adulteress? How comes it that if the husband did not
connive at any outrage this inheritance was consigned to
the good faith of him in particular? For some reason must
be found for his being heir. Did this rich man love this
beautiful woman, not daring to speak up to her, but doing
so with the husband (and hence the rumor) and as he<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_109_1" id="target_note_LCL501_109_1"><sup>1</sup></a>
hunted for a bequest did he<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_109_2" id="target_note_LCL501_109_2"><sup>2</sup></a> make the will?</p>
<p>Certain things, though not mentioned in the theme,
are manifest by their very nature. That the marriage between
these litigating parties is &lt;in bad shape&gt; seems to
me clearer than daylight. For I do not understand how the
estate was tacitly left in trust to the husband unless he were
conniving. This is to prevent one of the jurors requiring
manifest proofs. This is not a case that admits of a witness
or an attested document; we examine the conscience of the
opposing party. So the whole business of the jury is to find
the truth, which can become clear, where motives are hidden
and concealed by their nature, only if they think no
item petty by which truth can be found. So the mind of the
jury must be so prepared that it can be influenced even by
trivial pointers. It is by nature difficult to prove a tacit bequest
on trust. Nonetheless, how do we prove it? Certain
points, even if they are not strong in themselves, prevail by
accumulation.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_109_3" id="target_note_LCL501_109_3"><sup>3</sup></a> The inheritance pertains either to the poor
man or to the poor man’s wife. If it does not pertain to the
poor man, it pertains to the poor man’s wife. The rider was
written openly. Surely and clearly he was chosen with a
view to the passing on of the inheritance; his silence and
good faith necessarily relate to restoring the inheritance.
So he ought to restore it to somebody; if not to her, I ask
