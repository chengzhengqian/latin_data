<h2>308</h2>
<span class="label">Two wills</span>
<p>Let last wills be valid. Let the next of kin have the property
of intestates deceased without children. A man made a
friend his heir in his first will, then made a second naming
someone else. He died. The second will was invalidated.
The heir named in the former will and the relatives dispute
about the property.</p>
<span class="label"><span class="sc">declamation</span></span>
<p>Both in the custom of the community and in the laws it is
laid down that, whenever possible, the wills of persons deceased
be honored, and that for no trivial reason. For no
other consolation is seen for death except wish beyond
death.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_437_1" id="target_note_LCL500_437_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Otherwise even patrimony itself may seem a burden
if it doesn’t have an undiminished law, in which case,
while we are allowed complete freedom in its regard during
our lifetime, it is taken away when we die. Relatives
have second place after wills, and that only if a man dies intestate
and childless: not that it is absolutely right that the
property of the deceased come to them, but because property
left behind, in the middle as it were, doesn’t seem to
go to anyone else more appropriately. So it’s no use their
trying to lay a load on us with that word kinship, brandishing
blood and nature—people who have already been excluded
in two wills. And certainly, whenever the question
is about definite law established by our ancestors, there is
no need to praise the laws under which we live and according
to which you gentlemen must give your verdict.</p>
