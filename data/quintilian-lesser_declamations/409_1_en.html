neither, beats both? For what if those four were split into as
many verdicts? Would you then set them against me as a
single part? Doubtless no one of them would stand with
my three, but no one of them would be joined to another.
Would you make a single block out of four votes? By no
means. But what difference does it make whether the disagreement
is by twos or by units? Equally it cannot be
numbered as a part if it is divided into parts. What if two
pronounced stigma, two exile, two death, and one (as often
happens) abstained? Unquestionably the votes would be
equal. So if they<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_353_9" id="target_note_LCL501_353_9"><sup>9</sup></a> are equal with one subtracted, are they
not superior with one added? But, so you know the law
does not necessarily require two parts, look at the words:
“what the greater part decide,” it says: not “which of two.”
Finally, gentlemen, I must be brief. What penalty ought
the defendant to suffer if you leave out the death penalty?
What penalty? Exile, I suppose. So when four votes will
not yield to three, shall five succumb to two? &lt;Or stigma?&gt;
But the unfairness is the same. What will you do &lt;in this&gt;
controversy of punishments? You can’t suffer both. If you
bear the stigma, you must stay in the country; if you are expelled,
you leave the country.</p>
<p>“What then?” he says? “Shall I die when only three
wanted me to perish?” What about it? Is it so unfair that
you die, when you have confessed<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_353_10" id="target_note_LCL501_353_10"><sup>10</sup></a> and even in your own
judgment are eminently deserving of execution? For what
shall we reserve you? Evidently you will be a splendid example
to our citizens: your way of life is such that it was
possible for you to be convicted.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_353_11" id="target_note_LCL501_353_11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
