<span class="label">&lt;<span class="sc">declamation</span>&gt;</span>
<p>In itself the name of friend appears to me actually the
more sacred, for it proceeds from the heart, from intention;
the other is the gift of chance, of the circumstances of
birth, and things that are not of our own choice. My friend
wanted me to be his heir at one time (which is enough): he
never wanted you, &lt;neither&gt; when his judgment was working
nor when it was wandering.</p>
<span class="label"><span class="sc">discussion</span></span>
<p>Now the usual commonplace in favor of all wills.</p>
<span class="label"><span class="sc">declamation</span></span>

<h2>309</h2>
<span class="label">Rapist convicted</span>
<p>A girl brought up before the magistrates opted for marriage
with the young man who was said to have violated
her.He denied the rape. He fought it out in court. He lost.
He does not refuse to marry. She wants to opt.</p>
<span class="label"><span class="sc">discussion</span></span>
<p>This young man’s style should be restrained. For although
the theme in no &lt;way&gt; binds him so that he has to appear
as a rapist, still he cannot quarrel with the court’s decision.</p>
