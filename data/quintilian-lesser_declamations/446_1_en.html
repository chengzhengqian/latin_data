her whom he gave to his grandmother to be reared. On his
deathbed he made his son his heir, his wife alternate heir.
He ordered that his steward be manumitted. The boy was
brought back to his mother, and, pirates being sighted,
left<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_427_2" id="target_note_LCL501_427_2"><sup>2</sup></a> by her in a house by the shore. He disappeared. After
a few days a corpse with battered features, thought to be
the son’s, was cast up on the same shore and buried by the
mother with funeral rites. The steward, manumitted by
her,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_427_3" id="target_note_LCL501_427_3"><sup>3</sup></a> after a few years set out on business and found a
young man, whom he said was his master,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_427_4" id="target_note_LCL501_427_4"><sup>4</sup></a> in a slave mart.

<p>Gentlemen of the jury, we<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_427_7" id="target_note_LCL501_427_7"><sup>7</sup></a> proved our case abroad, proved
it at home to relatives, domestics, freedmen, grandmother;
only to this mother (for shame!) we cannot prove it. She is
so happy to believe herself bereaved that she doesn’t recognize
her own unless they are dead. If the power of greed
for money was not known before,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_427_8" id="target_note_LCL501_427_8"><sup>8</sup></a> it triumphs even over
nature. A woman who recently embraced a corpse as her
son now flees her son as though he were a corpse. For her
loss she believed only herself: for congratulation she believes
nobody. Alone of his relations she does not recognize
