to take them back would have opposed it except that a good
example might be made from their reception. So they deserve
some punishment, deserve stigma, if this were related
only to themselves.</p>

Athenians, that there is nothing which can strengthen military
discipline more than an example against the unworthy.

<p>“Whoso shall be at liberty by will of his master, let him be
free.”We must ask what is meant by being at liberty. * “He
