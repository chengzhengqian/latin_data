there is a hope of proving it. But when someone says “I
deposited it with you, you know it yourself,” what does he
appear to be doing except calling on the gods as witnesses?
So give us a reason why he claimed if he had not made the
deposit.</p>
<p>He could have had the money, that’s clear. He left heirs
himself and so did the other of the same rank. It is clear
that many reasons may arise among soldiers for depositing
money: a long journey came up, a dangerous mission. If
money were to be deposited, where is it more likely to be
deposited than with a man of the same rank? For beside
that good faith is more easily expected from an equal,
there is a kind of bond between the same rank. It is not
usual for a deposit to be made &lt;with a superior&gt; or with
an inferior 〚since the deposit is made so that it may be
returned〛. It is credible therefore that he deposited with a
man of his own rank. “But without a witness.” I shall speak
of all deposits. Sad, upon my word, is the condition of mortality
when a witness seems to be needed nowadays in
everything we do. Is truth not enough? Is there no divinity
in Faith?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_5_3" id="target_note_LCL501_5_3"><sup>3</sup></a> Can’t what two people know be regarded as sufficiently
proved?</p>
<p>However, let us come, as I said, to the proof. He killed
the man who was denying the money. Again I ask, for what
reason, what motive? “It was hate.” Why? I give a reason
why he should have killed: the denial. For you to exclude
this motive for the killing, you must substitute another. It
would have been proof enough if he had killed in secret,
from ambush, as though he were going to deny it.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_5_4" id="target_note_LCL501_5_4"><sup>4</sup></a> What
motive drove the man into crime? What was it that aroused
such fury—except that he knew he had given the money?
