<h2>248</h2>
<span class="label">Eight years for a double involuntary homicide</span>
<p>Let one found guilty of involuntary homicide be in exile for
five years. Let it be lawful to kill an exile inside the borders.
A man who had killed involuntarily went into exile. There
in the third year of his exile he committed another homicide
in a similar way. He completed the five-year period
dating from the second homicide. As he was returning
after the eighth year, somebody killed him inside the borders.
He stands trial for murder.</p>

<p>The killing of a man does not automatically involve crime
and conviction, since sometimes this is legally permissible.
〚And when it is permissible, it is also incumbent.〛 It is permissible
to kill an exile inside the borders. That legal right
arises in two ways: either the person returning is &lt;not&gt;
permitted to return at all or the person returning &lt;is not&gt;
permitted to return except &lt;after a time&gt;. I incline to think
that of the two the one who returns against the law when
he would later return legally seems the more justly killed.
The other might arguably be driven by homesickness and
ultimate desperation to cheat the law. Furthermore, since
exiles either return as eluding detection or as so licensed,
those who return openly against the law deserve death
considerably more. For in the former’s case the remission
of their cheat<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_39_1" id="target_note_LCL500_39_1"><sup>1</sup></a> does not necessarily make a harmful precedent
and someone who acknowledges that he is returning
