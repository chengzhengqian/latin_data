down &lt;once for all&gt;, defined once for all, they are cast in
their own definitions, their own words. If there were no
tyrannicide, perhaps it might be just tolerable that there
be a question whether you ought to take the will for the
deed; as it is, though we grant that what he did was similar
to a tyrannicide, it cannot however be preferred to the
thing to which it is similar. Therefore the law gives the reward
to us, not to you. So far as the religious duty of the
jury is concerned, it would be enough for the case to be
concluded at this point.</p>
<p>But why should we not now answer his plea too?—with
this admission at the outset, gentlemen of the jury: we confess
that he is a man of good intentions, we concede that he
is eager for freedom, as long as he on his side confesses that
he lacks courage, perhaps because of weakness either natural
or such as riches themselves are apt to bring in their

be bought? In the end, in our commonwealth is it not
spirit, not courage, not the hand, that brings a man to the
highest honor, but the strong-box and the steward? I like
the way you do business; and you thought out a fine short
cut—I won’t say to fame and reputation but to property, of
which you had more than enough anyhow. Tell me, tell
me now, how much did you pay &lt;to opt for&gt; whatever
you want? You say to me, “I gave money and put down
something from a part of my fortune that was lying idle,”
