In general, fathers cannot disown those they disown without
detailing the misbehavior. In the case of this son I only
have to point to the look of him to arouse disgust. What is
this get-up of my son’s, this filth? Why are you embarrassing
me by begging food from other people when you have a
father? Are you training yourself against Fortune? What
worse can happen? Do you suffer cold and hunger for fear
they may happen some day? Do you suffer something for
fear that it may some day have to be suffered? But you and
your like have a new style of self-promotion: you seek veneration
by misery. Hence that shamelessness—you count
modesty a crime and have taken to yourselves the most
opprobrious of names.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_311_2" id="target_note_LCL500_311_2"><sup>2</sup></a> But all philosophy-mongering is

<p>But if you can’t put up with being disowned, if you think
forfeiture of inheritance is an evil, then you have been
found out: you are affected by loss of money and damage to
reputation. A man who every day girds against this very
affluence, you want it all the same. So you don’t deserve it.
But let us admit what we feel; let vanity not put us outside
