of his remorse, his shame. And who can feel any indignation
at the killing of a man who has slain two? If there is
any compassion here, it ought to be for them.</p>
<p>This is what I would have said if I were speaking of a
man who came under the law condemning involuntary homicide.
What did the law lay down? “Let one found guilty
of involuntary homicide be in exile for five years.” It is no
concern of mine whether he committed involuntary homicide.
The law is not so framed as to require that he who has
committed involuntary homicide be in exile for five years
but that he who is found guilty of involuntary homicide be
in exile for five years. He killed a man while in exile, perhaps
involuntarily; but it should have been determined
that the killing was involuntary. For whenever someone
has been killed, there are two questions: was he in fact
killed by the person accused or was he killed involuntarily,
directly or indirectly? In this case it was clear that a man
was killed &lt;by the person in question&gt;, but it should have
been declared that the killing was involuntary. Not only
did he owe the law another five years, but a punishment in
perpetuity. To be found guilty of involuntary homicide is a
sort of acquittal. This did not happen in his case. But let us
remit punishment in perpetuity for the present. Who will

to an additional five years, starting at the expiry of the first term? The declaimer says there had been no verdict of involuntary
homicide on the second death, therefore no trial (none is
mentioned in the theme). Why then was the exile not free to return
at the end of the five-year term?</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL500_45_3a').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
