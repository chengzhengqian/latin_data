weighty is clear, since a man wants to die. So the senate
does not have to enquire whether these reasons for death
are weighty or not; the man who wishes to die thinks they
are, that is enough. But the enquiry is about whether the

easily if you separate them, so you might relieve the weight
of misfortunes if they don’t bear down &lt;all together&gt; but
come one at a time. A number of children at one time!
What if my wife too? 〚If that is weighty in itself, both loss
