<p>What if logic too is not at odds with the text and wording
of that law? For what do you think the lawmaker intended
when he laid down this statute? He did not want
women to possess too much wealth, for fear the community
be weighed down by their power. So he laid this down
against individual women; to obviate womenâ€™s wealth it
was enough to provide that no more than half of an estate
should be bequeathed to one of them individually. But the
laws did not stipulate that no more than one woman should
be written as heir in the same will, any more to be sure than
that more than one legacy should not be left to the same
women.</p>

<h2>265</h2>
<span class="label">Beater of a person under stigma in a temple</span>
<p>Whoso commits injury in a temple, let him pay ten thousand
to the person he has injured and ten to the community.
Let a person under stigma be barred from taking
action for injuries. A man beat a person under stigma in a
temple. The magistrate claims ten thousand in the name of
the community.</p>

<p>If a sense of decency is commendable, which is a very hard
matter in a financial suit, we are not at law for ourselves,
nor are we greedy even on behalf of the commonwealth
and the community. This entire action has been set up not
so much for gain, to acquire this money, as to avenge the
immortal gods and for the expiation, to use the proper
word, of the temple.</p>
<p>The law is as clear as our sense of decency is
