<p>I was saying just now: “I have a witness.” But I already
have a prejudgment. If a respectable witness swears, a controversy
is resolved: but I shall produce many sworn jurors.
The case was heard, investigated, and wrapped up. I say

case was not only judged but judged abroad, where there
were no relatives, where there was hardly anyone who
knew this boy’s father.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_441_43" id="target_note_LCL501_441_43"><sup>43</sup></a> And yet, upon my word, what sort

She says: “The freedman gave money to the slave dealer

not have put herself into the freedman’s hands and the freedman
would not have put himself into the dealer’s hands, risking exposure
