<p>But I killed my enemy. Whom? A poor man, with no
power in the senate-house or the assembly. Enemies stand
on equal terms. But suppose he was my enemy: do I have
to resort to murder straight away? Are verbal arguments
ended with weapons? Even public enemies are spared:
Caesar wanted to pardon Cato. And then, do I kill him with
my own hand? Am I such a savage? Isn’t there poison, an
assassin? And I am rich. And then, along with my wife.
Don’t I spare her even? And then, how? Do I haul him out
of the street? Doesn’t he cry out, appeal to the citizenry?
And do I call in a parasite as my accomplice in such a
crime, and throw him out afterwards? Am I not afraid of
his informing on me?</p>
<p>“How then,” he says, “did he seduce your wife?” You
ask me to account for another person’s action. How do I
know whether this was his way of getting even since he had
no other? “He was poor,” says the prosecution. As though
women are seduced by money only, particularly rich ones.
They are more taken by allurements and endearments. At
all events, if any of the household helped,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_405_3" id="target_note_LCL501_405_3"><sup>3</sup></a> it was done
through the parasite; and that was why he was thrown out<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_405_4" id="target_note_LCL501_405_4"><sup>4</sup></a>
and why nobody took him in—because he had injured the
man who had taken him up most generously.</p>
<p>“But the parasite said so.” First, he is only one witness;
second, he is a parasite. “He said so under torture.” I believe
him all the less. People often lie under torture. Further,
he had a reason for lying, because he had been sent
packing, because he committed temple-theft by reason of
poverty and did not get away with it.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_405_5" id="target_note_LCL501_405_5"><sup>5</sup></a> Hence I am on trial.</p>
