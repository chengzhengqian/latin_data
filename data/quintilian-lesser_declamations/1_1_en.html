<h2>&lt;Adulteress killed by exiled husband&gt;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_9_1" id="target_note_LCL500_9_1"><sup>1</sup></a></h2>
<p>Let one found guilty of involuntary homicide be exiled for
five years. Let it be lawful to kill an adulterer along with an
adulteress.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_9_2" id="target_note_LCL500_9_2"><sup>2</sup></a> &lt;A person found guilty of involuntary homicide
returned at night to visit his wife before completing
his five years of punishment. Finding her in adultery, he
killed her. Returning after the five years, he is charged with
homicide.&gt;</p>
<span class="label"><span class="sc">declamation</span></span>
<p>* * * is clear, and anyway in this of all communities it is beyond
dispute that &lt;not all&gt; persons admitting to a homicide
&lt;automatically&gt; come under the law. How shall you
distinguish * * * Do you require that I cure adultresses?
&lt;You killed them.&gt; So who doubts that this is legal in this
community? “Let it be lawful to kill an adulterer along
with the adulteress,” so it runs. Isn’t that just what I did?
“But you had no right to kill,” and his whole quibble boils
down to this, his denial of my right to kill: first, because I
did not have citizen rights during my time in exile and laws
