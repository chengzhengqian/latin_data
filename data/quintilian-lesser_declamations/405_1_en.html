band of a beautiful wife, was solicited three times by a foreign
neighbor, a businessman, for his wife’s favors, at a
named price. The husband sent a wardrobe maid dressed
as her mistress. He is accused of maltreatment.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_345_2" id="target_note_LCL501_345_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p>The husband is to be defended with the following color:
Let him be said to have been a careful guardian of his wife’s
chastity, also naturally anxious and sedulous. When he was
solicited about his wife’s favors, he was surprised at the
audacity of the foreign businessman. When he was approached
again, he began to have some suspicion of his
wife too; as far as now appears, more from a defect in his
own nature than from any fault of his wife. But when the
adulterer<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_345_3" id="target_note_LCL501_345_3"><sup>3</sup></a> urged him even for a third time, he was unable
to hide his suspicion and anxiety. So because he thought
that the adulterer had previously had some talk with his
wife through the wardrobe maid, he summoned the latter
and asked her whether she knew anything about an adultery.
She answered that her mistress was innocent and not
even known to the businessman. “In short, if you doubt my
word, send me dressed as your wife. I’ll see whether he can
tell the difference.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_345_4" id="target_note_LCL501_345_4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
