comrades; the general flattered me. Community, rumor
has deceived you. I a hero, an old man? I a hero, the father
of a deserter?〛<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_33_4" id="target_note_LCL501_33_4"><sup>4</sup></a> But suppose I cannot have this: then I
don’t use the honor of valor, I don’t take on the burdens of a
hero. Don’t give me rewards. I am not killing the deserter
as a hero. Discharge me from my merit, free me from the
name. 〚And you certainly have another punishment.〛 The
law wished the deserter to be killed by a hero, as a thoroughly
useless, thoroughly hateful being.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_33_5" id="target_note_LCL501_33_5"><sup>5</sup></a> It did not lay
this down as a penalty for the hero, nor impose it on him if
he refused, nor any other compulsion against his will. For
what will you do if I don’t kill him? Where does this ordinance
take us? You have no law. But you want to avenge

then does this have to do with parricide? “Kill your son too,

strong to say: “I don’t want to kill him.” You will forgive me
if I say: “I can’t; my hand, which used to be called strong,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_33_6" id="target_note_LCL501_33_6"><sup>6</sup></a>

<p>I know, gentlemen, that good fathers now blame me, as
not knowing how to opt for reward. A better, more loving
father would say: “Give me my son for my services. I became
a hero, shed so much enemy blood, was one of the
factors in victory: won’t that do for the work of two?” If I
was a better father, I should frankly admit that it was my
fault my son deserted. What need was there to lead a stripling
into battle? What need was there to pit tender years
against a very formidable enemy in a very bitter fight? Or
at least, if love of glory, desire for praise was so great, I
