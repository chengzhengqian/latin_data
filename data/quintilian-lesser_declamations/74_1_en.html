<p class="noindent">“Tyrants come often.” First, how unfair it is that
because you have rascals even those who are agreed to
be good citizens should be stripped of property inherited
from their fathers and grandfathers! If we are afraid of tyranny,
it would have been a good deal more equitable that
actions be directed against the persons of those who could
be suspect to the commonwealth than that there should be
public penalty for, as you say, public fear. Add that largeness
of means is not the principal reason for aiming at a tyranny.
On the contrary, tyranny is a good deal more likely to
be seized by broken men, crippled in fortune, who cannot
survive in a stable commonwealth. Then, you are so far
from inhibiting tyranny by this means that if there are
madmen in our community they will actually have a reason
for aiming at tyranny. For if a man seizes tyranny in order
to get possession of other men’s goods, how much more
readily will he get to be a tyrant in order to protect his own
or retrieve his own!</p>
