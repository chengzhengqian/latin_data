that adultery counts as a charge, parricide as defamation?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_59_4" id="target_note_LCL501_59_4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>“I want to plead on adultery.” Which is to say, that witness
is dead. And am I at this time at leisure to worry about
my bed? Weeping and bereaved, shall I complain because
my wife has loved another, preferred another to me? Even
earlier on I should never have brought that charge into
court except that my son knew. If I had merely lost that fine
young man, still I should be excused if I called off all other
cases. I must confess the truth: I killed him, yes, I, when I
named him openly, when I confessed that my confidence
about the earlier trial lay entirely in him. Further, what
does it matter to you?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_59_5" id="target_note_LCL501_59_5"><sup>5</sup></a> Use the argument that I did not
want to tax you with adultery, make it one of the points
prejudicial to the prosecution—so long as I get <span class="italic">my</span> trial.
Tell me of a law under which both offenses can be punished.</p>
<p>I expect you will say among other things: “What reason
did I have to poison my son? I was not an adulteress.”We’ll
see <span class="italic">there</span>;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_59_6a" id="target_note_LCL501_59_6a"><sup>6</sup></a> we’ll put our case <span class="italic">there</span>. And you were well
aware of it. But desire for delay is natural to wicked people.
Here<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_59_7" id="target_note_LCL501_59_7"><sup>7</sup></a> you see infamy as the punishment. But what is reputation
or public opinion to you? But certain thoughts occur:
“There will be argument on the adultery and it will
take a long time and the trial will be dragged on, as it is so
far. The penalty for adultery will be followed by another
indictment, another jury, and another drawing of lots.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_59_8" id="target_note_LCL501_59_8"><sup>8</sup></a>
Meanwhile, if tricks don’t work, the Fates can do much.</p>
