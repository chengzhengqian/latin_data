community. For if in court there is always to be question
about laws, what is just in them, what equitable, what
convenable to the community, there was no need for laws
to be written at all. And I do believe there were times in
the past when justice rested on judgment, alone and unsupported.
But menâ€™s minds pulled it this way and that, and
the right course could never be adequately determined;
for that reason a fixed pattern was put in place by which we
were to live. Those authors of our laws embraced this pattern
in words; if this may be changed and perverted to suit
particular interests, there goes the whole meaning and use
of law. For what does it matter whether laws are nonexistent
or whether their import is doubtful?</p>
<p>That law embraced the provision that no more than a
half be left to a woman. That no more than a half was left
to either one of my clients is clear. And if the lawmaker
had wished that only half an estate go to females and half
be left to males in all circumstances, he could obviously
have provided just that. No big, difficult roundabout was
needed,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_173_4" id="target_note_LCL500_173_4"><sup>4</sup></a> only a law so framed that no more than half an
estate go to females. For I ask: if &lt;somebody&gt; bequeaths
to a number of women, but somewhat lesser portions,
which however when calculated and amalgamated amount
to more than one half of the estate, I ask, can there be a legal
challenge. For if suit be filed, it will not, as I imagine,
be under this law, under which more than half the estate
may not be bequeathed to a female, since none of them
will get a half. But if you ask us to calculate the total, it
makes no difference how much is left to each woman.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_173_5" id="target_note_LCL500_173_5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
