father, even alone, I obtained.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_399_11" id="target_note_LCL501_399_11"><sup>11</sup></a> Let it be said, saving your
majesty: we are not all so brave, not all of us can bear fighting.
But not everybody who cannot kill an enemy is automatically
able to kill his father. Dispositions vary: some enjoy
&lt;business, others&gt; leisure. I wanted to be a soldier
along with you.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_399_12" id="target_note_LCL501_399_12"><sup>12</sup></a> There! A parricide: I wanted to live under
your judgment. Eager to show it, I even called friends into
your presence. But after I was ordered: “I must obey my
father,” I said. “Let us go to war. What should I have to fear
for myself if my father has no fears for his son?” I saw some
struck down, others put to flight, whole armies slaughtered.
I gave myself to the peril, submitted me, as though
cheap in my own eyes, to Fortune. And therefore, I think, I
was victorious, poor wretch! Then it was that, considering
my perils and wounds, “What?” I said. “Can no one be
victorious here, unless he wants to die?” I returned to
my father’s house: there was no discharge, not even after
the victory. “If it is necessary, let us die,” I say, “but at
home. There at least my father will bury me.” Yet still hoping
the while for a father’s clemency: “Let my father see,” I
said. “Let him catch me. He did not believe<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_399_13" id="target_note_LCL501_399_13"><sup>13</sup></a> me when I
begged, let him believe me when I die.” I put myself in his
way with the poison to make him take pity on me. But, as I
see, I made my father more cruel. And now I understand:
you wanted your son to perish when you sent him into the
battle.</p>
<p>If you insist, give me back the poison. Let me die by my
own means. But pity your heir, pity the hero: let me get by
your judgment what I could not win from you through
friends.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_399_14" id="target_note_LCL501_399_14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
