<p>So I understand, gentlemen, that I ought not only to
strive to mitigate my father’s anger, soften him, but that it is
in my role (and I ask this invoking your support) that he be
willing to be friends again with my relative<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_117_5" id="target_note_LCL500_117_5"><sup>5</sup></a> and his ransomer.
For I shall make no boast of my filial behavior: it
was <span class="italic">his</span> doing that I ransomed.</p>

<h2>258</h2>
<span class="label">Hero defies hero father</span>
<p>If two or more become heroes, let them contend in arms
for the reward. Let the hero opt for what he wants. A father
and son become heroes. The father asked his son to yield
the reward to him; he was refused. He yielded himself, and
disowns.</p>
<span class="label"><span class="sc">declamation</span></span>
<p>Even if it were possible for the reason<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_117_1" id="target_note_LCL500_117_1"><sup>1</sup></a> to be concealed, the</p>
<p class="noindent">refusal of a parent’s request in itself deserved disowning.
For how much could<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_117_2" id="target_note_LCL500_117_2"><sup>2</sup></a> he render me so as to make me an
equal return? I am not now debiting you with things commonly
brought up—the daylight, the right of freedom, the
use of life: I debit you with this very fact that you became a
hero. This bodily strength of yours is mine. This courage
ready to despise danger flowed from mine. For a long
while I made a hero of you by precept, most recently by example
also. However much I ask of you, is it not enough to
name it? Is it not enough for a desire to come to your notice
