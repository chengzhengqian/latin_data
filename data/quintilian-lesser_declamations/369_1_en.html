<p class="noindent">I have been harmed. Even if no vengeance were due for
my suffering, consolation<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_273_7" id="target_note_LCL501_273_7"><sup>7</sup></a> would be due. But let us see also
why this thing is done. Two young men, our sons, were
both in love with the same prostitute. The question was,
which one would have her. I want to put it to you, whether
knowing this you gave money to <span class="italic">your</span> son. I want to know
whether, when you saw my son (as you think) wanting to
die, you had any such apprehension about your own. My
son says he wants to die because of his love: your son is in
love too. Here I shall catch your fatherly feelings:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_273_8" id="target_note_LCL501_273_8"><sup>8</sup></a> if you
had thought there was a chance of death, then indeed you
would have run to your son. So what was your calculation?
You did not save my son, but reformed your son. There was
one method, I believe, of turning him away from his burning
impulse, if the love were directed elsewhere, if the
power to commit that ugliness was taken from him.
So your son lives on, and lives respectably, and now
lives without gossip. But you have given me a prostitute for
a daughter-in-law, you have made my house a brothel, and
as though it was not enough to have done me these injuries,
you still want to assert to the jury that my son would
not have lived if the prostitute had not been redeemed.</p>

<span class="label">A poor man hired to kill a tyrant</span>
<p>Let a tyrannicide opt for whatever he will. A rich man gave
a poor young man money to kill a tyrant. He killed him.
They are at odds about the reward.</p>
