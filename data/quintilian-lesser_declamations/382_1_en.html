free his son of anxiety, it is quicker for him to pardon him
straight away.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_299_2" id="target_note_LCL501_299_2"><sup>2</sup></a> His pleading will have to be varied, so that
he says his son deserves death but doubts whether he himself
can go through with it. But those points that have to do
with the question of dementia itself, though common to
other controversies of this kind, are not to be passed over.
For we shall say that dementia cannot be nailed by a single
charge and we shall support this proposition of ours by a
definition, saying that dementia is a loss of understanding
in all matters, that anyway nobody is so fortunate as not to
do some things worthy of regret, not to be subject to error,
and that this is not characteristic of a person demented but
of a human being. Add to this that in common with all such
cases we shall also add something specially, that the dementia
concerned in this trial is said to be of a kind that can
be removed by a single word.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_299_3" id="target_note_LCL501_299_3"><sup>3</sup></a> Further, since it is admitted
that dementia is incurable, so much so that it has not yet
been possible to discover what causes dementia or where
the mind settles,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_299_4" id="target_note_LCL501_299_4"><sup>4</sup></a> what is in a man’s own power surely cannot
be considered to be dementia.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_299_5" id="target_note_LCL501_299_5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

<p>If I am won over, I shall all at once be not only a sane but a
good and indulgent father. Do you want to know, my son,
what dementia is? It is to put one’s life at risk because of
lust, not to understand the peace,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_299_6" id="target_note_LCL501_299_6"><sup>6</sup></a> not to understand the
laws, and, if beyond this the present predicament counts
for anything, to accuse a man whom you need to win over.</p>
