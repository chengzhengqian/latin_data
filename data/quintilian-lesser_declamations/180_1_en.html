intercourse of the community, that persons deprecating
the stigma of paternal punishment become objects of pity
most of all because their past status seems imperiled. That
my son should be concerned on that account is certainly
incredible. How little will it matter that he will be disowned
when he is already a parasite! Would that I could
call him contumacious, gentlemen, resisting as he does so
obstinately not only my admonishments but my entreaties.
As it is, he took this license into his head because of a slave
mentality. The fact is that the favor of a rich young prodigal,
who displays his power over my son as if a chattel of his
own were concerned, greatly emboldens him. This person
too is unfortunate; for I have so shocking a son that he himself
is reproached with the connection. Nor does the reason
for this large gathering escape me; they have flocked
here to look at two bumpkins, and perhaps he himself
passed the word. Well he might: this is how he gets his

but even for enjoyment if it were cultivated by two owners.
After I had worked it for a long time,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_367_2" id="target_note_LCL500_367_2"><sup>2</sup></a> I did not refuse the
burden of taking a wife and raising children in order to
leave to my son what my parents left to me. Of himself I
made no complaint; he seemed a hard worker. I sent him
into town. He returned less countrified and was in a hurry
