death, against adulterers, adultery would more often be
committed with impunity. So they laid down a second penalty;
they had regard for the weaker brethren, the more
lenient. Perhaps they reflected also that not all would have
the strength. They tempered severity so that each avenged
himself according to his capability.</p>
<p>I have spoken as though for a young man, I have spoken
as though for a husband; I must speak as for one not into
puberty. Upon my word, I cannot quite settle in my mind
whether it was lawful for him to kill the adulterers. For
how would your son have been defended if someone had
come along to say: “You killed human beings when you
were not yet a husband; for the meaning of this name does
not consist in the initial appellation, and it is not enough to
be reckoned a husband merely for a kiss.” Next he would
