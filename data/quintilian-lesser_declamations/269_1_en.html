libeling both of us. Now, brother, whatever part of nature
you are in, I must plead your case too. Some degree of
brotherly good will at its utmost seemed at one time to
have been lacking, perhaps because each of us, confident
in his own feelings, demanded more of the other’s.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_73_7" id="target_note_LCL501_73_7"><sup>7</sup></a> Fortune
was kind in that each of us was in good case at that
time, our homes without tears, no suspicion of parricide at
that period when we were less fond of one another. But
it was not the fault of our own hearts, except that overeagerness
for &lt;friends&gt; is a vice of the human heart.
These<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_73_8" id="target_note_LCL501_73_8"><sup>8</sup></a> are the folk who separate minds conjoined, insert

that’s enough) good will and once more solid brotherhood;
or rather, upon my word, greater and closer association
after repentance. Men who have never disagreed do not
know the blessing of brotherhood. Just as fair weather is
the sweeter after a storm, so to our hearts, torn and long
chastened, comes the haven as it were of brotherhood. We
were loving even in retrospect; it was not affection,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_73_10" id="target_note_LCL501_73_10"><sup>10</sup></a> but
