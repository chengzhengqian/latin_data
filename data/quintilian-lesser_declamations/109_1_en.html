that an utterance be elicited from the victim but
only her wish, let us see now whether the raped girl wished
her rapist to die. Would you think it of more weight, gentlemen,
that she had spoken before a magistrate than the
fact that she did not have the courage to come before a
magistrate, that she could not show her eyes to bystanders
or to the light of day, that the unfortunate girl ended her
life by her own hand? Give her the strength: she will kill

has perished, although it is certain that my daughter perished
on account of the rapist. [This they call cause of his
death.] Why then ought the person killed to be avenged
when it is certain that, if he were alive, he ought to be
killed? And that all that that I have said in my defense,
showing that I was not liable under this law, is not
