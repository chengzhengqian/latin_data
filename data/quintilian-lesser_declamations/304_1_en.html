at this moment. For if it was the cause of diseases that a
man in our community, but by his own will and intention,
had seized the castle and robbed us of our freedom,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_143_8" id="target_note_LCL501_143_8"><sup>8</sup></a> how
will the immortal gods punish what we shall have done? So
we shall bring out that body, condemned of all and of his
own self, in public obsequies! To work! Let a great funeral
procession be led, let the senate go first, and let that most
venerable order, though happy in the recent recovery of
freedom, transfer their countenances and dress to sorrow;
then let a great multitude of Knights, finally the entire
people, move in a circle round the pyre. Let us add tears
also: “We have lost a tyrannicide, avenger of the commonwealth
and author of our freedom!” Then let us go back
home and tell our children: “These are the rewards of
valor.” Or shall someone even ascend the rostrum and call
an assembly of the people and sing the praises of the man
we are about to bury in the Forum—the supreme honor
given to illustrious citizens? The immortal gods shall hear
it, who freed us from the plague, who sent most grievous
distempers—propitious gods! If anyone believes what I
say, at this moment my mind is on this thought, this picture:
from that tyrant’s burning pyre I think diseases will
rise straight away, and wherever that ill-omened fire shall
disperse its dire and accursed smoke upon the community,
I think a pestilential cloud will settle over our houses and
roofs. What responses shall we seek then, what aid?—we
men who do the immortal gods the crowning injury of
making them seem to have given the response that saved
the commonwealth for the sake of the tyrant?</p>
