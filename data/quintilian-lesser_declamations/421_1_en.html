result was that I didn’t lack someone to beat me in my old
age. The one whom I had taken up to protect me, whom I
hoped would be my champion even against strangers, had
beaten me so openly that he could not even deny it. Foolishly,
I still persevered in the same indulgence and when
my friends asked me who had beaten me, I went on lying.
“Come now,” they say, “are you waiting for him to kill you?”</p>
<p>They haled me into the Forum, showed the marks
on my battered face. He confessed, the judge found him
guilty, the executioner took off his hands: I had no part in
that trial except tears. While the parricide is talked about
all over the community, impiety found its origin.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_377_7" id="target_note_LCL501_377_7"><sup>7</sup></a> Look, as
you see, he beats me again. “I ask eye-for-eye,” says he.</p>
<p>What are you doing? Do you charge me with cruelty?
Whom did I ever beat? My way is to pity even strangers. I
crippled you, though you were mine. Was it in wine? Was it
in madness? Was I angry? Eye-for-eye is retribution for injury.
The law was written to the end that nobody should
play the ruffian with impunity. So do you say that I took
away &lt;your hands&gt; injuriously? I cut them off under the
law; and not I, but the executioner. Anything done by law is
usually not punished by law. And by what law? “Whoso
beats his father.” “But you,” says he, “were not his father.”
