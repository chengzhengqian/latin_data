that the trial was not concluded,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_55_9" id="target_note_LCL500_55_9"><sup>9</sup></a> I suffered enough injury
in the former trial, and with fair judges it can be considered
a completed action, since I as litigator was not permitted
to consummate it.</p>
<p>So I have dealt with points that pertained to my case:
that an adulterer cannot always be accused previously, that
I did sue, that even though the action was not completed,
yet, since the commonwealth interposed and it was not
completed by reason of the hero’s law, the action should be
viewed as though I had done whatever I wished. 〚I wish to
come closer for a summary of this matter. The crime of
adultery involves two persons. Of these two it must needs
be that he who prosecutes the adulterer first also prosecutes
the adulteress. So can you say to me that I am prosecuting
you first? You cannot. I laid charge against you in
the second place, I brought you before the magistrates in
the second place. But whatever is second must have something
prior. These things are so linked by nature that if I
sued the adulterer first, I am suing you; If not, I am suing
you first as though I were suing the adulterer.〛<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_55_10a" id="target_note_LCL500_55_10a"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>It remains, gentlemen, also to examine what the commonwealth
had in view when it gave the reward. The hero,
I imagine, asked for the quashing on his own account and
could not get any quashing except the one he asked for.</p>

by somebody. Two alternatives are presented: (a) the
prosecution of one of the pair involving that of the other; (b) the
prosecution of the adulteress following that of the lover. Applying (b) there is no problem; the prosecutor will be in compliance with
the law. But if his prosecution is disallowed as incomplete, he can
apply (a), calling a prosecution of the adulteress a prosecution of
the lover. That, however, nullifies the legal basis of the controversy,
which by the word <span class="italic">prius</span> requires a separate prosecution of
the lover. But it could be argued that the <span class="italic">intention</span> of the law
would be met by prosecuting them jointly.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL500_55_10a').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
