<p>The rich man has two things to do:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_275_1" id="target_note_LCL501_275_1"><sup>1</sup></a> make himself the
tyrannicide and the more deserving of the reward. He cannot
be the tyrannicide unless by accumulation of detail
he approves himself as worthy of the reward and it is as
though he had done the killing.</p>
<span class="label"><span class="sc">declamation</span></span>
<p>The first thing to be said on behalf of the claimant to the
reward is: he killed the tyrant. Can that be doubted? Does
our opponent as much as raise any controversy about that?
Let us see later on then what comparison lies between
their respective deservings: meanwhile, even if the rich
man’s deservings are greater, they are different. Grant that
he is an excellent citizen, has done outstanding service to
the community: my client is the tyrannicide. Perhaps what
the other did will be to his advantage when he stands for
office: meanwhile, you gentlemen are in session with respect
to this law, this statute; meanwhile, my client appeals
to the commonwealth in the words of the law.</p>
<p>It would have been enough for me to have approved
this to you if the only question was whether he should be
the recipient. But since we have got into this dispute, let us
see how our opponent makes himself the tyrannicide. He
thought about the country’s freedom but that is not yet
tyrannicide. He urged somebody on, gave money, did everything
to make my client perform tyrannicide: although
I may admit that this is similar to tyrannicide, the very fact
that it is similar shows that it is something else. Who gives
you license to bend laws and transfer them? They were laid
