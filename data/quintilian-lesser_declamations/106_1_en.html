<p>“Let him who has been the cause of a death receive capital
punishment.” The punishment itself is enough to show
that this law applies only to a person who has committed
the same thing as if he had killed. For the lawgiver could
not have laid down a harsher penalty against one who had
slaughtered with his own hand than he did against one
who had supplied a cause. So from the similarity of the
punishment you should require a similar crime also. To
what purpose is this? So that you don’t think the definition
with which the other side embraces the matter to be true,
namely that whoever has brought about the killing of a
human being is automatically regarded as the cause of a
death. Otherwise by your argument the accuser of a guilty
man was the cause of his death, and one who gave evidence
against a defendant, even though it was the truth, can none
the less be considered the cause of his death, and one
who has revealed adulterers to a husband, and one who
has brought a criminal into public view. Why then cannot
these be accused under this law? Because they themselves
were not the sole cause, since those who were put to death
perished legally. But let us keep this part till later. Meanwhile,
let us see what a cause of death is. We say that a
cause of a death is what has brought death to a human being
by itself, what has brought harm without any additional
extraneous causes, something by which a human being
would have perished even if he himself had done nothing.</p>
