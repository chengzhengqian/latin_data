the community only after his information has been approved,
he would have said so plainly and openly. As it is, I
think the lawgiver was content to look at the intention. So
it is enough that he did not invent anything, did not lie
from a desire to return, did nothing in fine in order to remain.
What do you say? Do you hold that he lied? Let us
ask half the jury. I am not now accusing the defendant. He
got off, he was acquitted, he has the benefit of the law. I am

whether the defendant should be convicted of plotting to
set up a tyranny but also at the same time whether this man
ought to remain in the community. If equal votes favor the
