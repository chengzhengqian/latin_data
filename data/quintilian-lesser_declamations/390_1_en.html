given the same warning to himself. He had realized that it
was empty talk, without any proofs, and so said that the
exile knew nothing, and there was no need for him to be
recalled. But the others, who were in consternation, had
decreed that the return of one exile was not of such importance
that the community should be kept any longer in
such fear. The decree of the senate was not known to
everybody (and indeed in a scare of this sort everything is
apt to be done in a hurry), but everybody knew of that law

decree<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_315_4" id="target_note_LCL501_315_4"><sup>4</sup></a> was not known to everybody but the status of the

<p>I am getting up a tyranny! For you see: I am in with criminals,
I want exiles to be recalled, I don’t catch their doings,
their plots!<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_315_5" id="target_note_LCL501_315_5"><sup>5</sup></a> If I had had this<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_315_6" id="target_note_LCL501_315_6"><sup>6</sup></a> in mind, would I have done
everything so openly and gone myself of all people to the
exile? Would I have revealed myself and my plan right
away to an innocent man<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_315_7" id="target_note_LCL501_315_7"><sup>7</sup></a>? Ought I not to have been afraid
of this very thing<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_315_8" id="target_note_LCL501_315_8"><sup>8</sup></a>? Would I have added my vote to this
suspicion, so as to seem as if I was afraid of an informer?</p>
