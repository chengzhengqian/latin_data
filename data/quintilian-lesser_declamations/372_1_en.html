whereas I say: “I scaled the castle, I mowed down the
guards, I butchered his wicked body with repeated blows.”
“I gave money, talked about killing the tyrant.” That was a
very dangerous thing to do, if you had not happened upon
a tyrannicide. Let it be enough for you, you rich men, that
your wealth enables you to lend money through stewards,
that you manage your households through agents, hold
most of your property in your absence, that if there is any

every day we suffer injuries and indignities. We need some
brave man, some good citizen, someone to free us from
these great evils.” If he were to ask you as you speak why
you don’t do it yourself, no doubt you will answer: “I can’t,
I don’t have the spirit or the strength” and you will add:
“You can.”</p>

spirit made with money! Maybe we are drawn into all manner
of things by gain, maybe hope leads us to work, leads
us to endurance, but no one takes &lt;so great&gt; a risk with
thought of time to come. Has anyone ever had money in
view when about to embark on a peril from which he does
