thought me criminal, if I had refused him? As it was, he
promised a fuller vengeance, leaving my hands clean and
untainted, himself too a strict father; for you should not
think he lacked gravity, did not have the spirit to punish.
He disowned, and that he did not do this for the occasion
his will made clear. So my father did not promise me
money and I had other reasons than money for letting him
go and he was not disowned for me to make an incidental
profit.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_263_3" id="target_note_LCL500_263_3"><sup>3</sup></a> For nobody can be persuaded that the person disowned
suffered all this on my account.</p>
<p>How much more ample a vengeance has come my way!
The punishment of death is brief; as it is, he is long in want,
long in bad odor.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_263_4" id="target_note_LCL500_263_4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

That this girl, my client, was raped is agreed. That she was
raped by the man for whose property she opts is not denied.
That the law gave her power to opt for whichever she
wished is common ground between us. So what is there to
stand in the way?</p>
<p>They say that the girl should not be given the option
