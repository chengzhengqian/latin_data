<p>Were it not, gentlemen of the jury, that rich men find the
chief pleasure of reckless violence in actually glorying in
their crimes, it had been worth while to let vengeance for
our most unfortunate fellow citizens go by the board, if
only the perpetrator could hold his tongue. For here is the
manifest impropriety of the improper punishment that
was exacted: he devised how death should be exacted from
his enemies and imputed to themselves. He forced men innocent,
even though found guilty, to fight each other.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_405_1" id="target_note_LCL500_405_1"><sup>1</sup></a>
Even in their calamity<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_405_2" id="target_note_LCL500_405_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Fortune had joined them: he ordered
them to kill each other knowingly, which was for
them the worst fate of all.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_405_3" id="target_note_LCL500_405_3"><sup>3</sup></a> Consider, gentlemen, what
those who did this were afraid of.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_405_4" id="target_note_LCL500_405_4"><sup>4</sup></a> Moreover, gentlemen,
while number generally makes crimes appear more hateful,
we will admit that the fact that both perished is to be
counted as one consolation in our grief: he set them against
each other on the terms that if one prevailed he could not
go back after five years.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL500_405_5" id="target_note_LCL500_405_5"><sup>5</sup></a> So if vengeance should be consistent
with the law, gentlemen, never was anything devised
so contrary to our laws as that an exile should kill &lt;an exile&gt;
caught inside the borders; but if your justice should exact
a punishment for cruelty, he was not content with what an
angry law had written against unfortunates. For how much
heavier punishment they endured than they deserved,
judge thus: this an enemy chose, and &lt;a rich&gt; enemy, angry
with poor men; for hate sits deepest when a man is angry
with those he despises.</p>
<p>They had taken a stand against his wealth in the consciousness
