Ago<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_39_1" id="target_note_LCL501_39_1"><sup>1</sup></a> to look at the persona of him before whom the case is
to be pleaded,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_39_2" id="target_note_LCL501_39_2"><sup>2</sup></a> so too I must now also warn you to look at
the persona which we are assuming. What is this father
like? Not harsh: he did not disown the loose-liver or scold
him; even when doing something by way of admonishing
him he said nothing. He is not hard: for he wept.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_39_3" id="target_note_LCL501_39_3"><sup>3</sup></a> Whatever
we say against the “color” of such a disposition will be
in some sort said contrary to the theme. So we ought to
take the plan of our whole plea from what came before.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_39_4" id="target_note_LCL501_39_4"><sup>4</sup></a>
What did come before other &lt;than&gt; a certain mild embarrassment?
<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_39_5" id="target_note_LCL501_39_5"><sup>5</sup></a> So when we shall have made our point that a
conviction of dementia must not be reached from one action,
we shall come to the process of our defense. Let us be
clear about the earlier life; not only because the defendant
can thus be defended but because the embarrassment recoils
upon the prosecutor.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL501_39_6" id="target_note_LCL501_39_6"><sup>6</sup></a> For everything he says on his
own behalf he will say against the son.</p>
<span class="label"><span class="sc">declamation</span></span>
<p>What did I do dementedly? As a young man I lived frugally,
I increased my patrimony, I married a wife, I acknowledged
a son, I love him. “You follow me in public,”
he says, “weeping.” These items could be defended separately;
for nobody in the world could be surprised because
as a father I followed my son and, separated from this, the
tears might seem to have nothing to do with you. But lest I
be thought to be sliding out of my prosecutor’s charge by
any device, I will join what is brought against me in its entirety.
