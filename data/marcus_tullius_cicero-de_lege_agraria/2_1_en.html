he wants money. I suppose he will think out some plan and bring it forward. For in the former articles the dignity of the Roman people was violated, the name of our realm aroused the common hatred of all the world, cities that had been pacified, the lands of our allies, the status of kings, were presented to the decemvirs; now he wants a certain sum<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL240_345_a" id="target_note_LCL240_345_a"><sup>a</sup></a> in cash paid down on the spot. I am waiting to see what<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> our watchful and sagacious tribune of the people is thinking out. “Let the Scantian forest be sold.” says he. Did you, I ask, find this forest in the list of neglected possessions<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL240_345_b" id="target_note_LCL240_345_b"><sup>b</sup></a> or in the pasture registers of the censors?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL240_345_c" id="target_note_LCL240_345_c"><sup>c</sup></a> If there is anything which you have hunted out, discovered, dug out of the darkness, although it is unfair, yet make away with it all the same, as happens to be convenient, since <span class="italic">you</span> brought it forward; but are <span class="italic">you</span> then to sell the Scantian forest<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL240_345_d" id="target_note_LCL240_345_d"><sup>d</sup></a> as long as we are consuls and this senate exists? are <span class="italic">you</span> then to lay hands on any of the imposts? are <span class="italic">you</span> then to rob the Roman people of their support in war, of their ornaments during peace? Then indeed I shall judge myself to be a less energetic consul than those bravest of men in the times of our ancestors, because it will be thought that the revenues, which were obtained for the Roman people during their consulships, cannot even be retained when I am consul.</p>

<p>II. He is selling all the public property in Italy<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span> item by item. No doubt he is busy about that, for he does not let a single item pass. He searches through the whole of Sicily<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL240_345_e" id="target_note_LCL240_345_e"><sup>e</sup></a> in the censors’ registers; he leaves no building, no lands unnoticed.
