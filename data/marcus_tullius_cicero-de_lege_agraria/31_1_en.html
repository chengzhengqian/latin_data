<p>XII. But notice how carefully he maintains the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">30</span><span class="br"></span> prerogatives of the tribunate. The consuls, when proposing a <span class="italic">lex curiata</span>, have often been obstructed by the veto of the tribunes. We do not complain of the tribunes having the power to do this; only, if anyone abuses the power, we have our opinion. But this tribune of the people in regard to a <span class="italic">lex curiata</span>, which a praetor is proposing, takes away the power of intercession. And while he must be blamed because the tribunician power is lessened by a tribune of the people, one cannot help laughing at him because, while a consul is not allowed to have anything to do with military matters unless he is authorized to do so by a

After the regal period its functions became purely formal, limited to confirming the appointment of magistrates (already chosen by the <span class="italic">centuriata</span>) in their authority and examining the auspices. This was called the <span class="italic">lex curiata de imperio</span>.<span class="linebreak"></span>
Cicero wants to show that the method of selecting the decemvirs is a farce. According to the old laws, officials had to submit twice—to the verdict of the <span class="italic">centuriata</span> or <span class="italic">tributa</span> and the <span class="italic">curiata</span> (except the censors, who were elected by one <span class="italic">comitia</span> only—the <span class="italic">centuriata</span>). But the <span class="italic">tributa,</span> by Rullus’s law, has already been reduced to a farce by the method of election, not by the <span class="italic">tributa</span> as a whole, but only by a majority of seventeen tribes, and “you do not enter the <span class="italic">curiata,</span> and further, even if the law is not passed, if there is any intercession as to the <span class="italic">curiata,</span> the appointment is still to hold good.”<span class="linebreak"></span>
Cicero’s whole object is to bring the law into ridicule. The people were jockeyed as to the <span class="italic">tributa</span> and the <span class="italic">curiata,</span> with the semi-comic nature of which they were familiar. Purposely, he says nothing here to prove the exact accuracy of his statements.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL240_403_aa').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
