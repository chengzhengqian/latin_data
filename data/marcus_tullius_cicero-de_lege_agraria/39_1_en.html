<p>Next, consider this in the light of your thoughts<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">45</span><span class="br"></span> and feelings. Foreign nations can hardly endure our ambassadors, men invested with little authority, who visit the provinces with “free embassies”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL240_419_b" id="target_note_LCL240_419_b"><sup>b</sup></a> for the sake of their own private affairs. For the mere name of <span class="italic">imperium</span> is hateful and greatly feared, however insignificant the possessor of it may be, because, when they have left the city, it is not their own name, but yours, that they abuse. How then will it be, do you think, when these decemvirs roam about the world with <span class="italic">imperium,</span> with the rods of office, with that picked band of young surveyors? What do you think will be the feelings, the apprehension, the danger threatening the unhappy nations?

What a calamity for the people, if he says so!
