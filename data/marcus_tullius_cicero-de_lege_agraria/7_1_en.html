foreigners are expelled from Rome, while Glaucippus is excepted. For this exception is not a case of one man being kindly treated, but of one man being freed from an injustice. But the law attacks the revenues of the same man whose spoils it leaves alone. For it orders the decemvirs to have the use of any money received from fresh revenues after our consulship. As if we do not understand that it is the fresh revenues acquired by Gnaeus Pompeius that they are thinking of selling!</p>

<p>V. You see now, conscript fathers, that the money<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">14</span><span class="br"></span> of the decemvirs is heaped and piled up by the aid of all kinds of imposts and ways of collecting money. “The unpopularity of this wealth will be lessened by its being spent in purchasing lands.” Excellent! Who then is going to buy those lands? The same decemvirs; you, Rullus (I say nothing about the rest), will buy what you like and you will sell what you like; both of them you will do at any price you like. For that excellent man takes care not to buy from one who is unwilling to sell. As if we do not understand that it is unprofitable to a man to buy from him if he does not want to sell, but it is profitable to buy from one who wants to sell. To say nothing about the others, how much land will your father-in-law sell you? who, if I rightly understand his impartial temper,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL240_355_a" id="target_note_LCL240_355_a"><sup>a</sup></a> will not be unwilling to sell. The rest will gladly do the same, to change for money the unpopularity arising from their possession of land, to receive what they passionately desire, to give away what they find difficult to retain.</p>
<p>Now observe the unlimited and intolerable license<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">15</span><span class="br"></span> of all these provisions. Money has been got together for buying lands; moreover, they will not be bought
