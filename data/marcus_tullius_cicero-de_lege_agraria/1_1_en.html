For the decemvirs will say, what is said by many and has often been said, that, after the consulship of the same men,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL240_343_a" id="target_note_LCL240_343_a"><sup>a</sup></a> that kingdom<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL240_343_ba" id="target_note_LCL240_343_ba"><sup>b</sup></a> became the Roman people’s by the will of King Alexander. Will you therefore give Alexandria to them when they ask for it secretly, although when they fought against you quite openly you resisted them? By the immortal gods! do such ideas appear to you to be sober men’s plans or the dreams of men drunk with wine? do they look like the deliberate opinions of wise men or the raving wishes of madmen?

(<span class="italic">d.</span> 81), is referred to. Mommsen favours the second alternative, chiefly because Alexander II. was the last genuine Lagid, “since it was always by the last scion of the legitimate ruling family that Rome was appointed heir, as in the similar cases of Pergamum,
