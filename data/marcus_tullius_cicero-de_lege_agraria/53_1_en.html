<p>XXVII. But do you,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">71</span><span class="br"></span> Romans, if you will be guided by me, keep possession of the influence you enjoy, of your liberty, of your votes, of your dignity, of your city, of your forum, of your games, of your festivals, and all your other enjoyments; unless perhaps you prefer to abandon these privileges and this brilliant republic, and to settle in the dry sands of Sipontum or in the pestilential swamps of Salapia<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL240_447_a" id="target_note_LCL240_447_a"><sup>a</sup></a> with Rullus for your leader. Or let him tell us what lands he intends to purchase; let him declare what he is going to give, and to whom. But after he has sold all your cities, lands, revenues, and kingdoms, tell me, I ask you, will you allow him to buy some tract of sand or marshes? Besides, it is an extraordinary thing that by this law everything is to be sold, the money is to be got together first and heaped up before a single clod of earth is bought. Then the law orders land to be bought, but without anyone being forced to sell. I ask, if there are none who want to sell,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">72</span><span class="br"></span> what is to be done with the money? The law forbids its being paid in to the treasury; it prohibits its being demanded from the decemvirs. So then the decemvirs will hold all the money, and no land will be bought for you; your revenues will be transferred, your allies annoyed, kings and all nations exhausted; they will have your money, you will have no lands. “It will be easy,” says Rullus, “to induce them to sell by offering a large price.” So then we see what the law means: we are to sell our property for as much as we can, and to buy other people’s property at whatever price they choose to ask for it.</p>
