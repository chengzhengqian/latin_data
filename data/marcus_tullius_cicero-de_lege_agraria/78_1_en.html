estates, which he has bought one after the other in the district of Casinum, by the proscription of his neighbours as far as the eye could reach, until all these farms completed the appearance of a single large district and estate—these lands, which he now holds with a certain amount of apprehension, he will be able to possess without any anxiety.”</p>
<p>Now, since I have shown you for what reason and<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">15</span><span class="br"></span> for whose sake Rullus has brought forward this law, it is for him to make you understand what occupier I am defending when I oppose this law. You are selling the Scantian wood; it is in the possession of the Roman people. I am for the defence. You are dividing Campanian territory; you are in possession of it. I refuse to give it up. Next, I see that possessions in Italy, Sicily, and the other provinces are for sale and proscribed by this law: they are your estates, your possessions; I shall resist and oppose this, and, as long as I am consul, I will not allow the Roman people to be turned out of its possessions by anyone, especially since no advantage is sought for you. For<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">16</span><span class="br"></span> you ought not to remain any longer in error. Is there any one of you inclined to violence, crime, or even murder? No one. And yet, believe me, it is for men of that kind that Campanian territory and the beautiful Capua are reserved; an army is being raised against you, against your liberty, against Gnaeus Pompeius; it is against the city of Rome that Capua is to be opposed, against you that bands of audacious scoundrels are being organized; against Gnaeus Pompeius that ten generals are being appointed. Let them come and, since they have summoned me before your assembly at your request, let them argue the question and answer me face to face!</p>
