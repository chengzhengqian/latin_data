nefarious citizens are being formed; there is no danger from without, no king, no people, no nation, is to be feared; the evil is confined within our gates, it is internal and domestic. It is the duty of each of us to remedy it to the best of our power and we ought all to endeavour to heal it. You are mistaken, if you<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">27</span><span class="br"></span> think that the senate alone approves of my words, but that the people is differently inclined. All who wish to be safe will follow the authority of a consul free from all ambitious desires, and not burdened with evil deeds, prudent in the midst of dangers, bold in strife. But if any one of you is inspired by the hope of being able to set his sails for office by methods of disorder, in the first place let him abandon the hope of that as long as I am consul; and, secondly, let him take myself, whom he sees now consul, born in equestrian ranks, as an example of what way of life most surely leads good citizens to honour and dignity. But if, conscript fathers, you promise me your zeal in upholding the common dignity, I will certainly fulfil the most ardent wish of the republic, that the authority of this order, which existed in the time of our ancestors, may now, after a long interval, be seen to be restored to the State.</p>
