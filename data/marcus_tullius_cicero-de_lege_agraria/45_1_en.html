<p>Next follows: “all the lands<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL240_431_a" id="target_note_LCL240_431_a"><sup>a</sup></a> outside Italy”; no limit of time being stated as before, “dating from the consulship of Sulla and Pompeius.” It will be for the decemvirs to decide after inquiry whether the land is private or public; and upon such land a heavy tax is imposed. Who can help seeing what extensive,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">57</span><span class="br"></span> intolerable, and despotic judicial power this is—to be able, wherever they choose, without any discussion, without any legal assistance, to make what is private property public and to exempt from taxes what is public property? In this article the Recentoric district in Sicily is excepted; and the exception gives me great pleasure both on account of my close friendship with the inhabitants<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL240_431_b" id="target_note_LCL240_431_b"><sup>b</sup></a> and because it is just. But what impudence it is! Those who occupy the Recentoric district defend themselves on the plea of long-standing occupation, not of right, relying on the sympathy of the senate, not on the nature of the land. For they confess that it is public land, but say that it would not be fair that they should be dispossessed and driven from their ancestral homes and household gods. And if the Recentoric district is private land, why do you except it? but if it is public, what kind of equity is it to allow other lands, even if private, to be adjudged public, and to except particularly by name one which is acknowledged to be public property?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL240_431_c" id="target_note_LCL240_431_c"><sup>c</sup></a> Is then the land of those men to be excepted who have had influence with Rullus for some reason,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL240_431_d" id="target_note_LCL240_431_d"><sup>d</sup></a> while all the others, wherever they may be, without distinction, without any investigation by the Roman people, without the verdict of the senate, are to be handed over to the decemvirs?</p>
