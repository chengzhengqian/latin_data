ease. For it is out of disturbance and civil dissensions that such men usually acquire honours, power, and wealth. You, whose influence is based on your votes, your liberty on the laws, your rights on the justice of the courts and the equity of the magistrates, and your property on peace, you ought to preserve your ease by all possible means.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL240_481_a" id="target_note_LCL240_481_a"><sup>a</sup></a> For if those who owing to<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">103</span><span class="br"></span> inactivity live in quiet still take pleasure in their disgraceful indolence from that quiet itself, how fortunate will you be, if in this condition which you enjoy you hold fast to this quiet, not sought for by sloth but obtained by your own valiant exertions. Owing to the unanimity which I have established between myself and my colleague,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL240_481_b" id="target_note_LCL240_481_b"><sup>b</sup></a> to the great dislike of those men who said that we were and would be enemies to them<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL240_481_c" id="target_note_LCL240_481_c"><sup>c</sup></a> during our consulship, I have wisely made provision for and taken precaution against all emergencies, and tried to bring those men back to their allegiance. I have also given the tribunes notice not to stir up sedition during my consulship. But the greatest and strongest support of our common fortunes, O Romans, will be that you should show yourselves in all future times of the republic such as you have shown yourselves to me to-day in this great assembly for your own safety. I undertake, I promise you in all sincerity that I will secure that finally those who were jealous of the honour conferred upon me will yet confess that all of you showed the greatest wisdom in your choice of a consul.</p>
