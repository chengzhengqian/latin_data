made for the appointment of triumvirs, quinquevirs, and decemvirs as curators; I ask this tribune, the friend of the people, if they have ever been elected except by the thirty-five tribes. For, as it is fitting that all powers, commands, and commissions<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL240_389_a" id="target_note_LCL240_389_a"><sup>a</sup></a> should proceed from the whole Roman people, this is especially the case in regard to those which are established for any advantage and interest of this people. For it is then that the whole body of citizens have to elect the man who they think will do his best to assist the people, while each individual by his zeal and vote is able to pave the way for acquiring some benefit for himself. It was left to a tribune before anyone else to think how to deprive the entire Roman people of their votes, and to invite only a few tribes, not according to established legal rules but by accidental favour of the lot, to exercise their liberty.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL240_389_b" id="target_note_LCL240_389_b"><sup>b</sup></a> “Also and in the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">18</span><span class="br"></span> same manner,” it says in the second article, “as at the election of the pontifex maximus.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL240_389_c" id="target_note_LCL240_389_c"><sup>c</sup></a> He did not even see that our ancestors had such regard for the people that, because on religious grounds it was considered unlawful for it to confer such an office, they nevertheless decided in his case, considering the importance of the priesthood, that candidates should humbly beg the people to grant them the office. And Gnaeus Domitius,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL240_389_da" id="target_note_LCL240_389_da"><sup>d</sup></a> tribune of the people, a man of distinguished family, passed a similar law with regard to the other priesthoods, which provided that, because the people, on religious grounds, could not confer the priesthoods, the smaller half of them should be invited to attend, and that the candidate chosen by that half should be co-opted by the college.
