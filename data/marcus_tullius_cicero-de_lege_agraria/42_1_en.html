illustrious Publius Servilius.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL240_425_a" id="target_note_LCL240_425_a"><sup>a</sup></a> He adds the royal domains of Bithynia, of which the farmers of the revenue now have the enjoyment; next the lands of Attalus in the Chersonese<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL240_425_b" id="target_note_LCL240_425_b"><sup>b</sup></a>; those in Macedonia, which belonged to Philip or Perses, and were also farmed out by the censors, and are a sure source of revenue. He also includes in the sale the rich and<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">51</span><span class="br"></span> fertile lands of Corinth and Cyrene, which belonged to Apion<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL240_425_c" id="target_note_LCL240_425_c"><sup>c</sup></a>; and sells the territories which you possess in Spain near New Carthage and in Africa old Carthage itself, which Publius Africanus I suppose consecrated,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL240_425_d" id="target_note_LCL240_425_d"><sup>d</sup></a> by the advice of his counsellors,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL240_425_e" id="target_note_LCL240_425_e"><sup>e</sup></a> not out of any religious respect for its dwellings and their antiquity, nor that the place itself might show traces of the disaster that overtook those who contended with Rome for the empire of the world. But Scipio was not so good a business man as Rullus is, or perhaps he was unable to find a purchaser for that place. However, to all these lands, taken in our ancient wars by the valour of our greatest commanders, he adds the royal lands of Mithridates in Paphlagonia, Pontus, and Cappadocia, in order that the decemvirs may sell them. Is it not so? Without terms having been<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">52</span><span class="br"></span> arranged, without the general’s report having been heard, before the war is finished, while King Mithridates, without an army, driven from his kingdom, is nevertheless contemplating some new enterprise against us at the end of the world,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL240_425_f" id="target_note_LCL240_425_f"><sup>f</sup></a> and is defended
