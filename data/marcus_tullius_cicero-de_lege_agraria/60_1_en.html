Campanian territory will be entirely handed over to these robust, sturdy, and audacious henchmen of the decemvirs; and, as you now say of your ancestors, “Our ancestors left us this land,” so your descendants will say of you, “Our fathers inherited this land from their fathers and they have lost it.” I indeed think<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">85</span><span class="br"></span> that, supposing for the moment the Campus Martius were divided and two feet of standing room were assigned to each of you, still you would prefer to have the enjoyment of the whole in common than to have a small part of it as your own. Wherefore, even if some of this territory, which is promised to you but is really intended for others, should come to each of you, yet it would be more honourable for you to possess the whole in common than for each of you to have a portion. But as it is, since nothing comes to you but all is meant for others and is robbed from you, will you not most energetically resist this law, as if it were an armed enemy, in defence of your lands?</p>
<p>Rullus adds the plain of Stella to the Campanian territory and assigns twelve acres apiece in it to each colonist, as if indeed there were so little difference between the two! But the truth is, Romans, that a<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">86</span><span class="br"></span> very large number of men is needed to fill all these towns. For, as I have said before, the law allows the decemvirs to occupy with their own colonists such municipalities as they please, such old colonies as they please. They will fill the municipality of Cales, they will overwhelm Teanum, they will extend a chain of garrisons through Atella,Cumae, Neapolis, Pompeii, and Nuceria, but Puteoli, which is now independent and enjoys its liberty and has its own jurisdiction, will be occupied entirely by a new people and foreign forces.</p>
