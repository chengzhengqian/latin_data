Even if part of this territory could be<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">80</span><span class="br"></span> allotted to you, would you not prefer that it should remain a part of your patrimony? Will you allow the one most beautiful estate belonging to the Roman people, the source of your wealth, the ornament of peace, the support in war, the basis of your revenues, the granary of the legions, your relief of the corn supply—will you allow it to perish? When all your other revenues failed you in the Italian war,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL240_455_b" id="target_note_LCL240_455_b"><sup>b</sup></a> have you forgotten how many armies you supported by the income from Campanian territory? or do you not know that the other splendid revenues of the Roman people often depend upon a slight change of fortune or alteration of circumstances<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL240_455_c" id="target_note_LCL240_455_c"><sup>c</sup></a>?

But the revenues derived<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">81</span><span class="br"></span> from Campanian territory have this advantage that they are safe at home and are protected by all our garrisons; hence they are neither disturbed by wars, their produce does not vary, and is not liable to damage from weather or situation. Our ancestors not only refrained from diminishing what they had taken from the Campanians, but even bought up lands
