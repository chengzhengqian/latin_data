recalling all the kindness I have received from you, when it comes to considering why I have been judged worthy of the highest honour you can bestow and such remarkable evidence of your esteem, I may myself state the reason, should it be necessary, in moderate terms, thinking that you who so judged me worthy will still hold the same opinion.</p>
<p>I am the first “new” man,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL240_373_a" id="target_note_LCL240_373_a"><sup>a</sup></a> after a very long<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> interval, almost more remote than our times can remember,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL240_373_b" id="target_note_LCL240_373_b"><sup>b</sup></a> whom you have made consul; that position, which the nobility held secured by guards and fortified in every way, you have broken open, and have shown your desire that it should in future be open to merit, allowing me to take the lead. And you not only elected me consul, which in itself is a very high honour, but you did so in a way in which few nobles in this city have been made consuls, and no “new” man before me.</p>

<p>II. For certainly, if you will be good enough to consult your memory in regard to “new” men, you will find that those who were elected without rejection only obtained office after long labours and seizing a favourable opportunity, having become candidates many years after they had been praetors and somewhat later than their age and the laws allowed them<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL240_373_c" id="target_note_LCL240_373_c"><sup>c</sup></a>; but that those who became candidates in their own year<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL240_373_d" id="target_note_LCL240_373_d"><sup>d</sup></a> were not elected without rejection first; that I am the only one of all the “new” men that we can remember who became a candidate for the consulship when the law allowed and obtained it the first time I applied, so that this honour which I have received from you, which I stood for as soon as I was allowed to do so, appears not to have been seized when opportunity offered in the person of another
