For when the same men shall have all wealth, a vast population under their control, when the same men shall by their resources hold all Italy under siege, when they shall also have your liberty hemmed in by their garrisons and colonies, what hope, I ask you, what means of recovering your liberty will be left to you?</p>
<p>But, we shall be told, the land of Campania, the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">76</span><span class="br"></span> most beautiful in the world,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL240_451_a" id="target_note_LCL240_451_a"><sup>a</sup></a> will be divided by this law, and a colony conducted to Capua, a very large and magnificent city.
