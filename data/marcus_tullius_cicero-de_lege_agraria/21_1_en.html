when I was consul-elect, that the tribunes-elect were drawing up an agrarian law, I felt a desire to learn their intentions; for I thought that, since we should have to fulfil magisterial functions in the same year, there ought to be some bond of union between us, for carrying on the affairs of the State wisely. But<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">12</span><span class="br"></span> when I attempted to get on such terms with them that we could converse without reserve, I was kept in the dark, I was shut out; and when I gave them to understand that, if the law seemed to me likely to be useful to the Roman plebeians, I would support and help to pass it, they scorned my generous offer, and declared that I could never be brought to approve of any kind of largesse. I accordingly withdrew my offers of assistance, for fear that persistency might perhaps appear treacherous or insolent. In the meantime they continued to assemble privately, to invite certain private individuals to join them, to summon darkness and solitude to their aid in their secret meetings. You can easily imagine my great apprehension from your own anxiety during those times. At last the tribunes enter upon office; the speech of<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">13</span><span class="br"></span> Rullus in particular is expected, because he was both the chief promoter of the agrarian law and was more truculent than any of his colleagues. As soon as he was elected, he practised putting on a different expression, a different tone of voice, and a different gait; his clothes were in rags, his person was terribly neglected, more hair about him now and more beard,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL240_383_a" id="target_note_LCL240_383_a"><sup>a</sup></a> so that eyes and aspect seemed to protest to the world the tribunician power and to threaten the republic. I waited for the manâ€™s expected law and speech. At first no law is proposed. He orders an assembly to be summoned for the 12th of December.
