is sought by this law. He himself neither entrusts it to the whole people, nor do those who were the instigators of these plans think that it can be rightly entrusted to it. Lots will be drawn for the tribes—by<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">21</span><span class="br"></span> the same Rullus. Lucky man! he will only draw those he wishes. The decemvirs chosen by the nine tribes drawn by the same Rullus will become, as I shall presently show, our absolute masters. And, to show themselves grateful and not forgetful of a favour, they will allow that they do owe something to the notorious<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL240_393_a" id="target_note_LCL240_393_a"><sup>a</sup></a> men of these nine tribes, but as for the remaining twenty-six there will be nothing that they do not hold themselves justified in refusing them. Whom then, I ask, does he wish to be elected decemvirs? Himself first. But how is that lawful? For old laws are in existence—not consular laws, if you think this of any importance—but laws made by tribunes, which were very acceptable and agreeable to you and your ancestors. These are the Licinian and the second Aebutian<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL240_393_b" id="target_note_LCL240_393_b"><sup>b</sup></a> laws, which not only prohibit anyone who has proposed a law concerning any commission or power from being appointed to any such commission or power, but even excludes his colleagues, kinsfolk, and relatives by marriage. Indeed, if you have the interest of the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">22</span><span class="br"></span> people at heart, avoid all suspicion of personal gain; show that <span class="italic">you</span> seek nothing but the general usefulness and advantage, leave authority to others, let <span class="italic">your</span> reward be gratitude for your favour. For anything else is hardly worthy of a free people, of your spirit and high-mindedness.</p>
