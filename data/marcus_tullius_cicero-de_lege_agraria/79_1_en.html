<p>1. <span class="italic">Imberba iuventute;</span> (Charisius, <span class="italic">Ars Grammatica,</span> (ed. C. Barwick, 1925) i. 95) “in beardless youth.” (<span class="italic">The reference is perhaps to the description of Rullus in ii.</span> 5. 13.)</p>
<p>2,3. <span class="italic">This figure—a disjunctive proposition or statement—embellishes and amplifies discourse in the following manner:</span> They will occupy Capua, having conducted colonists thither, they will secure Atella with a garrison, they will obtain possession of Nuceria, Cumae with a large number of their people; they will bind together the rest of the towns with garrisons. <span class="italic">Another instance is:</span> The whole of the Propontis and the Hellespont will therefore be sold under the public crier; the whole coast of the Lycians and Cilicians will be knocked down, Mysia and Phrygia will be put under the same conditions and laws. (<span class="italic">The reference is perhaps to ii.</span> 15, 38–46.)</p>
<p>4. The decemvirs will sell the booty, the spoils, the division of the plunder (confiscated goods) and lastly the camp itself of Gnaeus Pompeius, while the general has to sit still. (<span class="italic">The reference is perhaps to the digressions about Pompey.</span>)</p>
