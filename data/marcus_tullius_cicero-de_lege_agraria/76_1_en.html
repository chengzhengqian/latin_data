<p>III. I see that you, my<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">10</span><span class="br"></span> friends, as the nature of the case compels you, are stirred to indignation by the impudence of the law or of Rullus’s speech: of the law, since it establishes a better title to estates assigned by Sulla than to hereditary property, of the speech since, in a cause of that kind, he dares to accuse anyone of defending the principles of Sulla with too great vehemence. But, if he were content only to ratify the Sullan allotments, I would say nothing, provided he confessed that he was one of his partisans. But he not only gives security to them but even increases their possessions by some kind of donation; and the man who charges me with defending the donations of Sulla not only ratifies them, but appoints fresh allotments himself, and suddenly here is Sulla risen from the dead! For consider what vast grants of land<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">11</span><span class="br"></span> this accuser of ours endeavours to make by a single word: <span class="sc">the lands which have been given, donated, granted, or sold.</span> Very well, I hear. What next? <span class="sc">Possessed.</span> So this is what a tribune of the people has ventured to propose to enact—that anyone who has been in possession of a property since the consulship of Marius and Carbo should hold it by the best title that anyone can hold private property! What! even if he has turned out the owner by violence, has obtained possession of it stealthily, or on sufferance? So then this law will annul civil law, the titles to possessions, the provisional decisions of the praetors. This is not an unimportant matter, my friends, nor is<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">12</span><span class="br"></span> it a petty larceny that is hidden under this expression.
