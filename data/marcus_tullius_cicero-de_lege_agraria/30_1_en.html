<span class="italic">tributa,</span> the <span class="italic">comitia curiata</span> has been retained only for the sake of examining the auspices. But this tribune of the people, seeing that no one can exercise authority except at the bidding of the people or the plebs, has confirmed that authority by the <span class="italic">comitia curiata,</span> which you do not enter, and suppressed the <span class="italic">comitia tributa,</span> which was yours. Thus, while your ancestors desired that you should give a decision at two <span class="italic">comitia</span> in the election of each magistrate, this friend of the people has not left the authority of even one <span class="italic">comitia</span> to the people.
