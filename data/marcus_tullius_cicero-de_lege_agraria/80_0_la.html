<span class="label"><span class="italic">Popularis</span> (II. iii. § 7)</span>
<p>To this word Cicero attaches great importance. As a rule the <span class="italic">populares</span> are contrasted with the <span class="italic">optimates</span> (elsewhere with <span class="italic">nobiles</span>), meaning those who strove to promote the interests of the many as opposed to those of the few (see <span class="italic">Pro Sestio,</span> xlv. § 96) (not “popular” in the usual English sense). The <span class="italic">optimates</span> included the nobles and the rich middle class of the <span class="italic">equites,</span> in fact all who were opposed to change that might affect their interests. They were called the “best people” in the State, the conservative and aristocratic party as opposed to the popular or democratic party.</p>
<p>The term <span class="italic">popularis</span> is vague, and is used of anyone who favours the <span class="italic">populus</span> of whatever rank he may be; and it often happened that a noble took the side of the people from disinterested motives or to promote his own interests. Here Cicero defines the word to suit his own views; while in the senate he took the side of the nobles, on the platform he posed as a democrat. It is often used in the sense of turbulent, a turbulent fellow, according to the view taken of a popular orator or demagogue.</p>
