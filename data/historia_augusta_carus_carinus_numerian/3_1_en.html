waxed great, but afflicted by strife with allies it lost all sense of happiness, and crushed by civil wars it wasted away in weakness until the time of Augustus. He then restored it once more, if indeed we may say that it was restored when it gave up its freedom. Nevertheless, in some way or other, though mourning at home, it enjoyed great fame among nations abroad. Next, after enduring so many of the house of Nero,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_421_1" id="target_note_LCL263_421_1"><sup>1</sup></a> it reared its head again under Vespasian, and though having no joy from all the good fortune of Titus and bleeding from Domitian’s brutality, it was happier than had been its wont under Nerva and Trajan and his successors as far as Marcus, but was sorely stricken by the madness and cruelty of Commodus.

To what end, however, do we dwell on such lamentations and the misfortunes of the times? Let us, rather, pass on to Cams,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_421_3" id="target_note_LCL263_421_3"><sup>3</sup></a> a mediocre man, so to speak, but one to be ranked with the good rather than the evil princes, yet a better ruler by far, had he not left Carinus to be his heir.</p>
