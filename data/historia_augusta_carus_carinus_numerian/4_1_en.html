that by reason of the very great difference among them I am unable to tell what it really was. For Onesimus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_423_1" id="target_note_LCL263_423_1"><sup>1</sup></a> who wrote with great diligence a Life of Probus, maintains that, whereas Carus’ parents were Illyrians, he himself was both born and educated at Rome. Fabius Ceryllianus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_423_2" id="target_note_LCL263_423_2"><sup>2</sup></a> however, who has described with the greatest skill the period of Carus, Carinus and Numerian, declares that he was born, not in Rome, but in Illyricum,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_423_3" id="target_note_LCL263_423_3"><sup>3</sup></a> and that his parents were not Pannonians but Carthaginians. I myself remember having read in a certain journal<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_423_4" id="target_note_LCL263_423_4"><sup>4</sup></a> that Carus was born at Milan but enrolled in the official list of the council of the city of Aquileia. Carus himself, it cannot be denied, wished to appear a Roman, for this is shown by a letter of his, which he wrote when proconsul to his legate, urging him to a faithful performance of duty.</p>
<p>The letter of Carus:</p>
<p>“From Marcus Aurelius Carus proconsul of Cilicia<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_423_5" id="target_note_LCL263_423_5"><sup>5</sup></a> to Junius his legate. Our forefathers, those great men of Rome, in choosing their legates observed the following principle, namely, to display a sample of their own characters in those to whom they delegated the conduct of public affairs. And even if this were not so, I myself should not do otherwise; and, indeed, I have not done otherwise, if by your aid I shall make no mistake. Wherefore look to it that we may not be found to differ from our forefathers, that is, the men of Rome.”</p>
<p>You see that throughout this letter he wishes it to be understood that his forefathers were native Romans.</p>
