For suddenly, after an especially violent peal which had terrified all, it was shouted out that the emperor was dead. It came to pass, in addition, that the chamberlains, grieving for the death of their prince, fired his tent; and the rumour arose, whatever its source, that he had been killed by the lightning, whereas, as far as we can tell, it seems sure that he died of his illness.”</p>

<p>IX. This letter I have inserted for the reason that many declare that there is a certain decree of Fate that no Roman emperor may advance beyond Ctesiphon,
and that Carus was struck by the lightning because he desired to pass beyond the bounds which Fate has set up.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_431_1" id="target_note_LCL263_431_1"><sup>1</sup></a> But let cowardice, on which courage should set its heel, keep its devices for itself. For clearly it is granted to us and will always be granted, as our most venerated Caesar Maximian has shown,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_431_2" id="target_note_LCL263_431_2"><sup>2</sup></a> to conquer the Persians and advance beyond them, and methinks this will surely come to pass if only our men fail not to live up to the promised favour of Heaven.</p>
<p>That Carus was a good emperor is evident from many of his deeds but especially from this, that as soon as he received the imperial power he crushed the Sarmatians, who were so emboldened by Probus’ death that they threatened to invade not only Illyricum
but Thrace and Italy as well, and he showed such skill in breaking up the war that in a very few days he made the provinces of Pannonia free from all fear, having killed sixteen thousand Sarmatians and captured twenty thousand of both sexes.</p>
