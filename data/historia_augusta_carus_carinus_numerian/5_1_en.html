when he was first made emperor, he wrote to the senatorial order among other things the following: “And so, Conscript Fathers, you should rejoice that one of your own order and your own race has been created emperor. Wherefore we will do our best that no foreigner shall seem to be a better man than one of yourselves.” This passage also makes it sufficiently clear that he wished to be thought a Roman, that is, one born in Rome.</p>
<p>He, then, after rising through the various civil and military grades, as the inscriptions<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_425_1" id="target_note_LCL263_425_1"><sup>1</sup></a> on his statues show, was made prefect of the guard by Probus, and he won such affection among the soldiers that when Probus, that great emperor, was slain, he alone seemed wholly worthy of the imperial power.</p>

<p>VI. I am not unaware that many have suspected and, in fact, have put it into the records that Probus was slain by the treachery of Carus.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_425_2" id="target_note_LCL263_425_2"><sup>2</sup></a> This, however, neither the kindness of Probus toward Carus nor Carus’ own character will permit us to believe, and there is the further reason that he avenged the death of Probus with the utmost severity and steadfastness. Probus’ opinion of him, moreover, is shown by a letter written to the senate with regard to the honours conferred on him:</p>
<p>“From Probus Augustus to his most devoted senate, greeting.” Among other recommendations: “Happy, indeed, were our commonwealth if I had more men engaged in the public business similar to Carus or, in fact, to most of yourselves. Wherefore I recommend, if it be your pleasure, that an equestrian statue be voted to this man of old-time character, adding the further request that a house be erected for him at the public expense, the marble to be furnished by me.
