<p>VII. And so—not to include what is of little importance or what can be found in other writers—as soon as he received the imperial power, by the unanimous wish of all the soldiers he took up the war against the Persians for which Probus had been preparing.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_427_1" id="target_note_LCL263_427_1"><sup>1</sup></a> He gave to his sons the name of Caesar,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_427_2" id="target_note_LCL263_427_2"><sup>2</sup></a> planning to despatch Carinus, with some carefully-selected
men, to govern the provinces of Gaul, and to take along with himself Numerian, a most excellent and eloquent young man. It is said, moreover, that he often declared that he was grieved that he had to send Carinus to Gaul as prince, and that Numerian was not of an age to be entrusted with the Gallic empire, which most of all needed a steadfast ruler. But of this at another time; for there is still in existence a letter of Carus’, in which he complains to his prefect about the character of Carinus, so that it seems to be true, as Onesimus says, that Carus intended to take from Carinus the power of a Caesar. But of this, as I have already said, I must tell later on in the Life of Carinus himself.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_427_3" id="target_note_LCL263_427_3"><sup>3</sup></a> Now we will return to the order of events.</p>

It would appear that Carus fought this war on the Danube and then set out for the East without going to Rome. We are told by Zonaras (xii. 30) that he defeated the Persians and then returned to Rome, whence he set out against the Sarmatians but was killed during a campaign against the Huns, or, as some say, on the river Tigris, as the result of a stroke of lightning; but this can hardly be correct, as his reign of one year was not long enough to permit of so much activity.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL263_427_4a').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
