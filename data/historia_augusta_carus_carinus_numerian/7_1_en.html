been engaged, and without opposition he conquered Mesopotamia and advanced as far as Ctesiphon<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_429_1" id="target_note_LCL263_429_1"><sup>1</sup></a>; and while the Persians were busied with internal strife he won the name of Conqueror of Persia.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_429_2" id="target_note_LCL263_429_2"><sup>2</sup></a> But when he advanced still further, desirous himself of glory and urged on most of all by his prefect,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_429_3" id="target_note_LCL263_429_3"><sup>3</sup></a> who in his wish to rule was seeking the destruction of both Carus and his sons as well, he met his death, according to some, by disease, according to others, through a stroke of lightning.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_429_4" id="target_note_LCL263_429_4"><sup>4</sup></a> Indeed, it cannot be denied that at the time of his death there suddenly occurred such violent thunder that many, it is said, died of sheer fright. And so, while he was ill and lying in his tent, there came up a mighty storm with terrible lightning and, as I have said, still more terrible thunder, and during this he expired. Julius Calpurnius, who used to dictate for the imperial memoranda,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_429_5" id="target_note_LCL263_429_5"><sup>5</sup></a> wrote the following letter about Carus’ death to the prefect of the city, saying among other things:</p>
<p>“When Carus, our prince for whom we truly care, was lying ill, there suddenly arose a storm of such violence that all things grew black and none could recognize another; then continuous flashes of lightning and peals of thunder, like bolts from a fiery sky, took from us all the power of knowing what truly befell.
