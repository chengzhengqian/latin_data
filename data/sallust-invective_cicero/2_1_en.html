eloquence of yours with M. Piso<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_365_1" id="target_note_LCL462_365_1"><sup>1</sup></a> by sacrificing your
chastity? Far from surprising then that you sell it as outrageously
as you gained it shamefully!</p>
<p>But I imagine the distinction of your domestic scenario
makes you proud! A wife smeared with sacrilege and perjuries,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_365_2a" id="target_note_LCL462_365_2a"><sup>2</sup></a>
a daughter, her mother’s rival, more pleasing and
submissive to you than a daughter should be to a parent.
You acquired your house itself, a disaster for you and
yours, with violence and plunderings, presumably to impress
upon us how greatly things have changed, seeing
that you, disreputable as you are, live in the house that
belonged to the illustrious P. Crassus.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_365_3" id="target_note_LCL462_365_3"><sup>3</sup></a> And all this notwithstanding,
Cicero says that he was in the assembly of
the immortal gods and from there despatched to guard this
city and its citizens<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_365_4" id="target_note_LCL462_365_4"><sup>4</sup></a> * * * executioner apart from the name
(?), who credits the misfortune of the community to his
own glory; as though your Consulship were not the cause
of that conspiracy and for that reason the commonwealth
was torn apart at the time when it had you for its guardian.</p>
<p>But I imagine your political decisions subsequent to
your Consulship in consultation with your wife Terentia
make you prouder, when you two proceeded to set up trials

(Clark 15), Cicero in his youth was introduced by his father to
Piso, perhaps some seven years his senior, because of the latter’s
old-style way of life and literary attainments. In later life Cicero’s
opinion of him varied widely at different periods. The aspersion
here is a commonplace in this kind of writing, not to be taken seriously.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL462_365_1').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL462_365_2a"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL462_365_2a" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">2</sup>Terentia’s half-sister Fabia was a Vestal Virgin.
