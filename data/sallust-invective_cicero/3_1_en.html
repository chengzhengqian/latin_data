the conspirators to exile, others to fines. One of them
would build you your villa at Tusculum, another one at
Pompeii, another bought your house. But anyone who
could do nothing for you was Catiline’s closest associate; he
either had come to assault your house or had plotted
against the Senate, in fact you had ‘informed yourself’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_367_6" id="target_note_LCL462_367_6"><sup>6</sup></a>

enmity of noblemen, holds the commonwealth dear, lets
neither fear nor favour part him from the truth, loves (?)

Cicero’s mentor in youth, but they were not related. Moreover, he
