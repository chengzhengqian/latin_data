<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">L.</span> You are slow, Corydon, in coming back from Rome. For twenty nights past, of a truth, have our woods longed to see you, and the saddened bulls waited for your yodellings.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">C.</span> O you slow-coach, no more unbending than a tough axle, Lycotas, you prefer to see old beech-trees rather than the new sights exhibited by our youthful god<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL284_279_a" id="target_note_LCL284_279_a">

</a> in the spacious arena.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">L.</span> I wondered what could be reason enough for your delay, why your pipe was idle in the silent woods, and why Stimicon, decked in pale ivy, sang alone: to him, for want of you, we have sadly awarded a tender kid.

<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">C.</span> Let Stimicon be unconquered and win prizes to enrich him,—let him not only rejoice in the kid he has received, but let him carry off the whole of the folds which Thyrsis purifies, still he will not equal my joys, nor yet, if someone gave me all the herds of Lucanian forests, would they delight me more than what I have seen in Rome.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">L.</span> Tell me, come, tell me, Corydon. Be not so grudging as to disdain my ears. Truly, I shall find your words as sweet as your songs are wont to be whenever men to sacred rites invoke Pales the fertile or Apollo of the herds.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL284_279_c" id="target_note_LCL284_279_c">
