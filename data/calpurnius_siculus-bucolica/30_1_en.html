Let him listen or recite, since so he desires. ’Twill be joy enough for me to watch Lycidas quaking, when, blenched, he hears in your presence his evil deeds made public.</p></div>

want to compete in turn——But no, I’ll not be your
umpire: someone else may be the judge to settle this! Look, here come both Mycon and neighbour Iollas: they will be able to put a close to your strife.</p></div>
