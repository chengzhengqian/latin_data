<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">C.</span> Not yet doth the waning summer tame the sun’s horses, although the wine-presses are squeezing the juicy clusters and a hoarse whisper comes from the foaming must as it ferments. Look, Ornytus, do you see how comfortably the cattle our father trusted us to watch have lain down to rest in the shaggy broom? Why do not we also make for the neighbouring shade? Why only a cap to protect our sunburnt faces?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">O.</span> Rather let us seek this grove, brother Corydon,—the grottoes over there, the haunt of Father Faunus, where the pine forest thickly spreads its delicate foliage and rears its head to meet the sun’s fierce rays, where the beech shields the waters that bubble ’neath its very roots, and with its straying boughs casts a tangled shade.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">C.</span> Whithersoever you call me, Ornytus, I follow. For by refusing my embraces and denying me nightly pleasures, my Leuce has left it lawful for me to enter the shrine of horned Faunus. Produce your reed-pipes then and any song you keep stored for use. My pipe, you will find, will not fail you—the pipe that Ladon’s skill fashioned for me lately out of a ripely seasoned reed.</p></div>
