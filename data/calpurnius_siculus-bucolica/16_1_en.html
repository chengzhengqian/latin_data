in sooth, the distant sound of my prayers at earth’s furthest ends. But if perchance no sweeter melody attract your ear, if the songs of others fail to charm you more than mine, will you let the page I compose to-day be corrected by your critical file? For not only have the gods given to you to tell husbandmen of coming rain-storms and of the kind of sunrise a golden sunset offers, but you are often the singer of sweet poetry,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL284_249_a" id="target_note_LCL284_249_a">

</a> But if you would show favour to my nervous attempts, perhaps I might make trial of those reeds which skilful Iollas<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL284_249_c" id="target_note_LCL284_249_c">

</a> presented to me yesterday with the words, “This pipe wins over savage bulls, and makes sweetest melody to our own Faunus. It once was owned by Tityrus, who among these hills of yours was the first to sing his tuneful lay on the Hyblaean pipe.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL284_249_d" id="target_note_LCL284_249_d">

He was a bard inspired, one who could on the reed-pipe outplay the lyre. Often, while he sang, beasts of the wild fawned in frolic near, and the oak came close and halted there: did he but sing, a Naiad would adorn him with red acanthus and dress with a comb his tangled locks.</p></div>

<span class="italic">Iollas,</span> according to Wernsdorf, stands for a scholar or poet who had prompted the writing of the Eclogues. Some have suggested one of Calpurnius’ teachers, or even Theocritus—which conflicts with the idea that Tityrus is Virgil.
