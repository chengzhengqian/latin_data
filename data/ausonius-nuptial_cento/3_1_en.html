<p>heroic verse admits, so that either a penthemimeris (- ⏑ ⏑ - ⏑ ⏑ -) can be linked with an anapaestic continuation (⏑⏑-⏑⏑-⏑⏑ - -), or a trochaic fragment (- ⏑ ⏑ - ⏑ ⏑ - ⏑) with a complementary section (⏑-⏑⏑-⏑⏑—), or seven half-feet (-⏑⏑-⏑⏑-⏑⏑-) with a choric anapaest (—⏑ ⏑ -), or after a dactyl and a half-foot (-⏑ ⏑-) is placed whatever is needed to complete the hexameter: so that you may say it is like the puzzle which the Greeks have called <span class="italic">ostomachia.</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL096_375_1" id="target_note_LCL096_375_1"><sup>1</sup></a> There you have little pieces of bone, fourteen in number and representing geometrical figures. For some are equilateral triangles, some with sides of various lengths, some symmetrical, some with right angles, some with oblique: the same people call them isosceles or equal-sided triangles, and also right-angled and scalene. By fitting these pieces together in various ways, pictures of countless objects are produced: a monstrous elephant, a brutal boar, a goose in flight, and a gladiator in armour, a huntsman crouching down, and a dog barking—even a tower and a tankard and numberless other things of this sort, whose variety depends upon the skill of the player. But while the harmonious arrangement of the skilful is marvellous, the jumble made by the unskilled is grotesque. This prefaced, you will know that I am like the second kind of player.</p>
<p>And so this little work, the <span class="italic">Cento,</span> is handled in the same way as the game described, so as to harmonize different meanings, to make pieces arbitrarily connected seem naturally related, to let foreign elements show no chink of light between, to prevent the far-fetched from proclaiming the force which united them, the closely packed from bulging unduly, the loosely knit from gaping.
