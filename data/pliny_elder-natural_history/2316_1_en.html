greatest of Nature’s works, and I am actually met by such an unsought and overwhelming proof of hidden power that inquiry should really be pursued no further, and nothing equal or similar can be found, Nature surpassing herself, and that in numberless ways. For what is more violent than sea, winds, whirlwinds, and storms? By what greater skill<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL418_465_a" id="target_note_LCL418_465_a"><sup>a</sup></a> of man has Nature been aided in any part of herself than by sails and oars? Let there be added to these the indescribable force of tidal ebb and flow, the whole sea being turned into a river. All these, however, although acting in the same direction, are checked by a single specimen of the sucking fish, a very small fish. Gales may blow and storms may rage; this fish rules their fury, restrains their mighty strength, and brings vessels to a stop, a thing no cables can do, nor yet anchors of unmanageable weight that have been cast.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL418_465_b" id="target_note_LCL418_465_b"><sup>b</sup></a> It checks their attacks and tames the madness of the Universe with no toil of its own, not by resistance, or in any way except by adhesion. This little creature suffices in the face of all these forces to prevent vessels from moving. But armoured fleets bear aloft on their decks a rampart of towers, so that fighting may take place even at sea as from the walls of a fortress.
