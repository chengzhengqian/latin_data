same animals have no pastern-bone, but those with cloven hooves have one. Pastern-bones are also lacking in animals having toes, and no animal has them in the forefeet. The camel’s pastern-bones resemble those of the ox but are a little smaller; for the camel’s foot is divided in two by a very small cleft, and is fleshy at the tread like a bear’s, for which reason a camel’s feet are liable to split on too long a journey without shoeing.</p>

The same bird has a tongue like a snake’s which it stretches out a long way, and it turns its neck round towards
