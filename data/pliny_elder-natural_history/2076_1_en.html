‘perverted’ or adulterated alum. Liquid alum<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL394_399_a" id="target_note_LCL394_399_a"><sup>a</sup></a> has an astringent, hardening and corrosive property. Mixed with honey it cures ulcers in the mouth, pimples and eruptions; this treatment is carried out in baths containing two parts of honey to one of alum. It reduces odour from the armpits and perspiration. It is taken in pills against disorders of the spleen and discharge of blood in the urine. Mixed with soda and chamomile it is also a remedy for scabies.</p>
<p>One kind<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL394_399_b" id="target_note_LCL394_399_b"><sup>b</sup></a> of solid alum which is called in Greek schiston, ‘splittable,’ splits into a sort of filament of a whitish colour, owing to which some people have preferred to give it in Greek the name of trichitis, ‘hairy alum.’ This is produced from the same ore as copper, known as copperstone, a sort of sweat from that mineral, coagulated into foam. This kind of alum has less drying effect and serves less to arrest the detrimental humours of the body, but it is extremely beneficial as an ear-wash, or as a liniment also for ulcers of the mouth and for the teeth, and if it is retained in the mouth with saliva; or it forms a suitable ingredient in medicines for the eyes and for the genital organs of either sex. It is roasted in crucibles until it has quite lost its liquidity.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL394_399_c" id="target_note_LCL394_399_c"><sup>c</sup></a> There is another alum of a less active kind, called in Greek strongyle, ‘round alum.’ Of this also there are two varieties, the fungous which dissolves easily in any liquid and which is rejected as entirely worthless, and a better kind which is porous and pierced with small holes like a sponge and of a round formation, nearer white in colour, possessing a certain quality of unctuousness, free from grit, friable, and not apt to cause a black stain.
