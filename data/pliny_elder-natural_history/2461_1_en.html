in Britain called the Electrides. Pytheas<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_191_a" id="target_note_LCL419_191_a"><sup>a</sup></a> speaks of an estuary of the Ocean named Metuonis and extending for 750 miles, the shores of which are inhabited by a German tribe, the Guiones. From here it is a day’s sail to the Isle of Abalus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_191_b" id="target_note_LCL419_191_b"><sup>b</sup></a> to which, he states, amber is carried in spring by currents, being an excretion consisting of solidified brine. He adds that the inhabitants of the region use it as fuel instead of wood and sell it to the neighbouring Teutones. His belief is shared by Timaeus, who,<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">c.</span> 356–260 <span class="sc">b.c.</span></span>
however, calls the island Basilia. Philemon denies the suggestion that amber gives off a flame. Nicias insists on explaining amber as moisture from the sun’s rays, as follows: he maintains that as the sun sets in the west its rays fall more powerfully upon the earth and leave there a thick exudation, which is later cast ashore in Germany by the tides of the Ocean. He mentions that amber is formed similarly in Egypt, where it is called ‘sacal,’ as well as in India, where the inhabitants find it more agreeable even than frankincense;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_191_d" id="target_note_LCL419_191_d"><sup>d</sup></a> and that in Syria the women make whorls of it and call it ‘harpax,’ or ‘the snatcher,’ because it picks up leaves, straws and the fringes of garments. Theochrestus holds that it is washed up on the capes of the Pyrenees by the Ocean in turmoil,d a view which is shared by Xenocrates, the most recent writer on the subject, who is still living.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_191_e" id="target_note_LCL419_191_e"><sup>e</sup></a> Asarubas
