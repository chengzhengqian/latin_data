<h2><span class="ac">Book XI</span></h2>
<p>I. There remain some creatures of immeasurably<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Insects: their habits and structure—sense-organs, limbs and stings.</span></span> minute structure<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL353_433_a" id="target_note_LCL353_433_a"><sup>a</sup></a>—in fact some authorities have stated that they do not breathe and also that they,
are actually devoid of blood. These are of great number and of many kinds; they have the habits of land-animals and of flying animals, some lacking wings, for instance centipedes,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL353_433_b" id="target_note_LCL353_433_b"><sup>b</sup></a> others winged, for instance bees, others of both kinds, for instance ants, some lacking both wings and feet; and all are rightly termed insects, from the incisions which encircle them in some cases in the region of their necks and in others of their chests and stomach and separate off their limbs, these being only connected by a thin tube, with some however the crease of the incision not entirely encircling them, but only at the belly or higher up, with flexible vertebrae shaped like gutter-tiles—showing a craftsmanship on the part of Nature that is more remarkable than in any other case: inasmuch as in large bodies or at all events the larger ones the process of manufacture was facilitated by the yielding nature of the material, whereas in these minute nothings what method, what power, what labyrinthine perfection is displayed! Where did Nature find a place in a flea for all the senses?—and other smaller creatures can be mentioned,—but at what point in its surface did she place sight? where did she attach taste?
