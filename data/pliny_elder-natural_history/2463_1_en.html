to his noble Athenian lineage, his public achievements and his leadership of an army. Sophocles tells us how amber is formed in the lands beyond India from the tears shed for Meleager by the birds known as Meleager’s Daughters.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_195_a" id="target_note_LCL419_195_a"><sup>a</sup></a> Is it not amazing that he should have held this belief or have hoped to persuade others to accept it? Can one imagine, one wonders, a mind so childish and naive as to believe in birds that weep every year or that shed such large tears or that once migrated from Greece, where Meleager died, to the Indies to mourn for him? Well then, are there not many other equally fabulous stories told by the poets? Yes; but that anyone should seriously tell such a story regarding such a substance as this, a substance that every day of our lives is imported and floods the market and so confutes the liar, is a gross insult to man’s intelligence and an insufferable abuse of our freedom to utter falsehoods.</p>
<p>It is well established that amber is a product of islands in the Northern Ocean, that it is known to the Germans as ‘glaesum,’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_195_b" id="target_note_LCL419_195_b"><sup>b</sup></a> and that, as a result, one of these islands, the native name of which is Austeravia,
was nicknamed by our troops Glaesaria, or Amber Island, when Caesar Germanicus was conducting<span class="marginNote right"><span class="sc">a.d.</span> 16.</span>
operations there with his naval squadrons. To resume, amber is formed of a liquid seeping from the interior of a species of pine, just as the gum in a cherry tree or the resin in a pine bursts forth when the liquid is excessively abundant.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_195_ca" id="target_note_LCL419_195_ca"><sup>c</sup></a> The exudation

It is washed up on other parts of the Baltic coast and is occasionally carried to the east coast of Britain. It is a fossil resin exuded from an extinct pine, <span class="italic">Pinus succinifera.</span>
Succinite contains up to 6% of succinic acid, and a considerable amount of this acid is present in most of the ancient amber objects found in Italy and Greece that have been chemically examined. The northern origin of the amber of which most of these objects were made is thus proved. As for the amber of S. Europe, the Sicilian contains very little succinic acid. The Rumanian contains some succinic acid, but is harder than succinite, and there is no evidence that it was known to the ancient world.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL419_195_ca').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
