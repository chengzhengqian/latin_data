made of Cyprian copper in mortars of the same metal, and the Latin name for the mixture is santerna. It is in this way used in soldering the gold called silvery-gold; a sign of its having been so treated is if the application of borax gives it brilliance. On the other hand ‘coppery’ gold shrinks in size and becomes dull, and is difficult to solder; for this purpose a solder is made by adding some gold and one seventh as much silver to the materials above specified, and grinding them up together.</p>
<p>XXX. While speaking of this it will be well to annex the remaining particulars, so as to occasion all-round admiration for Nature. The proper solder for gold is the one described; for iron, potter’s clay; for copper in masses, <span class="italic">cadmea</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL394_73_a" id="target_note_LCL394_73_a"><sup>a</sup></a>; for copper in sheets, alum; for lead and marble, resin. Black lead however is joined by means of white lead,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL394_73_b" id="target_note_LCL394_73_b"><sup>b</sup></a> and white lead to white lead by using oil; stagnum<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL394_73_c" id="target_note_LCL394_73_c"><sup>c</sup></a> likewise with copper filings, and silver with stagnum. For smelting copper and iron pine-wood makes the best fuel, though Egyptian papyrus can also be used; gold is best smelted with a fire made of chaff. Water puts heat into quicklime and Thracian stone,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL394_73_d" id="target_note_LCL394_73_d"><sup>d</sup></a> and olive-oil puts it out; fire however is most readily quenched by vinegar, mistletoe and eggs. Earth it is quite impossible to ignite, but charcoal gives a more powerful heat if it is burned till it goes out and then catches fire again.</p>
<p>XXXI. After these details let us speak about the<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Silver.</span></span> varieties of silver ore, the next madness of mankind. Silver is only found in deep shafts, and raises no hopes of its existence by any signs, giving off no shining sparkles such as are seen in the case of gold.
