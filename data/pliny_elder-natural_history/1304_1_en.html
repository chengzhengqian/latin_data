If a number of clouds spread like fleeces of wool in the east, they will presage rain lasting three days. When clouds settle down on the tops of the mountains, the weather will be stormy; but if the tops become clear, it will turn fine. When there is heavy white cloud, a hailstorm, a ‘white storm’ as it is called, will be imminent. A patch of cloud however small seen in a fine sky will give a storm of wind.</p>
<p>LXXXIII. Mists coming down from the mountains or falling from the sky or settling in the valleys will promise fine weather.</p>
<p>LXXXIV. Next after these, signs are given by<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Weather signs in the fire.</span></span> fires on the earth. When they are pallid and crackling
they are perceived as messengers of storms; also it is a sign of rain if fungus forms in lamps, and if the flame is spiral and flickering. When the lights go out of themselves or are hard to light, they announce wind; and so do sparks piling up on the top of a copper pot hanging over the fire, or live coal sticking to saucepans when you take them off the fire, or if when the fire is banked up it sends out a scattering of ashes or emits a spark, or if cinders on the hearth cake together and if a coal fire glows with extreme brilliance.</p>
<p>LXXXV. Water also gives signs. If when the sea<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Weather signs given by the sea.</span></span> is calm the water in a harbour sways about or makes
a splashing noise of its own, it foretells wind, and if it does so in winter, rain as well; if the coasts and shores re-echo during a calm, they foretell a severe storm, as also do noises from the sea itself in a calm, or scattered flakes of foam, or bubbles on the water. Jelly-fish on the surface of the sea portend several<span class="marginNote right">IX. 154.</span> days’ storm. Often also the sea swells in silence, and blown up in unusually high waves confesses that the winds are now inside it.</p>
