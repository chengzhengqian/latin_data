But also the more inland seas are shut in by land like the water in a harbour; yet a more untrammeled expanse is subject to the tidal sway, inasmuch as there are several instances of people making the crossing from Italy to Utica in two days in a calm sea and with no wind in the sails when a strong tide was running. But these motions are observed more round the coasts than in the deep sea, since in the body too the extremities are more sensitive to the pulse of the veins, that is of the breath. But in most estuaries owing to the different risings of the stars in each regrion the tides occur irregularly, varying in time though not in method, as for instance in the Syrtes.</p>
<p>C. And nevertheless some tides have a special<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Exceptional local tides.</span></span> nature, for instance the channel at Taormina<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL330_347_b" id="target_note_LCL330_347_b"><sup>b</sup></a> that ebbs and flows more frequently, and the one at Euboea that has seven tides in twenty-four hours. The tide at Euboea stops three times a month, on the seventh, eighth and ninth day after the new moon. At Cadiz the spring nearest the shrine of Hercules, which is enclosed like a well, sometimes rises and sinks with the ocean and sometimes does both at the contrary periods; a second spring in the same place agrees with the motions of the ocean.
