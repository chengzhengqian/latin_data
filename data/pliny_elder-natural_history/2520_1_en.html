‘Oritis,’ or ‘mountain stone,’ sometimes known also<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Oritis.</span></span>

it has been polished. This ‘ostracias ‘is so hard that
other gemstones are engraved with pieces of it.
The ‘ostritis,’ or ‘oyster stone,’ owes its name to its<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Ostritis.</span></span>

cites quite a tasteful poem on the stone composed by Queen Timaris and dedicated to Venus. In this poem it is implied that the stone helped her to bear children. Some people call it ‘panerastos,’ or ‘loved-by-all.’
