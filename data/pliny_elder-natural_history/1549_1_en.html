Some of the poisonous mushrooms are easily recognized by their being of a pale-red colour, of a putrid appearance and of a leaden hue inside; the furrows of the striated parts are mere chinks,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL392_359_b" id="target_note_LCL392_359_b"><sup>b</sup></a> with a pale rim all round the edge. Not all the poisonous kinds are like this, and there is a dry sort, similar to the genuine mushroom, which shows as it were white drops on the top, standing out of its outer coat. The earth in fact produces first a matrix for this purpose, and afterwards the mushroom itself in the matrix, like the yoke inside the egg; and the baby mushroom is just as fond of eating its coat as is the chick. The coat cracks when the mushroom first forms; presently, as the mushroom gets bigger, the coat is absorbed into the body of the foot-stalk, two heads rarely ever springing from one foot. The first origin and cause of mushrooms is the slime and the souring juice of the damp ground, or often of the root of acorn-bearing trees,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL392_359_ca" id="target_note_LCL392_359_ca"><sup>c</sup></a> and at first is flimsier than froth, then it grows substantial like parchment, and then the mushroom, as I have said, is born.
