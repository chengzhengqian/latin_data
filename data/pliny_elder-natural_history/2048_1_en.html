a fine picture of Bacchants with Satyrs prowling towards them, and a Scylla that is now in the Temple of Peace in Rome. No other painter was ever a more rapid worker. Indeed it is recorded that he accepted<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">c.</span> 355 <span class="sc">b.c.</span></span> a commission from the tyrant of Sicyon Aristratus to paint by a given date a monument that he was erecting to the poet Telestes, and that he only<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">fi. c.</span> 398 <span class="sc">b.c.</span></span> arrived not long before the date; the wrathful tyrant threatened to punish him, but in a few days he finished the work with a speed and an artistic skill that were both remarkable. Among his pupils were his brother Ariston and his son Aristides,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL394_343_a" id="target_note_LCL394_343_a"><sup>a</sup></a> and Philoxenus of Eretria, who painted for King Cassander<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL394_343_b" id="target_note_LCL394_343_b"><sup>b</sup></a> a picture that holds the highest rank, containing a battle between Alexander and Darius. He also painted a picture with a wanton subject showing three Sileni at their revels. Imitating the rapidity of his master he introduced some shorthand methods of painting, executed with still more rapidity of technique.</p>
<p>With these artists is also reckoned Nicophanes, an elegant and finished painter with whom few can be compared for gracefulness, but who for tragic feeling and weight of style is far from Zeuxis and Apelles. Perseus, the pupil to whom Apelles dedicated his<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">§ 79.</span><span class="br"></span> volumes on the art of painting, had belonged to the same period. Aristides<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL394_343_c" id="target_note_LCL394_343_c"><sup>c</sup></a> of Thebes also had as his pupils his sons Niceros and Ariston,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL394_343_d" id="target_note_LCL394_343_d"><sup>d</sup></a> the latter the painter of a Satyr Crowned with a Wreath and Holding a Goblet; and other pupils of Aristides were Antorides and Euphranor<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL394_343_e" id="target_note_LCL394_343_e"><sup>e</sup></a>; about the latter we shall speak later on.<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">§ 128.</span><span class="br"></span></p>
