shock of what looks like shaggy hair at their top. The Greeks also give the name of ‘bearded stars’ to those from whose lower part spreads a mane resembling a long beard. ‘Javelin-star’ quiver like a dart; these are a very terrible portent.

The same stars when shorter and sloping to a point have been called ‘Daggers’; these are the palest of all in colour, and have a gleam like the flash of a sword, and no rays, which even the Quoit-star, which resembles its name in appearance but is in colour like amber, emits in scattered form from its edge.

There also occur ‘Goat comets,’ enringed with a sort of cloud resembling tufts of hair.
