wait for the olives to fall off, for by remaining attached to the branches beyond their proper time they use up the nourishment for the coming crop and occupy its place: this is proved by the fact that if they are not gathered before the west wind blows they acquire renewed strength and fall off with greater difficulty.</p>

beginning of autumn is the posia, which owing to a faulty method of cultivation and not to any fault of nature, is a very fleshy fruit; next the orchites, which contains a great deal of oil, and after that the radius. For as these olives are very delicate the lees in them very quickly gets hold of them and cause them to fall off. But the gathering of the hard-skinned
olives, which strongly resist damp and consequently are very small, is put off even till the month of March, the Licinian, Cominian, Contian and Sergian kinds, the last called by the Sabines the ‘royal olive,’ not turning black before the west wind blows, that is before February 8. It is thought that they begin to ripen then, and as a very excellent oil is made from them reason also appears to reinforce this mistake; and people say that the cold causes harshness in the oil in the same degree as the ripening of the berry increases the quantity, whereas in reality the goodness of the oil is not a matter of the time of gathering but of the kind of olive, which is slow in decaying into lees. A similar mistake is made in keeping the olives when gathered on wooden shelves and not crushing them till they sweat out juice, inasmuch as all delay diminishes the yield of oil and increases the quantity of lees. The consequence is the common assertion that a peck of olives yields only six pounds of oil; but nobody measures the
