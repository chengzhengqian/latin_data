This has been discovered by many experiments—that of Hannibal’s towers in Africa and Spain, and in Asia when piratical alarms prompted the precaution of watchtowers of the same sort, warning fires lit on which at noon were often ascertained to have been seen by the people farthest to the rear at 9 p.m. Alexander above mentioned had a runner named Philonides<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL330_315_a" id="target_note_LCL330_315_a"><sup>a</sup></a> who did the 1200 stades from Sicyon to Elis in 9 hours from sunrise and took till 9 p.m.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL330_315_ba" id="target_note_LCL330_315_ba"><sup>b</sup></a> for the return journey, although the way is downhill; this occurred repeatedly. The reason was that going his way lay with the sun but returning he was passing the sun as it met him travelling in the opposite direction. For this reason ships sailing westward beat even in the shortest day the distances they sail in the nights, because they are going with the actual sun.</p>

But perhaps the length of the route is overestimated at 1200 stades, about 136 miles, as the distance from Sicyon to Elis measures only about 80 miles in a straight line on the map. Elis lies higher above sea-level than Sicyon, but only the latter part of the return journey can be described as downhill.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL330_315_ba').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
