<p>The kind called ‘table-grapes,’ one of the hard-berry group, are grown on trellises—they are both white and black—and so are the ‘cow’s-udder’ grapes, also of both colours, and those of Aegium and of Rhodes, not mentioned before, and the ‘one-ounce’ grape, apparently named from the weight of the berry, and also the ‘pitch grape,’ the darkest in colour of all the black grapes, and the ‘garland’ grape, the clusters of which by a sport of nature are arranged in a wreath with leaves interspersed among the berries, and the grapes called ‘market-grapes,’ a very quick bearer that attracts buyers by its appearance and stands carriage well.
