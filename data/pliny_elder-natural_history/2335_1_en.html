in the words of another, one who was the greatest connoisseur of such matters in our time. These then are the words of Mucianus, which I will quote:—</p>
<p>Oysters of Cyzicus are larger than those of Lake Lucrinus, fresher than the British, sweeter than those of Medullae, sharper than the Ephesian, fuller than those of Ilici,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL418_503_a" id="target_note_LCL418_503_a"><sup>a</sup></a> less slimy than those of Coryphas, softer than those of Histria, whiter than those of Circeii.</p>
<p>It is agreed, however, that none are fresher or softer than the last.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL418_503_b" id="target_note_LCL418_503_b"><sup>b</sup></a> The writers of Alexander’s expedition tell us that in the Indian sea are found oysters a foot long, and among ourselves a spendthrift<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL418_503_c" id="target_note_LCL418_503_c"><sup>c</sup></a> has invented the nickname <span class="italic">tridacna,</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL418_503_d" id="target_note_LCL418_503_d"><sup>d</sup></a> wishing it to be used of oysters so large that they require three bites.</p>
<p>I shall give all their medical virtues at this point. Oysters are specific for settling the stomach, they restore lost appetite, and luxury has added coolness by burying them in snow, thus wedding the tops of the mountains to the bottom of the sea. They are a gentle laxative. They also, if boiled with honey wine, cure tenesmus if there is no ulceration. They also clean an ulcerated bladder. Boiled, unopened as gathered, in their shells, they are wonderfully good for streaming colds. Reduced to ash and mixed with honey oyster shells relieve troubles of the uvula and tonsils, similarly parotid swellings, superficial abscesses and indurations of the breasts. Applied with water the ash cures sores on the head and smooths the skin of women. It is sprinkled on burns and is popular as a dentifrice. Applied also with vinegar it cures itch and eruptions of phlegm. The purple-fish too is a good antidote to poisons.
