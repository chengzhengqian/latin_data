<p>XXX. Nowhere are more serviceable millstones to be found than in Italy, for here they are proper stones and not lumps of rock. In certain provinces, however, they are not found at all. Some stones of this kind are quite soft and can be smoothed also with a whetstone, so that from a distance they may be mistaken for serpentine. No other stones are<span class="marginNote right">§§ 55–56.</span>
more durable than millstones; for, as with wood, it is characteristic of stones of one sort or another to be unable to stand rain, sun or wintry weather. Some are affected even by the moon, while others acquire a patina in course of time or lose their white colour when treated with oil.</p>
<p>Some people call a millstone ‘pyrites,’ or ‘fire-stone,’<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Pyrites.</span></span>
because there is a great amount of fire in it. However, there is another ‘pyrites’ which is similar, only more porous, and yet another which resembles copper.

Some roast it two or three times with honey until the moisture is consumed, whereas others roast it first on hot coals and then with honey. Afterwards, it is washed like copper. The varieties of pyrites are used in pharmacy for their warming, drying, dispersing and reducing effects, and also to cause indurations to discharge their matter.

Did Varro mean that rotary mills were invented at Volsinii or that stones suitable for them were found there? Probably neither, if Pliny has understood him correctly. In this context he is surely reporting a curiosity. Round millstones
were found, ready for use in their natural state.<span class="linebreak"></span>
