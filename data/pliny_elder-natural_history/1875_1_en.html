<p>CXVII. There is also tragopogon, called by some<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Tragopogon.</span></span> come, with a small stem, leaves like those of saffron, a long, sweet root, and at the top of the stem a broad, dark calyx. It grows on rugged soils, and is eaten but never used in medicine.</p>
<p>CXVIII. Such is all that I have been told or discovered<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Age and potency of plants.</span></span> worth recording about plants. At the close, I think it not out of place to add a warning that their properties vary with their age. As I have said,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL393_479_a" id="target_note_LCL393_479_a"><sup>a</sup></a> elaterium lasts longest, dark chamaeleon forty years, centaury not more than twelve, peucedanum and aristolochia up to six, and the wild vine one year—that is, if they are kept in the shade. And of external animals indeed none attack the roots that I have mentioned except the sphondyle, a kind of creeping thing,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL393_479_b" id="target_note_LCL393_479_b"><sup>b</sup></a> which infests them all.</p>
<p>CXIX. There is no doubt either that the potency<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Drugs and habit.</span></span> and efficacy of all roots are lessened if the fruit<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL393_479_c" id="target_note_LCL393_479_c"><sup>c</sup></a> ripens before they are dug, and it is the same with seeds if the root has been cut previously for the sake of the juice. The properties moreover of all plants are weakened by habit, and they cease to be beneficial when needed if they have been in daily use; similarly with harmful plants. All plants however have greater efficacy and potency when they grow in cold regions subject to north-east winds, and likewise those that grow in dry.</p>
<p>CXX. There are also considerable differences between races. I have heard for instance about tapeworms and maw-worms, that they infest the peoples of Egypt, Arabia, Syria and Cilicia, while on the contrary they are never found at all among those of Thrace and Phrygia. This is less remarkable than their being found among the Thebans, but not among
