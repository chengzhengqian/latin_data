Let another line run transversely through the middle of the umbilicus;<span class="marginNote right">§ 327.</span> this line will run due east and west, and a path that cuts across the land on this line will be called the ‘decuman’. Then two other lines must be drawn obliquely to form an X, so as to run down from the right and left of the northern point to the left and right of the southern point. All these lines must run through the same umbilicus, and they must all be equal and the spaces between all of them must be equal.
