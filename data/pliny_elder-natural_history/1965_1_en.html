preserved the quality of ‘symmetry’ (for which there is no word in Latin) by the new and hitherto untried method of modifying the squareness of the figure of the old sculptors, and he used commonly to say that whereas his predecessors had made men as they really were, he made them as they appeared to be. A peculiarity of this sculptor’s work seems to be the minute finish maintained in even the smallest details.</p>
<p>Lysippus left three sons who were his pupils, the<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Lysippus son.</span></span> celebrated artists Laippus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL394_177_a" id="target_note_LCL394_177_a"><sup>a</sup></a> Boëdas and Euthycrates, the last pre-eminent, although he copied the harmony rather than the elegance of his father, preferring to win favour in the severely correct more than in the agreeable style. Accordingly his Heracles, at Delphi, and his Alexander Hunting, at Thespiae, his group of Thespiades,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL394_177_b" id="target_note_LCL394_177_b"><sup>b</sup></a> and his Cavalry in Action are works of extreme finish, and so are his statue of Trophonius at the oracular shrine of that deity, a number of Four-horse Chariots, a Horse with Baskets<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL394_177_c" id="target_note_LCL394_177_c"><sup>c</sup></a> and a Pack of Hounds. Moreover Tisicrates, another<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Tisicrates.</span></span> native of Sicyon, was a pupil of Euthycrates, but closer to the school of Lysippus—indeed many of his statues cannot be distinguished from Lysippus’s work, for instance his Old Man of Thebes, his King Demetrius (Poliorcetes), and his Peucestes, the man who saved the life of Alexander the Great and so deserved the honour of this commemoration.</p>
<p>Artists<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL394_177_d" id="target_note_LCL394_177_d"><sup>d</sup></a> who have composed treatises recording these matters speak with marvellously high praise of Telephanes of Phocis, who is otherwise unknown,<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Telephanes.</span></span>
