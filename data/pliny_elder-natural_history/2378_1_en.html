artists were chiefly responsible for making the structure one of the seven wonders of the world. On the north and south sides it extends for 63 feet,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_25_a" id="target_note_LCL419_25_a"><sup>a</sup></a> but the length of the façades is less, the total length of the facades and sides being 440 feet. The building rises to a height of 25 cubits<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_25_ba" id="target_note_LCL419_25_ba"><sup>b</sup></a> and is enclosed by 36 columns. The Greek word for the surrounding colonnade is ‘pteron,’ ‘a wing.’ The east side was carved by Scopas, the north by Bryaxis, the south by Timotheus and the west by Leochares; and before they completed their task, the queen died. However, they refused to abandon the work without finishing it, since they were already of the opinion that it would be a memorial to their own glory and that of their profession; and even to-day they are considered to rival each other in skill. With them was associated a fifth artist. For above the colonnade there is a pyramid as high again as the lower structure and tapering in 24 stages to the top of its peak. At the summit there is a four-horse chariot of marble, and this was made by Pythis. The addition of this chariot rounds off the whole work and brings it to a height of 140 feet.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_25_c" id="target_note_LCL419_25_c"><sup>c</sup></a> There is a Diana by Timotheus at Rome in the temple of the Palatine Apollo, a statue for which a head was made as a replacement by Avianius Evander.<span class="marginNote right">Hor. <span class="italic">sat.

Pliny is presumably giving the height of the pteron, that is, half the total height of the building (see § 31). If, as seems likely, Pliny’s figure of 140 feet for the total height is more or less correct (see p. 25, n.<sup> <span class="italic">c</span></sup>), the height of the pteron would have been about 45 cubits, so that for XXV the correct reading may be XXXXV.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL419_25_ba').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL419_25_c"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL419_25_c" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">c</sup>This figure may be approximately correct.
