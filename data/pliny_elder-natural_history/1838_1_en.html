<p>IX. Androsaces is a whitish plant, bitter, leafless,<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Androsaces.</span></span> with seed pods in hairy tufts. It grows especially
along the sea coast of Syria. For dropsy are prescribed two-drachma doses of the plant pounded or boiled down in water, vinegar, or wine, for it is a powerful diuretic. It is also prescribed for dropsy and applied locally. The seed too has the same properties.</p>
<p>X. Androsaemon, or, as others have called it,<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Androsaemon.</span></span> ascyron, is not unlike hypericum, about which I have already spoken,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL393_405_a" id="target_note_LCL393_405_a"><sup>a</sup></a> but the stalks are larger, closer together, and redder. Its leaves are pale and shaped
like those of rue; the seed resembles that of the dark poppy. The stalk tops when crushed give out a juice of the colour of blood. Their smell is resinous. It grows in vineyards; about the middle of autumn it is dug and hung up. When used as a purge it is pounded with the seed and taken early in the morning or after dinner, the dose being two drachmae in hydromel, wine, or plain water, and the whole draught a sextarius.

This dose should be repeated after an interval of four days. After the actual purging wine should be drunk by the stronger patients and water by the weaker. The plant is applied also to gouty limbs, to burns, and, as it stanches blood, to wounds.</p>
