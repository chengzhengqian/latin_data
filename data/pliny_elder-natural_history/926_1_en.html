The itriola is peculiar to Umbria and to the districts of Bevagna and Ancona, and the ‘dwarf-vine’ to that of San Vettorino. The same districts have the bananica, an unreliable vine, though people become fond of it. The people of Pompei give the name of their township to a grape, although it grows in greater quantity at Chiusi; the people of Tivoli also name a grape after their township, although they have lately discovered the ‘olive-grape,’ so called from its resemblance to an olive: this is the latest grape introduced hitherto.
