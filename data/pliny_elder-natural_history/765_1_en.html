maggot developes, and three days later it becomes a caterpillar, which as days are added grows larger; it becomes motionless, with a hard skin, and only moves when touched, being covered with a cobweb growth—at this stage it is called a chrysalis. Then it bursts its covering and flies out as a butterfly.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL353_503_a" id="target_note_LCL353_503_a"><sup>a</sup></a></p>
<p>XXXVIII. In this way some creatures are<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Other modes of generation of insects.</span></span> generated from rain in the earth and some even in wood. For not only is the goatmoth caterpillar born in wood, but also the horse-fly springs from wood, and other creatures, wherever there is excessive damp,</p>

Again worms<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL353_503_b" id="target_note_LCL353_503_b"><sup>b</sup></a> are born in the flesh of dead bodies and also in the hair of living people, a foul growth that caused the death of the dictator Sulla and also of one of the most famous of Greece poets, Alcman. This indeed also infests birds, and actually kills pheasants unless they sprinkle themselves with dust; and of hairy animals it is believed that only the ass and sheep are immune from this evil.

Also I find in the authorities that some springs of water in which we bathe are specially productive of this kind of creature; inasmuch as even wax generates what is believed to be the smallest of animals. Others<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL353_503_d" id="target_note_LCL353_503_d"><sup>d</sup></a> again are generated out of dirt by the rays of the sun, creatures that hop with a frisk of their hind legs, and others out of damp dust, that fly about in caves.</p>
