<p>XIX. The fifth kind of resinous tree has the same<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Larch.</span></span> habitat and the same appearance; it is called the larch. Its timber is far superior, not rotting with age and offering a stubborn resistance to damp; also it has a reddish colour and a rather penetrating scent. Resin flows from this tree in rather large quantities, of the colour and stickiness of honey, and never becoming hard.</p>
<p>The sixth kind is the torch-pine<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL370_417_a" id="target_note_LCL370_417_a"><sup>a</sup></a> specially so called,<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Torch-pine.</span></span> which gives out more resin than the rest, but less, and of a more liquid kind, than the pitch-pine; and it is agreeable for kindling fires and also for torchlight at religious ceremonies. These trees, at all events the male variety, also produce the extremely strong-smelling liquid called by the Greeks <span class="italic">syce.</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL370_417_b" id="target_note_LCL370_417_b"><sup>b</sup></a> It is a disease of the larch to turn into a torch-pine.<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Properties of resinous trees.</span></span></p>
<p>All these kinds of trees when set fire to make an enormous quantity of sooty smoke and suddenly with an explosive crackle send out a splutter of charcoal and shoot it to a considerable distance—excepting
the larch, which does not burn nor yet make charcoal, nor waste away from the action of fire any more than do stones. All these trees<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL370_417_c" id="target_note_LCL370_417_c"><sup>c</sup></a> are evergreen, and are not easily distinguishable in point of foliage even by experts, so closely are they interrelated; but the pitch-pine is not so tall as the larch, which has a thicker and smoother bark and more velvety and oilier and thicker foliage, the leaf bending more softly to the touch, whereas the foliage
