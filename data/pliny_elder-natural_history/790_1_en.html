removes anxieties. Hares with two livers are found in the district of Briletum and Thames and in the Chersonese on the Sea of Marmara, and surprising to say, when the animals are moved to another place one of the two livers disappears.</p>
<p>LXXIV. The liver also contains the gall-bladder,<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">The gallbladder.</span></span> but not all animals possess one. At Chalcis in Euboea the cattle have none, while at Naxos they have a very large double one, so that both facts seem portentous to a stranger.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL353_553_a" id="target_note_LCL353_553_a"><sup>a</sup></a> Horses, mules, asses, stags, wild goats, boars, camels and dolphins have not got one; some mice have. Among human beings few lack one; those who do are exceptionally strong in health and long-lived. Some think that the horse has a gall-bladder not indeed in the liver but in the belly, and that the stag has one in the tail or in the bowels, and that consequently they have such a bitter flavour that dogs will not touch them. But as a matter of fact it is only excrement, and because of this the substance of this part also contains the worst portion of the blood. Unquestionably only sanguineous animals possess a liver. The liver receives the blood from the heart with which it is connected, and passes it into the veins.</p>
<p>LXXV. But with a human being black gall contains<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Psychological effect of gall.</span></span> the cause of insanity, and when it is all excreted death follows. Hence the reproach made against a man’s character under the term ‘bile’: so powerful a poison is contained in this part when it spreads to the mind. Moreover when it is diffused all over the body it takes away the colour even of the eyes, and indeed, when excreted, even from bronze vessels,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL353_553_b" id="target_note_LCL353_553_b"><sup>b</sup></a> which turn black when touched by it—so that nobody need be surprised that snakes’ gall is poison.
