wine may be given the scent of pitch and some touches of its piquant flavour. It is thought that a more effective way of doing this is by means of raw flower of resin, this giving briskness to the smooth quality of the wine, while on the other hand resinjuice<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL370_269_a" id="target_note_LCL370_269_a"><sup>a</sup></a>

Some people advise using both resin-juice

For the tartness of vinegar possesses a valuable quality useful for important purposes, and without which it is impossible to live in comparative comfort.
