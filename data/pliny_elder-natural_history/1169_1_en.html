ground, so that it may not shoot from the place where it was cut off. As for a quickset, it should be removed immediately after the vintage.</p>
<p>A plan has recently been invented of planting a snake-branch near the tree—that is our name for a veteran main branch that has grown hard with many years’ service. The quickest plan in the case of a vine is to cut this old branch off as long as possible and scrape the bark off three-quarters of its length, down to the point to which it is to be buried in the ground—for this reason it is also called a ‘scraped’ shoot—and then to press it down in the furrow, with the remaining part standing straight up against the tree. If the vine be meagre or the soil thin, it is customary to cut down the plant as close to the ground as possible, until the root gets strong, and likewise not to plant it when there is dew on it, nor in a place exposed to a north wind; the vines themselves ought to face north-east, but their young shoots should have a southerly aspect.</p>
<p>There must be no hurry to prune a young vine, but<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Pruning vines on trees.</span></span>
at first the growth should be collected together into circular shapes, and no pruning should be applied except to a strong plant, a vine trained on a tree being about a year later in bearing fruit than one trained on a cross-bar. Some people forbid pruning altogether until the vine equals the tree in height. At the first pruning it should be cut back six feet from the ground, a shoot being left below and encouraged to grow by bending over the wood. It should have three buds and not more left when it has been pruned. In the following year the branches sent out from these should be spread out on the lowest stages of the trees and allowed to climb to
