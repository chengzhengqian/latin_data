<p>XLIX. The best silex<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_135_a" id="target_note_LCL419_135_a"><sup>a</sup></a> is the black variety,<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Silex.</span></span>
although in certain localities it is the red that is best, and in several places even the white, as in the Anician quarries round Lake Bolsena near Trachina or, again, in the neighbourhood of Statonia, the stone from these two places being immune even to fire.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_135_b" id="target_note_LCL419_135_b"><sup>b</sup></a> The same two varieties are, moreover, used for sculpture on monuments, where they offer the added advantage of remaining untouched by the ravages of time. Of these stones are made the moulds in which bronze implements are cast. There is also a green stone that strongly resists fire, but it is nowhere plentiful and, where it is found, occurs in pieces and not in a mass. Of the remaining varieties, the pale silex can only occasionally be used for rough walling, while the rounded kind stands up to hard abuse, but is unreliable for building purposes unless it is bonded with large quantities of mortar. The silex found in rivers is no more reliable, always giving the impression of being thoroughly damp.</p>
<p>L. When stone is of doubtful quality the remedy is to quarry it in the summer and to lay it only after it has been subjected to weathering for at least two years. Those stones of this class that have been damaged by such treatment may be more profitably incorporated in masonry lying below ground-level, while those that have withstood weathering can be safely exposed even to the sky.</p>

were using brick, of hard stone or silex<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_135_c" id="target_note_LCL419_135_c"><sup>c</sup></a> dressed to a uniform thickness. When they follow this procedure the style of masonry is what they call ‘isodomos,’ or ‘masonry with equal courses.’ When the courses
