are broader than those of cabbage, and hairy; the stem is upright, and more than a cubit high. The seed is black and of no use. The root is single, and of the thickness of a finger. The plants also grow in flat country. Wild verbascum has leaves like those of elelisphacus and tall, while the branches are of a woody texture.</p>
<p>LXXIV. There are also two<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">phlomis.</span></span>
sorts of phlomis, both shaggy and with round leaves, growing near the ground. A third is called lychnitis,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL393_225_a" id="target_note_LCL393_225_a"><sup>a</sup></a> by some thryallis<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL393_225_b" id="target_note_LCL393_225_b"><sup>b</sup></a>; it has three or at most four leaves, which are thick and fleshy, and suitable for lamp wicks. It is said that, placed in the leaves of the kind we have called female, a fig does not even begin to go bad. It is almost superfluous to distinguish these various kinds, because they all have the same properties. A draught for the sting of scorpions is made from the root and rue in water, which is as efficacious as it is bitter.</p>

It is said that a dead scorpion, if smeared with white hellebore, comes to life again. Thelyphonon kills every kind of quadruped if its root be applied to the genitals, the leaf indeed, which is like that of cyclamen, does so before the end of the same day. The plant itself is jointed, and grows in shaded places. Good for scorpion bite is the juice of betony or<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL393_225_c" id="target_note_LCL393_225_c"><sup>c</sup></a> plantain.</p>
