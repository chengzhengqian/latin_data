<p>XLI. In early days there were two kinds of<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Encaustic.</span></span> encaustic painting, with wax and on ivory with a graver or <span class="italic">cestrum</span> (that is a small pointed graver<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL394_371_a" id="target_note_LCL394_371_a"><sup>a</sup></a>); but later the practice came in of decorating battleships. This added a third method, that of employing a brush, when wax has been melted by fire; this process of painting ships is not spoilt by the action of the sun nor by salt water or winds.</p>
<p>XLII. In Egypt they also colour cloth by an<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Egyptian dyeing</span></span> exceptionally remarkable kind of process. They first thoroughly rub white fabrics and then smear them not with colours but with chemicals that absorb colour. When this has been done, the fabrics show no sign of the treatment, but after being plunged into a cauldron of boiling dye they are drawn out a moment later dyed. And the remarkable thing is that although the cauldron contains only one colour, it produces a series of different colours in the fabric, the hue changing with the quality of the chemical employed, and it cannot afterwards be washed out. Thus the cauldron which, if dyed fabrics were put into it, would undoubtedly blend the colours together, produces several colours out of one, and dyes the material in the process of being boiled; and the dress fabrics when submitted to heat become stronger for wear than they would be if not so heated.</p>
<p>XLIII. Enough and more than enough has now<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Plastic art. Early stages. Butades and others.</span></span> been said about painting. It may be suitable to append to these remarks something about the plastic art.
