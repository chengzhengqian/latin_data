It is thought too that the beak of the heron by itself rinsed in wine has the same effect. Sleep is kept away, on the contrary, by a dried bat’s head worn as an amulet.</p>

Antaphrodisiac too are snails, and pigeon’s dung taken with oil and wine. Aphrodisiac for men are the right parts of a vulture’s lung, worn as an amulet in a piece of crane’s skin; aphrodisiac also are the yolks of five pigeons’ eggs mixed with a denarius by weight of pig fat and swallowed in honey, sparrows or their eggs in food, or the right testicle of a cock worn as an amulet in a piece of ram’s-skin. They say that rubbing with ibis ash, goose grease and iris oil prevent miscarriage when there has been conception; that desire on the contrary is inhibited if a fighting cock’s testicles are rubbed with goose grease and worn as an amulet in a ram’s skin, as it also is if with a cock’s blood any cock’s testicles are placed under the bed. Women unwilling to conceive are forced to do so by hairs from the tail of a she-mule, pulled out during the animal copulation and entwined during the human.
