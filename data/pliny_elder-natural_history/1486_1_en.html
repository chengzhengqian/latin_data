Its stems, shooting out from the root, trail on the ground; the leaves are broad and prickly. The stems are called cacti, which make, even when preserved, a palatable food.

It should be remembered that Pliny probably made notes while a reader read aloud to him. The text of Th. (VI. 4, 11) may be useful: τὸ δὲ περικάρπιον, ἐν ᾧ τὸ σπέρμα, τὴν μὲν μορφὴν ἀκανθῶδες, ἀφαιρεθέντων δὲ τῶν παππωδῶν σπερμάτων ἐδώδιμον καὶ τοῦτο καὶ ἐμφερὲς τῷ τοῦ φοίνικος ἐγκεφάλῳ· καλοῦσι δὲ αὐτὸ σκαλίαν.
