Consequently when torn asunder they display a remarkable tenacity of life, and the separate parts go on throbbing, because whatever their vital principle is it certainly does not reside in particular members but in the body as a wholeâ€”least of all in the head, and this alone does not move unless it has been torn off with the breast.

have been created for the sake of man. They collect
honey, that sweetest and most refined and most
