<p>LVI. Syria also supplies galbanum,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL370_89_a" id="target_note_LCL370_89_a"><sup>a</sup></a> which also<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Other scent-plants.</span></span> grows on Mount Amanus; it comes from a kind of fennel which they call stagonitis, like the resin of the same name. The kind of galbanum most esteemed is cartilaginous, clear like hammoniacum
and free from all woody substance. Even so it is adulterated with beans or with sacopenium.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL370_89_b" id="target_note_LCL370_89_b"><sup>b</sup></a> Pure galbanum, if burnt, drives away snakes with its smell. It is sold at 5 denarii a pound.</p>
<p>LVII. Pure galbanum is only useful for medicinal purposes; but Syria produces all-heal which is used for unguents as well. It also grows at Psophis in Arcadia and round the spring of Erymanthus, and in Africa and in Macedonia also. It has a peculiar stalk 7½ feet long; this throws out first four leaves and then six lying on the ground, which are very large and of a round shape, but the leaves on the top of the plant are like those of the olive; the seed hangs in tufts like that of the fennel. The juice is got by means of incisions made in the stalk at harvest time and at the root in autumn. It is valued for whiteness when it coagulates, the next grade being assigned to juice of a pale colour, while the black is held of no value. The price of the best quality is two denarii a pound.</p>
<p>LVIII. From this fennel the one called bear’s-wort fennel differs only in the leaf, which is smaller, and has divisions like a plane-leaf. It only grows in shady places. Its seed, bearing the same name, resembles that of hart-wort; it is only useful for medicine.</p>

Syria also supplies the malobathrum,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL370_89_c" id="target_note_LCL370_89_c"><sup>c</sup></a> a tree with a folded leaf, the colour of a leaf that has dried up; from it oil is pressed to use for unguents, Egypt also producing it in still greater quantity.
