<h2><span class="ac">Book XXII</span></h2>
<p>I. Nature and our earth might have filled the measure of our wonder at them in anyone who reviews even the preceding volume only, with all Nature’s gifts in it, and all the kinds of plants created for the needs or pleasures of mankind. But how many more kinds remain, and how much more wonderful they are in their discovery! For of the plants mentioned already the greater number, owing to their excellence as food, perfume or ornament, have led to repeated experiments; of the rest it is their efficacy that proves that nothing is created by Nature without some more hidden reason than those just mentioned.</p>
<p>II. Now I notice that some foreign peoples use certain plants on their persons both to make themselves more handsome and also to keep up traditional custom. At any rate among barbarian tribes the women stain the face, using, some one plant and some another; and the men too among the Daci and the Sarmatae tattoo their own bodies. In Gaul there is a plant like the plantain, called glastum;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL392_295_a" id="target_note_LCL392_295_a"><sup>a</sup></a> with it the wives of the Britons, and their daughters-in-law,
stain all the body, and at certain religious ceremonies march along naked, with a colour resembling that of Ethiopians.</p>
<p>III. Moreover we know that clothes are dyed<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Vegetable dyes.</span></span> with a wonderful dye from a plant, and, to say nothing of the fact that, of the berries of Galatia,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL392_295_b" id="target_note_LCL392_295_b"><sup>b</sup></a> Africa, and Lusitania, the “coccum” is specially reserved<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL392_295_a" id="target_note_LCL392_295_a"><sup>a</sup></a>
