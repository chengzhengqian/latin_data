On the right as you enter from the ocean is Africa and on the left Europe, with Asia between them; the boundaries are the river Don and the river Nile. The ocean straits mentioned are fifteen miles long and five miles broad, from the village of Mellaria<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL352_5_a" id="target_note_LCL352_5_a"><sup>a</sup></a> in Spain to the White Cape<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL352_5_b" id="target_note_LCL352_5_b"><sup>b</sup></a> in Africa, as given by Turranius Gracilis, a native of the neighbourhood, while Livy and Cornelius Nepos state the breadth at the narrowest point as seven miles and at the widest as ten miles: so narrow is the mouth through which pours so boundless an expanse of water. Nor is it of any great depth, so as to lessen the marvel, for recurring streaks of whitening shoal-water terrify passing keels, and consequently many have called this place the threshold of the Mediterranean.
