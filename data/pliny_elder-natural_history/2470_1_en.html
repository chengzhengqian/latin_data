tested upon an anvil, and they are so recalcitrant to blows that an iron hammer head may split in two and even the anvil itself be unseated. Indeed, the hardness of ‘adamas’ is indescribable, and so too that property whereby it conquers fire and never becomes heated.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_209_a" id="target_note_LCL419_209_a"><sup>a</sup></a> Hence it derives its name, because, according to the meaning of the term in Greek, it is the ‘unconquerable force.’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_209_b" id="target_note_LCL419_209_b"><sup>b</sup></a> One of these stones is called in Greek ‘cenchros,’ or millet seed, and is like a millet seed in size. A second is known as the Macedonian and is found in the gold-mines of Philippi. This is equal in size to a cucumber seed. Next comes the so-called Cyprian, which is found in Cyprus and tends towards the colour of copper, but has potent medical properties, which I shall describe later. <span class="marginNote right">§ 61.</span>
After this, there is the ‘siderites,’ or ‘iron stone,’ which shines like iron and exceeds the rest in weight, but has different properties. For it can not only be broken by hammering but also be pierced by another ‘adamas.’ This can happen also to the Cyprian kind, and, in a word, these stones, being untrue to their kind, possess only the prestige of the name they bear.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_209_ca" id="target_note_LCL419_209_ca"><sup>c</sup></a></p>
<p>Now throughout the whole of this work I have tried to illustrate the agreement and disagreement that exist in Nature, the Greek terms for which are respectively ‘sympathia,’ or ‘natural affinity,’ and ‘antipathia,’ or ‘natural aversion.’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_209_d" id="target_note_LCL419_209_d"><sup>d</sup></a> Here more clearly than anywhere can these principles be discerned.
