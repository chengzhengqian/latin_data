eagle, and also the hare-eagle,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL353_297_a" id="target_note_LCL353_297_a"><sup>a</sup></a> is smallest in size and of outstanding strength; it is of a blackish colour. It is the only eagle that rears its own young, whereas all the others, as we shall describe, drive them away; and it is the only one that has no scream or cry. Its haunt is in the mountains. To the second kind belongs the white-rump eagle found in towns and in level country; it has a whitish tail. To the third the <span class="italic">morphnos,</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL353_297_b" id="target_note_LCL353_297_b"><sup>b</sup></a> which Homer also calls the dusky eagle, and some the <span class="italic">plangos</span> and also the duck-eagle; it is second in size and strength, and it lives in the neighbourhood of lakes. Phemonoe,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL353_297_c" id="target_note_LCL353_297_c"><sup>c</sup></a> who was styled Daughter of Apollo, has stated that it possesses teeth, but that it is mute and voiceless; also that it is the darkest of the eagles in colour, and has an exceptionally prominent tail. Boethus also agrees. It has a clever device for breaking tortoise-shells that it has carried off, by dropping them from a height; this accident caused the death of the poet Aeschylus, who was trying to avoid a disaster of this nature that had been foretold by the fates, as the story goes, by trustfully relying on the open sky.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL353_297_d" id="target_note_LCL353_297_d"><sup>d</sup></a> Next, the fourth class comprises the hawk-eagle, also called the mountain stork, which resembles a vulture in having very small wings but exceeds it in the size of its other parts, and yet is unwarlike and degenerate, as it allows a crow to flog it. It is always ravenously greedy, and keeps up a plaintive screaming. It is the only eagle that carries away the dead bodies of its prey; all the others after killing alight on the spot. This species causes the fifth kind to be called the ‘true eagle,’ as being the genuine kind and the only pure-bred one; it is of medium size and dull reddish colour, and it is rarely seen.
