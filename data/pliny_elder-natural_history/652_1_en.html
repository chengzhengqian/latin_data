<p>LXXVI. The pipefish or garfish is the only fish so prolific that its matrix is ruptured when it spawns; after spawning the wound grows together, which is said to happen in the case of blindworms also. The filefish digs a trench in the ground to lay its eggs in and covers it again with earth, and a month later digs the earth up again and opens the trench and leads its brood into the water.</p>
<p>LXXVII. The red perch and the sea-perch<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL353_277_a" id="target_note_LCL353_277_a"><sup>a</sup></a> are said to have wombs. The species called by the Greeks hoop-fish<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL353_277_b" id="target_note_LCL353_277_b"><sup>b</sup></a> is said to practise self-impregnation. The offspring of all aquatic animals are blind at birth.</p>
<p>LXXVIII. There has recently been sent to us a<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Longevity in fish.</span></span> remarkable case of longevity in fishes. In Campania not far from Naples, there is a country house named Posilipo<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL353_277_c" id="target_note_LCL353_277_c"><sup>c</sup></a>; Annaeus Seneca writes that in Caesar’s fishponds on this property a fish thrown in by Polio Vedius had died after reaching the age of 60, while two others of the same breed that were of the same age were even then living. The mention of fishponds reminds me to say a little more on this topic before leaving the subject of aquatic animals.</p>
<p>LXXIX. Oyster ponds were first invented by<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Oyster culture.</span></span> Sergius Orata on the Gulf of Baiae, in the time of the orator Lucius Crassus, before the Marsian war<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL353_277_d" id="target_note_LCL353_277_d"><sup>d</sup></a>; his motive was not greed but avarice, and he made a great profit out of his practical ingenuity, as he was the first inventor of showerbaths—he used to fit out country houses in this way and then sell them. He was the first to adjudge the best flavour to Lucrine oysters—because the same kinds of fish are of better quality in different places, for example sea-bass in the Tiber between the two bridges<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL353_277_e" id="target_note_LCL353_277_e"><sup>e</sup></a>, turbot at Ravenna, moray in Sicily, sturgeon at Rhodes, and other kinds
