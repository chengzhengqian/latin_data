is found in India, in Italy within the territory of the Samnites and in Spain near the shores of the Atlantic. There is also the artificial ‘obsian’ glass<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_157_a" id="target_note_LCL419_157_a"><sup>a</sup></a> which is used as a material for tableware, this being produced by a colouring process, as is also the case with a completely red, opaque glass called in Greek ‘blood-red ware.’ There is, furthermore, opaque white glass and others that reproduce the appearance of fluor-spar, blue sapphires or lapis lazuli, and, indeed, glass exists in any colour. There is no other material nowadays that is more pliable or more adaptable, even to painting. However, the most highly valued glass is colourless and transparent, as closely as possible resembling rock-crystal. But although for making drinking vessels the use of glass has indeed ousted metals such as gold and silver, it cannot bear heat unless cold fluid is first poured into it; and yet glass globes containing water become so hot when they face the sun that they can set clothes on fire.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_157_b" id="target_note_LCL419_157_b"><sup>b</sup></a> Pieces of broken glass can, when heated to a moderate temperature, be stuck together, but that is all. They can never again be completely melted except into globules separate from each other,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_157_c" id="target_note_LCL419_157_c"><sup>c</sup></a> as happens in the making of the glass pebbles that are sometimes nicknamed ‘eyeballs’ and in some cases have a variety of colours arranged in several different patterns. Glass, when boiled with sulphur, coalesces into the consistency of stone.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_157_d" id="target_note_LCL419_157_d"><sup>d</sup></a></p>
