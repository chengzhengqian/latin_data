Sotacus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_103_a" id="target_note_LCL419_103_a"><sup>a</sup></a> describes five kinds of magnet: an Ethiopian; another from Magnesia, which borders on Macedonia and is on the traveller’s right as he makes for Volos from Boebe;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_103_b" id="target_note_LCL419_103_b"><sup>b</sup></a> a third from Hyettus in Boeotia; a fourth from the neighbourhood of Alexandria in the Troad; and a fifth from Magnesia in Asia Minor. The most important distinction is between the male and female varieties,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_103_c" id="target_note_LCL419_103_c"><sup>c</sup></a> while the next lies in their colour. Those found in the Magnesia that is close to Macedonia are red and black, whereas the Boeotian have more red than black in them. Those found in the Troad are black and female, and therefore exert no force,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_103_c" id="target_note_LCL419_103_c"><sup>c</sup></a> while the most worthless kind is that of Magnesia in Asia Minor, which is white, has no power of attracting iron and resembles pumice.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_103_d" id="target_note_LCL419_103_d"><sup>d</sup></a> It has been ascertained that, the bluer a magnet is, the better it is. The palm goes to the Ethiopian variety, which in the market is worth its weight in silver. It is found in the sandy district of Ethiopia known as Zmiris. There, too, is found the haematite magnet, which is blood-red in colour and, when ground, produces not only blood-red
but also saffron-yellow powder.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_103_e" id="target_note_LCL419_103_e"><sup>e</sup></a> But haematite has not the same property of attracting iron as the magnet. The test of an Ethiopian magnet is its
