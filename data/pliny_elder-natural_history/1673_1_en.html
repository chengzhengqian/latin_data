<p>LXI. Sabine herb, called brathy by the Greeks, is of<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Savin.</span></span> two kinds. One has a leaf like that of the tamarisk, the other like that of the cypress, for which reason some have called it the Cretan cypress. Many use it instead of frankincense for fumigations; in medicines moreover a double dose is said to be equivalent in strength to a single dose of cinnamon. It reduces gatherings and checks corroding sores; an application cleanses ulcers, and used as a pessary or for fumigation it brings away the dead foetus. With honey it is used as an ointment for erysipelas and carbuncles; taken in wine it cures jaundice. By fumigation sabine herb is said to cure the pip in chickens.</p>
<p>LXII. Like this sabine herb is the plant called selago<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Selago.</span></span>
It is gathered without iron with the right hand, thrust under the tunic through the left arm-hole, as though the gatherer were thieving.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL393_75_aa" id="target_note_LCL393_75_aa"><sup>a</sup></a> He should be clad in white, and have bare feet washed clean; before gathering he should make a sacrificial offering of bread and wine. The plant is carried in a new napkin. The Druids of Gaul have recorded that it should be kept on the person to ward off all fatalities, and that the smoke of it is good for all diseases of the eyes.</p>
<p>LXIII. The same authorities have called samolus<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Samolus.</span></span>
(brook-weed) a plant growing in moist regions,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL393_75_b" id="target_note_LCL393_75_b"><sup>b</sup></a> which (they say) is to be gathered with the left hand
