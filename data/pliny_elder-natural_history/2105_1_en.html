<p>XV. Sneezing caused by a feather relieves a<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Sneezing.</span></span> cold in the head, and sneezing and hiccough are relieved by touching with the lips, it is said, the nostrils of a mule. For sneezing Varro advises us to scratch the palm of each hand with the other; most people advise us to transfer the ring from the left
