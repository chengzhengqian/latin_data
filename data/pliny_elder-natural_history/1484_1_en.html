called stoebe. Hippopheos<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL392_229_aa" id="target_note_LCL392_229_aa"><sup>a</sup></a> has prickly joints. A peculiar characteristic of the caltrop is that it has also a prickly fruit.</p>
<p>LV. Of all these kinds the best known is the<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Nettles.</span></span> nettle, often taller than two cubits, the cups of which in blossom pour out a purple down.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL392_229_b" id="target_note_LCL392_229_b"><sup>b</sup></a> There are several different kinds. There is the wild, also called female, and the cultivated. One of the wild varieties, called dog nettle, has a sharper sting, even the stem pricking, and fringed leaves. Another, which also gives out a smell, is called the Herculanean nettle.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL392_229_c" id="target_note_LCL392_229_c"><sup>c</sup></a> All nettles have a copious, black seed. It is a strange thing that, without any prickly points, the mere down is poisonous, and that only a light touch at once causes to arise itching and blisters like those from burns. The well-known remedy for nettle sting is olive oil. The stinging quality however does not come at once with the plant itself, but only when this has grown strong through the sun. When young indeed in the spring nettles make a not unpleasant food, which many eat in the further devout belief that it will keep diseases away throughout the whole year. The root too of the wild varieties makes more tender all meat with which it is boiled. The harmless nettle, which does not sting, is called lamium. About scorpio I shall speak when I come to deal with medicinal plants.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL392_229_d" id="target_note_LCL392_229_d"><sup>d</sup></a></p>

Pliny seems to have used both names. Theovertex phrastus, IX. 15, 6, says that hippophaes is a drug made from tithymallos, but Hort suspects the text.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL392_229_aa').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL392_229_b"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL392_229_b" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">b</sup>Not of course the stinging <span class="italic">lanugo</span> mentioned later on.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL392_229_b').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL392_229_c"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL392_229_c" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">c</sup>Unidentified, as all nettles have either a slight smell or none at all.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL392_229_c').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL392_229_d"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL392_229_d" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">d</sup>XXII. § 39.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL392_229_d').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
