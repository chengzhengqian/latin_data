As to this cucumber itself, those who sing its praises<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Varieties of cucumber.</span></span> tell us that the best variety grows in Arabia, and the next best in Arcadia; some report that in Cyrene grows a cucumber like the heliotrope, of the<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Wild cucumber.</span></span> size of a walnut, appearing between the leaves and the branches; its seed is curled back like a scorpion’s tail but white in colour. Moreover, some call this cucumber “scorpion”; both its seed and elaterium are most effective antidotes to the sting of the scorpion.
