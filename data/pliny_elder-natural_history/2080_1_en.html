from Sardinia, is only used for white fabrics, and is of no use for cloths of various colours; it is the cheapest of all the Cimolus kinds; more valuable are the Umbrian and the one called ‘rock.’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL394_407_a" id="target_note_LCL394_407_a"><sup>a</sup></a> The peculiarity of the latter is that it increases in size when it is steeped in liquid; consequently it is sold by weight, whereas Umbrian is sold by measure. Umbrian earth is only employed for giving lustre to cloths. It will not be out of place to touch on this part of the subject also, as a Metilian law referring to fullers still stands, the law which Gaius Flaminius and Lucius Aemilius as censors put forward<span class="marginNote right">220 <span class="sc">b.c.</span></span> to be carried in parliament: so careful about everything were our ancestors.
