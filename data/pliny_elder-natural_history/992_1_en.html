There was also a fig-tree in front of the temple of Saturn, which in 404 <span class="sc">b.c.,</span> after a sacrifice had been offered by the Vestal Virgins, was removed, because it was upsetting a statue of Silvanus. A tree of the same kind that was self-sown lives in the middle of the forum, at the spot where, when the foundations of the Empire were collapsing in portent of disaster, Curtius had filled up the gulf<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL370_343_a" id="target_note_LCL370_343_a"><sup>a</sup></a> with the greatest of treasures, I mean virtue and piety and a glorious death. Likewise self-sown is a vine in the same locality, and there is an olive planted by the care of the populace for the sake of the shade; an altar in the forum was removed on the occasion of the gladiatorial show given by his late Majesty Julius, the most recent one that fought in the forum.</p>

A remarkable fact about the fig is that this<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Fig-growing caprification.</span></span> alone among all the fruits hastens to ripen with a rapidity due to the skill of nature. There is a wild variety of fig called the goat-fig which never ripens, but bestows on another tree what it has not got itself, since it is a natural sequence of causation, just as from things that decay something is generated. Consequently this fig engenders gnats<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL370_343_b" id="target_note_LCL370_343_b"><sup>b</sup></a> which, being cheated out of nutriment in their mother tree, fly away from its decaying rottenness to the kindred tree<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL370_343_c" id="target_note_LCL370_343_c"><sup>c</sup></a> and by repeatedly nibbling at the figs—that
