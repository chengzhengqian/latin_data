They say that the fumes of their<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL418_235_a" id="target_note_LCL418_235_a"><sup>a</sup></a> burning feathers chase serpents away, and that those who carry about them a vulture’s heart are protected not only from the attacks of serpents, but also from those of wild beasts, bandits, and angry potentates.</p>
<p>XXV. The flesh of chickens, torn away and applied<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">chickens.</span></span> warm to the bite, overcomes the venom of serpents, as will also a chicken’s brain taken in wine. The Parthians prefer to put on the wound the brain of a hen. Chicken broth also, taken by the mouth, is a splendid remedy, being wonderfully good for many other purposes. Panthers and lions do not touch those rubbed over with this broth, especially if garlic has been boiled in it. A rather powerful purge is the broth of an old cock, which is also good for prolonged fevers, paralysed and palsied limbs, diseases of the joints, headaches, eye-fluxes, flatulence, loss of appetite, incipient tenesmus, complaints of liver, kidneys, and bladder, indigestion and asthma. And so instructions even are current for making it: they tell us that it is more effective boiled with sea-cabbage,
or tunny-fish, or caper, or celery, or the herb mercury, with polypodium or dill, but most beneficial when three congii of water are boiled down to three heminae, with the above-mentioned herbs, cooled in the open air and administered, the best time being when an emetic has preceded. I will not pass over a marvel, though it has nothing to do with medicine: if the limbs of hens are stirred up in melted gold they absorb it all into themselves, so violent a poison of gold is chicken. But cocks themselves do not crow if they have a collar of gold shavings round their necks.</p>
