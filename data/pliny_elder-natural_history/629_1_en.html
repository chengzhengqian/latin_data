<p>The sea-urchin, which has spines instead of feet,<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">The echinus.</span></span> belongs to the same genus. These creatures can only go forward by rolling over and over, and consequently they are often found with their prickles worn off. Those of them with the longest spines are called <span class="italic">echinus cidaris</span>, and the smallest are called cups. They have not all the same transparent colour: in the district of Torone some are born white, with a small spine. The eggs of all have a bitter taste; they are laid in clutches of five. Their mouths are in the middle of their body, on the under side. It is said that they can forecast a rough sea and that they take the precaution of clutching stones and steadying their mobility by the weight: they do not want to wear away their spines by rolling about. When sailors see them doing this they at once secure their vessels with more anchors.</p>

<p>Sea-scallops are held to belong to the same class, which also retire into hiding at seasons of extreme cold and extreme heat; and piddocks, which shine as if with fire in dark places, even in the mouth of persons eating them.</p>
<p>LII. We now come to the purples and the<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Purples and other shell-fish.</span></span> varieties of shell-fish, which have a stronger shell. The latter display in great variety nature’s love of sport: they show so many differences of colour, and also of shape—being flat, hollow, long, crescent-shaped, circular, semi-circular, humped, smooth, wrinkled, serrated, furrowed; with the crest bent
