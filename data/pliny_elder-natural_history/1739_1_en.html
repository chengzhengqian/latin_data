four kinds of it: one with round tubers on the root, and with leaves partly like those of the mallow and partly like those of ivy, but darker and softer: the second is the male plant,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL393_207_a" id="target_note_LCL393_207_a"><sup>a</sup></a> with a long root of four fingers’ length, thick as a walking-stick; the third is very long and as slender as a young vine, with especially strong properties, and is called by some clematitis and by other cretica. All kinds of this plant are of the colour of boxwood, and have small stems and purple blossom. They bear small berries like caper berries. Only the root has medicinal value. There is also a fourth kind, called plistolochia, more slender than the one last mentioned, with dense, hair-like masses for a root, and of the thickness of a stoutish rush, which some surname polyrrhizos. All kinds have a drug-like smell, but that of the rather long<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL393_207_ba" id="target_note_LCL393_207_ba"><sup>b</sup></a> and slender root is more agreeable; its fleshy outer skin in fact is even suitable for nard ointments. These plants grow on plains with a rich soil. The time to dig them up is at harvest; the earth is scraped off them before they are stored away.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL393_207_c" id="target_note_LCL393_207_c"><sup>c</sup></a> The most valued root, however, comes from Pontus, and in every case the heaviest specimens are preferred; for medicines the round is more suitable, for snake bites the longer
