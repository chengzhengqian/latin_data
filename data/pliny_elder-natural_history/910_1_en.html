Shrubs and trees also grow at the bottom of<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Submarine vegetation.</span></span> the sea—those in the Mediterranean being of smaller size, for the Red Sea and the whole of the Eastern Ocean are filled with forests.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL370_179_a" id="target_note_LCL370_179_a"><sup>a</sup></a> The Latin language has no name for what the Greeks call phycos,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL370_179_b" id="target_note_LCL370_179_b"><sup>b</sup></a> as our word alga denotes a herbaceous sea-plant, whereas the phycos is a shrub. It has a broad leaf and is coloured green; and it produces a growth one of the Greek names for which means ‘leek-weed’ and the other ‘bind-weed.’ Another variety of the same shrub has a hair-like leaf resembling fennel, and grows on rocks, while the one above grows in shallow water near the coast; both kinds shoot in spring-time and die off in autumn. The phycos growing on rocks round the island of Crete is also used for a purple dye; the most approved kind being that growing on the northern side of the island, as is the case in regard to sponges. A third variety resembles a grass; its root is knotted, and so is its stalk, like the stalk of a reed.</p>
<p>XLIX. Another group of shrubs is called bryon,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL370_179_c" id="target_note_LCL370_179_c"><sup>c</sup></a> which has the leaf of a lettuce only more wrinkled.

The oak is reported to provide a dye for woollen fabrics, and some in deep water are actually said to bear acorns, these facts having been ascertained by shipwrecked persons and by divers. Also other very large marine trees are reported in the neighbourhood of Sicyon—for the sea-vine<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL370_179_e" id="target_note_LCL370_179_e"><sup>e</sup></a> grows
