It is not important to mention the colours and<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Varieties of coloured marbles.</span></span> species of marbles when they are so well known, nor is it easy to list them when they are so numerous. For there are few places for which a characteristic marble is not found to exist. Even so, the most famous kinds have already been mentioned, along with the peoples whose names they bear, in the course<span class="marginNote right">e.g. iv. 67; V. 22.</span> of our circuit of the world. Not all of them occur in quarries, but many are found scattered also beneath the earth’s surface, some indeed being very valuable, like the green Lacedaemonian,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_43_d" id="target_note_LCL419_43_d"><sup>d</sup></a> which is brighter than any other marble, or the Augustean and, more recently, the Tiberian, which were found in Egypt for the first time during the principates of Augustus and<span class="marginNote right">27 <span class="sc">b.c.–a.d.</span> 14; <span class="sc">a.d.</span> 14–37.</span>
