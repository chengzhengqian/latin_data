<p>XVI. Night birds also have hooked talons, for<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">owls.</span></span> instance the little owl, the eagle-owl and the screech-owl. All of these are dim-sighted in the daytime. The eagle-owl is a funereal bird, and is regarded as an extremely bad omen, especially at public auspices; it inhabits deserts and places that are not merely unfrequented but terrifying and inaccessible; a wierd creature of the night, its cry is not a musical note but a scream. Consequenlty when seen in cities or by daylight in any circumstances it is a direful portent; but I know several cases of its having perched on the houses of private persons without fatal consequences. It never flies in the direction where it wants to go, but travels slantwise out of its course.

What this bird was I cannot discover, and it is not recorded. Some persons give this interpretation, that the fire-bird was any bird that was seen carrying a coal from an altar or altar-table; others call it a ‘spinturnix,’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL353_315_c" id="target_note_LCL353_315_c"><sup>c</sup></a> but I have not found anybody who professes to know what particular species of bird that is.
