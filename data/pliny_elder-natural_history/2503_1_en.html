is colourless, but describes it as ‘containing a twinkling star.’ He mentions that there are also to be found dull ‘cerauniae’ which if steeped in soda and vinegar for several days form such a star, which, however, fades away again after as many months. Sotacus distinguishes also two other varieties of the stone, a black and a red, resembling axe-heads. According to him, those among them that are black and round are supernatural objects; and he states that thanks to them cities and fleets are attacked and overcome, their name being ‘baetuli,’ while the elongated stones are ‘cerauniae.’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_275_a" id="target_note_LCL419_275_a"><sup>a</sup></a> These writers distinguish yet another kind of ‘ceraunia’ which is quite rare.

and is sometimes called ‘root of crystal’ for this reason. It is known as ‘iris’ in token of its appearance, for when it is struck by the sunlight in a room it casts the appearance and colours of a rainbow on the walls near by, continually altering its tints and ever causing more and more astonishment because of its extremely changeable effects. It is agreed that it has hexagonal faces, like the rock-crystal,
