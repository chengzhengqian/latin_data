<p>XXXI. There is another tree with the same name,<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">The citron.</span></span> bearing fruit which some people abhor for its scent
and bitter taste while other people are fond of it; this wood is also used for decorating houses, but it does not need further description.</p>
<p>XXXII. Africa also, where it faces in our direction,<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">The African nettle-tree, producing fruit and wine.</span></span> produces a remarkable tree, the lotus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL370_161_a" id="target_note_LCL370_161_a"><sup>a</sup></a> called in the vernacular <span class="italic">celthis,</span> which also has been naturalized in Italy, though it has been altered by the change of
soil. The finest lotus is found round the Syrtes and
the district of the Nasamones. It is the size of a
pear, although Cornelius Nepos states that it is a<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Fr. 20 Halm.</span></span>
short fruit. The incisions in the leaf resemble those
in the holm-oak, except that they are more numerous.
There are several varieties of lotus, differing chiefly
in their fruits. This one is the size of a bean and
saffron-coloured, but it changes colour several times
before it is ripe, like grapes. It grows in thick
clusters on the branches like myrtle-berries and not
like cherries as it does in Italy; in its own country
it is so sweet to eat that it has even given its name to
a race of people<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL370_161_b" id="target_note_LCL370_161_b"><sup>b</sup></a> and to a land which is too
hospitable to strangers who come there, making them
forget their native land. It is reported that chewing
this lotus prevents gastric diseases. The better kind
has no stone inside it, those of the other variety having
a kernel of a bony appearance. Also a wine is
pressed from this fruit that resembles mead, which
again according to Nepos will not keep for more than
ten days; he states that the berries are chopped
up with wheat and stored in casks for food. Indeed
we are told that armies have been fed on this while
