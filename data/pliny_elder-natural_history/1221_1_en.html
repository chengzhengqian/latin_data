<p>‘Hard’ flour<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL371_247_a" id="target_note_LCL371_247_a"><sup>a</sup></a> is made from hard wheat, the most highly esteemed coming from Africa. A fair return is half a peck from a peck with five sixteenths of special flour—that is the name given in the case of hard wheat to what in common wheat is called the ‘flower’; this is used in copper works and paper mills—and in addition four sixteenths of second quality flour and the same amount of bran, but from a peck of ‘hard’ flour 22 pounds of bread and from a peck of flower of wheat 16 pounds. The price for this when the market rate is moderate is 40 asses a peck for flour, 8 asses more for ‘hard’ flour and twice as much for bolted common wheat. There is also another distinction, that when bolted a single time it gives 17 pounds of bread, when twice 18, when three times 19⅓, and 2½ pounds of second quality bread, the same amount of shorts and six sixteenths of bran.</p>

But it is less exposed to danger in the straw than other cereals, because it always has the ear on a straight stalk and it does not hold dew to cause rust. Best emmer makes the sweetest bread; the grain itself is of closer fibre than ordinary emmer and the ear is at once larger and heavier: a peck of the grain seldom fails to make 16 pounds. In Greece it is difficult to thresh and consequently Homer<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL371_247_b" id="target_note_LCL371_247_b"><sup>b</sup></a> speaks of it as being fed to cattle—for his word <span class="italic">olyra</span> means this grain;
