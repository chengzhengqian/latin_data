frost. Pisa rejoices in the vine of Paros, and Modena in the vine of Perugia, which has a black grape and makes a wine that within four years turns white. It is a remarkable fact that at Modena there is a grape that turns round with the sun and is consequently called in Greek the ‘revolving grape’; and that in Italy a grape from Gaul is popular, but across the Alps that of Picenum. Virgil mentions a Thasian<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Georgies</span> II. 91.</span>
vine, a Maraeotid and a Lagean, and a number of other foreign kinds that are not found in Italy.</p>
<p>But again there are some vines which are distinguished<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Vines grown for fruit.</span></span> for their grapes and not for their wine, for instance, among the hard-berry group the ambrosia grape, which needs no jars but will keep on the vine, so strong is its resistance to cold and heat and to bad weather, nor does it require a tree or stakes to support it, as it sustains its own weight, though this is not the case with the dactylis, the stalk of which is only the thickness of a finger; and among the vines with large bunches the pigeon-vine, and still more the purple ‘double-bosomed’ vine, so called because it does not bear clusters but only secondary bunches; and also the ‘three-foot’ vine, named from its size, and also the ‘rush’ vine with its shrivelled grape and the vine called the Raetic vine in the Maritime Alps, which is quite unlike the famous vine of that name, because this is a short-stalked vine with closely packed clusters and producing a low class of wine; but it has the thinnest skin of any grape, and a single very small stone (called chium), and one or two grapes in each bunch are exceptionally large. There is also the black Aminean grape to which they give the name of ‘Syrian grape,’ and also the Spanish grape, which is the most highly rated of the inferior kinds.</p>
