three oboli in one cyathus of old wine, is good for disorders of the spleen, as is the root in honey wine of all kinds of panaces, but best of all is teucria, dried and taken in drink by boiling down to one hemina<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL393_321_a" id="target_note_LCL393_321_a"><sup>a</sup></a> a handful of it with three heminae of vinegar. In vinegar it is also used as a liniment, or, if that cannot be borne, in figs or water. Polemonia is taken in wine, or a drachma of betony in three cyathi of oxymel, or aristolochia as used for snake bite. Argemonia, taken in food on seven consecutive days, is said to reduce the spleen, and so are two oboli of agaric in oxymel. It is reduced also by the root of nymphaea heraclia taken in wine or by itself. Cissanthemus,
if a drachma is taken twice daily in two cyathi of white wine for forty days, is said to carry off the spleen gradually in the urine. Useful too is a decoction of hyssop with fig, or of the root of lonchitis before it sheds its seed, while a decoction of root of peucedanum is good for both spleen and kidneys. The spleen is reduced by the juice of acoron taken by the mouth—the roots are very useful for trouble of the hypochondria and groin<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL393_321_b" id="target_note_LCL393_321_b"><sup>b</sup></a>—by the seed of clymenus taken in drink for thirty days, the dose being a denarius by weight in white wine, by powdered betony taken in honey and squill vinegar, and by root of lonchitis in water. Teucrium<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL393_321_c" id="target_note_LCL393_321_c"><sup>c</sup></a> is used as liniment, likewise scordium with wax, or agaric with powdered fenugreek.</p>
