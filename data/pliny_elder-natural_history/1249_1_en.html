crop has been sown is badly ploughed: the ground will only have been worked properly where it is impossible to tell in which of two opposite directions the share went. It is also usual to make intermediate runnels by means of a larger furrow, if the place requires this, for these to draw off the water into the ditches.</p>

follows the harrowing of clods with a framework or a rake where circumstances require it, and, where local custom allows, this second breaking is also repeated after the seed has been sown, by means of a harrow-framework or with a board attached to the plough covering up the seeds—this process is called ridging; if they are not covered, this is ‘unridging’—the original use of the word that means ‘raving’.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL371_303_a" id="target_note_LCL371_303_a"><sup>a</sup></a> Virgil when he said that the best crop is one that<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Georg</span>.

Where the soil is rather dense, as it usually is in Italy, it is better to plough five times before sowing, but in Tuscany nine times. With beans and vetch however it is a labour-saving plan involving no loss to dispense with preliminary breaking before sowing.</p>
