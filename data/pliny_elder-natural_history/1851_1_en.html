this account of chrysolachanum is inadequate, yet I find no more detail given, for a further fault of which our modern herbalists, at least, are guilty is that they have described but briefly, and even by a mere name, plants well known to themselves just as if these were generally familiar. They say, for instance, that coagulum terrae (earth rennet) is constipating<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL393_431_a" id="target_note_LCL393_431_a"><sup>a</sup></a> and diuretic<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL393_431_b" id="target_note_LCL393_431_b"><sup>b</sup></a> if taken in water or wine, and that</p>
<p>(XLIV) the pounded leaves of cucullus with vinegar cure the bites of serpents and the stings of scorpions. Some give this plant another name, strumus, others the Greek name of strychnus. It has black berries; a cyathus of juice from these, with two of honey wine, is good treatment for lumbago, as also for headache if used with rose oil for bathing the brow, while for scrofulous sores the plant itself is applied locally.</p>
<p>XLV. Conferva is peculiar to running streams,<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Conferva.</span></span> Alpine in particular, so named from <span class="italic">conferuminare,</span> to solder together. It is more like a fresh-water sponge than a moss or vascular plant, being a hairy, dense, and porous mass. To my knowledge a man who, pruning a very high tree, fell and broke nearly all his bones, was treated with this plant. His entire body was enveloped in it; whenever it dried it was sprinkled with its native water but rarely taken off, only in fact for renewals when the plant lost its strength. The patient recovered in an almost incredibly short time.</p>
<p>XLVI. The Cnidian grain has the colour of kermes-red,<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Coccus Cnidius.</span></span>
and size is larger than a peppercorn. Its
heating properties are so great that it is swallowed in
bread, lest it should scorch the throat in its passage.
A sovereign remedy for hemlock poisoning, it also
checks looseness of the bowels.</p>
