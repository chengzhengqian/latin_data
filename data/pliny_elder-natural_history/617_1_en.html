The coast mullet also is not in favour. The most approved kind have the flavour of an oyster. This variety has the name of shoe-mullet, which Fenestella thinks was given it from its colour.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL353_207_a" id="target_note_LCL353_207_a"><sup>a</sup></a> It spawns three times a year—at all events that is the number of times that its fry is seen.
