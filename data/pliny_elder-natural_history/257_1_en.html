The only town of Phocis on the coast is Daphnus, but inland are Larisa, Elatea, and on the banks of the Cephisus, as we have said, Lilaea, and, facing Delphi, Cnemis and Hyampolis. Then there is the Locrian coast, on which are Larumna and Thronium, near which the river Boagrius flows into the sea, and the towns of Narycum, Alope and Scarphia. Afterwards comes the Malian Gulf<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL352_139_a" id="target_note_LCL352_139_a"><sup>a</sup></a> named from its inhabitants and on it are the towns of Halcyone, Aeconia and Phalara.</p>
<p>Then comes Doris, in which are Sperchios, Erineon, Boion, Pindus and Cytinum. In the rear of Doris is Mount Oeta.</p>
<p>There follows Haemonia, which has often changed its name, having been successively called Pelasgis or Pelasgic Argos, and Hellas, Thessaly and Dryopis, always taking its surname from its kings: it was the birthplace of the king named Graecus from whom Greece is named, and of king Hellen from whom the Hellenes get their name. These same people are called by three different names in Homer, Myrmidons, Hellenes and Achaeans. The section of the Hellenes adjacent to Doris are named Phthiotae; their towns are Akhino and Heraclea, which takes the name of Trechin<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL352_139_b" id="target_note_LCL352_139_b"><sup>b</sup></a> from the Pass of Thermopylae four miles away in the gorge of the river Ellada. Here is Mount Callidromus, and the notable towns are Hellas, Halos, Lamia, Phthia and Arne.</p>
<p>VIII. The places in Thessaly are Orchomenus,<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Thessaly.</span></span>
formerly called the Minyan, and the town of Alimon, otherwise Holmon, Atrax, Palamna, the Hyperian Spring, the towns of Pherae (behind which lies Pieria spreading in the direction of Macedonia),
