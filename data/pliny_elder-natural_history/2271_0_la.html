<p>Pliny, XXX, 128: <span class="italic">vel mortua mirum si sine adservata transcenderit gravida innoxium fieri si protinus transcendat adservatam.</span> A tentative effort towards a solution of this passage is given by Warmington as follows. The sentence began <span class="italic">vel mortuam mirum</span> but was continued, in erratic copying,
by a wrongly written clause (a) <span class="italic">si sine adservata transcenderit
gravida</span> which was then imperfectly corrected into another clause (b) <span class="italic">si protinus transcendat adservatam</span> written in the margin. This marginal correction (b) was later copied out in its right place while clause (a) was still retained. It is clause (a) which is really corrupt and superfluous, and it should be deleted; and the whole passage may then be read: <span class="italic">vel mortuam mirum innoxiam fieri si protinus adservatam transcendat gravida</span>: “Or a dead one, wonderful to relate, does no harm if a pregnant woman crosses it if it was preserved without delay.” Warmington suggests that a scribe began writing <span class="italic">mirum si sine mora adservatam transcendat</span> instead of <span class="italic">si protinus a. t.</span> At some later stage the intruded word <span class="italic">mora</span> was omitted but <span class="italic">sine</span> was still left in and <span class="italic">adservatam</span> was made into an ablative <span class="italic">adservata.</span> Thus <span class="italic">si protinus transcendat adservatam</span> or <span class="italic">si protinus adservatam transcendat</span> seems likely to be right. Anyhow to retain both clauses (a) and (b) seems intolerable; and (a) is more wrong than (b).</p>
