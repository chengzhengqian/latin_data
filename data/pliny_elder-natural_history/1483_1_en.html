<p>LIII. The Egyptians have besides many plants of no repute, but they hold in the highest esteem one called cnecos; it is unknown in Italy and the Egyptians value it, not as a food, but for its oil, which they extract from the seed. The chief varieties are the wild and the cultivated. Of the wild there are two species. One is similar to the cultivated, but has a stiff<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL392_227_a" id="target_note_LCL392_227_a"><sup>a</sup></a> stem. This is why the women of old used the stem of this species<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL392_227_b" id="target_note_LCL392_227_b"><sup>b</sup></a> as a distaff, for which reason it is called by some atractylis. Its seed is white, large and bitter. The other is rather prickly, with a more fleshy stem, which<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">prickly plants.</span></span> almost trails on the ground, the seed being very small. This belongs to the class of spinous plants, for I must classify also the various kinds of them.</p>
<p>LIV. Some plants then are prickly,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL392_227_c" id="target_note_LCL392_227_c"><sup>c</sup></a> while others are without prickles. Of prickly plants the species are many. Of nothing but prickle are asparagus and scorpio, for they have no leaves at all. Some prickly plants, however, have leaves, for instance thistle, erynge, glycyrrhiza<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL392_227_d" id="target_note_LCL392_227_d"><sup>d</sup></a> and nettle. For all these have a sharp sting in their leaves. Some have foliage also along<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL392_227_e" id="target_note_LCL392_227_e"><sup>e</sup></a> the prickly spine, as caltrop and rest-harrow. Some again have prickles not on the leaves but on the stem, as pheos, that some have
