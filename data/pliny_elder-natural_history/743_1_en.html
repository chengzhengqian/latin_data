acceptable to bees, perhaps because at that season
there is no other supply for them. Consequently
this honey-gathering is roughly in the period between
the end of vintage and the setting of the Pleiads on
November 13. Reason advises leaving two-thirds
of the honey then procured for the bees, and always
the parts of the combs that contain bee-bread. In<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Hibernation of bees.</span></span>
the sixty days from midwinter to the rising
Arcturus they live on sleep, without any food; in
the warmer period from the rising of Arcturus to the
spring equinox they now keep awake, but still keep
inside the hive and have recourse to the food kept
for this time. But in Italy they do the same after
the rising of the Pleiads, sleeping till then. Some<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Methods of taking honey.</span></span>
people in taking out the honey weigh the hives, so
separating the amount to be left behind. There is
indeed a bond of equity even in the case of bees,
and it is said that if the partnership is defrauded
the hives perish. Consequently it is one of the first
rules that people must wash themselves clean before
they take the honey; also bees hate scurf, and
women’s menstruation. When honey is being
removed it is very useful for the bees to be driven
away by smoke, so that they may not get angry or
greedily devour it themselves. Also denser smoke
is employed to arouse their sloth to their tasks, for
if they have not gone on incubating, the combs they
make are discoloured. On the other hand excessive
smoke kills them, as honey very quickly undergoes
deterioration if turned sour by the least touch of
moisture; and for this reason among the kinds of
honey there is a special sort called by the Greek
word meaning ‘smokeless.’</p>
