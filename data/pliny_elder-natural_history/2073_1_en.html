Near to the nature of sulphur is also that of<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Bitumer</span></span> bitumen.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL394_393_a" id="target_note_LCL394_393_a"><sup>a</sup></a> In some places it is a slime and others an earth, the slime being emitted, as we have said,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">V, 72.</span><span class="br"></span> from the lake<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL394_393_b" id="target_note_LCL394_393_b"><sup>b</sup></a> of Judaea and the earth being found in the neighbourhood of the seaside town of Sidon in Syria. Both of these varieties get thickened and solidify into a dense consistency.

The bitumen from Apollonia also is liquid, and all of these varieties are called by the Greeks <span class="italic">pissasphalt,</span> from its likeness to vegetable-pitch and bitumen. There is also an unctuous bitumen, of the consistency of oil, found in Sicily, in a spring at Girgenti, the stream from which is tainted by it.
