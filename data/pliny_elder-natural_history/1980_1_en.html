It is made by fusing copper and then transferring it to other furnaces, where a faster use of the bellows makes the metal give off layers like scales of millet, which are called the flower. However when the sheets of copper are cooled off in water they shed off other scales of copper of a similar red hue—this scale is called by the Greek word meaning ‘husk’—and
by this process the flower is adulterated, so that the scale is sold as a substitute for it. On the other hand, scale of copper is forcibly knocked off bolts into which are welded cakes of the metal, specially in the factories of Cyprus. The whole difference is that the scale is detached from the cakes by successive hammerings, whereas the flower falls off of its own accord. There is another finer kind of scale, the one knocked off from the down-like surface of the metal, the name for which is ‘stomoma.’</p>
