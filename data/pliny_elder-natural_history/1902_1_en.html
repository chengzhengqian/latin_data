We have in our own times seen the
Emperor Claudius’s wire Agrippina, at a show at which he was exhibiting a naval battle, seated at his side wearing a military cloak made entirely of cloth of gold.

<p>XX. On marble and other materials incapable of being raised to a white heat gold is laid with white of egg; on wood it is laid with glue according to a formula; it is called leucophorum, white-bearing; what this is and how it is made we will explain in its proper place. The regular way to gild copper <span class="marginNote right"><span class="sc">xxxv.</span> 36.</span> would be to use natural or at all events artificial quicksilver,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL394_51_b" id="target_note_LCL394_51_b"><sup>b</sup></a> concerning which a method of adulteration has been devised, as we shall relate in describing <span class="marginNote right">§§ 100. 125.</span> the nature of those substances. The copper is
first subjected to the violence of fire; then, when it is red hot, it is quenched with a mixture of brine, vinegar, and alum,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL394_51_c" id="target_note_LCL394_51_c"><sup>c</sup></a> and afterwards put to a test, its brilliance of colour showing whether it has been sufficiently heated; then it is again dried in the fire, so that, after a thorough polishing with a mixture of pumice and alum, it is able to take the gold-leaf laid on with quicksilver. Alum has the same cleansing<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">§ 60.</span><span class="br"></span> property here that we said is found in lead.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL394_51_d" id="target_note_LCL394_51_d"><sup>d</sup></a></p>
