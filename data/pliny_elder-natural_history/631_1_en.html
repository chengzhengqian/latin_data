what has it to do with our backs? Are we not content to feed on dangers without also being clothed with them? Is it that the rule that we get most satisfaction from luxuries costing a human life to procure holds good for the whole of our anatomy?</p>
<p>LIV. The first place therefore and the topmost<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Pearls.</span></span> rank among all things of price is held by pearls. These are sent chiefly by the Indian Ocean, among the huge and curious animals that we have described<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL353_235_a" id="target_note_LCL353_235_a"><sup>a</sup></a> as coming across all those seas over that wide expanse of lands from those burning heats of the sun.

Also if the sky is lowering (they say) the pearl is pale in colour: for it is certain that it was conceived from the sky, and that pearls have more connexion with the sky than with the sea, and derive from it a cloudy hue, or a clear one corresponding with a brilliant, morning.
