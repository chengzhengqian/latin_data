These must be kept on in the sun until the skin is violently irritated; then there must be fomentation and rubbing with oil, followed by another application. This treatment should be repeated for several days, but deep ulceration must be guarded against. For vitiligo of all kinds<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL418_357_b" id="target_note_LCL418_357_b"><sup>b</sup></a> they also recommend the application of flies with root of eupatoria, or the white part of hens’ dung kept in old oil in a horn box, or bat’s blood, or hedgehog’s gall in water.

These bones also, with the rennet of any quadruped, show a good result by the third day. Cantharides too are highly recommended, beaten up and applied with barley meal.</p>
