The flour of naked wheat boiled in vinegar is good for cramp; the bran moreover and rose oil, dried figs and sebesten plums, all boiled down, make a good gargle for tonsils and throat. Sextus Pomponius,
father of a man who was praetor, himself the most distinguished man<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL392_381_a" id="target_note_LCL392_381_a"><sup>a</sup></a> in Nearer Spain, was superintending the winnowing in his barns when he was seized with the pains of gout. Burying himself above his knees into the wheat he was relieved of the pain, and the water in his feet dried up in a wonderful way, so that afterwards he adopted this procedure as a remedy. The absorbent power of wheat is so great that it dries up casks full of liquid.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL392_381_b" id="target_note_LCL392_381_b"><sup>b</sup></a> Experienced authorities also prescribe the chaff of wheat or barley to be applied warm for hernia,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL392_381_c" id="target_note_LCL392_381_c"><sup>c</sup></a> and the water in which it has been boiled to be used for fomentations. There is to be found in emmer-wheat a little worm like the wood-worm. If this be plugged with wax into the hollow of a decayed tooth, it is said that the tooth comes out, or even if the affected part be rubbed with it. Olyra (two-grained wheat) is, as I have said,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL392_381_d" id="target_note_LCL392_381_d"><sup>d</sup></a> also called arinca. With a decoction of it a medicine is made which the Egyptians call athera, very beneficial for babies, though adults too use it as a liniment.</p>
