Menander husbands use the name as a term of abuse for their wives. It is injurious to the stomach. It so disturbs the bowels as to cause cholera<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL392_149_a" id="target_note_LCL392_149_a"><sup>a</sup></a> in some persons. It is said however to be good for scorpion stings when drunk in wine, for corns on the feet when applied in a liniment, and also, with oil, for diseases of the spleen and for pain in the temples. Used as a food it is thought by Hippocrates to check menstruation.</p>
<p>XCIV. Spignel is not grown in Italy except by<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">spignel.</span></span> medical men, and by very few of these. There are two kinds of it. The more famous is called Athamanticum
or Athamanicum, because, as some think, it was discovered by Athamas, or according to others because the most esteemed variety is found in Athamania. Its leaves are like those of anise, the stem being sometimes two feet high;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL392_149_b" id="target_note_LCL392_149_b"><sup>b</sup></a> it has many roots, slanting, dark, and occasionally deep, the plant being Jess red than the other kind. The root, pounded or boiled and taken in water, is diuretic, and wonderfully good for dispersing flatulence of the stomach, and also for griping and troubles of the bladder and of the womb. With honey it is applied to the joints, and an application with celery to the lower abdomen is diuretic for babies.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL392_149_c" id="target_note_LCL392_149_c"><sup>c</sup></a></p>
<p>XCV. Fennel has been made famous, as we have<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Fennel.</span></span> said,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL392_149_d" id="target_note_LCL392_149_d"><sup>d</sup></a> by serpents, which taste it to cast off their old skin and with its juice improve their eyesight. Consequently it has been inferred that by fennel juice especially can dimness of human vision also be removed. This juice is collected when the stem is swelling to bud, dried in the sun and applied in honey as an ointment. The most esteemed is gathered in Spain from the tear-drops of the plant.
