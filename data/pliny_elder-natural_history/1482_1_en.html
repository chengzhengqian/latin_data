boiled and chewed breaks up into spidery threads, but the stem itself is handsome, jutting out from leaves which, even when compared with those of trees, are very broad, similar to the leaves called personata<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL392_225_a" id="target_note_LCL392_225_a"><sup>a</sup></a> which are found in Italian rivers. So much do the people of the Nile appreciate the bounty of their river that they plait colocasia leaves into vessels of various shapes, which they consider make attractive goblets. The colocasia is now grown in Italy.</p>
<p>LII. In Egypt next in esteem after colocasia<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Chicory.</span></span> comes chicory, which I have spoken of as wild endive. It appears after the Pleiades<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL392_225_b" id="target_note_LCL392_225_b"><sup>b</sup></a> and its parts bloom in succession. It has a tough root, so that it is even used to make binding ropes. Farther from<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Other Egyptian plants.</span></span> the river grows anthalium, of the size and roundness of a medlar, without kernel or peel, and with the leaf of the cyperus.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL392_225_c" id="target_note_LCL392_225_c"><sup>c</sup></a> They roast it at a fire and eat it. They eat too oetum, which has few and very small leaves, but a large root. Arachidne indeed and aracos, though they have manifold, branchy roots, have neither leaf nor any green, nor anything else at all above ground. The rest of the plants commonly included by the Egyptians among their foods are thus named:—chondrylla, hypochoeris, caucalis, enthryscum, scandix, called by some tragopogon,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL392_225_d" id="target_note_LCL392_225_d"><sup>d</sup></a> which has leaves very like those of saffron, parthenium, trychnum, corchorus, aphace and achynops, the last two appearing just after the equinox. There is a plant called epipetron which never blossoms. But on the other hand aphace, as its flowers fade, puts forth continually others all the winter and all the spring, right on into summer.</p>
