<p>XXIX. Chalcitis, ‘copper-stone,’ is the name of<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Chalcitis.</span></span> an ore,a that from which copper also, besides <span class="italic">cadmea</span>,
is obtained by smelting. It differs from <span class="italic">cadmea</span> because the latter is quarried above ground, from rocks exposed to the air, whereas chalcitis is obtained from underground beds, and also because chalcitis becomes immediately friable, being of a soft nature, so as to have the appearance of congealed down. There is also another difference in that chalcitis contains three kinds of mineral, copper, <span class="italic">misy</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL394_215_b" id="target_note_LCL394_215_b"><sup>b</sup></a> and <span class="italic">sori,</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL394_215_c" id="target_note_LCL394_215_c"><sup>c</sup></a> each of which we shall describe in its place;<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">§§ 120, 121.</span><span class="br"></span> and the veins of copper in it are of an oblong shape. The approved variety of chalcitis is honey coloured, and streaked with fine veins, and is friable and not stony. It is also thought to be more useful when fresh, as when old it turns into <span class="italic">sori.</span> It is used for growths in ulcers, for arresting hæmorrhage and, in the form of a powder, for acting as an astringent on the gums, uvula and tonsils, and, applied in wool, as a pessary for affections of the uterus, while with leek juice it is employed in plasters for the genitals. It is steeped for forty days in vinegar in an earthenware jar, covered with dung, and then assumes the colour of saffron; then an equal weight of <span class="italic">cadmea</span> is mixed with it and this produces the drug called psoricon or cure for itch. If two parts of chalcitis are mixed with one of <span class="italic">cadmea</span> this makes a stronger form of the same drug, and moreover it is more violent if it is mixed in vinegar than if in wine; and when roasted it becomes more effective for all the same purposes.</p>
