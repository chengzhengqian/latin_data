parching, that is an infallible sign. But so great is the necessary strain on the eyes that pain results. To avoid this strain they have recourse to other tests. They dig a hole to the depth of five feet, covering it with jars of unbaked potters’ clay, or else with a well-oiled bronze basin, and also a burning lamp arched over with foliage and earth on top; if the clay is found to be wet or broken, or if moisture covers the bronze, or the lamp goes out without any failure of oil, or perchance a flock of wool is wet,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL418_407_a" id="target_note_LCL418_407_a"><sup>a</sup></a> then the finding of water is assured. Some also light a fire first and dry the hole, making yet more conclusive the evidence of the vessels.</p>
