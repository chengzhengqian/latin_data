with egg, each beaten up with its shell, allowed to simmer in a new vessel with salt, two cyathi of raisin wine or date juice, and three cyathi of water; this preparation is taken in drink. Snails are also beneficial when burnt, and their ash taken in wine with a small piece of resin. Snails without shells, about which I have spoken<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL418_315_a" id="target_note_LCL418_315_a"><sup>a</sup></a>—they are found chiefly in Africa—are very useful in dysentery; five are burnt and taken with half a denarius by weight of gum acacia; of this ash two spoonfuls are given in myrtle wine or any dry wine with an equal quantity of hot water. Some, using all African snails, administer according to this recipe; others prefer to inject the same number of African snails or broad snails,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL418_315_b" id="target_note_LCL418_315_b"><sup>b</sup></a> adding if the flux is severe gum acacia of the size of a bean. The cast slough of snakes is boiled down with rose oil for dysentery and tenesmus in a pewter vessel; if in any other kind of vessel, the application must be made with the help of pewter. Chicken broth is good for these two complaints, but broth made with an old cock, thoroughly salted, is purgative. A hen’s crop, roasted and given in oil and salt, soothes the pains of coeliac troubles—but previously hen and patient must both abstain from cereals<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL418_315_c" id="target_note_LCL418_315_c"><sup>c</sup></a>—as does dove’s dung roasted and taken in drink. The flesh of a wood-pigeon boiled in vinegar is good for dysentery and for coeliac troubles; for dysentery too a thrush roasted with myrtle berries, so are blackbirds and honey in which bees have died.</p>
