disgraceful reason for this scanty knowledge is that even those who possess it refuse to teach it, just as though they would themselves lose what they have imparted to others. To this must be added that there is no sure method of discovery; for even of those we already know chance has sometimes been the finder; at other times, to speak the truth, the discoverer was a god. Down to recent years there has been no cure for the bite of a mad dog, a symptom of which is dread of water and aversion to drink of any kind. Recently the mother of a man serving in the praetorian guard saw in a dream how she sent<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL393_149_a" id="target_note_LCL393_149_a"><sup>a</sup></a> to her son to be taken in drink the root of the wild rose, called cynorrhodon, which by its appearance had<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Cynorrhodon and hydrophobia.</span></span>
