(heath), comparing it to the brooms of Ameria. He says that boiled in wine, beaten up with honey, and applied to cancerous sores it heals them. Some authorities consider it to be the same as tamarice. But it is specific for splenic trouble if its juice is extracted and drunk in wine; so wonderful do they make out its antipathy to be to this internal organ, and to this only, that they affirm that if pigs drink out of troughs made of this wood they are found to be without a spleen. And for that reason they give to a man also, if he has an enlarged spleen, food and drink in vessels made of tamarisk. A respected medical authority, moreover, has asserted that a twig, broken off from it without its touching the ground or iron, relieves belly-ache, if it be so applied as to be pressed to the body by the tunic and the girdle.

The pounded bark is given for the spitting of blood and for excessive menstruation, also to sufferers from coeliac disease.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL393_53_ba" id="target_note_LCL393_53_ba"><sup>b</sup></a> An application of
