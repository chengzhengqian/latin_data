Philo; and that, because the king greatly admired it, a statue 4 cubits high was later made of peridot in honour of this Ptolemy’s wife, Arsinoe, and consecrated in the shrine which was named after her the Arsinoeum. Our most recent authorities assert that the stone is found also near Alabastrum, a town in the Thebaid, and divide it into two varieties, the ‘prasoides,’
or ‘leek-like,’ and the ‘chrysopteros,’ or ‘golden-feathered,’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_253_b" id="target_note_LCL419_253_b"><sup>b</sup></a> of which the latter resembles the ‘chrysoprasus.’ In general, the colour tends to resemble<span class="marginNote right">§ 113.</span>

Also, it is the only precious stone that is affected by an iron file, whereas all others have to be smoothed with Naxian stone<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_253_c" id="target_note_LCL419_253_c"><sup>c</sup></a> and emery.

It is of exceptional size, but is porous and full of flaws. A far purer and finer stone is found in Carmania.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_253_da" id="target_note_LCL419_253_da"><sup>d</sup></a> In both localities, however, ‘callaina’ occurs amidst inaccessible icy crags, where it is seen as an eye-shaped swelling loosely adhering to the rocks, as
