More useful is the foam of a horse, or fresh horse-dung reduced to ash and mixed with rose-oil, fresh butter, beef suet with goose grease, she-goat’s or bull’s urine, or that used by fullers, stale, and warmed until the steam rises up the neck of the jar (a third part of vinegar is added and little myrrh), the dung, mixed with the gall, of a calf that has not tasted grass added to the slough of snakes, the ears being first warmed; these medicaments are inserted into the ears on wool. Beneficial is also veal suet, with goose grease and juice of ocimum; the marrow of a calf mixed with pounded cummin and poured into the ear; and for ear pains the seminal fluid of a hog, caught<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL418_121_b" id="target_note_LCL418_121_b"><sup>b</sup></a> as it drips from a sow before it can touch the ground; for fractures of the ears the glue made from the genitals of calves and melted in water; for other affections the fat of foxes, goat’s gall with warm rose-oil or with leek juice, or, if any part of the ear has been ruptured, with woman’s milk; if there is hardness of hearing, ox gall with the urine of a goat, male or female, or if there is pus. But whatever the use may be, it is thought that these remedies are more efficacious if they are smoke-dried for twenty days in a goat’s horn. Another approved treatment is a third of a denarius of hare’s rennet and half a denarius of sacopenium in Amminean wine. Parotid swellings are reduced by bear’s grease with an equal weight of wax and bull suet (some add hypocisthis), and an application of butter by itself after previous fomentation with a decoction
