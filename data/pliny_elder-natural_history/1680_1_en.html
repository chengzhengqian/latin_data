<p>LXXIV. A second kind of bramble, on which a rose grows, produces a little round growth like a chestnut, an excellent remedy for the stone. It is different from the dog-rose, about which I shall speak<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL393_89_a" id="target_note_LCL393_89_a"><sup>a</sup></a> in the next book.</p>
<p>The cynosbatos is called by some cynapanxis, by others neurospastos. It has a leaf like a man’s foot-print. It also bears a black cluster, in the berry of which it has a string, whence the whole shrub is called neurospastos.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL393_89_b" id="target_note_LCL393_89_b"><sup>b</sup></a> It is different from the caper that the physicians have called cynosbatos. The stalk<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL393_89_c" id="target_note_LCL393_89_c"><sup>c</sup></a> of this, pickled in vinegar, is chewed as a remedy for affections of the spleen and for flatulence. The string of it chewed up with Chian mastic cleanses the mouth. The rose-blossom of brambles with axle-grease clears away mange; the berries mixed with oil of unripe grapes dye the hair. The blossom of the blackberry is gathered at harvest-time. The white blossom taken in wine is excellent for pleurisy and also for coeliac affections. The root, boiled down to one-third, checks looseness of the bowels and haemorrhage; the decoction also makes a wash that strengthens the teeth. With the same juice are fomented sores of the anus and of the genitals. The ash from the root replaces a relaxed uvula.</p>
<p>LXXV. The Idaean bramble was so called because no other grows on Mount Ida. It is, however, more delicate than other brambles and smaller, with the canes farther apart and less prickly; it grows under the shade of trees. The blossom of it with honey is applied to fluxes of the eyes and to erysipelas, and in water it is given as a drink to patients with disordered stomachs<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL393_89_d" id="target_note_LCL393_89_d"><sup>d</sup></a>; its other properties are the same as those mentioned above.</p>
