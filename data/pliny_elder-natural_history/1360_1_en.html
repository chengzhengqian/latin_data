of all the seasonings which gratify<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL371_525_a" id="target_note_LCL371_525_a"><sup>a</sup></a> a fastidious taste, cummin is the most agreeable. It grows on the surface of the ground, hardly adhering to the soil and stretching upward, and it should be sown in the middle of spring, in crumbly and specially warm soils. Another kind of cummin is the wild variety called country cummin, or by other people Thebaic<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL371_525_b" id="target_note_LCL371_525_b"><sup>b</sup></a> cummin. For pounding up in water and using as a draught in cases of stomach-ache the most highly esteemed kind in our continent is that grown at Carpetania, though elsewhere the prize is awarded to Ethiopian and African cummin; however some prefer the Egyptian to the African.</p>
<p>XLVIII. A herb of exceptionally remarkable nature<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Alexanders; caper.</span></span> is black-herb,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL371_525_c" id="target_note_LCL371_525_c"><sup>c</sup></a> the Greek name for which is horse parsley, and which others call zmyrnium. It is reproduced from the gum that trickles from its own stalk, but it can also be grown from a root. The people who collect its juice say that it tastes like myrrh, and Theophrastus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL371_525_d" id="target_note_LCL371_525_d"><sup>d</sup></a> states that it sprang first from sown myrrh seed. Old writers had recommended sowing horse-parsley in uncultivated stony ground near a garden wall; but at the present day it is sown in land that has been dug over and also after a west wind has followed the autumn equinox. The reason for the old plan was that the caper also is sown principally in dry places, after a plot has been hollowed out for deep digging and stone banks have been built all round it: otherwise it strays all over the fields and takes the fertility out of the soil. It blossoms in summer and continues green till the setting of the Pleiads; it is most at home in sandy soil. The bad qualities of the caper that grows over seas we have spoken of among the exotic shrubs.<span class="marginNote right">XIII. 127.</span></p>
