Intestinal parasites also are expelled by a dose of an acetabulum of the same juice taken in a harsh wine with sprigs of wild marjoram. It is diuretic. Dogs too and pigs are killed by this juice in pearl barley with water and oil added. It attracts mice to itself, and kills them, unless they swallow water at once. Some people recommend that its root be cut up and kept suspended by cords, and be boiled in food against those fluxes which the Greeks call ῥευματισμοί.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL392_325_a" id="target_note_LCL392_325_a"><sup>a</sup></a> Of the dark variety that with a purple flower is said by some to be the male plant, that with a violet flower the female.
