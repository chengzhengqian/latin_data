laid are of varying thickness the style is known as ‘pseudisodomos,’ a spurious variety of the former. A third style is the ‘emplectos’ or ‘interwoven,’ in which only the faces are dressed, the rest of the material being laid at random. It is essential that joints should be made to alternate in such a way that the middle of a stone covers the vertical joint in the course last laid. This should be done even in the core of the wall if circumstances permit, and failing this, at least on the faces. When the core of the wall is packed with rubble, the style is ‘diatonicos,’ ‘with single stones stretching from face to face.’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_137_a" id="target_note_LCL419_137_a"><sup>a</sup></a> ‘Network masonry,’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_137_b" id="target_note_LCL419_137_b"><sup>b</sup></a> which is very commonly used in buildings at Rome, is liable to crack.

coarse sand to two of the hottest possible quicklime, together with pieces of silex each weighing not more than a pound. The floor and walls built of this material should all alike be beaten with iron bars. It is better to build cisterns in pairs so that impurities may settle in the first, and water pass through a filter purified into the adjoining one.</p>

preparing it from variegated limestone, for white limestone produces a better quality. Lime made from a hard stone is more effective for walling, while that made from porous limestone is more suitable for plastering.
