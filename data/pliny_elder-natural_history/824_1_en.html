It is stated that the Gauls, imprisoned as they were by the Alps as by a then insuperable bulwark, first found a motive for overflowing into Italy from the circumstance that a Gallic citizen from Switzerland named Helico, who had sojourned at Rome on account of his skill as an artificer, had brought with him when he came back some dried figs and grapes and some samples of oil and wine; and consequently we may pardon them for having sought to obtain these things even by means of war.</p>

But who would not be justifiably surprised to<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Trees introduced from abroad: the plane.</span></span> hear that a tree has been procured from another clime merely for the sake of shade? This tree is the plane, which was first imported into the Ionian Sea as far as the island of San Domenico to plant over the tomb of Diomede, and which crossed from there to Sicily and was one of the first trees bestowed on Italy, and which has now travelled as far as Belgium and actually occupies soil that pays tribute<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL370_7_a" id="target_note_LCL370_7_a"><sup>a</sup></a> to Rome, so that the tribes have to pay rent even for shade. The elder Dionysius, the tyrant of Sicily, imported plane-trees to the city of Reggio as a marvel to adorn his palace, on the site where afterwards a gymnasium was built; and it is found in the authorities that these trees were not able to grow to full size, and that in all Italy there were no others except the ‘Spania.’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL370_7_b" id="target_note_LCL370_7_b"><sup>b</sup></a></p>

This took place at about the period of the capture of Rome;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL370_7_c" id="target_note_LCL370_7_c"><sup>c</sup></a> and so much honour has since accrued to plane-trees that their growth is encouraged by having wine poured on them, as it has been found that this is of the greatest benefit to the roots, and we have taught even trees to be winebibbers!</p>
