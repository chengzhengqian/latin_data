(“ground cypress”) taken in wine is a powerful antidote to the poisons of all serpents and scorpions. The ampeloprason (“vine leek”) grows in vineyards,<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Ampeloprason.</span></span>
has the leaves of a leek, causes violent belching, but is an antidote for the bites of serpents. It promotes urine and menstruation. Taken in drink and applied externally it checks discharges of blood from the genital organ. It is also administered to women after child-birth and for the bites of dogs. That plant also which is called stachys bears a resemblance to the leek, but has longer and more numerous leaves, a pleasant smell and a colour verging on saffron yellow. It is a powerful emmenagogue.</p>
