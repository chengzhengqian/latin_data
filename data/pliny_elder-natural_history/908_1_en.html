Also the Apulian caper-tree produces vomiting and diarrhoea by causing flatulence in all the organs. Some persons call this shrub ‘dog-brier,’ others ‘snake-vine.’</p>
<p>XLV. The saripha growing on the banks of the<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Cyperus auricomus?</span></span> Nile also belongs to the shrub class. It is about 3 ft. high and the thickness of a man’s thumb; its foliage Is that of the papyrus, and it is chewed in a similar<span class="marginNote right">§ 72.</span> manner. The root is highly rated in workshops for use as fuel, because of its hardness.</p>
<p>XLVI.

It serves the same purpose as vetch, but produces satiety more quickly, an animal being fattened by quite a moderate amount—so
