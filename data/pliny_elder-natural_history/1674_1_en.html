gums. The better the sort of each kind the more potent its effect. Gums are injurious to the teeth, coagulate blood and therefore benefit those who spit blood; they are also good for burns though bad for affections of the trachea; they promote urine and lessen the bitter taste in things. Gums generally are acrid,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL393_77_ba" id="target_note_LCL393_77_ba"><sup>b</sup></a> but the gum that comes from bitter almonds, and is more efficacious for giving astringency to the internal organs, possesses heating properties. The gums from plums, cherries and vines are less esteemed. An application of gum has drying and astringent properties, in vinegar moreover it cures lichens on babies, and four oboli taken in must<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL393_77_c" id="target_note_LCL393_77_c"><sup>c</sup></a> are good for a chronic cough.

Dioscorides I 123, τὸ δὲ κόμμι αὐτῆς (<span class="italic">sc.</span> ἀμυγδάλης πικρᾶς) στύφει καὶ θερμαίνει, shows that the bitter almond is referred to, but the run of the sentence makes us expect a nominative adjective to be joined to <span class="italic">efficacior.</span> Perhaps—it is only a guess—the sentence should run: <span class="italic">adstrictis ceteris, quae ex amygdala amara &lt;excipitur amara&gt; est spissandisque visceribus efficacior; habet excalfactorias vires.</span> The logic of the passage would be that other gums lessen bitter tastes, but gum from bitter almonds is itself bitter.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL393_77_ba').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL393_77_c"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL393_77_c" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">c</sup>It is difficult to make sense here of <span class="italic">in mixto,</span> “in a mixture.” Moreover, <span class="italic">in</span> is not the usual preposition in such phrases, but <span class="italic">ex</span> or <span class="italic">cum.</span> This objection, of course, applies to <span class="italic">musto</span> as much as to <span class="italic">mixto.
