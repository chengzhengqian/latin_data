<p>LI. A tree found in Egypt is the henna,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL370_79_a" id="target_note_LCL370_79_a"><sup>a</sup></a> which has the leaves of the jujube-tree and the white, scented seed of the coriander. Cypros-seed is boiled in olive oil and afterwards crushed, producing the cypros of commerce, which sells at 5 denarii a pound. The best is made from the tree grown at Canopus on the banks of the Nile, the second best at Ascalon in Judaea, and the third quality on the island of Cyprus, which has a sort of sweet scent. The cypros is said to be the same as the thorn called privet in Italy.</p>
<p>LII. In the same region grows camelâ€™s thorn, a<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Scented thorn.</span></span> white thorn of the size of a moderate-sized tree, with the flower of a rose; the root is in request for unguents.

<p>LIV. But every other scent ranks below balsam.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL370_79_c" id="target_note_LCL370_79_c"><sup>c</sup></a><span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Balsam of Mecca: when first imported.</span></span> The only country to which this plant has been vouchsafed is Judaea, where formerly it grew in only two gardens, both belonging to the king; one of them was of not more than twenty iugera in extent and the other less. This variety of shrub was exhibited to the capital by the emperors Vespasian and Titus;
