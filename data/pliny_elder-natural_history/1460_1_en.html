are tied together and hung in the smoke. Then, as the little knots bare themselves, these stems in March are steeped in the lees of dark wine or Greek wine, so that they take on the colour. In this state they are planted in little trenches, with a hemina of lees poured round each. In this way bright-red lilies are produced, and it is wonderful that a plant can be so dyed as to grow a bloom that is also dyed.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL392_181_a" id="target_note_LCL392_181_a"><sup>a</sup></a></p>
<p>XIV. Next in esteem comes the violet, of which<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Violets.</span></span> there are several kinds, the purple, the yellow, the white, all of them planted as are vegetables, from cuttings.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL392_181_b" id="target_note_LCL392_181_b"><sup>b</sup></a> Of these kinds however the purple, which comes up wild in sunny, poor soils, springs
up with a broader, fleshy leaf, coming straight from the root.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL392_181_c" id="target_note_LCL392_181_c"><sup>c</sup></a> It is the only one to be distinguished from the others by a Greek name, being called ion, from which ianthine cloth gets its name. Of the cultivated violets, the most highly esteemed is the yellow variety. The kinds called Tusculan and marine have a slightly broader but less perfumed petal.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL392_181_d" id="target_note_LCL392_181_d"><sup>d</sup></a> The Calatian variety however is entirely without perfume and has a very small petal;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL392_181_d" id="target_note_LCL392_181_d"><sup>d</sup></a> it is a gift of autumn, but all other kinds bloom in spring.</p>
<p>XV.
