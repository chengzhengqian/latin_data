But mortars made of another stone from Cape Matapan, a black marble, or of Parian marble are not so useful to doctors, so we are told, better ones being made of onyx marble from Egypt or of white serpentine. For there is such a species of serpentine, and vessels and boxes also are made of it.</p>

know to be the case also with the green stone of Como in Italy. The Siphnian stone, however, has a peculiarity of its own in that when thoroughly heated with oil it becomes black and hard, whereas naturally it is very soft. Such are the divers properties to be found in one substance. Incidentally, exceptional instances of soft stones occur beyond the Alps. In the province of Belgic Gaul a white stone is said to be cut with a saw, just like wood, only even more easily, so as to serve as ordinary roof tiles and as rain tiles<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_127_b" id="target_note_LCL419_127_b"><sup>b</sup></a> or, if so desired, as the kind of roofing known as ‘peacock-style.’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_127_c" id="target_note_LCL419_127_c"><sup>c</sup></a></p>

However, the specular stone (for even this substance ranks as a stone) has a far more amenable character which allows it to be split into plates as thin as may be wished.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_127_da" id="target_note_LCL419_127_da"><sup>d</sup></a> Formerly it was produced only in Hither Spain, and even then not in the whole of the province, but merely within an area of a hundred miles around the city of Priego.
