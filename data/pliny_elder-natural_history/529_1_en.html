account of all the other species of animals that recently have reached Italy more frequently by importation from all quarters. Scythia, owing to its lack of vegetation, produces extremely few; its neighbour Germany few, but some remarkable breeds of wild oxen, the maned bison and the exceptionally powerful and swift aurochs,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL353_31_a" id="target_note_LCL353_31_a"><sup>a</sup></a> to which the ignorant masses give the name of buffalo, though the buffalo is really a native of Africa and rather bears some resemblance to the calf and the stag.</p>
<p>XVI. The North also produces herds of wild horses, as do Asia and Africa of wild asses, and also the elk, which resembles a bullock save that it is distinguished by the length of its ears and neck; also the achlis,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL353_31_b" id="target_note_LCL353_31_b"><sup>b</sup></a> born in the island of Scandinavia<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL353_31_c" id="target_note_LCL353_31_c"><sup>c</sup></a> and never seen in Rome, although many have told stories of itâ€”an animal that is not unlike the elk but has no joint at the hock and consequently is unable to lie down but sleeps leaning against a tree, and is captured by the tree being cut through to serve as a trap,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL353_31_da" id="target_note_LCL353_31_da"><sup>d</sup></a> but which nevertheless has a remarkable turn of speed. Its upper lip is exceptionally big; on account of this it walks backward when grazing, so as to avoid getting tripped up by it in moving forward. There are reports of a wild animal in Paeonia called the bonasus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL353_31_e" id="target_note_LCL353_31_e"><sup>e</sup></a> which has the mane of a horse but in all other respects resembles a bull; its horns are curved back
