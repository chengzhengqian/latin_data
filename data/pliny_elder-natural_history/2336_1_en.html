Beaten up raw, oysters cure scrofulous sores and chilblains on the feet.</p>
<p>XXII. Seaweed too is said by Nicander<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL418_505_a" id="target_note_LCL418_505_a"><sup>a</sup></a> to be an antidote. There are many kinds of it, as I have said:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL418_505_b" id="target_note_LCL418_505_b"><sup>b</sup></a> one with a long, red leaf, another with a broader leaf, and a third with a curly one. The most prized is the one growing near the ground<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL418_505_c" id="target_note_LCL418_505_c"><sup>c</sup></a> in the island of Crete among the rocks, for this dyes even wool with a colour so fixed that it cannot be washed out afterwards. Nicander recommends it to be given in wine.</p>
<p>XXIII. Hair lost through mange is restored by ashes of the sea-horse, either mixed with soda and pig’s lard, or else by itself in vinegar; the skin however must be prepared for medicaments by the rind of the sepia cuttle-fish ground to powder. It is restored also by the ash of the sea-mouse with oil, by that of the sea-urchin burnt with its flesh, by the gall of the sea-scorpion, also by the ash of three frogs with honey, better with liquid pitch, but the frogs must be burnt together alive in a jar. Leeches blacken the hair if they have rotted for forty days in a red wine. Others recommend that for the same number of days a sextarius of leeches be allowed to rot in a leaden vessel containing two sextarii of vinegar, and that then they should be applied in the sun. Sornatius tells us that they have such power that unless those who are going to dye keep oil in the mouth, the extract from the leeches blackens the teeth as well. To sores on the head are applied with honey beneficially shells of murex or purple-fish, reduced to ash; those of any shell-fish, ground to powder if not burned, and applied in water, are also beneficial. For headache use beaver-oil with peucedanum and rose-oil.</p>
