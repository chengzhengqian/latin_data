visit, is a spring in the heart of Monte Viso, an extremely lofty Alpine peak in the territory of the
Ligurian Vagienni; the stream burrows underground and emerges again in the district of Vibius Market. It rivals all other rivers in celebrity; its Creek name was Eridanus, and it is famous as the scene of the punishment of Phaethon.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL352_87_a" id="target_note_LCL352_87_a"><sup>a</sup></a> The melting of the snows at the rising of the Dogstar causes it to swell in volume; but though its flooding does more damage to the fields adjacent than to vessels, nevertheless it claims no part of its plunder for itself, and where it deposits its spoil it bestows bounteous fertility. Its length from its source is 300 miles, to which it adds 88 by its windings, and it not only receives navigable rivers from the Apennines and the Alps, but also immense lakes that discharge themselves into it, and it carries down to the Adriatic Sea as many as 30 streams in all. Among these the best-known are: flowing from the Apennine range, the Jactum, the Tanaro, the Trebbia (on which is Piacenza), the Taro, the Enza, the Secchia, the Panaro and the Reno; flowing from the Alps, the Stura, Oreo, two Doras, Sesia, Ticino, Lambra, Adda, Oglio and Mincio. Nor does any other river increase so much in volume in so short a distance; in fact, the vast body of water drives it on and scoops out its bed with disaster to the land, although it is diverted into streams and canals between Ravenna and Altino over a length of 120 miles; nevertheless where it discharges its water more widely it forms what are called the Seven Seas.</p>
<p>The Po is carried to Ravenna by the Canal of Augustus; this part of the river is called the Padusa,
