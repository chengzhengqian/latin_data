Although these tales are incredible, yet they fill us with wonder, and force us to admit that there is still much truth in them. Hence too I find that most authorities hold that there is nothing which cannot be achieved by the power of plants, but that the properties of most are still unknown. Among these thinkers was Herophilus, famous in medicine, who is reported to have said that certain plants are perhaps beneficial even when merely trodden on.

But the reason why more herbs are not familiar is because experience of them is confined to illiterate country-folk, who form the only class living among them; moreover nobody cares to look for them when crowds of medical men are to be met everywhere. Many simples also, though their properties have been discovered, still lack names, for instance, the plant I mentioned when dealing with the cultivation of crops,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL393_147_d" id="target_note_LCL393_147_d"><sup>d</sup></a> which we know keeps all birds away if buried at the corners of the cornfield.

Instead of this we get a statement that a patient has grown worse on the arrival of visitors who have travelled on foot.
