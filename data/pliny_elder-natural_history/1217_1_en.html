of the most famous authorities on medical science, has devoted one whole book to its praises. Utica barley-water is of outstanding quality. There is a kind in Egypt made of the double-pointed grain. The kind of barley used for making this drink in Andalusia and Africa is called by Turranius smooth barley. The same authority is of opinion that <span class="italic">olyra,</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL371_239_a" id="target_note_LCL371_239_a"><sup>a</sup></a> and <span class="italic">oryza</span> (rice) are the same plant. The recipe for making barley-water is universally known.</p>

<p>XVII. and starch is made from every kind of wheat and common wheat,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL371_239_b" id="target_note_LCL371_239_b"><sup>b</sup></a> but the best from three-month
wheat. For its discovery we are indebted to the island of Chios, and that is where the best kind comes from to-day. Its name<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL371_239_c" id="target_note_LCL371_239_c"><sup>c</sup></a> is Greek, and means ‘made without milling’. Next to the starch made from three-month wheat is the kind made of the lightest sort of wheat. This is soaked with fresh water in wooden tubs, with the grain completely covered, the water being changed five times in the course of a day, and preferably in the night time as well, so as to get it mixed up evenly with the grain. When it is quite soft but before it goes sour it is strained through linen or wicker baskets and poured out on a tiled surface that has been smeared with leaven, and left to thicken in the sun. Next to the starch of Chios that from Crete is most highly spoken of; and then comes the Egyptian kind. The test of its quality is smooth consistency and light weight, and the condition of being fresh. It has moreover been mentioned already by Cato<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL371_239_d" id="target_note_LCL371_239_d"><sup>d</sup></a> among ourselves.</p>
