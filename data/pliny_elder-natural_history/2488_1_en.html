The ‘anthracitis ‘has the fiery colour of the stones previously mentioned, but it possesses one peculiar property: when it is touched its glow dies away and disappears, but when, on the other hand, it is soaked with water it blazes forth again.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_245_a" id="target_note_LCL419_245_a"><sup>a</sup></a></p>
