famous for Hammoniac salt, itself so called because it is found under the sand.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL418_427_a" id="target_note_LCL418_427_a"><sup>a</sup></a> It is in colour like the alum called <span class="italic">schiston</span>,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL418_427_b" id="target_note_LCL418_427_b"><sup>b</sup></a> consisting of long opaque slabs, of an unpleasant flavour, but useful in medicine. That is most valued which is most transparent and splits into straight flakes. A remarkable feature is reported of it: of very little weight in its underground pits, when brought into the light of day it becomes incredibly heavy. The reason is obvious; the damp breath of the pits helps the workers by supporting the weight as does water. It is adulterated by the Sicilian salt I have said<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL418_427_c" id="target_note_LCL418_427_c"><sup>c</sup></a> comes from the lake Cocanicus, as well as by Cyprian salt, which is wonderfully like it. In Hither Spain too at Egelesta salt is cut into almost transparent blocks; to this for some time past most physicians have given the first place among all kinds of salt. Every region in which salt is found is barren, and nothing will grow there. To speak generally, these remarks about the various kinds of native salt are comprehensive. Of artificial<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Artificial salt.</span></span> salt there are various kinds. The usual one, and the most plentiful, is made in salt pools by running into them sea water not without streams of fresh water, but rain helps very much, and above all much &lt;warm&gt;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL418_427_d" id="target_note_LCL418_427_d"><sup>d</sup></a> sunshine, without which it does not dry out. In Africa around Utica are formed heaps of salt like hills; when they have hardened under sun and moon, they are not melted by any moisture, and even iron cuts them with difficulty. It is also however made in Crete without fresh water<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL418_427_e" id="target_note_LCL418_427_e"><sup>e</sup></a> by letting the sea flow into the pools, and around Egypt by the sea itself,
