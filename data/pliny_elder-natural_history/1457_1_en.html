forced by the hand, and is always like a bud; the petals are very broad. Another kind springs from a stem like that of the mallow, with leaves like olive leaves, called mucetum.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL392_175_a" id="target_note_LCL392_175_a"><sup>a</sup></a> Between these<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL392_175_b" id="target_note_LCL392_175_b"><sup>b</sup></a> in size is an autumn rose, named coroniola (little chaplet); all of these<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL392_175_b" id="target_note_LCL392_175_b"><sup>b</sup></a> are without perfume except coroniola and the rose growing on a bramble. In so many ways is spuriousness possible!<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL392_175_c" id="target_note_LCL392_175_c"><sup>c</sup></a> In other districts too the genuine rose also depends to a very great extent upon the soil for its main characteristics. The rose of Cyrene has the finest perfume,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL392_175_d" id="target_note_LCL392_175_d"><sup>d</sup></a> for which reason the choicest ointment is to be obtained there. At Carthage in Spain there is an early rose that blossoms throughout the winter. Weather too makes a difference; for in certain years the rose grows with less perfume, and furthermore all roses have more perfume on dry soils than on moist. It likes to be grown on soils that are neither rich nor clayey nor irrigated, being content with a rubbly soil,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL392_175_e" id="target_note_LCL392_175_e"><sup>e</sup></a> and fond in particular of ground on which rubble has been spread. The Campanian rose is early, the Milesian late, but the one that continues to flower the latest is the Praenestine. The ground is dug deeper for roses than for crops,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL392_175_f" id="target_note_LCL392_175_f"><sup>f</sup></a> but shallower than for vines. They are very slow in growing from the seed, which is in the shell itself, right under the flower, and covered with down. For this reason it is preferred to graft shoots into an incision in the stem. And into the eyelets of the root, as with the reed, there is grafted one kind of rose that is pale, prickly, with
