In this direction a number of islands<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL352_193_b" id="target_note_LCL352_193_b"><sup>b</sup></a> are reported to exist that have no names, but according to the account of Timaeus there is one named Baunonia,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL352_193_c" id="target_note_LCL352_193_c"><sup>c</sup></a> lying off Scythia, at a distance of a day’s voyage from the coast, on the beach of which in spring time amber is cast up by the waves. The rest of these coasts are only known in detail by reports of doubtful authority. To the north is the ocean; beyond the river Parapanisus where it washes the coast of Scythia Hecataeus calls it the Amalchian Sea, a name that in the language of the natives means ‘frozen’; Philemon says that the Cimbrian name for it is Morimarusa (that is, ‘Dead Sea’) from the Parapanisus to Cape Rusbeae, and from that point onward the Cronian Sea.

Also some islands called the Oeonae are reported of which the inhabitants live on birds’ eggs and oats, and others on which people are born with horses’ feet, which gives them their Greek name; there are others called the All-ears Islands in which the natives have very large ears covering the whole of their bodies, which are otherwise left naked.</p>
<p>From this point more definite information begins to open up, beginning with the race of the Inguaeones, the first that we come to in Germany. Here there is an enormous mountain, the Saevo, as big as those of the Ripaean range, which forms an enormous bay reaching to the Cimbrian promontory; it is named the Codanian Gulf, and is studded with islands. The most famous of these is Scandinavia; its size
