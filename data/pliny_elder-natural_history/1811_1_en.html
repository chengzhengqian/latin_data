and Mayhoff <span class="italic">sanantur</span> followed by ablatives. The disturbance may have been caused by the accidental omission of <span class="italic">sanat et</span> before <span class="italic">plantago</span> and its later re-insertion two lines further on. The various readings of our MSS. were probably due to conscious efforts to restore the grammar. Both Detlefsen and Mayhoff adopt <span class="italic">oxymelitis</span>; but both <span class="italic">drachma</span> and <span class="italic">obolus</span> are weights, not measures of capacity, and the sense requires that the amount of betony and agaric should be given, not the amount of oxymel in which they were taken. Professor Andrews would keep the order of words in the MSS., commenting menting that Pliny seems to say: “Yes, archezostis does cure, but it takes a long time.”</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL393_351_aa').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL393_351_b"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL393_351_b" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">b</sup>It is often difficult to see whether in such phrases the adverbial expression goes with the participle <span class="italic">tritus</span> or not.
