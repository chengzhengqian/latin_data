dose being two cyathi in lukewarm water, and the patient after taking the draught should lie down on his spleen. The very tendrils by which the vine climbs, pounded and swallowed in water, check habitual vomiting. The ash of vines with old axle grease is good for tumours, cleanses fistulas and in time heals them completely, as it does cramps, and pains in the sinews arising from chill; for bruises however it may be applied thus or with oil, for excrescences of flesh on bones it should be with vinegar and soda, for scorpion stings and dog bites, with oil. The ash of the bark by itself restores the hair on burns.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL392_419_a" id="target_note_LCL392_419_a"><sup>a</sup></a></p>

It also cures sores in a moist part of the body, such as the mouth, tonsils or genitals. It is very helpful for clearness of vision,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL392_419_c" id="target_note_LCL392_419_c"><sup>c</sup></a> and is good for scabrous eyelids, sores in the corners of the eyes, films on the eyes, running sores in any part of the body, flabby scars, and bones with a slimy pus on them.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL392_419_da" id="target_note_LCL392_419_da"><sup>d</sup></a> Its strength can be modified by adding honey or raisin wine. Omphacium is also good for dysentery, spitting of blood, and quinsy.</p>

Marcidus,</span> withered (decayed, shrunk), is not an appropriate adjective for a scar. Forcellini, perhaps in reference to this passage, gives <span class="italic">flaccidus</span> as an equivalent. “Bones slimy purulently” is almost nonsense. Only when bones are exposed because of wounds or dangerous rodent ulcers do we see them “purulent.” The truth seems to be that Pliny misread the Greek that appears in Dioscorides (V. 5) as οὖλα
πλαδαρά, ὦτα πυορροοῦντα: “flabby gums and pus in the ears.” <span class="italic">I.e.</span> οὖλα has been confused with οὐλαὶ and ὦτα with ὀστᾶ.
