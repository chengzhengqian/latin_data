of State. There is less certainty regarding the stones about which men too pass judgement. In the case of men, it is an individual’s caprice that sets a value upon an individual stone, and, above all, the rivalry that ensues. A case in point is that of the Emperor Claudius, when he took to wearing a
‘smaragdus’ or a sardonyx. But according to Demostratus, the first Roman to adopt a sardonyx<span class="marginNote right">§ 34.</span>
was the elder Africanus, and hence arose the esteem<span class="marginNote right">236–181 <span class="sc">b.c.</span></span>

meant a stone with a layer of carnelian resting on a layer of white, that is, like flesh superimposed on a human finger-nail, both parts of the stone being translucent. Such is the character of the Indian sardonyx according to Ismenias, Demostratus, Zenothemis
and Sotacus. The last two writers call such other varieties of the stone as are opaque ‘blind sardonyx.’ Those stones that have now usurped the name although they lack all trace of the carnelian of the Indian stones<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_233_b" id="target_note_LCL419_233_b"><sup>b</sup></a> come from Arabia;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_233_c" id="target_note_LCL419_233_c"><sup>c</sup></a> and the sardonyx has come to be recognized in the guise of several colours, the base being black or else having the colour of azurite, while the ‘nail’above is

In the present context the word clearly means carnelian. Thus sardonyx is strictly a banded chalcedony containing at least one layer of carnelian. Owing to the popularity of the genuine sardonyx, the word had come to be applied, no doubt by the dealers, to other varieties of onyx containing a layer of red jasper (<span class="italic">imitante . . . minium,</span> § 87) or of sard (<span class="italic">melleae aut faeculentae,</span> § 89).</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL419_233_aa').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL419_233_b"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL419_233_b" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">b</sup>Retaining with B <span class="italic">Indicarum</span> (sc. <span class="italic">sardonychum</span>).</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL419_233_b').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL419_233_c"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL419_233_c" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">c</sup>These too may have been Indian, like many stones attributed to Arabia.
