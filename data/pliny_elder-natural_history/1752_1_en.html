<p>LXXXVI. From callithrix also is made a snuff. This plant has the leaves of the lentil; the stems are very slender rushes and the root is very small. It grows in shady, moist places, and has a hot taste.</p>
<p>LXXXVII. Hyssop crushed in oil is good for phthiriasis and itch on the scalp. The best comes from Mount Taurus in Cilicia, the next best from Pamphylia and Smyrna. Upsetting the stomach, it purges by stool if taken with figs, by vomitings if taken with honey. Pounded with honey, salt, and cummin it is also supposed to counteract the poison of snake bites.</p>
<p>LXXXVIII. Lonchitis is not, as most people have thought, the same plant as xiphion or phasganion, although the seed is like a spear point; for it has leaves like those of the leek, reddish near the root and more numerous than on the stem, little heads like the masks of comedy, which put out a small tongue, and very long roots. It grows in thirsty soils.</p>
<p>(LXXXIX.) Xiphion or phasganion on the other hand grows in moist soils. When it first leaves the ground it presents the appearance of a sword, has a stem two cubits high, and a fringed root like a filbert, which must be dug up before harvest and dried in the shade. The upper part of it, beaten up with frankincense and mixed with an equal quantity by weight of wine, extracts bone splinters from the head and all suppurating matter in the body, or any snake bones that have been trodden on; the plant also counteracts poisons.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL393_233_aa" id="target_note_LCL393_233_aa"><sup>a</sup></a> Headache is relieved by

XXIV 61. The position of <span class="italic">serpentis</span> and the plural <span class="italic">venena</span> are other objections. Now <span class="italic">ossa serpentis</span> is odd. My friend Mr. John Chadwick tells me often cut himself on a snake’s skeleton? He might however easily run a thorn into his foot during a cross-country walk. The corresponding passage in Dioscorides (IV 20) has ἀκίδας καὶ σκόλοπας ἐπισπᾶσθαι. It is conjectural, but just possible, that <span class="italic">serpentis</span> has replaced an original <span class="italic">spina</span> because the <span class="italic">ossa</span> of the first clause of this sentence was repeated a little later on unconsciously by a careless scribe. Then the sense would be “if a thorn has been trodden on.”<span class="linebreak"></span>
All this is so conjectural that I do not feel justified in changing the text. that a snake’s skeleton would make a nasty wound if trodden on.
