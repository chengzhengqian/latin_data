which, placed alongside gold, make it assume a white, silvery appearance. These stones are set in an open bezel so as to remain fully transparent, while the rest are backed with brass foil.</p>
<p>XLIII. Although they have now ceased to be used<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Chrysoelectri.</span></span>
as gems, there are certain stones to be mentioned
that are called ‘chrysoelectri,’ or ‘golden amber.’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_269_a" id="target_note_LCL419_269_a"><sup>a</sup></a> Their colour passes into that of amber, but only in morning light. Those from Pontus are betrayed by their light weight. Some of these stones are hard and reddish, while some are soft and full of flaws. Bocchus assures us that they have been found also in Spain, in the place where, according to his previous<span class="marginNote right">§ 24.</span>
account, rock-crystal is dug up from shafts sunk to water-level, and adds that he saw a ‘chrysolithus’ weighing twelve pounds.</p>
<p>XLIV. There occur also ‘leucochrysi,’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_269_b" id="target_note_LCL419_269_b"><sup>b</sup></a> or ‘golden-white’
stones, which are traversed by a bright white vein; and there is also the ‘capnias,’ or ‘smoky stone’ belonging to this class.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_269_c" id="target_note_LCL419_269_c"><sup>c</sup></a> There are, moreover, stones closely resembling those made of glass-paste, their colour being a kind of bright saffron-yellow. They can be so convincingly counterfeited in glass that the difference cannot be observed, although it may be detected by touch, since the glass-paste feels warmer.</p>
<p>XLV. In the same class is the ‘melichrysus,’
or ‘honey-gold stone,’ which looks like pure honey seen through a clear film of gold.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_269_d" id="target_note_LCL419_269_d"><sup>d</sup></a> This stone, a product of India, is brittle, although hard, but is by no means unpleasing. India produces also the
‘xuthos’ or ‘brownish-yellow stone,’ a gem regarded<span class="marginNote right">§ 169.</span>
there as fit only for the common folk.</p>
<p>XLVI. White stones are headed by the ‘paederos,’<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">The opal</span> (<span class="italic">cf</span>. §§ 80–84).</span>
