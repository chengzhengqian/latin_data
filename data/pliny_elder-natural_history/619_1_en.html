marshes and lakes so as to produce their offspring safe, as in those waters there are no creatures to devour their young and the waves are less fierce. Their understanding these reasons and their observing the changes of the seasons would seem more surprising to anybody who considers what fraction of mankind is aware that the biggest catch is made when the sun is passing through the sign of the Fishes.</p>
<p>XXXVI. Some sea-fish are flat, for instance the<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Flatfish.</span></span> turbot, the sole and the plaice,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL353_211_a" id="target_note_LCL353_211_a"><sup>a</sup></a> which differs from the turbot only in the posture of its body—the turbot lies with the right side uppermost and the flounder with the left; while other sea-fish are long, as the moray and the conger.</p>
<p>XXXVII. Consequently<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Varieties of fins.</span></span> differences also occur in the fins, which are bestowed on fish instead of feet; none have more than four, some have three, some two, certain kinds none. In the Lago di Celano, but nowhere else, there is a fish that has eight fins to swim with. Long slippery fish like eels and congers generally have two fins, others have none, for instance, the moray which also has no gills. All this class use the sea as snakes do the land, propelling themselves by twisting their bodies, and they also crawl on dry land; consequently this class are also longer-lived. Some of the flat-fish too have not got fins, for example, the prickly ray—for these swim merely by means of their breadth—and the kinds called soft fish, such as polyps, since their feet serve them instead of fins.</p>
