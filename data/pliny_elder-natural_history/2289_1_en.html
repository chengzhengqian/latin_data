Certain lands become drier in rainy weather, as the region of Namia; Marcus Cicero included this in his Marvels, saying that drought brings mud, and rain dust.</p>

Therefore the same rivers are found in some parts to be unwholesome. Tributaries too alter the flavour of a river, as do those of the Borysthenes, and being absorbed are diluted.
