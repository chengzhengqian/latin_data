the hardiest trees to live are olives, seeing that it is generally agreed among the authorities that they last 200 years.</p>
<p>XCI. On a hill named Corne in the territory of Tusculum,<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Celebrated trees near Tusculum.</span></span>
near the city, there is a grove named Corne which has been held in reverence from early times by the district of Latium as sacred to Diana; it consists of a beech coppice the foliage of which has the appearance of having been trimmed by art. This grove contains one outstanding tree which in our generation excited the affection of the orator Passienus Crispus, who had twice been consul and who subsequently became still more distinguished by marrying Agrippina
and becoming the stepfather of Nero; Crispus used regularly not merely to lie beneath the tree and to pour wine over it, but to kiss and embrace it. Close to this grove is a holm-oak which is also famous, as measuring thirty-four feet round the trunk, and sending out what look like ten separate trees of remarkable size and forming a wood of itself.</p>

by ivy. Some people believe that a similar property noxious to trees, though operating more slowly, is also contained in mistletoeâ€”for this plant also is recognised as by no means among the least remarkable on account of other properties beside its berries. For some varieties of plants cannot grow in the earth, and take root in trees, because they have no abode of their own and consequently live in that of others: instances of this are mistletoe and the plant in Syria called cadytas, which twines itself round not only trees but even teasels, and likewise in the district about Tempe in Thessaly the plant called polypodium, and also the dolichos and the serpyllum.
