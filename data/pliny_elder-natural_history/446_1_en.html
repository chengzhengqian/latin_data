exterminated by the Nasamones who now occupy that region, but a tribe of men descended from those who had escaped or had been absent when the fighting took place survives to-day in a few places . A similar race lingers on in Italy also, the Marsi, said to be descended from the son<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL352_517_a" id="target_note_LCL352_517_a"><sup>a</sup></a> of Circe and to possess this natural property on that account. However, all men contain a poison available as a protection against snakes: people say that snakes flee from contact with saliva as from the touch of boiling water, and that if it gets inside their throats they actually die; and that this is especially the case with the saliva of a person fasting.</p>
