third port named Mokha, which is not called at on the voyage to India, and is only used by merchants trading in frankincense and Arabian perfumes. Inland there is a town, the residence of the king of the district, called Sapphar, and another called Save. But the most advantageous way of sailing to India is to set out from Cella; from that port it is a 40 days’ voyage, if the Hippalus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL352_419_a" id="target_note_LCL352_419_a"><sup>a</sup></a> is blowing, to the first trading-station in India, Cranganore—not a desirable port of call, on account of the neighbouring pirates, who occupy a place called Nitriae,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL352_419_b" id="target_note_LCL352_419_b"><sup>b</sup></a> nor is it specially rich in articles of merchandise; and furthermore the roadstead for shipping is a long way from the land, and cargoes have to be brought in and carried out in boats. The king of Muziris, at the date of publication, was Caelobothras. There is another more serviceable port, belonging to the Neacyndi tribe, called Porakad; this is where king Pandion reigned, his capital being a town in the interior a long way from the port, called Madura; while the district from which pepper is conveyed to Becare in canoes made of hollowed tree-trunks is called Cottonara. But all these names of tribes and ports or towns are to be found in none of the previous writers, which seems to show that the local conditions of the places are changing. Travellers set sail from India on the return voyage at the beginning of the Egyptian month Tybis, which is our December, or at all events before the sixth day of the Egyptian Mechir, which works out at before January 13 in our calendar—so making it possible to return home in the same year. They set sail from India with a southeast wind,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL352_419_c" id="target_note_LCL352_419_c"><sup>c</sup></a> and after entering the Red Sea, continue the voyage with a south-west or south wind.</p>
