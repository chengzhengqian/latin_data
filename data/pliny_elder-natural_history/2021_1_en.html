It is found in Samos also, but the Samian is not used by painters, because it is excessively greasy. It is dug up in Samos by people lying on the ground and searching for a vein among the rocks. It has the same use in medicine as earth of Eretria; it also dries the tongue by contact, and acts as a depilatory, with an abrasive, effect. It costs a sesterce a pound.</p>
<p>The third of the white pigments is ceruse or lead acetate, the nature of which we have stated in<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">XXXIV 175.</span><span class="br"></span> speaking of the ores of lead. There was also once a native ceruse earth<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL394_289_b" id="target_note_LCL394_289_b"><sup>b</sup></a> found on the estate of Theodotus at Smyrna, which was employed in old days for painting ships.
