It is perfectly true that owing to their greatness the Roman people have lost their usages, and through conquering we have been conquered. We are the subjects of foreigners, and in one of the arts they have mastered even their masters. But of this more elsewhere.</p>
<p>II. In their proper places I have already spoken of<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">The lotus.</span></span>
the plant called lotus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL393_7_b" id="target_note_LCL393_7_b"><sup>b</sup></a> and also of the Egyptian plant called by the same name, sometimes known also as
the tree of the Syrtes. The berries of this lotus, which by our countrymen is called the Greek bean, check looseness of the bowels. Shavings of the wood, boiled down in wine, are good for dysentery, irregular menstruation, giddiness and epilepsy. They also prevent the hair from falling out. It is strange that nothing is more bitter than these shavings or sweeter than lotus fruit. From the sawdust also of the wood a medicine is prepared by boiling it down in myrtle water; it is then kneaded and cut into lozenges, which make a very useful medicine for dysentery, the dose being one victoriatus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL393_7_c" id="target_note_LCL393_7_c"><sup>c</sup></a> to three cyathi of water.</p>

the more potent parts are the peel itself and the skin just under it. A decoction of the latter is good for coeliac affections. In cases of dysentery also even

Dioscorides is quite clear. Under δρῦς he says (I. 106, Wellmann): μάλιστα δὲ αὐτῆς στύφει τὸ μεταξὺ
