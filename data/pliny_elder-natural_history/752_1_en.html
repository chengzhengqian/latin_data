are smaller than the others—kill one kind of spider called <span class="italic">phalangium</span> and carry them to their nests and then smear them over, and from these by incubating produce their own species. Moreover they all feed on flesh, contrary to bees which never touch a body. But wasps hunt larger flies and after cutting off their heads carry away the rest of the body.</p>
<p>The forest variety of hornets live in hollow trees,<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Hornets.</span></span>

Some authorities state that twenty-seven<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL353_477_a" id="target_note_LCL353_477_a"><sup>a</sup></a> hornet-stings will kill a human being. Another kind that seems less fierce has two classes—workers, smaller in size, which die in winter, and mothers, which last two years: these are not fierce at all. They make nests in spring, usually with four entrances, in which to breed the workers. When these have been reared, they then make other larger nests, in which they may now produce those who are to be mothers. Then the workers begin to function, and feed the mothers. The mothers are of a wider shape, and it is doubtful whether they possess stings, because they do not come out. These also have their drones. Some people hold the view that all these insects lose their stings towards winter. Neither the hornet nor the wasp kind have kings, nor do they swarm, but their numbers are continually renewed by offspring.</p>

which occurs in Assyria; it is larger than the kinds mentioned above. Silk-moths make their nests of mud like a sort of salt; they are attached to a stone, and are so hard that they can scarcely be pierced with javelins. In these nests they make
