this tied on them, especially when they are teething or suffering from cough, and to inject it into those troubled with tape-worms. Its other properties are not much different from those of honey. It cleanses sores on the head, especially abscesses of long standing.

Crocomagma therefore was the residue from a refining of saffron juice, not “the residuum of saffron after the extraction of the oil” (Lewis and Short). Cf.
