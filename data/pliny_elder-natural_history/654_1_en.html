<p>LXXXII. Ponds for keeping snails were first made<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Snail-breading.</span></span> by Fulvius Lippinus in the Trachina district a little before the civil war<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL353_281_a" id="target_note_LCL353_281_a"><sup>a</sup></a> fought with Pompey the Great; indeed he kept the different kinds of snails separate, with different compartments for the white snails that grow in the Rieti territory and for the Illyrian variety distinguished for size, the African for fecundity and the Solitane for breed. Moreover he devised a method of fattening them with new wine boiled down and spelt and other kinds of fodder, so that gastronomy was enriched even by fattened oysters; and according to Marcus Varro this ostentatious science was carried to such lengths that a single snail-shell was large enough to hold 80 quarts.</p>

(2) In the neighbourhood of Heraclea and Cromna and in many parts of the Black Sea there is one kind that frequents the water at the edge of rivers and makes itself caverns in the ground and lives in these, and also in the shore of tidal rivers when left dry by the tide; and consequently they are only dug up when the movement of their bodies shows that they are alive.
