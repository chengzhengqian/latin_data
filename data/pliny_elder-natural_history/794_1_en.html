directly from the abdomen right down the gut; this is the case with lynxes, and among birds cormorants. The elephant has four<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL353_561_a" id="target_note_LCL353_561_a"><sup>a</sup></a> abdomens, but its other parts resemble those of pigs; its lungs are four times as large as those of an ox. Birds have a fleshy and hard abdomen. In the abdomen of swallow chicks there are found white or red coloured pebbles, called swallow-stones; there are accounts of these in the treatises on magic. Also in the second abdomen of heifers is found a round ball<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL353_561_b" id="target_note_LCL353_561_b"><sup>b</sup></a> of blackish tufa that weighs nothing; this is thought to be a sovereign remedy for difficulty in child-birth if it has never been allowed to touch the ground.</p>
<p>LXXX. The abdomen and bowels except in the<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">The spleen.</span></span> oviparous species are wrapped in a fat thin caul. To this is attached the spleen on the left side opposite the liver, with which it occasionally changes place, but this constitutes a portent. Some think that oviparous species contain a spleen, and also snakes a rather small one; this undoubtedly appears to be so in the case of the tortoise, the crocodile, lizards and frogs. It is certain that the goat’s-head bird has not got a spleen, nor have the bloodless species. Sometimes it causes a peculiar impediment in running, owing to which runners who have trouble have an operation to reduce it. Also cases are reported of animals living after it has been removed by an incision. There are some who think that this operation deprives a man of the power of laughing, and that inability to control one’s laughter is caused by enlargement of the spleen. It is said that in a district in Asia called Scepsis the cattle have extremely small spleens, and that remedies for the spleen have been imported from there.</p>
