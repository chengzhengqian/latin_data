in which the roomy laxity of the abdomen passes the food on to the lower parts.</p>
<p>LXXIX. From this abdomen start in the sheep<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">The intestines.

On this account species in which the distance from the belly is longer are greedier for food; moreover those with a very fat abdomen are less clever. Birds also in some cases have two receptacles, one down which food just eaten passes to the throat, the other into which they pass the food from the throat when digestedâ€”<span class="italic">e.g</span>. hens, ring-doves, pigeons and partridges. Almost all the other species in most cases have not got this, but make use of a more widely opened gullet, for instance jays, ravens and crows. Some species treat the food in neither manner, but have the abdomen very near; these are species that have specially long and narrow necks, for instance the sultana-hen. The abdomen of whole-hoofed animals is rough and hard. In that of some land animals the roughness is denticulated, and in that of others it has a latticed bite. Species that are without teeth in both jaws and that do not ruminate digest their food here and pass it down from here into the belly. This in all species is attached at its middle to the navel; in man at its lower part it resembles the belly of a pig; the Greeks call it the colon; it is the seat of a great cause of pain. In dogs it is extremely narrow, and for this reason they can only relieve it with a violent effort and not without severe pain. The most ravenous animals are those in whom the food passes
