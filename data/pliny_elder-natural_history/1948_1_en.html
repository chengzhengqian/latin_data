winners with two-horse or four-horse chariots; and this is the origin of our chariot-groups in honour of those who have celebrated a triumphal procession. But this belongs to a late date, and among those monuments it was not till the time of his late lamented Majesty Augustus that chariots with six horses occurred,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL394_143_a" id="target_note_LCL394_143_a"><sup>a</sup></a> and likewise elephants.</p>
<p>XI. The custom of erecting memorial chariots<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Roman statues.</span></span> with two horses in the case of those who held the office of praetor and had ridden round the Circus in a chariot is not an old one; that of statues on pillars is of earlier date, for instance the statue of honour of Gaius Maenius who had vanquished the Old<span class="marginNote right">338 <span class="sc">b.c.</span></span> Latins to whom the Roman nation gave by treaty a third part of the booty won from them. It was in the same consulship that the nation, after defeating the people of Antium, had fixed on the platform the beaked prows of ships taken in the victory over the people of Antium, in the 416th year of the city of Rome; and similarly the statue to Gaius Duillius, who was the first to obtain a naval triumph over the<span class="marginNote right">260 <span class="sc">b.c.</span></span> Carthaginians—this statue still stands in the forum<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL394_143_b" id="target_note_LCL394_143_b"><sup>b</sup></a>—and
likewise that in honour of the praefect of markets Lucius Minucius outside the Triplets Gate, defrayed<span class="marginNote right">439 <span class="sc">b.c.</span></span> by a tax of one-twelfth of an <span class="italic">as</span> per head. I rather think this was the first time that an honour of this nature came from the whole people; previously it had been bestowed by the senate: it would be a very distinguished honour had it not originated on such unimportant occasions. In fact also the statue of Attus Navius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL394_143_c" id="target_note_LCL394_143_c"><sup>c</sup></a> stood in front of the senate-house—when
