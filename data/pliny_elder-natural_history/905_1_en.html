and painful deaths.</p>
<p>XXXVIII. Equally unlucky is the tree on the island of Lesbos called the euonymus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL370_169_a" id="target_note_LCL370_169_a"><sup>a</sup></a> which is not unlike the pomegranate tree—its leaves are between pomegranate and bay-leaves in size, but have the shape and soft texture of the leaf of the pomegranate—and which by the scent of its white blossom gives prompt warning of its pestilential qualities.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL370_169_b" id="target_note_LCL370_169_b"><sup>b</sup></a> It bears a pod like that of the sesame, with a coarse square-shaped grain inside it which is deadly for animals; and the leaf also has the same property, although sometimes an immediate evacuation of the bowels gives relief.</p>
<p>XXXIX. Alexander Cornelius mentions a tree called the lion-tree, the timber of which he says was used to build the Argo, which bears mistletoe resembling that on Valonia oak, which cannot be rotted by water or destroyed by fire, the same being the case with its mistletoe. This tree is, so far as I am aware, unknown to anyone else.</p>

It resembles the arbutus, only it has a smaller leaf and is an evergreen; the bark, though not rough, might be supposed to have frozen round the tree, it has such a wretched appearance.</p>
<p>XLI. The sumach has a similar leaf, but is smaller in size. It has the peculiarity of clothing its fruit (which is called pappus) with downy fluff, a thing that occurs with no other tree. The apharce<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL370_169_d" id="target_note_LCL370_169_d"><sup>d</sup></a> also resembles the andrachle, and like it bears twice a
