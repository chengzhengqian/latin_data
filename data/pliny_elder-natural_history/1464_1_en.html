Watery<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL392_189_a" id="target_note_LCL392_189_a"><sup>a</sup></a> flowers have perfume not altogether independent of the essential juice, the violet for instance, the rose and the saffron; moreover, watery flowers without this juice always have an oppressive perfume, for example, both kinds of lily. Southernwood and sweet marjoram have pungent scents. Of some plants the flowers only are pleasant, the other parts being scentless, for example, those of the violet and of the rose. Of garden plants the strongest-scented are those that are dry, like rue, mint and parsley, and such as grow on dry soils. Some products have more scent when old, for example the quince, and these same have more when gathered than when growing in the ground. Some have scent only when broken or after being crushed, others only when the skin or bark has been stripped off, others indeed only when burnt, for example, frankincense and myrrh. Crushed flowers are all more bitter than when unbroken. A few, such as the melilot, keep their scent longer when dried. Some impart a scent to the place itself, as does the iris, which also affects the whole of any tree, the roots of which it happens to touch.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL392_189_b" id="target_note_LCL392_189_b"><sup>b</sup></a> The hesperis<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL392_189_c" id="target_note_LCL392_189_c"><sup>c</sup></a> has a stronger scent at night, from which fact it gets its name. No animal has a smell, unless we believe what has been said about the panther.</p>
