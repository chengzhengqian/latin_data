shells and quarry sand. Authorities state that in India glass is made also of broken rock-crystal and that for this reason no glass can compare with that of India. To resume, a fire of light, dry wood is used for preparing the melt, to which are added copper and soda, preferably Egyptian soda.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_153_a" id="target_note_LCL419_153_a"><sup>a</sup></a> Glass, like copper, is smelted in a series of furnaces,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_153_b" id="target_note_LCL419_153_b"><sup>b</sup></a> and dull black lumps are formed. Molten glass is every where so sharp that, before there is the least sensation, it cuts to the bone any part of the body on which it splutters.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_153_c" id="target_note_LCL419_153_c"><sup>c</sup></a> After being reduced to lumps, the glass is again fused in the workshop and is tinted. Some of it is shaped by blowing,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_153_d" id="target_note_LCL419_153_d"><sup>d</sup></a> some machined on a lathe and some chased like silver. Sidon was once famous for its glassworks, since, apart from other achievements, glass mirrors were invented there.</p>
<p>This was the old method of producing glass. Now, however, in Italy too a white sand which forms in the River Volturno is found along 6 miles of the seashore between Cuma and Literno. Wherever it is softest, it is taken to be ground in a mortar or mill. Then it is mixed with three parts of soda, either by weight or by measure, and after being fused is taken in its molten state to other furnaces. There it forms a lump known in Greek as ‘sand-soda.’ This is again melted and forms pure glass, and is indeed a lump of clear colourless glass. Nowadays sand is similarly blended also in the Gallic and Spanish
