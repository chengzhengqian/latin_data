<p>XXII. Even wine contains miraculous properties<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Wines with curious properties.</span></span>
One grown in Arcadia is said to produce ability to bear children in women and madness in men; whereas in Achaia, particularly in the neighbourhood of Carynia, there is a wine that is reported to prevent child-bearing, and this even if women eat the grapes when they are pregnant, although these do not differ in taste from ordinary grapes. It is said that persons who drink the wine of Troezen cannot become parents. The people of Thasos are reported to make two different kinds of wine, a wine that brings sleep and another that banishes sleep. The same place has a vine called in Greek the ‘wild-animal vine,’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL370_263_a" id="target_note_LCL370_263_a"><sup>a</sup></a> the wine made from which and also its grapes cure snake-bites, and another the ‘frankincense vine,’ with a scent like that of incense, the wine from which is used for libations to the gods. That of the vine called ‘unconsecrated,’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL370_263_b" id="target_note_LCL370_263_b"><sup>b</sup></a> on the contrary, is banned from the altars; also it is said that no bird will touch it. Egypt gives the name of ‘wine of Thasos’ to an extremely sweet native vintage which causes diarrhoea; while Lycia on the contrary has one that has an astringent effect on the bowels. Egypt also possesses a wine called in Greek ‘delivery wine’ which causes abortion. There are certain wines that, while stored in wine-lofts alter in quality at the rising of the Dog-star and afterwards change back again; the same is the case with wines shipped over sea, and it is observed that the effect of the motion on vintages that can stand it is merely to double their previous maturity.</p>
