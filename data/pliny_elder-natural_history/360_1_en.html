Melitene, the part bordering on Commagene Cataonia, that on Phrygia Garsauritis, that on Cammanene Sargaurasana, that on Galatia Morimene, where the boundary between the two countries is formed by the river Cappadox, from which the Cappadocians take their name—they were formerly called the White Syrians.

In the interior there is also the notable river Coeranus, and on the coast after Amisus the town of Chadisia with the river of the same name, and the town of Lycastus, after which the district of Themiscyra begins. The river here is the Iris,<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Themiscyra.</span></span> with a tributary the Lycus. Inland is Ziela, the city-state famous for the defeat<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL352_345_a" id="target_note_LCL352_345_a"><sup>a</sup></a> of Triarius and the victory of Gaius Caesar.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL352_345_b" id="target_note_LCL352_345_b"><sup>b</sup></a> On the coast is the river Thermodon, which rises at the fortress called Phanorias
