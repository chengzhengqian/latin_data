<p>XLVIII. Of the numerous stones that remain to<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Tufa.</span></span> be considered, tufa is unsuitable for building construction because of its short life and its softness. However, some localities, for example Carthage in Africa,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_133_c" id="target_note_LCL419_133_c"><sup>c</sup></a> have no other stone to offer. It is eaten away by evaporation from the sea, rubbed by wind, and lashed and scarred by rain. But the Carthaginians are careful to protect their house walls by coating them with pitch; for lime plaster is another thing that erodes tufa. Hence the witty remark that people there treat their buildings with pitch and their wine with lime,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_133_d" id="target_note_LCL419_133_d"><sup>d</sup></a> since that is how they temper their new wine. Other soft varieties are found near Rome in the neighbourhood of Fidenae and Alba.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_133_e" id="target_note_LCL419_133_e"><sup>e</sup></a> In Umbria and Venetia, moreover, there is a white stone that can be cut with a toothed saw.

When exposed to spray, frost or rime they break up into slabs, nor do they show much resistance to sea breezes. Travertine is split by heat, although it<span class="marginNote right">§ 46.</span>
stands up to all other forces.</p>
