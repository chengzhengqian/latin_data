There is great power too in the lungs, especially those of rams, which flatten out very efficaciously excrescences of flesh on ulcers; ewe dung too by itself, warmed under an earthen jar and kneaded, reduces swollen wounds, and cleans and heals fistulas and epinyctides.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL418_351_d" id="target_note_LCL418_351_d"><sup>d</sup></a> The greatest power, however, is in the ash of a dog’s head, which cauterizes and
