if they mated in midwinter, after midsummer; they lay nearly 40 eggs, twice in a year if the hens turn the first brood out of the nest, otherwise sixteen eggs at the most and seven at the fewest. If somebody removes the eggs, they go on laying till they burst. They do not turn strange eggs out of the nest. It pays best to put nine or eleven eggs for them to sit on. The hens sit only 30 days at a time, or if the days are rather warm, 25. The touch of a nettle is fatal to goslings, and not less so is their greediness, sometimes owing to their excessive gorging and sometimes owing to their own violence, when they have caught hold of a root in their beak and in their repeated attempts to tear it off break their own necks before they succeed. A nettle-root put under their straw after they have lain in it is a cure for nettle-sting.</p>

The eagle sits on her eggs for thirty days at a time, and so do the larger birds for the most part, but the smaller ones, for instance the kite and hawk, sit for twenty days. A kite’s brood usually numbers two chicks, never more than three, that of the bird called the merlin as many as four, and the raven’s occasionally even five; they sit for the same number of days. The hen crow is fed by the cock while sitting. The magpie’s brood numbers nine, the blackcap’s<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL353_397_b" id="target_note_LCL353_397_b"><sup>b</sup></a> over twenty and always an odd number, and no other bird has a larger brood: so much more prolific are
