<p>XXII. According to Juba sandarach or realgar and ochre are products of the island of Topazus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL394_291_a" id="target_note_LCL394_291_a"><sup>a</sup></a> in the Red Sea, but they are not imported from those parts to us. We have stated the method of making<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">XXXIV. 177.</span><span class="br"></span> sandarach. An adulterated sandarach is also made from ceruse boiled in a furnace. It ought to be flame-coloured. Its price is 5 asses per lb.</p>
<p>XXIII. If ceruse is mixed with red ochre in equal quantities and burnt, it produces sandyx or vermilion—though it is true that I observe Virgil held the view that sandyx is a plant, from the line:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">Sandyx self-grown shall clothe the pasturing</span><span class="linebreak"></span>

</p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">Its cost per lb. is half that of sandarach. No other colours weigh heavier than these.</p>
<p>XXIV. Among the artificial colours is also Syrian colour, which as we said is used as an undercoating for cinnabar and red lead. It is made by mixing sinopis and sandyx together.</p>
<p>XXV. Black pigment will also be classed among<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Black pigments.</span></span> the artificial colours, although it<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL394_291_c" id="target_note_LCL394_291_c"><sup>c</sup></a> is also derived from earth in two ways; it either exudes from the earth like the brine in salt pits, or actual earth of a sulphur colour is approved for the purpose. Painters have been known to dig up charred remains
from graves thus violated to supply it. All these plans are troublesome and new-fangled; for black paint can be made in a variety of ways from the soot produced by burning resin or pitch, owing to which
