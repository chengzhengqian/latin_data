<p>XIII. Sinopis<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL394_285_a" id="target_note_LCL394_285_a"><sup>a</sup></a> was first discovered in Pontus,<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Ochre of Sinope.</span></span> and hence takes its name from the city of Sinope. It is also produced in Egypt, the Balearic Islands
and Africa, but the best is what is extracted from the caverns of Lemnos and Cappadocia, the part found adhering to the rock being rated highest. The lumps of it are self-coloured, but speckled on the outside. It was employed in old times to give a glow. There are three kinds of Sinopis, the red, the faintly red and the intermediate. The price of the best is 2 denarii a pound: this is used for painting with a brush or else for colouring wood; the kind imported from Africa costs 8 <span class="italic">as</span>-pieces a pound, and is called chickpea colour<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL394_285_b" id="target_note_LCL394_285_b"><sup>b</sup></a>; it is of a deeper red than the other kinds, and more useful for panels. The same price is charged for the kind called ‘low toned’ which is of a very dusky colour. It is employed for the lower parts of panelling; but used as a drug it has a soothing effect in &lt;lozenges and&gt; plasters and poultices, mixing easily either dry or moistened, as a remedy for ulcers in the humid parts of the body such as the mouth and the anus. Used in an enema it arrests diarrhoea, and taken through the mouth in doses of one denarius weight it checks menstruation. Applied in a burnt state, particularly with wine, it dries roughnesses of the eyes.</p>

Some persons have wished to make out that Sinopis only consists in a kind of red-ochre of inferior quality, as they gave the palm to the red<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Ochre of Lemnos.</span></span> ochre of Lemnos. This last approximates very closely to cinnabar,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL394_285_c" id="target_note_LCL394_285_c"><sup>c</sup></a> and it was very famous in old days, together with the island that produces it; it used only to be sold in sealed packages, from which
it got the name of ‘seal red-ochre.’ It is used to
