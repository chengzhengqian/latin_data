records that near the Atlantic is a Lake Cephisis, called by the Moors Electrum, which, when thoroughly heated by the sun, produces from its mud amber that floats upon the surface of its waters. Mnaseas speaks of a district in Africa called Sicyon and of a River Crathis flowing into the Ocean from a lake, on the shores of which live the birds known as Meleager’s
Daughters<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_193_a" id="target_note_LCL419_193_a"><sup>a</sup></a> or Penelope Birds. Here amber is formed in the manner described above. Theomenes<span class="marginNote right">§ 37.</span>
tells us that close to the Greater Syrtes<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_193_b" id="target_note_LCL419_193_b"><sup>b</sup></a> is the Garden of the Hesperides and a pool called Electrum, where there are poplar trees from the tops of which amber falls into the pool, and is gathered by the daughters of Hesperus. Ctesias<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_193_c" id="target_note_LCL419_193_c"><sup>c</sup></a> states that in India there is a River Hypobarus, a name which indicates that it is the bringer of all blessings. It flows from the north into the eastern Ocean near a thickly wooded mountain, the trees of which produce amber.

off the coast of Carmania there is an island called
Serita covered with a kind of cedar, from which amber flows down on to the rocks. Xenocrates asserts that amber in Italy is known not only as ‘sucinum,’ but also as ‘thium’; and in Scythia as ‘sacrium,’ for there too it is found. He states that others suppose that it is produced from mud in Numidia. But all these authors are surpassed by the tragic poet Sophocles, and this greatly surprises me seeing that his tragedy is so serious and, moreover, his personal reputation in general stands so high, thanks
