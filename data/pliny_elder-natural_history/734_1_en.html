so mighty a power that out of what is almost a tiny ghost of an animal she has created something incomparable! What sinews or muscles can we match with such efficacy and industry as that of the bees? What men, I protest, can we rank in rationality with these insects, which unquestionably excel mankind in this, that they recognize only the common interest? Not raising the question of breath, suppose we agree as to their possessing even blood; yet what a tiny quantity can there be in these tiny creatures! After these points let us estimate their intelligence.</p>
<p>V. In winter insects go into retirement<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL353_441_a" id="target_note_LCL353_441_a"><sup>a</sup></a>—for<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Hibernation of bees.</span></span>
whence could they obtain strength to endure frost and snow and the blasts of the north wind?—all species alike, no doubt, but not for so long a period the ones that hide in our house-walls and are warmed earlier than others are. In regard to bees, either seasons or else climates have changed, or previous writers have been mistaken.

They go out to their works and to their labours, and not a single day is lost in idleness when the weather grants permission. First they construct combs<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Construction of the hive.</span></span>
and mould wax, that is, construct their homes and cells, then produce offspring, and afterwards honey, wax from flowers, bee-glue from the droppings of the gum-producing trees—the sap, glue and resin of the willow, elm and reed. They first smear the whole interior of the hive itself with these as with a kind of stucco, and then with other bitterer juices
