the water more easily than full ones; that rain water is more useful than other water for salt-works, and that fresh water has to be mixed with sea water for the salt to be deposited; that sea water freezes more slowly, and boils more quickly; that the sea is warmer in winter and Salter in autumn; that all sea water is made smooth by oil, and so divers sprinkle oil from their mouth because it calms the rough element and carries light down with them; that on the high sea no snow falls; that though all water travels downward, springs leap upwards, and springs rise even at the roots of Etna, which is so hot that it belches out sands in a ball of flame over a space of 50 to 100 miles at a time.</p>
<p>CVII. (For we must also report some marvels connected with fire, the fourth element of nature, but first those arising from water.)</p>
<p>CVIII. In Samosata the capital of Commagene<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">a Mineral pitch.</span></span> there is a marsh that produces an inflammable mud called mineral pitch. When this touches anything solid it sticks to it; also when people touch it, it actually follows them as they try to get away from it. By these means they defended the city walls when attacked<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL330_361_b" id="target_note_LCL330_361_b"><sup>b</sup></a> by Lucullus: the troops kept getting burnt by their own weapons. Water merely makes it burn more fiercely; experiments have shown that it can only be put out by earth.</p>
<p>CIX. Naphtha is of a similar natureâ€”this is the<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Naphtha.</span></span> name of a substance that flows out like liquid bitumen in the neighbourhood of Babylon and the parts of Parthia near Astacus. Naphtha has a close affinity with fire, which leaps to it at once when it sees it in any direction. This is how Medea in the legend burnt her rival, whose wreath caught fire after she had gone up to the altar to offer sacrifice.</p>
