shrub that produces the grain of Cnidus, which some call flax, the name of the shrub itself being thymelaea,<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Daphne mescreon.</span></span> which others call chamelaea, others pyros achne, some cnestor, others cneorum. It resembles the oleaster, but has narrower leaves, which when chewed have a gummy consistency; it is the size of a myrtle, and has a seed of the colour and shape of emmer, which is only used for medicinal purposes.</p>
<p>XXXVI. The goat-shrub only grows in the island of Crete; it resembles the terebinth in seed as well as in other respects; the seed is reported to be very efficacious against arrow wounds. The same island also produces a goat-thorn,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL370_167_a" id="target_note_LCL370_167_a"><sup>a</sup></a> which has the root of the white thorn, and is much preferred to the goat-thorn growing in the country of the Medes or in Achaia; its price is 3 denarii per pound.</p>
<p>XXXVII. Asia also produces the goat-plant or Scorpio, a thorn without leaves and with reddish branches,
used for medicinal purposes: Italy also has the myrica,<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Tamarisk.</span></span> which is there called the tamarisk, and Achaia the wild brya; a remarkable property of the brya is that only the cultivated kind bears fruit; this resembles a gall-nut. In Syria and Egypt this shrub is abundant, and we give the name of ‘unlucky wood’ to its timber; yet some of the timbers of Greece are unluckier, for Greece grows a tree named the ostrys, another form of the name being ostrya, which grows by itself round rocks washed by water; it is like an ash in its bark and branches, and a pear in its leaf, though the leaves are a little longer and thicker and wrinkled with indentations running all across them; the seed resembles barley in colour as well as shape. The wood is hard and solid, and it is said that if it is brought into a house it causes difficulty in child-birth
