the same bark pounded checks all kinds of gatherings. From the leaves is extracted a juice employed for the same purposes. The leaves are also decocted in wine; but by themselves with honey added they are applied to gangrenous sores. A decoction of them taken in wine or the leaves themselves applied locally with rose oil and wax are soothing.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL393_55_a" id="target_note_LCL393_55_a"><sup>a</sup></a> So used they also cure epinyctis;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL393_55_b" id="target_note_LCL393_55_b"><sup>b</sup></a> a decoction of them is healing to tooth-ache and ear-ache; the root is similarly used for the same purposes. The leaves furthermore are applied with pearl barley to spreading ulcers. A drachma by weight of the seed is taken in drink for the poison of phalangia and other spiders; it is applied however with chicken fat to boils. It is an antidote also to the poison of serpents except that of the asp. It is also good for jaundice, phthiriasis and nits, if a decoction is used as a liniment, and this too checks excessive menstruation. The ash from the tree is good for all the same purposes. They say that if it is mixed with the urine of a castrated ox and taken in either drink or food it is antaphrodisiac. A burning coal of this wood is quenched with the urine mentioned and kept in the shade. This, when you want to light it, crumbles to powder.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL393_55_ca" id="target_note_LCL393_55_ca"><sup>c</sup></a> The Magi have recorded that the urine of a eunuch also has the same effect.</p>

The conjectures of Voss put this view far more clearly. “A burning coal, when desire is quenched, is put out by such urine and stored in a shady place; if the wish to kindle desire comes back, the same coal is burned.” The rekindling of the coal rekindles sexual desire by imitative magic. This interpretation commends itself to students of folk-lore, but is based on bold and dubious conjecture.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL393_55_ca').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
