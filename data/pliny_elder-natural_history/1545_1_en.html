bowels, its seed in vinegar immediately checks hiccough. It is applied to burns and is diuretic. The juice of the decoction is good for stomach, liver, kidneys, and bladder. This is the plant that Aristophanes<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL392_351_a" id="target_note_LCL392_351_a"><sup>a</sup></a> uses to poke fun at the poet Euripides, implying that his mother had not been a seller of even proper vegetables, but only of scandix. It would be the same sort of plant as enthryscum,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL392_351_b" id="target_note_LCL392_351_b"><sup>b</sup></a> were its leaves thinner and more fragrant. Its special merit is that it gives strength to a body exhausted by sexual indulgence, and revives sexual virility when flagging through old age. It checks leucorrhoea in women.</p>
<p>XXXIX. Iasine (bindweed?) too is considered to<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Iasine.</span></span> be a wild vegetable. It creeps on the ground, is full of milky juice, and bears a white flower called conchylium. This plant too has the same merit of exciting to sexual intercourse. Eaten raw in vinegar with food it brings also a rich supply of milk to nursing mothers. It is health-giving to those suffering from consumption. Applied to the head of babies it makes the hair grow, and the scalp more retentive of it.</p>
<p>XL. Caucalis too is edible, a plant like fennel,<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Caucalis</span> (<span class="italic">Tordylium apulum</span>).</span> with a short stem and a white flower. It is good for the heart; its juice too is taken as a draught, being especially good for the stomach and urine, for expelling stone and gravel, and for irritation of the bladder. It alleviates also catarrhs of the spleen, liver and kidneys. The seed promotes menstruation, and dries up bilious secretions after childbirth. It is also prescribed for seminal fluxes in men. Chrysippus
is also of opinion that it greatly helps conception. It is taken in wine fasting. It is also applied to the wounds caused by poisonous sea creatures, as Petrichus points out in his poem.</p>
