must it be to eat them? Who was the first, Osthanes,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL418_7_a" id="target_note_LCL418_7_a"><sup>a</sup></a> to think of such devices as yours? For it is you who must bear the blame, you destroyer of human rights and worker of horrors; you were their first founder, in order, I suppose, to perpetuate your memory. Who first thought of chewing one by one human limbs? What soothsaying<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL418_7_b" id="target_note_LCL418_7_b"><sup>b</sup></a> guided him? What origin could your medical practices have had? Who made magic potions more innocent than their remedies? Granted that foreigners and barbarians had discovered the rites, did the Greeks also make these arts their own? There is extant a treatise of Democritus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL418_7_c" id="target_note_LCL418_7_c"><sup>c</sup></a> stating that one complaint is more benefited by bones from the head of a criminal, and other complaints by those of a friend or guest. Moreover, Apollonius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL418_7_d" id="target_note_LCL418_7_d"><sup>d</sup></a> put in writing that to scrape sore gums with the tooth of a man killed by violence is most efficacious, and Meletos<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL418_7_e" id="target_note_LCL418_7_e"><sup>e</sup></a> that the gall of a human being cures cataract.

From the skull of a man hanged Antaeus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL418_7_g" id="target_note_LCL418_7_g"><sup>g</sup></a> made pills to cure the bites of a mad dog. Even quadrupeds too have been cured by remedies taken from a man; to cure flatulence in oxen their horns have been pierced and human bones inserted; for sick pigs wheat has been given which had remained for a whole night where a man had been killed or cremated. Far from me and my writings be such horrors. I shall speak not of sins but of aids, such as when will prove an effective remedy the milk of lying-in women, or human saliva, or contact with a human body, and the like. I do
