water there even bronze and iron are corroded. It flows, as I have pointed out,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL418_395_a" id="target_note_LCL418_395_a"><sup>a</sup></a> for only a short distance, and a marvellous thing is related of this spring: it is embraced by the roots of a wild carob always bearing purple blossom. And a unique kind of herb flourishes on the margins of the spring. In Macedonia, not far from the tomb of the poet Euripides, two streams join, one very wholesome to drink, the other a deadly poison.</p>
