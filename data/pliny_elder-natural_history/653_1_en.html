likewise—not to carry out this census of the larder to its conclusion. The coasts of Britain were not yet in service when Orata used to advertise the fame of the products of the Lago Lucrino; but subsequently it was deemed worth while to send to the end of Italy, to Brindisi, for oysters, and to prevent a quarrel between the two delicacies the plan has lately been devised of feeding away in the Lago Lucrino the hunger caused by the long porterage from Brindisi.</p>
<p>LXXX. In the same period the elder Licinius<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Fishponds.</span></span> Murena invented fishponds for all the other sorts of fish, and his example was subsequently followed by the celebrated record of Philip and Hortensius. Lucullus had built a channel that cost more than a country house, by actually cutting through a mountain near Naples and letting in the sea; this was why Pompey the Great used to call him ‘Xerxes<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL353_279_a" id="target_note_LCL353_279_a"><sup>a</sup></a> in Roman dress.’ After his decease the fish from this pond sold for 4,000,000 sesterces.</p>

His less than moderate country estate was sold by its fishponds for 4,000,000 sesterces. Subsequently affection for individual fishes came into fashion. At Baculo in the Baiae district the pleader Hortensius had a fishpond containing a moray which he fell so deeply in love with that he is believed to have wept when it expired. At the same country house Drusus’s wife Antonia adorned his favourite moray with earrings, and its reputation made some people extremely eager to visit Baculo.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL353_279_c" id="target_note_LCL353_279_c"><sup>c</sup></a></p>
