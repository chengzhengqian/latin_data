The text in § 107 is obviously corrupt in the MSS.; Mayhoff (Appendix p. 484) calls it a <span class="italic">locus desperatus.</span>
Either Pliny spoke of both thorns or he mentioned only the Arabian, forgetting what he had said in XIII. 63. A scribe was likely enough, if Pliny made this mistake, to add a mention of the Egyptian thorn; but if Pliny had spoken only of the Egyptian a scribe would not be likely to add the Arabian. So we can either try to harmonize what is said of the two thorns, with Mayhoff, or omit all reference to the Egyptian thorn, with Urlichs and Detlefsen. That Pliny is thinking of the <span class="italic">spina Arabica</span> is shown by Dioscorides III. 13: στύφουσα, καὶ πρὸς ῥοῦν γυναικεῖον καὶ πρὸς ἀναγωγὴν αἵματος καὶ πρὸς ἄλλους ῥευματισμοὺς
