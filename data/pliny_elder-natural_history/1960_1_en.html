nevertheless artists of repute: Antaeus, Callistratus, Polycles of Athens, Callixenus, Pythocles, Pythias and Timocles.</p>
<p>After thus defining the periods of the most famous artists, I will hastily run through those of outstanding distinction, throwing in the rest of the throng here and there under various heads. The most celebrated have also come into competition with each other, although born at different periods, because they had made statues of Amazons; when these were dedicated in the Temple of Artemis of Ephesus, it was agreed that the best one should be selected by the vote of the artists themselves who were present; and it then became evident that the best was the one which all the artists judged to be the next best after their own: this is the Amazon by Polycleitus, while next to it came that of Pheidias, third Cresilas’s, fourth Cydon’s<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL394_167_a" id="target_note_LCL394_167_a"><sup>a</sup></a> and fifth Phradmon’s.
Pheidias, besides the Olympian Zeus, which<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Pheidias.</span> § 49.</span> nobody has ever rivalled, executed in ivory and gold the statue of Athene that stands erect in the Parthenon at Athens, and in bronze, besides the Amazon mentioned above, an Athene of such exquisite beauty that it has been surnamed the Fair.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL394_167_b" id="target_note_LCL394_167_b"><sup>b</sup></a> He also made the Lady<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL394_167_c" id="target_note_LCL394_167_c"><sup>c</sup></a> with the Keys, and another Athene which Aemilius Paulus dedicated in Rome<span class="marginNote right">167 <span class="sc">b.c.</span></span> ? at the temple of Today’s Fortune, and likewise a work consisting of two statues wearing cloaks which Catulus erected in the same temple, and another<span class="marginNote right">101 <span class="sc">b.c.</span></span> work, a colossal statue undraped; and Pheidias is deservedly deemed to have first revealed the capabilities and indicated the methods of statuary.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL394_167_d" id="target_note_LCL394_167_d"><sup>d</sup></a></p>
