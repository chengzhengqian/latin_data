is sufficient. The midwife Sotira has said that it is a very efficacious remedy for tertians and quartans to smear with the flux the soles of the patient’s feet, much more so if the operation is performed by the woman herself without the patient’s knowledge, adding that this remedy also revives an epileptic who has fainted. Icatidas<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL418_61_a" id="target_note_LCL418_61_a"><sup>a</sup></a> the physician assures us that quartans are ended by sexual intercourse, provided that the woman is beginning to menstruate. All are agreed that, if water or drink is dreaded after a dog-bite, if only a contaminated cloth be placed beneath the cup, that fear disappears at once, since of course that sympathy, as Greeks call it, has an all-powerful

This also is agreed, and there is nothing I would more willingly believe, that if door-posts are merely touched by the menstrual discharge, the tricks are rendered vain of the Magi, a lying crowd, as is easily ascertained. I will give the most moderate of their promises: take the parings of a patient’s finger nails and toe nails, mix with wax, say that a cure is sought for tertian, quartan or quotidian fever, and fasten them before sunrise on another man’s door as a cure for these diseases.
