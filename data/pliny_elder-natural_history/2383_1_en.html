the embellishments in the temple of Juno are those that were destined for the temple of Jupiter.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_35_a" id="target_note_LCL419_35_a"><sup>a</sup></a></p>
<p>Fame has been won in the making also of marble miniatures, namely by Myrmecides, whose Four-horse Chariot and Driver were covered by the wings of a fly,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_35_b" id="target_note_LCL419_35_b"><sup>b</sup></a> and by Callicratides, whose ants have feet and other parts too small to be discerned.</p>
<p>V. So much for the sculptors in marble and the<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">White marble and marble with markings.</span></span> artists who have achieved the greatest fame. In discussing this subject, however, I am reminded that
in those times no value was attached to marble with markings. Apart from the marble of the Cyclades,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_35_c" id="target_note_LCL419_35_c"><sup>c</sup></a> sculptors worked in that of Thasos, which rivals it, and of Lesbos, which has a slightly more bluish tinge. Markings of various colours and decorations of marble in general are first mentioned by that most accurate exponent of the details of high living, Menander, and even he rarely alludes to them.<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">c.</span> 342–290 <span class="sc">b.c.</span></span> Marble columns were certainly used in temples, not, however, as an embellishment, since embellishments as such were not yet appreciated, but merely because there was no way of erecting stronger columns. Thus they are a feature of the unfinished temple of Jupiter Olympius at Athens, from which Sulla brought columns to be used for temples on the Capitol.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_35_da" id="target_note_LCL419_35_da"><sup>d</sup></a> However, ordinary stone and marble were distinguished already in Homer,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_35_e" id="target_note_LCL419_35_e"><sup>e</sup></a> for he speaks of a man being struck by a piece of marble; but this is as far as he goes. He decorates even his royal palaces, however
