peeled off cannot be bent; nor does the male tree produce seed or a flower as the female does, and the female is thicker in the trunk and its wood is white and of superior quality. A remarkable fact in regard to the lime is that no animal will touch its fruit, whereas the juice of the leaves and bark has a sweet taste. Between the bark and the wood there are thin coats made by a number of layers of skin, made from which are the ropes called lime-withies,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL370_431_a" id="target_note_LCL370_431_a"><sup>a</sup></a> and the thinnest part of them provided lime-chaplets,
famous for the ribbons of wreaths of honour in old times. Lime-wood is worm-proof, and it makes useful timber although the tree is of extremely moderate height.</p>
<p>XXVI. The maple, which is of about the same size<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">The maple: varieties and distribution.</span></span> as the lime, is second only to the citrus in its elegance as a material for cabinet-making and in the finish it allows of. It is of several kinds: the white maple, an exceptionally light-coloured wood, is called Gallic maple, and grows in Italy north of the Po, and on the other side of the Alps; the second kind has blotches running in wavy lines, and in its finer variety has received the name<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL370_431_b" id="target_note_LCL370_431_b"><sup>b</sup></a> of ‘peacock maple’ from its resemblance to a peacock’s tail, the finest sorts growing in Istria and Tyrol; and an inferior variety is called the thick-veined maple. The Greeks distinguish the varieties by locality, saying that the maple of the plains is light-coloured and not wavy—this kind they call glinon—but the mountain maple has a rather wavy grain and is harder, the wood of the male tree being still wavier and suitable for making more elegant articles; while a third kind is the hornbeam, a reddish wood that splits easily, with a rough bark of a pale colour.
