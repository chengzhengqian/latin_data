<p>LXXIX. A second variety of wild poppy is called heraclium, by others aphron, having leaves, if you look at it from a distance, that look like sparrows.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL392_121_a" id="target_note_LCL392_121_a"><sup>a</sup></a> Its roots are on the surface of the ground, and its seed is like foam. It is from the use of this plant that linen gets its shiny whiteness. In summer it is pounded in a mortar for epilepsy, the dose being an acetabulum in white wine;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL392_121_b" id="target_note_LCL392_121_b"><sup>b</sup></a> for it causes vomiting, and is very useful for the drug called diacodion and arteriace. This preparation however is made by steeping one hundred and twenty heads of this or any other wild poppy in three sextarii of rain water for two days; then they are thoroughly boiled in the same water, and after the whole<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL392_121_c" id="target_note_LCL392_121_c"><sup>c</sup></a> has been dried it is again boiled down to one half with honey in a slow heat.
