<p>(XV) whereas all the other birds of the same class drive their chicks out of the nests and compel them to fly, as also do ravens. These not only feed on flesh themselves too, but also drive away their chicks when strong to a considerable distance. Consequently in small villages there are not more than two pairs of ravens, and in fact in the neighbourhood of Crannon in Thessaly there is one pair permanently in each place; the parents retire to make room for their offspring.</p>

bird and the one mentioned above. Ravens breed before midsummer, also they have 60 days of ill-health,
principally owing to thirst, before the figs ripen in the autumn; whereas the crow is seized with sickness from that day onward.</p>
<p>Ravens produce broods of five at most. There is a popular belief that they lay eggs, or else mate, with the beak (and that consequently if women with child eat a raven’s egg they bear the infant through the mouth, and that altogether they have a difficult delivery if raven’s eggs are brought into the house); but Aristotle says that this is not true of the raven, any more indeed than it is of the ibis in Egypt, but that the billing in question (which is often noticed) is a form of kissing, like that which takes place between pigeons. Ravens seem to be the only birds that have an understanding of the meanings that they convey in auspices; for when the guests of Medus were murdered, all the ravens in the Peloponnese and Attica flew away.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL353_313_a" id="target_note_LCL353_313_a"><sup>a</sup></a> It is a specially bad omen when they gulp down their croak as if they were choking.</p>
