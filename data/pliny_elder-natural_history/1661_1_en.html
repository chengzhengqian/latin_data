differing only a little from the agnus castus;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL393_51_a" id="target_note_LCL393_51_a"><sup>a</sup></a> it has the same colour and very nearly the same leaf as rosemary. Report says that it counteracts the poison of serpents.</p>
<p>XL. Genista also is used for cords, and has a flower<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Greenweed.</span></span>
of which bees are very fond. I wonder whether this is the plant that Greek writers have called sparton, because, as I have mentioned,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL393_51_b" id="target_note_LCL393_51_b"><sup>b</sup></a> from it the Greeks are wont to make their fishing lines, and whether Homer had it in mind when he said that “the ships’ cords<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL393_51_ca" id="target_note_LCL393_51_ca"><sup>c</sup></a> (<span class="italic">sparta</span>) were loosed.” It is certain that the Spanish or African esparto grass was not yet in use, and though ships were made with sewed seams, yet it was with flax that they were sewed and never with esparto. The seed of this plant, which the Greeks call by the same name, grows in pods like those of the cowpea, and purges instead of hellebore if a drachma and a half with four cyathi of hydromel are drunk on an empty stomach. The branches, together with the leaves, soaked in vinegar for several days and then beaten up, yield a juice beneficial for sciatica in doses of one cyathus. Some prefer to soak them in sea-water and inject as an enema.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL393_51_d" id="target_note_LCL393_51_d"><sup>d</sup></a> The same juice with the addition of oil is used as an embrocation for sciatica. Some too use the seed for strangury. Pounded genista with axle-grease
cures painful knees.</p>
