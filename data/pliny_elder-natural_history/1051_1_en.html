barrenness in a woman. But Nature, showing her
foresight in this matter also, has been rather careless
about bestowing seed on a tree that is propagated
easily even from a planted sprig. It is said however
that one variety of willow usually carries its seed till
it ripens; this grows on the island of Crete just by
the path coming down from the Cave<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL370_461_a" id="target_note_LCL370_461_a"><sup>a</sup></a> of Jupiter;
it has a hard woody seed of the size of a chick-pea.</p>
<p>XLVII. Some trees are rendered barren by a fault<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Local in fertility of fruit-trees.</span></span>
in the locality, for instance the forest of Cende<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL370_461_b" id="target_note_LCL370_461_b"><sup>b</sup></a> on Paros, which bears nothing; and the peach-trees on Rhodes only produce blossom. This peculiarity is also caused by sex, as in the kinds of trees of which the males do not bear; though some people reverse this and assert that it is the male trees that bear. Another cause of barrenness is thick growth of leaves.</p>
<p>XLVIII. Some trees producing fruit bear it both<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Position of fruit on the tree.</span></span>
on the sides and at the end of their branches, instance the pear, the pomegranate, the fig and the myrtle. In other respects they have the same nature as cereal plants, for in their case also the ear grows at the tip of the stalks, whereas beans grow on the sides. The palm-tree alone, as has been stated, <span class="marginNote right">XIII. 30.</span>
has its fruit, enclosed in spathes, hanging down in bunches.</p>
<p>XLIX. The remaining trees have their fruit underneath<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Fruit sheltered by foliage.</span></span>
their leaves for its protection, except the fig, the leaf of which is very large and gives a great deal of shade, and because of this the fruit hangs above the leaves. The fig is also the only tree whose leaf forms later than the fruit. A remarkable thing reported in the case of a certain kind of fig-tree found in Cilicia and Cyprus and on the mainland of Greece is that the figs grow underneath the leaves,
