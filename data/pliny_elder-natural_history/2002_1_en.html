efficient, while for creeping or foul ulcers ash of calcined lead is useful; and the benefit they produce is on the same lines as in the case of sheets of papyrus.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL394_251_a" id="target_note_LCL394_251_a"><sup>a</sup></a> The lead is burnt in small sheets mixed with sulphur, in shallow vessels, being stirred with iron rods or fennel stalks till the molten metal is reduced to ashes; then after being cooled off it is ground into powder. Another process is to boil lead filings in a vessel of raw earth in furnaces till the earthenware is completely baked. Some mix with it an equal amount of lead acetate<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL394_251_b" id="target_note_LCL394_251_b"><sup>b</sup></a> or of barley and grind this mixture, in the way stated in the case of<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">ยง 168.</span><span class="br"></span> raw lead, and prefer the lead treated in this way to the Cyprus slag.</p>
<p>LI. The dross of lead is also utilized. The best is that which approximates in colour most closely to yellow, containing no remnants of lead or sulphur, and does not look earthy. This is broken up into small fragments and washed in mortars till the water assumes a yellow colour, and poured off into a clean vessel, and the process is repeated several times till the most valuable part settles as a sediment at the bottom. Lead dross has the same effects as lead, but to a more active degree. This suggests a remark on the marvellous efficacy of human experiment, which has not left even the dregs of substances and the foulest refuse untested in such numerous ways!</p>
<p>LII. Slag<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL394_251_c" id="target_note_LCL394_251_c"><sup>c</sup></a> is also made from lead in the same way as from Cyprus copper; it is washed with rain<span class="marginNote right">ยง 128 <span class="italic">sqq.</span></span> water in linen sheets of fine texture and the earthy particles are got rid of by rinsing, and the residue is sifted and then ground. Some prefer to separate the powder with a feather, and to grind it up with aromatic wine.</p>
