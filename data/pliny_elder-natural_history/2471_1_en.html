Nature’s two most powerful substances, iron and fire, can be broken up by goat’s blood.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_211_a" id="target_note_LCL419_211_a"><sup>a</sup></a> But it must be steeped in blood that is fresh and still warm, and even so needs many hammer blows. Even then, it may break all but the best anvils and iron hammers. To whose researches or to what accident must we attribute this discovery? What inference could have led anyone to use the foulest of creatures for testing a priceless substance such as this? Surely it is to divinities that we must attribute such inventions and all such benefits. We must not expect to find reason anywhere in Nature, but only the evidence of will! When an ‘adamas’ is successfully broken it disintegrates into splinters so small as to be scarcely visible. These are much sought after by engravers of gems and are inserted by them into<span class="marginNote right">§ 200.</span>
iron tools because they make hollows in the hardest materials without difficulty.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_211_b" id="target_note_LCL419_211_b"><sup>b</sup></a> The ‘adamas’ has so strong an aversion to the magnet that when it is placed close to the iron it prevents the iron from being attracted away from itself. Or again, if the magnet is moved towards the iron and seizes it, the ‘adamas’ snatches the iron and takes it away.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_211_c" id="target_note_LCL419_211_c"><sup>c</sup></a> ‘Adamas’ prevails also over poisons and renders them powerless, dispels attacks of wild distraction and drives groundless fears from the mind. For this reason the Greeks sometimes call it ‘anancites,’ or ‘compulsive.’ Metrodorus of Scepsis is alone, so far<span class="marginNote right">§ 35.</span>
as I know from my own reading, in stating that ‘adamas’ is found likewise in Germany, namely on the island of Basilia, which also produces amber, and<span class="marginNote right">§ 36.</span>
in preferring this ‘adamas’ to that of Arabia. There can be no doubt that this statement is untrue.</p>
