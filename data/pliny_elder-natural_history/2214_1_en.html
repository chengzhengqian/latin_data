burned in a jar with salt, to lick which gives clearness of vision, and is a tonic to the stomach and to the whole body. This salt is also given to sheep to keep them in health, and is an ingredient of an antidote to snake bite. Some use vipers<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL418_261_a" id="target_note_LCL418_261_a"><sup>a</sup></a> . . . as food. They prescribe that, first of all, as soon as the viper has been killed, salt should be placed in its mouth until it melts; then at both ends a length of four fingers is cut off and the intestines taken out; the rest they thoroughly boil in water,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL418_261_b" id="target_note_LCL418_261_b"><sup>b</sup></a> oil, salt and dill, and either eat at once, or mix in bread so that it can be used several times. In addition to what has been said above, the broth removes lice from any part of the body, as well as itching from the surface of the skin. Even by itself, the ash of a viper’s head shows results; as ointment for the eyes it is very effective, and the same is true of viper’s fat.

The fat of snakes mixed with bronze rust heals ruptured parts of the eyes, and rubbing with their skin, or slough, cast in spring, gives clear vision. The gall of the boa also is recommended for white ulcers, cataract, and dimness, and its fat similarly for clear vision.</p>
