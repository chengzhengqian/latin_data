place is 602½ miles from Ptolemais. The phenomenon is extremely remarkable, and the topic is one involving infinitely profound research,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL352_467_b" id="target_note_LCL352_467_b"><sup>b</sup></a> it being here that the structure of the world was discovered, because Eratosthenes derived from it the idea of working out the earth’s dimensions by the certain method of noting the shadows.</p>
