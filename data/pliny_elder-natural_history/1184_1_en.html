Irrigation is most beneficial about the rising of the Dogstar, and even then not too much of it, because it hurts the roots when they are soaked to the point of intoxication. The age of the tree also controls the due amount; young saplings are not so thirsty. But those that require most watering are those that have been used to it, whereas those which have sprung up in dry places only need a bare minimum of moisture.</p>

The harsher vines need to be watered, at all events in the Fabii district of the territory of Sulmo in Italy, where they irrigate even the plough-land; and it is a remarkable fact that in that part of the country water kills herbaceous plants but nourishes corn, and irrigation takes the place of a hoe for weeding. In the same district they irrigate the land round the vines at midwinter to prevent their suffering from cold, the more so if snow is lying or there is a frost; this process is there called ‘warming’ the vines, owing to the remarkable influence of the sun on the river,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL371_173_a" id="target_note_LCL371_173_a"><sup>a</sup></a> which in summer is almost unbearably cold.</p>
