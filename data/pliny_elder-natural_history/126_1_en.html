This makes ignorance all the more disgraceful to man, especially as he admits that with some cattle diseases of the eyes increase and diminish with the moon. His excuse is the heaven’s vastness, being divided at an enormous height into 72 signs, that is, shapes of things or of animals into which the learned have mapped out the sky. In them they have indeed noted 1600 stars as being specially remarkable for their influence or their appearance, for instance the seven which they have named the Pleiades in the tail of the Bull and the Little Pigs<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL330_253_b" id="target_note_LCL330_253_b"><sup>b</sup></a> in his forehead, and Bootes<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL330_253_c" id="target_note_LCL330_253_c"><sup>c</sup></a> the star that follows the Seven Plough-oxen.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL330_253_d" id="target_note_LCL330_253_d"><sup>d</sup></a></p>

Their density and bulk are conjectured with certain inference from the fact that they obscure the sun, which is otherwise visible even to those diving into water to whatever depth.</p>
<p>XLIII. Consequently I would not go against the<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">storms caused by stars.</span></span> view that it is also possible for the fires of stars to fall from above into the clouds (as we often see happen in fine weather, and the impact of these fires unquestionably shakes the air since even weapons when flung make a hissing noise); and that when they reach the cloud, a hissing steam is produced, just as when red-hot iron is plunged into water, and a coil of
