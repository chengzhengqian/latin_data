‘smaragdus’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_169_a" id="target_note_LCL419_169_a"><sup>a</sup></a> with the figure of Amymone<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_169_b" id="target_note_LCL419_169_b"><sup>b</sup></a> engraved upon it was offered for sale at a price of six gold pieces. Ismenias ordered the sum to be paid and, when two of the pieces were returned to him, he exclaimed, ‘Heavens! I’ve been done. The stone has been robbed of much of its value.’ It is Ismenias who appears to have brought in the fashion whereby all musical accomplishments came to be assessed partly in terms of this kind of lavish display. This was the case with his contemporary and rival Dionysodorus.

As for Nicomachus, he is said to have possessed merely large numbers of stones chosen without any discrimination.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_169_c" id="target_note_LCL419_169_c"><sup>c</sup></a></p>
