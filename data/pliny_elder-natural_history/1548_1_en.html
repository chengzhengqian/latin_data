Boiled in oil and in the skin of a pomegranate the root is also a remedy for complaints of the ears. All these preparations must be made from the white kind. Cleemporus says that the dark kind must not be eaten, because it causes diseases, but he agrees to the use of the white. Agathocles asserts that its juice counteracts even the poison of bull’s<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL392_357_a" id="target_note_LCL392_357_a"><sup>a</sup></a> blood, yet since it is agreed that the dark kind has cooling properties, pearl barley must therefore be added to the application. Zeno recommends the root of the white kind for strangury.</p>
<p>XLV.

Next to the ground it grows a gum, an excrescence the size of a bean,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL392_357_c" id="target_note_LCL392_357_c"><sup>c</sup></a> a pessary of which is said to promote menstruation. The whole<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL392_357_da" id="target_note_LCL392_357_da"><sup>d</sup></a> with the roots is pounded and divided into lozenges as an antidote for snake bites, for which treatment good reason can be adduced, for field mice wounded by snakes are said to eat it. A decoction of the plant in wine checks looseness of the bowels. The same makes an excellent substitute for gum to keep the eye-lashes tidy, however disordered these may be. Dorotheus declares in his verses that it is good for the stomach and the digestion.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL392_357_e" id="target_note_LCL392_357_e"><sup>e</sup></a> For the rest, it has been supposed to be bad for women, for the eyes, and for the virility of men.</p>
