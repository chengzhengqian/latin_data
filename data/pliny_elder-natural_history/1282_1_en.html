<p>The life of men in early times was rude and<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Danger periods.</span></span> illiterate; but nevertheless it will be found that mere observation was not less ingenious among them than theory is now. There were three seasons which they had to fear for their crops, and on this account they instituted the holidays and festivals of Robigalia, Floralia and Vinalia. Numa in the eleventh year of<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">trad. dates</span> 715–672 <span class="sc">b.c.</span></span>
his reign established the Feast of Robigalia, which is now kept on April 25, because that is about the time when the crops are liable to be attacked by mildew. Varro has given this date as fixed by the sun occupying the tenth degree of the Bull, as theory then stated; but the true explanation is that on one or other (according to the latitude of the various observers) of the four days from the twenty-ninth<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL371_369_a" id="target_note_LCL371_369_a"><sup>a</sup></a> day after the spring equinox to April 28 the Dog sets, a constellation of violent influence in itself and the setting of which is also of necessity preceded<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL371_369_b" id="target_note_LCL371_369_b"><sup>b</sup></a> by the setting of the Little Dog. So the same people in 238 <span class="sc">b.c.</span> in obedience to the Sibyl’s oracles, instituted the Floralia on April 23, in order that all vegetation might shed its blossom favourably. This day is dated by Varro at the sun’s entering the 14th degree of the Bull; consequently if full moon falls within these four days, the crops and all the vegetation then in flower will inevitably suffer injury. The First Vinalia,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL371_369_c" id="target_note_LCL371_369_c"><sup>c</sup></a> established in former days on April 23 for tasting the wines, has no reference to the fruits of the earth, nor yet have the festivals so far mentioned to the vines and olives, because their sprouting begins at the rise of the Pleiads, on May 10, as we<span class="marginNote right">XVI. 104, XVII, 11, XVIII. 248.</span>
