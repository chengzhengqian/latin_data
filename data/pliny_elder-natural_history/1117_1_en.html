adds the employment of the lightest kind of horse-dung for manuring cornfields, but for meadowland the heavier manure produced by feeding barley to horses, which produces an abundant growth of grass. Some people even prefer stable-manure to cowdung and sheeps’ droppings to goats’, but they rate asses’ dung above all other manures, because asses chew their fodder very slowly; but experience on the contrary pronounces against each of these. It is however universally agreed that no manure is more beneficial than a crop of lupine turned in by the plough or with forks before the plants form pods, or else bundles of lupine after it has been cut, dug in round the roots of trees and vines; and in places where there are no cattle they believe in using the stubble itself or even bracken for manure.</p>
<p>Cato says<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL371_39_a" id="target_note_LCL371_39_a"><sup>a</sup></a>: ‘You can make manure of stable-litter, lupines, chaff, bean-stalks and holm-oak or oak leaves. Pull up the dane-wort and hemlock out of the crop, and the high grass and sedge growing round osier beds; use this as litter for sheep, and rotten leaves for oxen.’—‘If a vine is making poor growth, make a bonfire of its shoots and plough in the ashes therefrom.’ He also says: ‘Where you are going to sow corn, give your sheep a free run on the land.’</p>
<p>VII. Moreover Cato also says<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL371_39_b" id="target_note_LCL371_39_b"><sup>b</sup></a> that there are certain<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Crops that fertilize.</span></span>
crops which themselves nourish the land: ‘Cornland is manured by grain, lupine, beans and vetches’; just as on the contrary: ‘Chick-pea, because it is pulled up by the roots and because it is salt, barley, fenugreek, bitter vetch,—these all scorch up<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL371_39_c" id="target_note_LCL371_39_c"><sup>c</sup></a> a cornland, as do all plants that are pulled up by the roots. Do not plant stone-fruit<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL371_39_d" id="target_note_LCL371_39_d"><sup>d</sup></a> in corn-land.’—Virgil holds the opinion<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Georg</span>.I. 77.</span>
that cornland is also scorched by flax, oats and poppies.</p>
