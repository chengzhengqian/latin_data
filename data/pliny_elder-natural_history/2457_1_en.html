Cornelius Bocchus mentions, furthermore, that rock-crystal of quite exceptional weight was found in Portugal, in the Ammaeensian mountains, when wells were being sunk to water-level. The surprising remark is made by Xenocrates of Ephesus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_183_a" id="target_note_LCL419_183_a"><sup>a</sup></a> that in Asia Minor and Cyprus rock-crystal is turned up by the plough, for previously it was not thought to occur in soil, but only amidst rocks. A more plausible statement made by the same Xenocrates is that it is also often carried down by torrents. Sudines maintains that<span class="marginNote right">XXXVI. 59.</span>
