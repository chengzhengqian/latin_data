<p>LXV. Holosteon (all-bone) is a plant with nothing<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Holosteon.</span></span> hard about it, the name being an antiphrasis coined by the Greeks, just as they call gall sweet. Its root is so slender as to look like hair. Four fingers long, the plant has narrow leaves like grass and an astringent taste, growing on hills with deep soil. Taken in wine for sprains and ruptures it also closes wounds, for it even fastens together pieces of meat when boiled with them.</p>
<p>LXVI. Hippophaeston is to be found<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL393_445_a" id="target_note_LCL393_445_a"><sup>a</sup></a> among the<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Hippophaestum.</span></span> thorns out of which fullers’ pots are made up, having no stem, no blossom, but only little, hollow heads and many small leaves of the colour of grass. Its little roots are whitish and soft.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL393_445_b" id="target_note_LCL393_445_b"><sup>b</sup></a> Their juice is extracted in summer; the dose to open the bowels is three oboli, being used especially in epilepsy, palsy, dropsy, and to treat giddiness, orthopnoea, and incipient paralysis.</p>
<p>LXVII. Hypoglossa has leaves shaped like those of<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Hypoglossa.</span></span> wild myrtle, concave, prickly, and on them as it were tongues, small leaves growing out of the leaves proper. A chaplet made from these and placed on the head relieves headache.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL393_445_c" id="target_note_LCL393_445_c"><sup>c</sup></a></p>
<p>LXVIII. Hypecoön grows in cornfields and has<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Hypecoön.</span></span> leaves like those of rue. Its properties are those of poppy juice.</p>

καὶ λεπτῇ ἔχων τὰ φύλλα ὅμοια, κόμην δὲ ἀκανθώδη καὶ ἐπ᾿
ἄκρου οἱονεὶ γλωττίδας, παραφύσεις μικρὰς παρὰ τοῖς φύλλοις.
δοκεῖ δὲ ἡ κόμη περίαμμα εἶναι χρήσιμον κεφαλαλγοῦσι. The reason why Mayhoff emended <span class="italic">concava</span> to <span class="italic">coma</span> is clear, but the Greek and the Latin, although very alike, have some differences, the greatest perhaps being Pliny’s <span class="italic">corona</span> where the Greek has κόμη. The Latin <span class="italic">coma,</span> and also κόμη, are difficult words, and there is no English word that will serve as a translation on every occasion. Some remarks on them will be found on pp. 482–483.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL393_445_c').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
