Africa and Cyprus, is leek-green in colour, but is
marked with blood-red streaks. The name is explained by the fact that, when the stone is dropped into a vessel of water and bright sunshine falls upon it, in reflecting the sunlight it changes it into the colour of blood. This is true especially of the Ethiopian variety. When it is out of water, the same stone catches the sunlight like a mirror and detects solar eclipses, showing the passage of the moon below the sun’s disc.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_299_a" id="target_note_LCL419_299_a"><sup>a</sup></a> Here, moreover, we have quite the most blatant instance of effrontery on the part of the Magi, who say that when the heliotrope plant is joined to the stone and certain prayers are pronounced over them the wearer is rendered invisible. The ‘Hephaestitis,’ or ‘Hephaestus<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Hephaestitis.</span></span>

The test of its genuineness is that boiling water when poured over it should cool immediately; or, alternatively, that when placed in the sun it should immediately set fire to a parched substance.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_299_b" id="target_note_LCL419_299_b"><sup>b</sup></a> The stone is found at Corycus.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_299_c" id="target_note_LCL419_299_c"><sup>c</sup></a> The Hermu aedoeon,’ or ‘sexual organ of<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Hermu aedoeon.</span></span>
