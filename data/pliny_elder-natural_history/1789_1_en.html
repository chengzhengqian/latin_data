<p>XXXVI. Nymphaea too in a dry wine loosens the bowels, as also does pycnocomon, which has leaves like rocket, but thicker and more acrid,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL393_307_a" id="target_note_LCL393_307_a"><sup>a</sup></a> a round root of a yellow colour and an earthy smell, a quadrangular stem, of moderate length and slender, and the blossom of basil. It is found on stony ground. Its root, taken in hydromel in doses of two denarii by weight, thoroughly purges the bowels of bile and phlegm. A drachma of the seed, taken in wine, causes wild dreams.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL393_307_ba" id="target_note_LCL393_307_ba"><sup>b</sup></a> Capnos trunca also carries away bile.</p>
<p>XXXVII. Of polypodium, a plant called by<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Polypodium.</span></span>
Romans filicula, being like a fern (<span class="italic">filix</span>), the root is medicinal, hairy, grass-green inside, as thick as the
little finger, with indented edges so as to look like a polypus’s arms, of a sweetish taste, and to be found<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL393_307_c" id="target_note_LCL393_307_c"><sup>c</sup></a> in stony soils or under old trees. The juice is extracted from the root soaked in water, and chopped up fine the root itself is sprinkled on cabbage, beet, mallows and pickled fish, or else boiled with gruel to make a gentle aperient usable even in fever. It brings away bile and phlegm, although injurious to the stomach. Dried and reduced to powder it eats away polypus if pushed up the nostrils. There is no flower and no seed.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL393_307_c" id="target_note_LCL393_307_c"><sup>c</sup></a></p>
