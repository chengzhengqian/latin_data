and Scandira; across the Gulf of Saloniki Iresia Solymnia, Eudemia and Nea, the last an island sacred to Minerva; across the Gulf of Athos lie four islands, Piperi with the town of that name and formerly called Evoenus, 9 miles off, Sciathos 15 miles, and Embro with its town 88 miles; the distance between Embro and Mastusia on the Gallipoli Peninsula is 22 miles. Embro is 62½ miles in circuit; it is watered by the river Ilissus. Twenty-two miles from Embro is Stalimene, which lies 87<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL352_173_a" id="target_note_LCL352_173_a"><sup>a</sup></a> miles from Mount Athos; its circuit measures 115½ miles, and on it are the towns of Hephaestia and Myrina—the market place of the latter is reached by the shadow of Mount Athos<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL352_173_b" id="target_note_LCL352_173_b"><sup>b</sup></a> at mid-summer. Six miles from Stalimene is Thasos, a free state, formerly called Aeria or Aethria; Abdera on the mainland is 22 miles from Thasos, and Athos 62½ miles, and the island of Samothrace, a free state, off the river Maritza, is the same distance from Thasos, 32 miles from Embro, 22½ from Stalimene, and 38 from the coast of Thrace; its circuit measures 35 miles, and on it rises Monte Nettuno, which is 10 miles high.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL352_173_c" id="target_note_LCL352_173_c"><sup>c</sup></a> Embro gives the worst anchorage for vessels of all the islands. It is mentioned by Callimachus under its ancient name of Dardania.</p>

We may also specify the names of uninhabited islands in the Gulf so far as we have been able to ascertain them: Avesticos, Sarnos, Cissyros, Charbrusa, Calathusa, Scyllia, Dialeon, Dictaea, Melanthia, Dracanon,
