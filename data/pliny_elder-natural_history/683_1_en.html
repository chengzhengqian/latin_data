<p>XXXV. Blackbirds, thrushes and starlings also<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Other migrants</span></span>
migrate in a similar way to neighbouring districts; but these do not moult their plumage, and do not
go into hiding, being often seen in the places where they forage for winter food. Consequently in Germany thrushes are most often seen in winter. The turtle-dove goes into hiding in a truer sense, and moults its feathers. Wood-pigeons also go into retreat, though in their case also it is not certain exactly where. It is a peculiarity of the starling kind that they fly in flocks and wheel round in a sort of circular ball, all making towards the centre of the flock. The swallow is the only bird that has an extremely swift and swerving flight, owing to which it is also not liable to capture by the other kinds of birds. Also the swallow is the only bird that only feeds when on the wing.</p>
<p>XXXVI. There is a great difference in the seasons<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Their periods.</span></span>
of birds; some stay all the year round, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> pigeons, some for six months, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> swallows, some for three months, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> thrushes and turtle-doves and those that migrate when they have reared their brood, such as woodpeckers and hoopoes.</p>
<p>XXXVII. Some authorities state that every year<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">An African migrant.</span></span>
birds fly from Ethiopia to Troy and have a fight at Memnon’s tomb, and consequently they call them
‘Memnon’s daughters.’ Cremutius records having discovered that every four years they do the same things in Ethiopia round the royal palace of Memnon.</p>
