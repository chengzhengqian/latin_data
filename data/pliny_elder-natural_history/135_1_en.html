fall back again to the earth drawing over it an envelope of cloud; these occur in a variety of forms. The fact is that their onrush is quite irregular, like that of mountain torrents (as we have pointed out<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL330_271_b" id="target_note_LCL330_271_b"><sup>b</sup></a> is the view of certain persons), and they give forth thunder and lightning. If travelling with a heavier momentum they burst a great gap in a dry cloud, they produce a storm called by the Greeks a cloudburst; but if they break out from a downward curve of cloud<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL330_271_c" id="target_note_LCL330_271_c"><sup>c</sup></a> with a more limited rotation, they cause a whirl unaccompanied by fire—I mean by lightning—that
is called a typhoon, which denotes a whirling cloudburst. This brings down with it a portion of heat torn from a cloud, which it turns and whirls round, increasing its own downward velocity by its weight, and shifting from place to place with a rapid whirl; it is specially disastrous to navigators, as it twists round and shatters not only the yards, but the vessels themselves, leaving only the slender remedy of pouring out vinegar in advance of its approach, vinegar being a very cold substance. The same whirlwind when beaten back by its very impact snatches things up and carries them back with it to the sky, sucking them high aloft.</p>

case of a storm, and is accompanied by a crashing noise, this is what they call a whirlwind, which overthrows everything in its neighbourhood. When the same rages hotter and with a fiery flow, it is called a <span class="italic">prester,</span> as while sweeping away the things it comes in contact with it also scorches them up. But a
