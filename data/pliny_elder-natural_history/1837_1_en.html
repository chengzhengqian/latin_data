two drachmae, a moderate one four, the maximum being six. When given as a purge it is taken in chicken broth.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL393_403_aa" id="target_note_LCL393_403_aa"><sup>a</sup></a></p>

When
it puts forth its leaves, they are like the ears of little mice.

Alsine would be just the same as helxine, were it not that it is smaller and less hairy.

It is used for gatherings and inflammations, and for all purposes for which helxine is employed, but with less efficacy.

Dioscorides tells us that the bowels might be injured by the use of alypon, and in § 95 we learn that chicken broth was used to mitigate such harmful effects. The various readings show that the text is corrupt. It is very strange that <span class="italic">iure,</span> the practically certain emendation of Hermolaus Barbarus, should appear in no extant MS.; the variants give some support to Mayhoff’s
