of pure balsam thickens in warm water, settling to the bottom of the vessel, whereas when adulterated it floats on the top like oil, and if it has been tampered with by using metopium, a white ring forms round it. The best test of all is that it will cause milk to curdle and will not leave stains on cloth. In no other case is more obvious fraud practised, inasmuch as every pint bought at a sale of confiscated property for 300 denarii when it is sold again makes 1000 denarii: so much does it pay to increase the quantity of adulteration. The price of wood-balsam is six denarii a pound.</p>
<p>LV. The region of Syria beyond Phoenicia nearest<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">styrax (Storax officinalis).</span></span> to Judaea produces styrax in the part round Gabala and Marathus and Mount Casius in Seleucia. The tree has the same name; it is similar to a quince. Its tears have a pleasant, almost pungent scent, and inside it resembles a reed, and is full of juice. About the rising of the Dog-star certain little maggots with wings flutter about this tree, gnawing away the wood, and consequently it is fouled with their scrapings. The styrax esteemed next to the above-named growths comes from Pisidia, Side, Cyprus and Cilicia, and that from Crete is rated lowest; that from Mount Amanus in Syria is valued by the medical profession, but even more by perfumiers. In every nation a red colour and sticky consistency are preferred, and styrax that is brown and covered with white mould is considered inferior. It is adulterated with cedrus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL370_87_a" id="target_note_LCL370_87_a"><sup>a</sup></a> resin or gum, and another way employs honey or bitter almonds; all these adulterations can be detected by their taste. The price of the best styrax is 17 denarii. It is also produced in Pamphylia, but this is a drier and less juicy kind.</p>
