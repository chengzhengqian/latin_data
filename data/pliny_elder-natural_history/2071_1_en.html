Mausolus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL394_389_a" id="target_note_LCL394_389_a"><sup>a</sup></a> at Halicarnassus, buildings still standing.<span class="marginNote right">377–353 <span class="sc">b.c.</span></span> Murena and Varro in their aedileship had some plaster work on brick walls at Sparta cut away, and because of the excellence of its painting had it enclosed in wooden frames and brought to Rome to decorate the Assembly-place. It was in itself a wonderful piece of work, yet its transfer caused even more admiration. In Italy also there is a brick wall at Arezzo and at Mevania. Structures of this sort are not erected in Rome, because an eighteen-inch wall will only carry a single storey, and there is a regulation forbidding any partition exceeding that thickness: nor does the system used for party-walls permit of it.</p>
<p>L. Let this be what we say about bricks. Among<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Sulphur.</span></span> the other kinds of earth the one with the most remarkable properties is sulphur, which exercises a great power over a great many other substances. Sulphur occurs in the Aeolian Islands between Sicily and Italy, which we have said are volcanic, but the most<span class="marginNote right">III, 92 ff.</span> famous is on the island of Melos. It is also found in Italy, in the territory of Naples and Campania, on the hills called the Leucogaei. It is there dug out of mine-shafts and dressed with fire. There are four kinds: live sulphur, the Greek name for which means ‘untouched by fire,’ which alone forms as a solid mass—for all the other sorts consist of liquid and are prepared by boiling in oil; live sulphur is dug up, and it is translucent and of a green colour; it is the only one of all the kinds that is employed by doctors. The second kind is called ‘clod-sulphur,’
and is commonly found only in fullers’
