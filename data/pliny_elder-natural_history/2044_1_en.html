His works include...<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL394_335_a" id="target_note_LCL394_335_a"><sup>a</sup></a> on the capture of a town, showing an infant creeping to the breast of its mother who is dying of a wound; it is felt that the mother is aware of the child and is afraid that as her milk is exhausted by death it may suck blood; this picture had been removed by Alexander the Great<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL394_335_b" id="target_note_LCL394_335_b"><sup>b</sup></a> to his native place, Pella. The same artist painted a Battle<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL394_335_c" id="target_note_LCL394_335_c"><sup>c</sup></a> with the Persians, a panel that contains a hundred human figures, which he parted with to Mnason the Tyrant of Elatea on the terms of ten minae per man. He also painted a Four-horse Chariots Racing, a Suppliant, who almost appeared to speak, Huntsmen with Quarry, Leontion Epicurus’s mistress, and Woman<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL394_335_d" id="target_note_LCL394_335_d"><sup>d</sup></a> At Rest through Love of her Brother; and likewise the Dionysus and the Ariadne once on view in the Temple of Ceres at Rome, and the Tragic Actor and Boy in the Temple of Apollo, a picture of which the beauty has perished owing to the lack of skill of a painter commissioned by Marcus Junius as praetor to clean it in readiness for the festival of the Games of Apollo. There has also been on view in the Temple of Faith in the Capitol his picture of an Old Man with a Lyre giving lessons to a Boy. He also painted a Sick Man which has received unlimited praise; and he was so able an artist that King Attalus is said to have bought a single picture of his for a hundred talents.</p>
<p>Protogenes also flourished at the same time, as has<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Protogenes.</span></span> been said. He was born at Caunus, in a community<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">§ 81.</span><span class="br"></span> that was under the dominion of Rhodes. At the outset he was extremely poor, and extremely devoted to his art and consequently not very productive.
