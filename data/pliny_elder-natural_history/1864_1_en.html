grows in meadows. A decoction of its stalks, a handful in a dry wine, is a cure for toothache, but it must be kept in the mouth.</p>
<p>LXXXV. Othonna grows in Syria. It is like<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Othonna.</span></span> eruca, has leaves full of holes and a saffron flower. This is why some have called it anemone. Its juice is a suitable ingredient of eye salves, for it is slightly biting, warming, and astringent, because of its drying nature; it clears away scars, films and all obstructions. Some say that it is washed, and then, after drying, worked up into lozenges.</p>
<p>LXXXVI. Onosma has long leaves up to about<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Onosma.</span></span> three fingers in length, lying on the ground like those of anchusa. It has no stem, no blossom and no seed.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL393_457_a" id="target_note_LCL393_457_a"><sup>a</sup></a> If a woman with child should eat it or step over it, she is said to miscarry.</p>

<p>LXXXVIII. Osyris bears dark twigs, slender and<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Osyris.</span></span> pliant, on which are dark leaves like those of flax. The seed on the twigs is black to begin with, and then the colour changes to red. From them are made cosmetics for women. A decoction of the roots taken by the mouth cures jaundice. These roots also, if cut off before the seed ripens and dried in the sun, check looseness of the bowels; but, if dug up after the ripening and boiled down in gruel, they are good treatment for catarrhs of the belly, and by themselves they are beaten up and taken in rain water.</p>
