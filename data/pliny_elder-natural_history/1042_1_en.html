and it makes no difference if they budded earlier, inasmuch as some trees are the first to bud and among the last to be stripped of their leaves, for instance almonds, ash-trees, elders, whereas the mulberry is the latest to bud and one of the first to shed its leaves. The soil also has a great influence in this matter: the leaves fall earlier on dry, thin soils, and earlier with an old tree, in many cases even before the fruit can ripen, for instance, in the case of the late fig and the winter pear and apple, and with the pomegranate the fruit is the only thing visible on the parent tree. But not even with the trees that always keep their foliage do the same leaves last on with others shooting up beneath themâ€”when
this happens the old leaves wither away, this occurring mostly about the solstices.</p>
<p>XXXV. Each of the trees in its own kind has a permanent<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Varieties of foliage.</span></span> uniformity of leaf, with the exception of the poplar, the ivy and the croton (which, as we have said,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">xv. 24.</span><span class="br"></span> is also called the cici). There are three kinds of poplars, the white, the black and the one called the Libyan poplar, which has a very small and very dark leaf and which is very famous for the mushrooms that grow on it. The white poplar has a leaf of two colours, white on the upper side and green underneath. With this tree and the black poplar and the croton the leaves are exactly circular when young but project into angles when older; whereas the leaves of the ivy are angular at first but become round. From the leaves of the white poplar springs out a quantity of shiny white down, and when the foliage is specially thick the trees are white all over like fleeces. Pomegranate and almond trees have reddish leaves.</p>
