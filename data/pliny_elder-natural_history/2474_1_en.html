On the contrary, it combines body and clarity, and, wherever one peers through the stones, reproduces the transparency of sea-water, the stones being in an equal degree translucent and brilliant. In other words, they dissipate their colour and also allow the sight to penetrate within. There is a story that in this island there stood on the burial-mound of a prince named Hermias, not far from the tunny-fisheries, the marble statue of a lion, into which had been inserted eyes made of ‘smaragdus’;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_217_b" id="target_note_LCL419_217_b"><sup>b</sup></a> and these, it is said, blazed so brightly, even far below the surface of the sea, that the tunnies fled in terror, and the fishermen were long puzzled by this strange behaviour until finally they changed the gemstones in the eye-sockets.</p>

But since high prices are so freely paid for these stones, it is only right that we should point out their defects, some of which are common to every kind, while others are regional peculiarities, as with human beings. Thus the Cyprian stones show various shades of sea-green, and these may be more or less intense in different parts of the same ‘smaragdus,’ so that the stones do not always maintain the familiar uniform deep colour of the Scythian variety. Moreover, some stones are traversed by a ‘shadow’; this makes the colour dull, and the fainter the colour, the more serious the defect. In accordance with these defects, ‘smaragdi’ are divided into classes, some, which are called ‘blind,’ being opaque, while
