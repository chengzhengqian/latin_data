which ensures that there are cones ripening in every single month of the year. Pine-cones that split while still on the tree are called azaniae, and if they are not removed they injure the rest of the crop.</p>
<p>XLV. The only trees that bear no fruit—I mean not<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Barren species</span></span>
even seed—are the tamarisk, which is of no use except for making brooms,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL370_459_a" id="target_note_LCL370_459_a"><sup>a</sup></a> the poplar, the alder, the Atinian elm and the alaternus, the leaves of which are between those of the holm-oak and the olive; but trees that never grow from seed nor bear fruit are considered to be unlucky and under a curse. Cremutius states that the tree from which Phyllis<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL370_459_b" id="target_note_LCL370_459_b"><sup>b</sup></a> hanged herself is never green. People open gum-producing trees after they have budded, but the gum does not thicken until after the fruit has been removed.</p>
<p>XLVI. Sapling trees have no fruit as long as they<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Varying liability to damage of fruit.</span></span>

The trees most liable to lose their fruit before it ripens are the palm, the fig, the almond, the apple and the pear, and also the pomegranate, which excessive dew and frost cause to lose its flower as well. In consequence of this people bend down its branches, lest if they shoot straight upright they may receive and retain the moisture which is injurious to them. The pear and almond lose their blossom even if it does not rain but a south wind sets in or the sky is cloudy, and if that sort of weather has prevailed after they have shed their blossom, they lose their first fruit. But it is the willow that loses its seed most quickly, before it approaches ripeness at all. This is the reason why Homer gives it the epithet ‘fruit-losing’;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL370_459_c" id="target_note_LCL370_459_c"><sup>c</sup></a> but succeeding ages have interpreted the meaning of the word in the light of its own wicked conduct, inasmuch as it is well known that willow seed taken as a drug produces
