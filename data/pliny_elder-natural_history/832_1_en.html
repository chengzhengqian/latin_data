<p>XV. There is also in India a grain resembling that of<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Other Indian trees.</span></span> pepper, but larger and more brittle, called the caryophyllon,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL370_23_a" id="target_note_LCL370_23_a"><sup>a</sup></a>
which is reported to grow on the Indian lotus-tree; it is imported here for the sake of its
scent. There is also a thorn-bush bearing an extremely bitter fruit that has a resemblance to pepper; this shrub has small thickly clustering leaves like the henna<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL370_23_b" id="target_note_LCL370_23_b"><sup>b</sup></a>; the branches are 4 1/2 feet long, the bark of a pale colour, and the root wide-spreading and woody, of the colour of box. This root boiled in water with the seed in a copper vessel produces the medicine called lycion. The thorn in question also grows on Mount Pelion, where it is used for mixing with a drug, as also are the root of the asphodel, ox-gall, wormwood, sumach and the lees of olive oil. The best lycion for medicinal purposes is the kind that makes a froth; this<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL370_23_c" id="target_note_LCL370_23_c"><sup>c</sup></a> is imported from India in leather bottles made of camel skin or rhinoceros hide. The shrub itself is sometimes known in Greece under the name of Chiron’s buckthorn.</p>

same name, which I have been unable to identify. This bark boiled with honey is considered in medicine to be a valuable specific for dysentery.</p>
<p>XVII. Arabia also produces tabaschir, but that<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">‘Sugar,’</span></span> grown in India is more esteemed. It is a kind of honey that collects in reeds, white like gum, and brittle to the teeth; the largest pieces are the size
of a filbert. It is only employed as a medicine.</p>
