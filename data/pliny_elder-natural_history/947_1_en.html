centuries ago almost innumerable kinds of artificial wine have been invented, which we will now specify,

What is called vine-flower wine is made from the claret vine, that is the wild vine, by steeping two pounds of the flowers of this plant in a jar of must; 30 days afterwards they are changed. Beside this the root and the grape-skins of the claret-vine are used in dressing leather. These grape-skins, a little after the blossom has gone off, provide a remarkable specific for cooling attacks of feverish heat in cases of disease, being said to be of an extremely cold nature. A portion of these grapes die off from the heat before the rest—these are called midsummer grapes; the whole of them never come to maturity, and if a bunch in an unripe state before it completely withers is fed to poultry it produces in them a distaste for stealing grapes.</p>

weak wine, is made from real wine in the following. manner: ten quarts of white must and half that quantity of water are kept boiling till a considerable amount of the water is boiled away. Other people
put in five quarts of sea-water and the same amount of rain-water and leave the mixture in the sun for 40 days to evaporate. This drink is given to invalids for whom it is feared that wine may be harmful.</p>
