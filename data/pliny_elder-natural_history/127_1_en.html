smoke whirls up. And I agree that these produce storms, and if there is wind or steam struggling in the cloud, it gives out claps of thunder, if it bursts out on fire, flashes of lightning, if it forces its way on a longer track, heat-lightning. The latter cleaves the cloud, the flashes burst through it, and thunderclaps are the blows of the fires colliding, causing fiery cracks at once to flash out in the clouds. It is also possible for breath emerging from the earth, when pressed down by the counter-impact of the stars, to be checked by a cloud and so cause thunder, nature choking down the sound while the struggle goes on but the crash sounding when the breath bursts out, as when a skin is stretched by being blown into. It is also possible for this breath, whatever it is, to be set on fire by the friction during its headlong progress. It is also possible for it to be struck out by the impact of the clouds, as by that of two stones, with heat-lightning flashing out like sparks. But all these occurrences are accidental—they cause mere senseless and ineffectual thunder-claps, as their coming obeys no principle of nature—they merely cleave mountains and seas, and all their other blows are ineffectual; but the former<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL330_255_a" id="target_note_LCL330_255_a"><sup>a</sup></a> are prophetical and sent from on high, they come by fixed causes and from their own stars.</p>

Similarly I am not prepared to deny that<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Air currents caused by contour of the earth.</span></span> it is possible for winds or rather gusts of air to be produced also by a dry and parched breath from the earth, and also possible when bodies of water breathe out a vapour that is neither condensed into mist or solidified into clouds; and also they may be caused by the driving force of the sun, because wind is understood to be nothing else than a wave of air;
