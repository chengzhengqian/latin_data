<p>XXIV. Of all fish, river or sea, the fats, melted in the sun and mixed with honey, are very good for clearness of vision, and so is beaver oil and honey. The gall of the star-gazer heals scars, and removes superfluous flesh about the eyes. No other fish has a greater abundance of gall; this opinion, Menander<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL418_507_a" id="target_note_LCL418_507_a"><sup>a</sup></a> too expresses in his comedies. This fish is also called uranoscopos,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL418_507_b" id="target_note_LCL418_507_b"><sup>b</sup></a> from the eye which it has in its head. The gall of the coracinus too improves vision, and that of the red sea-scorpion with old oil and Attic honey disperses incipient cataract; it should be applied as ointment three times, once every other day. The same treatment removes albugo from the eyes. A diet of mullet is said to dull the eye-sight.

Swellings and redness of the eyes are soothed by an application of sepia bone with woman’s milk, and by itself it is good for roughness of the lids. In this cure they turn up the lids, taking off the ointment after a little time, treat the part with rose-oil and soothe with a bread-poultice. The bone is also good treatment for night-blindness, if ground to powder and applied in vinegar. Reduced to ash it brings away scales; with honey it heals scars on the eyes; with salt and cadmia, a drachma of each, it heals inflammatory swellings, and also albugo in cattle.
