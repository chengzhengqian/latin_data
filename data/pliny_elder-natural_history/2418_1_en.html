ability to attract another magnet to itself.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_105_a" id="target_note_LCL419_105_a"><sup>a</sup></a> All magnets, incidentally, are useful for making up eye-salves if each is used in its correct quantity, and are particularly effective in stopping acute watering of the eyes. They also cure burns when ground and calcined. Also in Ethiopia and at no great distance is another mountain, (the ore from) which on the contrary repels and rejects all iron.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_105_b" id="target_note_LCL419_105_b"><sup>b</sup></a> Both of these properties have already been discussed by me on several occasions.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_105_c" id="target_note_LCL419_105_c"><sup>c</sup></a></p>

<p>XXVII. At Assos in the Troad we find the Sarcophagus<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">The Sarcophagus stone.</span></span>
stone, which splits along a line of cleavage. It is well known that corpses buried in it are consumed within a period of forty days, except for the teeth.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_105_e" id="target_note_LCL419_105_e"><sup>e</sup></a> Mucianus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_105_f" id="target_note_LCL419_105_f"><sup>f</sup></a> vouches for the fact that mirrors, scrapers, clothes and shoes placed upon the dead bodies are turned to stone as well. There are similar stones
both in Lycia and in the East; and these, when attached even to living persons, eat away their bodies.</p>
