Some people think that male frankincense is so called from its resemblance to the testes. The frankincense most esteemed, however, is the breast-shaped, formed when, while a previous drop is still hanging suspended, another one following unites with it. I find it recorded that one of these lumps used to be a whole handful, in the days when men’s eagerness to pluck them was less greedy and they were allowed to form more slowly. The Greek name for frankincense formed in this manner is ‘drop-incense’ or ‘solid incense,’ and for the smaller kind ‘chick-pea incense’; the fragments knocked off by striking the tree we call manna.
