attracted the Emperor Gaius Caligula, who was<span class="marginNote right"><span class="sc">a.d.</span> 37–41.</span> extremely covetous for gold, and who consequently gave orders for a great weight of it to be smelted; and as a matter of fact it did produce excellent gold, but so small a weight of it that he found himself a loser by his experiment that was prompted by avarice, although orpiment sold for 4 denarii a pound; and no one afterwards has repeated the experiment.</p>
<p>XXIII. All gold contains silver in various pro-portions,<span class="marginNote right">‘<span class="italic">Electrum.</span></span> a tenth part in some cases, an eighth in others. In one mine only, that of Callaecia called the Albucrara mine, the proportion of silver found is one thirty-sixth, and consequently this one is more valuable than all the others. Wherever the proportion of silver is one-fifth, the ore is called electrum<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL394_63_a" id="target_note_LCL394_63_a"><sup>a</sup></a>; grains of this are found in ‘channelled’<span class="marginNote right">Cf. § 68.</span> gold. An artificial electrum is also made by adding silver to gold. If the proportion of silver exceeds one-fifth, the metal produced offers no resistance on the anvil. Electrum also held a high position in old times, as is evidenced by Homer<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL394_63_b" id="target_note_LCL394_63_b"><sup>b</sup></a> who represents the palace of Menelaus as resplendent with gold, electrum, silver and ivory. There is a temple of Athena at Lindus of the island of Rhodes in which there is a goblet made of electrum, dedicated by Helen; history further relates that it has the same measurement as her breast. A quality of electrum is that it shines more brightly than silver in lamplight. Natural electrum also has the property of detecting poisons; for semicircles resembling rainbows run over the surface in poisoned goblets and emit a crackling noise like fire, and so advertise the presence of poison in a twofold manner.</p>
