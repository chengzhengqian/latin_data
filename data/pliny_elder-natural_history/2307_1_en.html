Soda however, stored in heaps, lasts a long time. A wonder of Lake Ascanius and of certain springs around Chalcis is that the surface water is sweet and drinkable but underneath is alkaline. Of soda the best is the finest, and therefore froth of soda is superior, but for some purposes the impure is good, for example colouring purple cloths and all kinds of dyeing. Soda is of great use in the making of glass, as will be described in its proper place.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL418_447_b" id="target_note_LCL418_447_b"><sup>b</sup></a> The soda-beds of Egypt used to be confined to the regions around Naucratis and Memphis, the beds around Memphis being inferior.

For the bodies too that they wish to embalm this is the soda they use. In this region are soda-beds from which red soda also is taken owing to the colour of the earth.
