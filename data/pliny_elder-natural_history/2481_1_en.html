<p>XXII. The defects of the opal are a colour tending towards that of the flower of the plant called heliotrope, or of rock-crystal or hail, as well as the occurrence of salt-like specks or rough places or dots that distract the eye. There is no stone which is harder to distinguish from the original when it is counterfeited in glass by a cunning craftsman. The only test is by sunlight. When a false opal is held steadily between the thumb and finger against the rays of the sun there shines through the stone one unchanging colour which is spent at its source, whereas the radiance of the genuine stone continually changes and at different times scatters its colours more intensely from different parts of the stone, shedding a bright light on the fingers where it is held. Owing to its exceptional beauty, this stone is commonly known by the Greek term ‘paederos,’ or ‘Favourite,’ <span class="marginNote right">§ 129.</span>
but those who regard the ‘paederos’ as a separate variety<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_231_a" id="target_note_LCL419_231_a"><sup>a</sup></a> say that the Indian name for it is ‘sangenon.’
The ‘paederos’ is said to be found in Egypt and Arabia, in Pontus, where the quality is very poor, and also in Galatia, Thasos and Cyprus. Exceptional specimens of these latter stones have the charm of
an opal, but they shine more softly and rarely lack roughness. The dominant colour of the ‘paederos’
is a mixture of sky-blue and purple, and the green of the ‘smaragdus’ is absent. Those in which the brilliance is darkened by the colour of wine are superior to those in which it is diluted with a watery tint.</p>
<p>XXIII. Up to this point there is agreement as to which stones are supreme, the question having been largely settled by a decree of our Women-councillors

His description of the stone in § 129 would apply to an opal. For him the question was complicated by the fact that there was an amethyst called ‘paederos’ (§ 123). The last sentence of § 84 and the list of places given in §§ 84 and 130 may in Pliny’s source have referred to the amethyst. The inclusion of Egypt points to this; and most of the names recur in the chapter on amethysts (§ 121). Moreover in § 80 Pliny states that opals come only from India.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL419_231_a').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
