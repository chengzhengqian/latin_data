of free birth were given lessons in drawing on boxwood, which had not been included hitherto, and that this art was accepted into the front rank of the liberal sciences. And it has always consistently had the honour of being practised by people of free birth, and later on by persons of station, it having always been forbidden that slaves should be instructed in it. Hence it is that neither in painting nor in the art of statuary<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL394_319_a" id="target_note_LCL394_319_a"><sup>a</sup></a> are there any famous works that were executed by any person who was a slave.</p>
<p>In the 107th Olympiad Aetion and Therimachus<span class="marginNote right">352–349 <span class="sc">b.c.</span> <span class="italic">Aetion and Therimachus.</span></span> also attained outstanding distinction. Famous paintings by Aetion are a Father Liber or Dionysus, Tragedy and Comedy and Semiramis<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL394_319_b" id="target_note_LCL394_319_b"><sup>b</sup></a> the Slave Girl Rising to a Throne; and the Old Woman carrying Torches, with a Newly Married Bride, remarkable for her air of modesty.</p>

His art was unrivalled for graceful charm, although other very great painters were his contemporaries. Although he admired their works and gave high praise to all of them, he used to say that they lacked the glamour that his work possessed, the quality denoted by the Greek word <span class="italic">charis,</span> and that although they had every other merit, in that alone no one was his rival. He also asserted another claim to distinction<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Apelles and Protogenes.</span></span> when he expressed his admiration for the immensely laborious and infinitely meticulous work
