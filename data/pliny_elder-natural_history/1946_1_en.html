I find that the first image of a god made of bronze at Rome was that dedicated to Ceres and paid for out of the property of Spurius Cassius who was put to death<span class="marginNote right">485 <span class="sc">b.c.</span></span> by his own father when trying to make himself king. The practice passed over from the gods to statues and representations of human beings also, in various forms. In early days people used to stain statues with bitumen,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL394_139_b" id="target_note_LCL394_139_b"><sup>b</sup></a> which makes it the more remarkable that they afterwards became fond of covering them with gold.
