<p>XIII. Wild astaphis, otherwise staphis, wrongly<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">staphis</span> (<span class="italic">Delphinium staphysagria</span>).</span> called by some <span class="italic">uva taminia</span>—for that is a distinct plant—with dark, straight stalks and the leaves of
