<p>LXIII. There is still one kind of floor that we must not fail to mention, namely the <span class="italic">Graecanicum</span> or ‘Greek style.’ The ground is well rammed and rubble or a layer of pounded potsherds laid on it. Then charcoal is trodden into a compact mass, and on top of this is spread a mixture of coarse sand, lime and ashes to a thickness of 6 inches. This is carefully finished to rule and level, and has the appearance of earth. But if it is smoothed with a grindstone it will pass for a black stone floor.</p>
