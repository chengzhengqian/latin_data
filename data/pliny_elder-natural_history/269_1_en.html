In the same region are Ophiussa, Butoa and Rhamnus, and after rounding the Ram’s Forehead the three called Acusagorus.

In front of it is Psyttalea, and, at a distance of 5 miles from Sunium, Helene. Then at the same distance from Helene is Ceos, called by some Romans Cea and by the Greeks also Hydrusa.
