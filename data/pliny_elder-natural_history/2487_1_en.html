‘carbunculi’ are found both at Orchomenos in
Arcadia and in Chios, the former, of which mirrors
are made, being the darker. According to him, there
are variegated stones, interspersed with white spots,
from Troezen, and likewise from Corinth,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_243_b" id="target_note_LCL419_243_b"><sup>b</sup></a> although

Nothing is harder than the attempt to distinguish the varieties of this stone, so great is the scope that they afford for the exercise of cunning, when craftsmen force the opaque stones to become translucent by placing foil beneath them. The duller stones, it is said, when steeped in vinegar for fourteen days shine with a lustre that persists for as many months. ‘Carbunculi’ are counterfeited very realistically in glass, but, as with other gems, the false ones can be detected on a grindstone, for their substance is softer and brittle. Artificial stones containing cores<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_243_e" id="target_note_LCL419_243_e"><sup>e</sup></a> are detected by using grindstones and scales, stones made of glass paste being less heavy.
