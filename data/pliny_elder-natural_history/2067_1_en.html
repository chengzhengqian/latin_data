would make thinner earthenware. The pottery of Cos is most famous for this, but that of Adria is most substantial; while there are also some instances of severity also in relation to pottery. We find that Quintus Coponius was found guilty of bribery because he made a present of a jar of wine to a person who had the right to a vote. And so that luxury also may contribute some importance to earthenware, the name of a service of three dishes, we are told by Fenestella, used to denote the most luxurious possible banquet: one dish was of lamprey, a second of pike and a third of a mixture of fish. Clearly manners were already on the decline, though nevertheless we can still prefer them even to those of the philosophers of Greece, inasmuch as it is recorded that at the auction held by the heirs of<span class="marginNote right">322 <span class="sc">b.c.</span></span> Aristotle seventy earthenware dishes were sold. We have already stated when on the subject of birds<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">X. 141</span><span class="br"></span> that a single dish cost the tragic actor Aesop 100,000 sesterces, and I have no doubt that readers felt indignant; but, good heavens, Vitellius when emperor had a dish made that cost 1,000,000 sesterces,<span class="marginNote right"><span class="sc">a.d.</span> 69</span> and to make which a special furnace was constructed out in open country, as luxury has reached a point when even earthenware costs more than vessels of fluor-spar. It was owing to this dish that Mucianus in his second consulship, in a protest<span class="marginNote right"><span class="sc">a.d.</span> 70</span> which he delivered, reproached the memory of Vitellius for dishes as broad as marshes, although this particular dish was not more disgraceful than the poisoned one by which Cassius Severus when prosecuting Asprenas charged him with having caused the death of 130 guests. Artistic pottery also confers fame on towns, for instance Reggio and Cumae.
