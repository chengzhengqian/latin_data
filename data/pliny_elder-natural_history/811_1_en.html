its back; it has large claws like a jayâ€™s. Some of the heavier birds, though none of those with crooked talons, have spurs added on the legs. The long-legged birds fly with their legs extended towards their tail, but the short-legged ones draw them into their middle. Those who say that there is no bird without feet assert that black martins have specially short feet, and also the Alpine swift, a bird that is very rarely seen. Even snakes with the feet of geese have been seen before now.</p>
<p>CVIII. The insects with hard eyes have the front<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Insects feet.</span></span> feet longer, so that they may occasionally rub their eyes with their feet, as we observe in house-flies. Insects with long hind feet leap, for instance locusts. But all these have six feet. Some<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL353_595_a" id="target_note_LCL353_595_a"><sup>a</sup></a> spiders have two very long feet in addition. Each foot has two joints. We have said<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL353_595_b" id="target_note_LCL353_595_b"><sup>b</sup></a> that some marine species also have eight feet, octopuses, cuttle-fish of both varieties, and crabs, which move their fore-feet in the opposite direction to the others and their hind-feet in a circle or slantwise; they are also the only animals with feet of a rounded shape. All the other species have two guiding feet, only crabs have four. Land species that exceed this number of feet, as most worms, have not less than twelve, and some as many as a hundred. No kind has an odd number of feet.</p>
<p>In the species with solid feet the legs are of the<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Growth of hooves.</span></span> proper size at birth, afterwards more truly stretching
out than growing. Consequently in infancy they scratch their ears with their hind feet, which when older they are unable to do, because length of time increases the size of only the surface of their bodies.
