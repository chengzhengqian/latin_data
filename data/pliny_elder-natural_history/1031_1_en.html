species, with the exception of the larch, there hang nut-like growths resembling catkins, packed together like scales. Those of the male fir have kernels in their tips, though this is not the case with the female fir; but the nuts of the pitch-pine have kernels filling the whole of the catkins, which are smaller and narrower, the kernels being very small and black, owing to which the Greek name for the pitch-pine is a word meaning ‘louse-tree.’ Also in the pitchpine
the nut-growths are more closely packed in the male trees and less moist with resin.</p>

and many other purposes. The wood of the tree is chopped up and put into ovens and heated by means
