<p>XCVIII. The seed of lychnis too, that flame-coloured<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Of lychnis.</span></span> flower, is crushed and taken in wine for snake bites and for the stings of scorpions, hornets and the like. The wild variety of this plant is injurious to the stomach. It loosens the bowels, in doses of two drachmae, bringing away bile most effectively, and is so hurtful to scorpions that the mere sight of it sends them into complete stupor. Its root is called bolites by the people of Asia; tied over the eye<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL392_283_a" id="target_note_LCL392_283_a"><sup>a</sup></a> it is said to remove white film<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL392_283_b" id="target_note_LCL392_283_b"><sup>b</sup></a> on the pupil.</p>
<p>XCIX. The vicapervica, otherwise chamaedaphne,<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Of periwinkle.</span></span> dried and crushed is given in water for dropsy in
doses of a small spoonful, under which treatment the patient very quickly loses the water. A decoction of it in ash and sprinkled with wine dries tumours. Its juice cures complaints of the ears. An application to the belly is said to be very beneficial indeed for diarrhoea.</p>
<p>C. A decoction of the root of butcher’s broom is<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Of butcher’s broom.</span></span> given every other day for stone in the bladder, for painful urination, or for blood in the urine. The root ought to be dug up on one day and the decoction made on the morning of the next, a sextarius of it being mixed with two cyathi of wine. There are some also who take in water the pounded root raw, and it is considered that nothing is more wholly beneficial to the male genitals than its small stalks pounded and used in vinegar.</p>
<p>CI. Batis (sea-fennel) too relaxes the bowels.<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Batis,</span></span> Crushed up it is used raw as a liniment for gout. The Egyptians sow acinos both for chaplets and for food; it would be just the same as ocimum were it
