<p>XXXV. Incontinence of urine is remedied by the sea-horse, roasted and taken often as food, by the ophidion, a little fish like the conger, with lily-root added, and by the tiny fish in the belly of the fish that has swallowed them, taken out and burnt for their ash to be taken in water. They also recommend African snails to be burnt with their flesh, and the ash to be given in Signian wine.</p>
<p>XXXVI. For gouty pains and for diseases of the joints oil is useful in which the intestines of frogs have been boiled down, and also the ash of bramble-toads mixed with stale grease. There are some who add to these also barley ash, taking equal weights of three ingredients. They recommend too a gouty foot to be rubbed with a fresh sea-hare, and the patient also to be shod with beaver skin, by preference that of the Pontic beaver, or else with seal skin, seal fat also being good for gout. Good also is bryon,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL418_531_a" id="target_note_LCL418_531_a"><sup>a</sup></a> about which I have spoken,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL418_531_b" id="target_note_LCL418_531_b"><sup>b</sup></a> a plant like the lettuce, but with more wrinkled leaves and without a stem. Its nature is styptic, and applied to the painful part it soothes the paroxysms of gout. Sea-weed too is good, about which by itself also I have spoken.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL418_531_c" id="target_note_LCL418_531_c"><sup>c</sup></a> Care is taken with sea-weed, not to apply it dry. An application of pulmo marinus is a cure for chilblains, and so is the ash of a sea-crab in oil, river-crabs too pounded and burnt, the ash also being kneaded with oil, and the fat of the silurus. In diseases of the joints paroxysms are soothed by applying fresh frogs every now and then; some recommend them to be cut up before being applied. Flesh is put on by the liquid of mussels and of shell-fish generally.</p>
<p>XXXVII. Epilepsy, as I have said,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL418_531_d" id="target_note_LCL418_531_d"><sup>d</sup></a> is treated by doses of seals’ rennet with mares’ or asses’ milk, or
