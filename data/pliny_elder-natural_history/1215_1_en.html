foam that forms on the surface in the process is used for leaven, in consequence of which those races have a lighter kind of bread than others. There is also a difference in the stalk, that of the better sort of grain being thicker. Thracian wheat is clothed with a great many husks, which is necessary for that region because of the excessive frosts. The same reason has also led to the discovery of a three-month wheat, because the snow holds back the ground; it is reaped about three months<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL371_235_a" id="target_note_LCL371_235_a"><sup>a</sup></a> after sowing, at the same time as wheat is harvested in the rest of the world. This wheat is known all over the Alps, and in the provinces with cold climates no corn flourishes better than this; moreover it has a single stem and in no region holds much grain, and it is never sown except in a thin soil. There is actually a two-month variety in the neighbourhood of Aenus in Thrace, which begins to ripen six weeks after it is sown; and it is surprising that no corn weighs heavier, and that it produces no bran. It is also used in Sicily and Achaia, in both cases in mountain districts, and in Euboea in the neighbourhood of Carystus. So greatly is Columella mistaken in his<span class="marginNote right">I. 9. 8.</span>
opinion that even three-month wheat is not a distinct variety, although it is of extreme antiquity. The Greeks call it setanion.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL371_235_b" id="target_note_LCL371_235_b"><sup>b</sup></a> It is said that in Bactria the grains of wheat grow so large that a single grain is as big as our ears of corn.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL371_235_c" id="target_note_LCL371_235_c"><sup>c</sup></a></p>

After explaining the nature of each variety we will also give the date for sowing. India has both cultivated and wild barley, and from it the natives make their best bread and also porridge.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL371_235_d" id="target_note_LCL371_235_d"><sup>d</sup></a> Their favourite
