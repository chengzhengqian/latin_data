is said to have been discovered after his decease, when his heir broke open his coffers, it having been his practice to put aside a coin<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL394_157_a" id="target_note_LCL394_157_a"><sup>a</sup></a> of the value of one gold denarius out of what he got as reward for his handicraft for each statue.</p>
<p>The art rose to incredible heights in success and afterwards in boldness of design. To prove its success I will adduce one instance, and that not of a representation of either a god or a man: our own generation saw on the Capitol, before it last went up<span class="marginNote right"><span class="sc">a.d.</span> 69.</span> in flames burnt at the hands of the adherents of Vitellius, in the shrine of Juno, a bronze figure of a hound licking its wound, the miraculous excellence and absolute truth to life of which is shown not only by the fact of its dedication in that place but also by the method taken for insuring it; for as no sum of money seemed to equal its value, the government enacted that its custodians should be answerable for its safety with their lives.</p>

The remarkable thing in the case of the last is that though it can be moved by the hand, it is so nicely balanced, so it is said, that it is not dislodged from its place by any storms.
