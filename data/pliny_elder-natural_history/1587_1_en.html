It causes headache, and is injurious to the throat, but good for kidneys, liver, intestines and bladder, for it makes these organs smooth. It is particularly efficacious against the buprestis,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL392_435_a" id="target_note_LCL392_435_a"><sup>a</sup></a> opium, curdled milk, hemlock, poisons and dorycnium<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL392_435_b" id="target_note_LCL392_435_b"><sup>b</sup></a>; it should be taken in oil and brought up again by vomitings. For all purposes white must is the weaker; raisin must is more pleasant, besides causing less headache.</p>
<p>XIX. The varieties of wine, their very many<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">The uses of wines.</span></span> differences, and most of the properties of each I have already described.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL392_435_c" id="target_note_LCL392_435_c"><sup>c</sup></a> There is no topic more difficult to handle, or more full of detail, seeing that it is hard to say whether wine does good to more people or harms them. Besides, a draught is fraught with great risk, it being uncertain whether it will immediately turn out to be a help or a poison. And indeed I shall confine my present remarks to the properties of wine as a medicine. Asclepiades composed one volume on its administration, a circumstance which gave him a nickname<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL392_435_da" id="target_note_LCL392_435_da"><sup>d</sup></a>; but his commentators on it afterwards composed an endless number of them. I, with Roman seriousness and with my appetite for the liberal arts, will carefully discuss the separate details,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL392_435_e" id="target_note_LCL392_435_e"><sup>e</sup></a> not as a physician, but to point out their effect on human health. But to treat of the various kinds of wine one by one is a vast and baffling task, because medical opinion is very divided.</p>
