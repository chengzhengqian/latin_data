An obelisk is a symbolic representation of the sun’s rays, and this is the meaning of the Egyptian word for it.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_51_b" id="target_note_LCL419_51_b"><sup>b</sup></a> The first of all the kings to undertake such a task was Mesphres, who ruled at Heliopolis, the city of the Sun, and was commanded<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Thutmose III, Menkhperrē, of Dynasty XVIII.</span></span> to do so in a dream.
