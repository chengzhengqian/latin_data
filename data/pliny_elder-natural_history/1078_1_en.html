the seven days next after full moon are the best for removing it. Beware absolutely of rough-hewing or cutting or touching any timber unless it is dry, and when it is frozen or wet with dew.’ Similarly the emperor Tiberius kept to the period between two moons even in having his hair cut. Marcus Varro advises the plan of having one’s hair cut just after full moon, as a precaution against going bald.</p>
<p>LXXVI. When the laroh and still more the silver fir<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Larch and silver fir, their uses and habitats</span></span>
has been felled, a liquid<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL370_515_a" id="target_note_LCL370_515_a"><sup>a</sup></a> flows from them for a long time. These are the tallest and the straightest of all the trees. For the masts and spars of ships the fir is preferred because of its light weight. A property shared by these trees and also by the pine is that of having veins running through the wood in four or in two divisions, or else only in one line. The interior in the four-veined kind is the best timber to cut up for inlaid wood-work and that in the two-veined
the worst,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL370_515_b" id="target_note_LCL370_515_b"><sup>b</sup></a> and softer than the other kinds; experts can tell them at once from the bark. Fir wood from the part of the tree that was near the ground is free from knots. This timber after being floated in a river in the way which we have described is cleared of bulges, and when so treated<span class="marginNote right">§ 186.</span>
is called sappinus, while the upper part which is knotted and harder is called club-wood. Moreover in the trees themselves the parts towards the north-east are stronger; and in general trees from damp and shady places are inferior and those from sunny places are closer grained and durable; on this account at Rome fir from the Tuscan coast is preferred to that from the Adriatic.</p>
