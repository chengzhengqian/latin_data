known of them and the most prevalent are emmer (the old name for which was adoreum), common wheat and hard wheat—these are common to most countries. <span class="italic">Arinca</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL371_243_a" id="target_note_LCL371_243_a"><sup>a</sup></a> wheat which is indigenous in the Gallic provinces is also frequent in Italy; while <span class="italic">zea, olyra,</span> and ‘rice’ or <span class="italic">tiphe</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL371_243_ba" id="target_note_LCL371_243_ba"><sup>b</sup></a> are only found in Egypt, Syria, Cilicia and Asia and Greece. Egypt makes a prime flour out of its own wheat, but it by no means matches that of Italy. The places that use zea have not got our emmer. Zea also is found in Italy, particularly in Campania, and is called ‘seed’; it has that name as being a remarkable thing, as we shall soon explain, <span class="marginNote right">§§ 112, 198.</span>

<span class="italic">aroura,</span> ‘the tilth that gives us zea’—it is not on account of its ‘bestowing life’, as some people think. Starch of a coarser quality than the kind mentioned before but otherwise identical is made from it. Emmer is the most hardy of every kind and the one that resists winter best. It stands the coldest localities and those that are under-cultivated or extremely hot and dry. It was the first food of the Latium of old times, a strong proof of this being found in the. offerings of adoria, as we have said. It is clear<span class="marginNote right">§ 14.</span>
however that for a long time the Romans lived on pottage, not on bread, since even to-day foodstuffs are also called ‘pulmentaria’, and Ennius, the oldest of our bards, describing a famine during a siege, recalls how fathers snatched away a morsel from their crying children. Even nowadays primitive rituals and birthday sacrifices are performed with gruel-pottage;
and it appears that pottage was as much unknown to Greece as pearl-barley was to Rome.</p>
