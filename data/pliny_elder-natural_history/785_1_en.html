<p>LXVI. Man has tonsils, the pig glands. Man<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Tonsils, uvula, windpipe, gullet.</span></span> alone has what is called the uvula hanging from the back of the palate between the tonsils. No oviparous species possesses the lesser tongue<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL353_543_a" id="target_note_LCL353_543_a"><sup>a</sup></a> below the uvula. Its functions are twofold, placed as it is between two tubes. Of these the inner one called the windpipe stretches to the lungs and the heart; this the lesser tongue closes while food is being eaten, as breath and voice passes along it, lest if drink or food should pass into the wrong channel, it might cause pain.

But in those possessing a nape it is composed of a number of bones articulated in rings with jointed vertebrae, so as to be capable of bending to look round; only in the lion and wolf and hyena is it a stiff structure of a single straight bone. Moreover it is connected with the spine, and the spine with the loins, in a bony but rounded structure, the marrow passing down from the brain through the orifices in the vertebrae.
