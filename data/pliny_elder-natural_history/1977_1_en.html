in addition what is called the mould-blend<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL394_201_a" id="target_note_LCL394_201_a"><sup>a</sup></a> of bronze of a very delicate consistency, because a tenth part of black lead is added and a twentieth of silver-lead; and this is the best way to give it the colour called Græcanic ‘after the Greek.’ The last kind is that called pot-bronze, taking its name from the vessels made of it; it is a blend of three or four pounds of silver-lead with every hundred pounds of copper. The addition of lead to Cyprus copper produces the purple colour seen in the bordered robes of statues.</p>
<p>XXI. Things made of copper or bronze get<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Copper-rust.</span></span> covered with copper-rust<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL394_201_b" id="target_note_LCL394_201_b"><sup>b</sup></a> more quickly when they
are kept rubbed clean than when they are neglected, unless they are well greased with oil. It is said that the best way of preserving them is to give them a coating of liquid vegetable pitch. The employment of bronze was a long time ago applied to securing the perpetuity of monuments, by means of bronze tablets on which records of official enactments are made.</p>
<p>XXII. Copper ores and mines supply medicaments in a variety of ways: inasmuch as in their neighbourhood all kinds of ulcers are healed with the greatest rapidity; yet the most beneficial is <span class="italic">cadmea.</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL394_201_c" id="target_note_LCL394_201_c"><sup>c</sup></a> This<span class="marginNote right">‘<span class="italic">Cadmea</span>’</span> is certainly also produced in furnaces where silver is smelted, this kind being whiter and not so heavy,
but it is by no means to be compared with that from copper. There are however several varieties; for while the mineral itself<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL394_201_d" id="target_note_LCL394_201_d"><sup>d</sup></a> from which the metal is made is called <span class="italic">cadmea,</span> which is necessary for the fusing process but is of no use for medicine, so again another kind<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL394_201_e" id="target_note_LCL394_201_e"><sup>e</sup></a> is found in furnaces, which is given a name indicating its origin.
