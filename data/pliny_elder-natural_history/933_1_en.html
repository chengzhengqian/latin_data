years after the consulship of Opimius, the wine cost that amount for one-twelfth of an amphora—this appears in our biography<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL370_225_a" id="target_note_LCL370_225_a"><sup>a</sup></a> of the bard Pomponius Secundus and the banquet that he gave to the emperor mentioned: so large are the sums of money that are kept stored in our wine-cellars! Indeed there is nothing else which experiences a greater increase of value up to the twentieth year—or a greater fall in value afterwards, supposing that there is not a rise of price.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL370_225_b" id="target_note_LCL370_225_b"><sup>b</sup></a> Rarely indeed has it occurred hitherto and only in the case of some spendthrift’s extravagance, for wine to fetch a thousand sesterces a cask. It is believed that the people of Vienne alone sell their wines flavoured with pitch, the varieties of which we have specified, for a higher<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">§ 18.</span><span class="br"></span>

And it will not be out of place to recall here what the famous philosopher Androcydes wrote to Alexander the Great in an attempt to restrain his intemperance: ‘When you are about to drink wine, O King, remember that you are drinking the earth’s blood. Hemlock is poison to a human being and wine is poison to hemlock.’ If Alexander had obeyed this advice, doubtless he would not have killed his friends<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL370_225_c" id="target_note_LCL370_225_c"><sup>c</sup></a> in his drunken fits; so that in fact we are justified in saying that there is nothing else that is more useful for strengthening the body, and also nothing more detrimental to our pleasures<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL370_225_d" id="target_note_LCL370_225_d"><sup>d</sup></a> if moderation be lacking.</p>
