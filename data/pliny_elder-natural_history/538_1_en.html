<p>XXIII. The panther and the tiger almost alone of<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">The panther.</span></span>
beasts are distinguished by a variety of markings, whereas the rest have a single colour, each kind having
its own—black in the case of lions in Syria only. Panthers have small spots like eyes on a light ground. It is said that all four-footed animals are wonderfully attracted by their smell, but frightened by the savage appearance of their head; for which reason they catch them by hiding their head and enticing them to approach by their other attractions. Some authorities report that they have a mark on the shoulder resembling a moon, expanding into a circle and hollowed out in a similar manner.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL353_49_a" id="target_note_LCL353_49_a"><sup>a</sup></a> As it is, people use the name ‘spotted ladies’, and for the males ‘pards’, in the whole of this genus, which occurs most frequently in Africa and Syria; some persons distinguish panthers from these by their light colour only, nor have I hitherto discovered any other difference.</p>
<p>XXIV. There was an old Resolution of the Senate<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Importation of wild animals for shows.</span></span>
prohibiting the importation of African elephants into Italy. Gnaeus Aufidius when Tribune of the Plebs<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL353_49_b" id="target_note_LCL353_49_b"><sup>b</sup></a> carried in the Assembly of the People a resolution repealing this and allowing them to be imported for
shows in the Circus. But Scaurus in his aedileship<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL353_49_c" id="target_note_LCL353_49_c"><sup>c</sup></a> first sent in procession 150 female leopards in one flock, then Pompey the Great 410, and the late lamented Augustus 420.</p>
<p>XXV. Augustus also in the consulship<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL353_49_d" id="target_note_LCL353_49_d"><sup>d</sup></a> of Marcus Tubero and Paullus Fabius, at the dedication of the Theatre of Marcellus, on May 7, was the first of all persons at Rome who exhibited a tamed tiger in a cage, although his late Majesty Claudius exhibited four at one time.</p>
