thin, rush-like twigs with small leaves, grows on rough localities, has a harsh taste, never flowers and never produces seed. It is a cure for splenic troubles, a property discovered,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL393_171_a" id="target_note_LCL393_171_a"><sup>a</sup></a> as is well known, in the following way; they say that when sacrificial entrails had been thrown on the plant, this stuck to the spleen and consumed it.
