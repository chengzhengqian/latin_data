It has a strong smell, but stronger when the juice comes from the root or fruit of the white mandrake. The ripe fruit is dried in the shade. The fruit juice is thickened in the sun, and so is that of the root, which is crushed or boiled down to one third in dark<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL393_243_b" id="target_note_LCL393_243_b"><sup>b</sup></a> wine. The leaves are kept in brine, more effectively those of the white kind.

The mere smell brings heaviness of the head and—although in certain countries the fruit is eaten—those who in ignorance smell too much are struck dumb, while too copious a draught even brings death. When the mandrake is used as a sleeping draught the quantity administered should be proportioned to the strength of the patient<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL393_243_d" id="target_note_LCL393_243_d"><sup>d</sup></a> a moderate dose being one cyathus.
