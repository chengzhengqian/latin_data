and a marvel is told by some Greeks, who have related, as I have said,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL418_469_a" id="target_note_LCL418_469_a"><sup>a</sup></a> that worn as an amulet it arrests miscarriage, and by reducing procidence of the uterus allows the foetus to reach maturity; others say that preserved in salt and worn as an amulet it delivers pregnant women, this being the reason why another name, <span class="italic">odinolytes,</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL418_469_b" id="target_note_LCL418_469_b"><sup>b</sup></a> is given to it. However these things may be, would anybody after this instance of staying a ship’s course entertain doubts about any power, force, and efficacy of nature, to be found in remedies from things that grow spontaneously?</p>

The remedy is a male specimen, specially hardened for this purpose with salt, to be worn in a bracelet. In the sea, however, it does not hurt, even by touch. There feeds on it without being killed one creature only, red mullet, which merely becomes flabby, more insipid, and coarser. Struck by it a human being
