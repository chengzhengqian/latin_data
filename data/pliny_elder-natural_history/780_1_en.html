<p>LXI. There are three kinds of teeth—serrated or<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">The teeth.</span></span> continuous or projecting: serrated teeth closing together like the teeth of a comb, so as not to be worn away by direct collision, as in snakes, fishes and dogs; continuous, as in man and the horse; projecting, as in the boar, hippopotamus and elephant. Of continuous teeth those that separate the food (incisors), are called the broad or sharp teeth, those that masticate it double teeth, and those between these dog-teeth. The latter are longest in creatures with serrated teeth. Continuous teeth are either in both jaws, as with the horse, or else there are no front teeth in the upper jaw, as with oxen and sheep and all the ruminants. The goat has no upper teeth except the pair in front. Species having serrated teeth have no projecting teeth, and a female rarely has them, and when she has them does not use them; consequently though boars gore, sows bite. No species with horns has projecting teeth, but all have curved ones; all the other species have solid teeth. All kinds of fish have serrated teeth except the parrot-fish—this is the only aquatic species that has level teeth. Many of them however have teeth on the tongue and all over the mouth, so as to soften by means of a multiplicity of wounds objects that they are unable to reduce by mastication. Many also have teeth on the palate [and also on the tail,]<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL353_533_a" id="target_note_LCL353_533_a"><sup>a</sup></a> and also turned further into the mouth, so as to prevent morsels of food from falling out, as they have no apparatus for retaining it.</p>
<p>LXII. The asp and serpent have similar teeth,<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">The teeth of poisonous species.</span></span> but two extremely long ones on the right and left side of the upper jaw, perforated by a slender tube like the stings of the scorpion, which inject poison.
