Among them, the laurel bears its own grapes,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL370_467_a" id="target_note_LCL370_467_a"><sup>a</sup></a> and especially the barren laurel, which produces nothing else, and which is consequently thought by some people to be the male tree. Hazels also bear catkins of a hard, compact shape, which are of no use for any purpose; but the holm-oak<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL370_467_b" id="target_note_LCL370_467_b"><sup>b</sup></a> produces the greatest number of things, for it grows both its own seed and the grain called crataegus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL370_467_c" id="target_note_LCL370_467_c"><sup>c</sup></a> and mistletoe grows on the north side of the tree and hyphear on the south side—we shall say more about these a little later—and occasionally<span class="marginNote right">§ 245.</span>

Some trees have no branches at all, for instance the box of the cultivated variety and the foreign lotus. Some trees are forked, and even branch out into five parts, some divide the trunk but have no branches, as is the case with the elder, and some are undivided and have branches, like the pitch-pines.
