also given the length of the route from the Straits of Sicily to Alexandria as 1350 miles. The whole length of the coastline round the bays specified, starting at the same point and ending at the Sea of Azov, amounts to 15,509 miles—although Artemidorus puts it at 756 miles more, and also reports that the total coastline including the shores of Azov measures 17,390 miles.</p>
<p>This is the measurement made by persons throwing out a challenge to Fortune not by force of arms, but by the boldness they have displayed in time of peace.</p>
<p>We will now compare the dimensions of particular<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Dimensions of continents.</span></span> parts of the earth, however great the difficulty that will arise from the discrepancy of the accounts given by authors; nevertheless the matter will be most suitably presented by giving the breadth in addition to the length.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL352_493_a" id="target_note_LCL352_493_a"><sup>a</sup></a> The following, then, is the formula for the area of Europe . . . length<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL352_493_b" id="target_note_LCL352_493_b"><sup>b</sup></a> 8148 miles. As for Africa—to take the average of all the various accounts given of its dimensions—its length works out at 3798 miles, and the breadth of the inhabited portions nowhere exceeds 750 miles; but as Agrippa made it 910 miles at the Cyrenaic part of the country, by including the African desert as far as the country of the Garamantes, the extent then known, the entire length that will come into the calculation amounts to 4708 miles. The length of Asia is admittedly 6375 miles, and the breadth should properly be calculated from the Ethiopic Sea to Alexandria on the Nile, making the measurement run through Meroë and Syene, which gives 1875 miles. It is consequently clear that Europe is a little less than
