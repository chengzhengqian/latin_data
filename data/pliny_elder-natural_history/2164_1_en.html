remedy for burns, but it is more adulterated than any other, a decoction being made from any old skins and even from shoes.

even if pus is present there, the most beneficial

Strains and injuries from a blow are treated with wild-boar’s dung collected in spring and dried; the same remedy is also good for charioteers who have been dragged along, or wounded by a wheel, or bruised in any way, even if the dung is applied while fresh. There are some who think it more beneficial to boil the dung in vinegar. Moreover, they assure us that this dung, reduced to powder and taken in drink, is curative of ruptures and sprains; for falls from vehicles it should be taken in vinegar.
