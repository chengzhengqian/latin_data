ways: in the detritus of rivers, for instance in the Iagus in Spain, the Po in Italy, the Maritza in Thrace, the Sarabat in Asia Minor and the Ganges in India; and there is no gold that is in a more perfect state, as it is thoroughly polished by the mere friction of the current. Another method is by sinking shafts; or it is sought for in the fallen debris of mountains. Each of these methods must be described.</p>
<p>People seeking for gold begin by getting up <span class="italic">segullum</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL394_53_a" id="target_note_LCL394_53_a"><sup>a</sup></a>—that is the name for earth that indicates the presence of gold. This is a pocket of sand, which is washed, and from the sediment left an estimate of the vein is made. Sometimes by a rare piece of luck a pocket is found immediately, on the surface of the earth, as occurred recently in Dalmatia when Nero was emperor, one yielding fifty pounds <span class="marginNote right"><span class="sc">a.d.</span> 54–68</span> weight of gold a day. Gold found in this way in the surface crust is called <span class="italic">talutium</span> if there is also auriferous earth underneath. The otherwise dry, barren mountains of the Spanish provinces which produce nothing else whatever are forced into fertility in regard to this commodity.</p>
<p>Gold dug up from shafts is called ‘channelled’ or <span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Gold-mining.</span></span> ‘trenched’ gold; it is found sticking to the grit of marble, not in the way in which it gleams in the lapis lazuli of the East and the stone<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL394_53_b" id="target_note_LCL394_53_b"><sup>b</sup></a> of Thebes<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL394_53_c" id="target_note_LCL394_53_c"><sup>c</sup></a> and in other precious stones, but sparkling in the folds of the marble. These channels of veins wander to and fro along the sides of the shafts, which gives the gold its name; and the earth is held up by wooden props. The substance dug out is crushed, washed,
