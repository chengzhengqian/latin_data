erected in the forum, were three feet in height, showing that this was the scale of these marks of honour in those days. I will not pass over the case of Gnaeus Octavius also, because of a single word that occurs in a Decree of the Senate. When King Antiochus IV said he intended to answer him, Octavius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL394_147_a" id="target_note_LCL394_147_a"><sup>a</sup></a> with the stick he happened to be holding in his hand drew a line all round him and compelled him to give his answer before he stepped out of the<span class="marginNote right">168 <span class="sc">b.c.</span></span> circle. And as Octavius was killed while on this<span class="marginNote right">162 <span class="sc">b.c.</span></span> embassy,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL394_147_b" id="target_note_LCL394_147_b"><sup>b</sup></a> the senate ordered a statue to be erected to him ‘in the spot most eyed’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL394_147_c" id="target_note_LCL394_147_c"><sup>c</sup></a> and that statue stands on the Platform. We also find that a decree was passed to erect a statue to a Vestal Virgin named Taracia Gaia or Fufetia ‘to be placed where she wished,’ an addition that is as great a compliment as the fact that a statue was decreed in honour of a woman. For the Vestal’s services I will quote the actual words of the Annals: ‘because she had made a gratuitous present to the nation of the field by the Tiber.’</p>
<p>XII. I also find that statues were erected to<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Greek statues.</span></span> Pythagoras and to Alcibiades, in the corners of the Place of Assembly, when during one of our Samnite Wars Pythian Apollo had commanded the erection<span class="marginNote right">343 <span class="sc">b.c.</span></span> in some conspicuous position of an effigy of the bravest man of the Greek race, and likewise, one of the wisest man; these remained until Sulla the dictator made<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL394_147_d" id="target_note_LCL394_147_d"><sup>d</sup></a> the Senate-house on the site. It<span class="marginNote right">80 <span class="sc">b.c.</span></span> is surprising that those illustrious senators of ours rated Pythagoras above Socrates, whom the same deity had put above all the rest of mankind in respect of wisdom, or rated Alcibiades above so many other men in manly virtue, or anybody above Themistocles<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL394_147_e" id="target_note_LCL394_147_e"><sup>e</sup></a> for wisdom and manly virtue combined.</p>
