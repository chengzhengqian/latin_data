Its current is sluggish and its waters are unwholesome to drink, although they are regarded as holy for ritual purposes. The river is muddy and flows in a deep channel, revealing its sands only when the tide ebbs. For it is not until they have been tossed by the waves and cleansed of impurities that they glisten. Moreover, it is only at that moment, when they are thought to be affected by the sharp, astringent properties of the brine, that they become fit for use. The beach stretches for not more than half a mile, and yet for many centuries the production of glass depended on this area alone.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_151_b" id="target_note_LCL419_151_b"><sup>b</sup></a> There is a story that once a ship belonging to some traders in natural soda<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_151_c" id="target_note_LCL419_151_c"><sup>c</sup></a> put in here and that they scattered along the shore to prepare a meal. Since, however, no stones suitable for supporting their cauldrons were forthcoming, they rested them on lumps of soda from their cargo. When these became heated and were completely mingled with the sand on the beach a strange translucent liquid flowed forth in streams; and this, it is said, was the origin of glass.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_151_d" id="target_note_LCL419_151_d"><sup>d</sup></a></p>

He began to introduce the magnet stone<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_151_ea" id="target_note_LCL419_151_ea"><sup>e</sup></a> also, since there is a belief that it attracts to itself molten glass no less than iron. Similarly, lustrous stones<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_151_f" id="target_note_LCL419_151_f"><sup>f</sup></a> of many kinds came to be burnt with the melt and, then again,
