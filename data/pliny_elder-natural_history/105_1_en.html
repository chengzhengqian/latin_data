<p>XIII. This is the system of the shining and occultation of the planets: it is more complicated from their motion and involves many remarkable facts, inasmuch as they change their magnitude and their colours, and both approach the North and retire towards the South, and suddenly are seen closer to the earth or to the sky. And although our account of these matters will differ in many points from that of our predecessors, we confess that credit for these points also must be given to those who first demonstrated the methods of investigating them: only nobody must abandon the hope that the generations are constantly making progress.</p>
<p>All these occurrences are due to a plurality of<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">due to three causes.</span></span> causes. The first is the factor of the circles which in the case of the stars the Greeks designate <span class="italic">apsides</span> or arcs (it will be necessary to employ Greek terms). Each planet has its own circle, and these are riot the same as those of the firmament, since the earth between the two vertices, named in Greek <span class="italic">poles,</span> is the centre of the sky, and also of the zodiac, which is situated on a slant between the poles. [All these facts are always established beyond doubt by the method of compasses.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL330_211_a" id="target_note_LCL330_211_a"><sup>a</sup></a>] Therefore the special arc of each is drawn from a different centre, and consequently they have different orbits and dissimilar motions, because the inner arcs must necessarily be shorter.</p>
<p>It follows that the points of the arcs highest above the centre of the earth are: in the case of Saturn in Scorpio, in that of Jupiter in Virgo, of Mars in Leo, of the sun in the Twins, of Venus in the Archer,
