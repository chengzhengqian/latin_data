sowing when the sun has crossed 12 degrees of the Scorpion and the moon is in the Bull.</p>
<p>LVI. There follows the question postponed to this place, a question that needs very careful consideration—that
of the proper date for sowing the crops; it is in a large degree connected with astronomy, and consequently we will begin by setting out the views of all authors in regard to it. Hesiod, the leader of<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Works and Days</span>, 384.</span> mankind in imparting agricultural instruction, gave only one date for sowing, to begin at the setting of the Pleiads; for he wrote in the Greek country of Boeotia where, as we have said, that is the custom<span class="marginNote right">§ 49.</span>
for sowing. It is agreed among the most careful observers that, as in the propagation of birds and animals, so with the earth, there exist certain impulses leading to conception; and the Greeks define this as the period when the earth is warm and moist. Virgil prescribes sowing bare and emmer wheats after<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Cf. Georg</span>. I 219, 208, 210, 227–229.</span>
the setting of the Pleiads, barley between the autumnal equinox and mid-winter, but vetch and calavances
and lentils at the setting of Boötes; with the consequence that it is important to ascertain the exact dates of the rising and setting of these and other stars. There are some who advise sowing before the setting of the Pleiads, at all events in dry land and in the provinces with a warm climate, because the seed keeps safely, there being no damp to make them rot, and within a day after the next fall of rain they break out; while others recommend sowing immediately after the setting of the Pleiads, because about a week later rains follow; and some advise beginning to sow at the autumnal equinox in cold places, but later in warm districts, so that the crops may not be too far forward before winter.
