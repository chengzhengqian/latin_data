As has been said, few aquatic species possess lungs, and in the oviparous species they are small and contain froth, not blood; consequently these species do not experience thirst. The same cause makes it possible for frogs and seals to stay long under water. Also the lungs of the tortoise, although very large and spreading under the whole of its shell, are nevertheless devoid of blood. The speed of a creature’s movement varies inversely with the size of its lungs. The chamaeleon’s lungs are extremely large in proportion to its size,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL353_551_a" id="target_note_LCL353_551_a"><sup>a</sup></a> and it has no other internal organ.</p>
