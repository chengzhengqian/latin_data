one that is most skilful in making his master bankrupt. Licinius Mucianus has recorded the capture in the Red Sea of a mullet weighing 80 lbs.; what price would our epicures have paid for it if it had been found on the coasts near the city?</p>
<p>XXXII. It is also a fact of nature that different<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Local varieties of taste.</span></span> fishes hold the first rank in different places—the blackfish in Egypt, the John Dory (called faber in Latin) at Cadiz, the saupe in the neighbourhood of Iviza, though elsewhere it is a disgusting fish, and everywhere it is unable to be cooked thoroughly unless it has been beaten with a rod; in Aquitaine
the river salmon is preferred to all sea-fish.</p>
<p>XXXIII. Some fish have numerous gills, others<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Varieties of gills and scales.</span></span> single ones, others double. With the gills they discharge the water taken in by the mouth. Hardening of the scales, which are not alike in all fishes, is a sign of age. There are two lakes in
Italy at the foot of the Alps, named Como and Maggiore, in which every year at the rising of the Pleiads<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL353_209_a" id="target_note_LCL353_209_a"><sup>a</sup></a> fish are found that are remarkable for close-set and very sharp scales, shaped like shoe-nails, but they are not commonly seen for a longer period than about a month from then.</p>

In the district of the river Clitorius this fish is said to have a voice and no gills; the same variety is by some people called the Adonis fish.</p>
<p>XXXV. The fish called the sea-mouse also comes out<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Fish that come to land.</span></span> on to the land, as do the polypus and the moray; so also does a certain kind of fish in the rivers of
India, and then jumps back again—for in most cases there is an obvious purpose in getting across into
