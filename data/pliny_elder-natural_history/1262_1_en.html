From then to the summer solstice, a period of 94 days 12 hours, the day is longer than the night... until the autumn equinox, and then the night having become equal to the day goes on increasing from that point until midwinter, a period of 88 days 3 hours (in the present passage the term ‘hours’ in each addition and subtraction denotes equinoctial hours and not the hours of any day in particular<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL371_329_ba" id="target_note_LCL371_329_ba"><sup>b</sup></a>) and all these changes occur at the eighth degree of the signs of the zodiac, midwinter at the eighth degree of Capricorn, about December 26, the equinox at the eighth of the Ram, the summer solstice at the eighth of the Crab and the other equinox at the eighth of the Scales—which days themselves also usually give some indications of changes of weather.
