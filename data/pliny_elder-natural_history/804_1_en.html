Sows give their first dugs to the pigs born first in each litter, these being the dugs nearest to their throats, and each pig in the litter knows its own dug in the order in which it was born, and gets its food from that one and not at another.

A cow does not have milk before calving; and after the first calving there are always biestings, which condense into a sort of foam<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL353_581_a" id="target_note_LCL353_581_a"><sup>a</sup></a> unless water is mixed with them. Asses in foal begin to give milk at once. Where the pasture is rich it is fatal for their foals to have tasted their mothers’ milk in the two days after birth; the name for the illness is biestings-fever. Cheese is not made from species with teeth in both jaws, as their milk does not curdle. Camel’s milk is the thinnest and mares’ milk the next thin; asses’ milk is thickest, so that it is used as a substitute for rennet. Asses’ milk is actually thought
