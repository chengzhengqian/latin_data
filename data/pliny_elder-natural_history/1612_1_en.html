They make the breath pleasant if the mouth be washed with a decoction of them, or with the juice extracted from them. Their pips are prescribed to be eaten by women for the nausea of pregnancy, the fruit itself, moreover, is eaten for weakness of the stomach, but not very easily without vinegar.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL392_485_a" id="target_note_LCL392_485_a"><sup>a</sup></a></p>

The sweet ones, which I have also called<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL392_485_c" id="target_note_LCL392_485_c"><sup>c</sup></a> apyrena, are
considered to be injurious to the stomach; they cause flatulence, and do harm to the teeth and gums.

They are equally to be avoided when there is vomiting and bringing up of bile. In these nature has shown us a grape and, not mere must, but actually wine ready made. Both are enclosed in a rather rough skin, which in the case of the bitter<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL392_485_e" id="target_note_LCL392_485_e"><sup>e</sup></a> fruit is much used.
