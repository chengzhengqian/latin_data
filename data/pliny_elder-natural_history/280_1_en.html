the east by the Satauci Scythians. The towns on the coast after Carcine are Taphrae at the actual neck of the peninsula, and then the Heraclean Peninsula, a place on which Rome has recently bestowed freedom; it was formerly called Megarice, and is the most highly cultured community in all this region owing to its having preserved the manners of Greece; it is encircled by a wall measuring five miles. Then come the Virgin’s Cape, Placia a city of the Tauri, the port of Balaklava, Ram’s Head Cape,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL352_185_a" id="target_note_LCL352_185_a"><sup>a</sup></a> jutting out into the middle of the Black Sea opposite to Cape Kerempi in Asia with a space between them of 170 miles, which is chiefly the reason that produces the shape of a Scythian bow.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL352_185_b" id="target_note_LCL352_185_b"><sup>b</sup></a> After this come a number of harbours and lakes belonging to the Tauri.

Beyond it there were in former times the towns of Cytae, Zephyrium, Acrae, Nymphaeum and Dia; while by far the strongest of them all, the Milesian city of Kertsch, at the actual mouth of the Straits, still stands; it is 87½ miles from Theodosia and 2½ miles, as we have said, from the town of Cimmerium situated across the Straits—this is the width that here separates Asia from Europe, and even this can usually be crossed on foot when the Gulf is frozen over. On the Straits of Kertsch, the length of which is 12½ miles, are the towns of Hermisium and Myrmecium, and inside the Straits is the island of Alopece. The coast of the Sea of Azov, from the place called Taphrae at the end of the isthmus to the mouth of the Straits of Kertsch measures altogether 260 miles.</p>
