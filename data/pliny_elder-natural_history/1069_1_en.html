of the Lake of Orchomenus compels me to speak about them in greater detail. The Greek name for a rather thick, stronger kind of reed used to be ‘fencereed,’
and for a more slender variety ‘plaiting reed,’ the latter growing in islands floating on the water and the former on the banks overflowed by the lake. The third is the flageolet reed—‘pipe-reed’ used to be the Greek name for it. This took eight years to grow, as the lake also regularly took that space of time in rising, it being thought to be a bad omen if ever it continued at its full height two years longer, a thing that was marked by the fatal Athenian battle at Chaeronea.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL370_497_a" id="target_note_LCL370_497_a"><sup>a</sup></a> Not far off is Lebadea . . . is called . . . the Cephisus flowing into it.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL370_497_b" id="target_note_LCL370_497_b"><sup>b</sup></a> When therefore the flooding has continued for a year, the reeds grow even to a size suitable for purposes of fowling: these used to be called in Greek’ yoke-reeds’; on the other hand those growing when the flood goes down sooner were called ‘silky reeds,’ with a thin stalk, those with a broader and whiter leaf being distinguished by the name of ‘female reeds,’ and those with only a small amount of down or none at all being called ‘eunuchs.’ These supplied the instruments for glorious music, though mention must also not be omitted of the further remarkable trouble required to grow them, so that excuse may be made for the present-day preference for musical instruments of silver.
