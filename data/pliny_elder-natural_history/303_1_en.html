<p>It is well ascertained that the next people are the Aethiopian tribe called the Perorsi. Juba, the father of Ptolemy, who was the first ruler to hold sway over both the Mauretanias, and who is even more distinguished for his renown as a student than for his royal sovereignty, has published similar facts about Mount Atlas, and has stated in addition that a plant grows there called the euphorbia,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL352_231_a" id="target_note_LCL352_231_a"><sup>a</sup></a> named after his doctor who discovered it; in a volume devoted solely to the subject of this plant<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL352_231_b" id="target_note_LCL352_231_b"><sup>b</sup></a> he sings the praises of its milky juice in very remarkable terms, stating it to be an aid to clear sight and an antidote against snake-bite and poisons of all kinds.—This is enough, or more than enough, about Mount Atlas.</p>
