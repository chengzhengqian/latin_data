But these adulterations can be detected—and it must be enough to state this once for all, to apply to all other perfumes as well—by smell, colour, weight, taste and the action of fire. The Bactrian bdellium is shiny and dry, and has a number of white spots like finger-nails; and also it has a specific weight of its own and ought not to be heavier or lighter than this.

Also these trees when the tide rises remain motionless although beaten by the waves; indeed at high water they are completely covered, and the evidence
of the facts clearly proves that this species of tree is nourished by the brackish water. They are of marvellous size, and in appearance they resemble the strawberry-tree, but their fruit is like almonds outside and contains a spiral kernel.</p>
