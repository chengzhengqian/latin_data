<p>XXVIII. Armenia sends us the substance<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL394_297_a" id="target_note_LCL394_297_a"><sup>a</sup></a><span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Azurite, etc.</span></span> named after it Armenian. This also is a mineral
that is dyed like malachite, and the best is that<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL394_297_b" id="target_note_LCL394_297_b"><sup>b</sup></a> which most closely approximates to that substance, the colour partaking also of dark blue. Its price used to be rated at 300 sesterces per pound. A sand has been found all over the Spanish provinces that admits of similar preparation, and accordingly the price has dropped to as low as six denarii.

Of all the colours those which love a dry surface of white clay, and refuse to be applied to a damp plaster, are purple, indigo, blue, Melian, orpiment, Appian<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL394_297_c" id="target_note_LCL394_297_c"><sup>c</sup></a> and ceruse.
