physician of no small authority, spread its fame, as did Aristogiton; it is excellent for wounds if applied pounded in water; taken however in drink it is equally good for blows on the breasts or on the hypochondria,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL393_409_a" id="target_note_LCL393_409_a"><sup>a</sup></a> likewise for spitting of blood. Some authorities have held that wounded patients should take it in drink. The further statement I think fabulous, that if burnt fresh it acts as solder for iron or copper.</p>
<p>XV. Aparine, called by some omphalocarpos, by<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">A parine.</span></span> others philanthropos, is branchy, hairy, and with
five or six leaves arranged at intervals in a circle around the branches. The seed is round, hard, hollowed,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL393_409_b" id="target_note_LCL393_409_b"><sup>b</sup></a> and rather sweet. It grows in cornfields, or gardens, or meadows, and is so prickly as even to cling to the clothes.

are more hairy. The stem is long and soft, and the seed like that of cummin. It grows on rocky soils, and has a tender root, whitish and sweet. A decoction of it in wine is given for tooth-ache, but it must be retained in the mouth.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL393_409_c" id="target_note_LCL393_409_c"><sup>c</sup></a> The decoction is drunk for sciatica and strangury. In wine the root<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL393_409_d" id="target_note_LCL393_409_d"><sup>d</sup></a> is applied to burns and chilblains, which are also fomented with the seed pounded in wine with the root.</p>
