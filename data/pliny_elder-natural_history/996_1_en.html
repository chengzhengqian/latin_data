being thin or thick and full of recesses or uniform. It is the only fruit which nature has enclosed in a covering made of pieces fitted together; for the shell is divided into two boat-shaped pieces, and the kernel is further separated into four sections with a woody membrane running between them. In all the other<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Hazel.</span></span> kinds of nut the whole is in one solid piece, as for instance in the hazel, itself also a sort of nut, the previous form of its name having been Abellina, after the name of its place of origin;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL370_351_a" id="target_note_LCL370_351_a"><sup>a</sup></a> but it came into Asia and Greece from Pontus and is consequently also called the Pontic nut. This nut also is protected by a soft beard, but the shell and the kernel are formed of one solid round piece.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL370_351_b" id="target_note_LCL370_351_b"><sup>b</sup></a> It also is roasted. The kernel has a navel in its centre. A third variety of the nut class is the almond, which<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Almond.</span></span> has an outer integument like that of the walnut but thinner, and also a second covering consisting of a shell; but the kernel is unlike a walnut’s in its breadth<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL370_351_c" id="target_note_LCL370_351_c"><sup>c</sup></a> and its hard part is more bitter. It is doubtful whether this tree existed in Italy in the time of Cato, as he calls<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL370_351_d" id="target_note_LCL370_351_d"><sup>d</sup></a> almonds ‘Greek nuts,’ a name which some people also retain in the class of walnuts. Beside these Cato adds a smooth, hard kind of hazel-nut, the Palestrina nut, which he praises very highly and says can be kept fresh and green by being potted and buried in the ground. At the present day the almonds of Thasos and Alba are famous, and two kinds grown at Taranto, one with a brittle shell and the other with a hard shell, which are very large in size and very little rounded in shape; also famous is the ‘soft nut,’ which breaks through its shell. Some interpret the word for walnut as honorific and say it means ‘Jove’s acorn.’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL370_351_e" id="target_note_LCL370_351_e"><sup>e</sup></a> I
