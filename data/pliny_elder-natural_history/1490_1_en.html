special delicacy. There is a tradition that if asphodel be planted before the gate of a country house it keeps away the evil influences of sorcery. Homer<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL392_241_a" id="target_note_LCL392_241_a"><sup>a</sup></a> also mentioned asphodel. Its root is like a navew of moderate size, and no plant has more bulbs, eighty being often grouped together. Theophrastus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL392_241_b" id="target_note_LCL392_241_b"><sup>b</sup></a> and the Greeks generally, beginning with Pythagoras, have given the name of anthericus to its stem, a cubit and often two cubits long, with leaves like those of wild leek; it is the root, that is to say the bulbs, that they call asphodel. We of Italy call this plant albucus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL392_241_c" id="target_note_LCL392_241_c"><sup>c</sup></a> and anthericus “royal spear”, the stem of which bears berries, and we distinguish two kinds. Albucus has a stalk a cubit long, large, without leaves and smooth, which Mago<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL392_241_d" id="target_note_LCL392_241_d"><sup>d</sup></a> recommends should be cut at the end of March or the beginning of April, when the blossoming has ceased but before its seed has begun to swell; he adds that the stalks should be split, and brought out into the sun on the fourth day, and that of the material so dried bundles should be made. The same authority adds that the Greeks call oistos,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL392_241_e" id="target_note_LCL392_241_e"><sup>e</sup></a> the plant which we include among sedge and call arrow. He recommends that from the fifteenth of May to the end of October it should be stripped of its skin and dried in mild sunshine, and also that the second kind of gladiolus, called cypiros, which too is a marsh plant, should be cut down to the root through-
