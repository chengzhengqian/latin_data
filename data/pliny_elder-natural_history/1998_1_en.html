<p>XLVIII. When copper vessels are coated with <span class="italic">stagnum</span> the contents have a more agreeable taste and the formation of destructive verdigris is prevented, and, what is remarkable, the weight is not increased.

At the present day a counterfeit <span class="italic">stagnum</span> is made by adding one part of white copper<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL394_243_d" id="target_note_LCL394_243_d"><sup>d</sup></a> to two parts of white lead; and it is also made in another way by mixing together equal weights of white and black lead: the latter compound some people now call ‘silver mixture.’ The same people also give the name of ‘tertiary’ to a compound containing two portions of black lead and one of white; its price is 20 denarii a pound. It is used for soldering pipes. More dishonest makers add to tertiary an equal amount of white lead and call it ‘silver mixture,’ and use it melted for plating by immersion any articles they wish. They put the price of this last at 70 denarii for 1 lb.: the price of pure white lead without alloy is 80 denarii, and of black lead 7 denarii.</p>
