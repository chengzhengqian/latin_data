<p>Contemporaries of Euphranor were Cydias, for<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Cydias.</span></span> whose picture of the Argonauts the orator Hortensius<span class="marginNote right">114–50 <span class="sc">b.c.</span></span> paid 144,000 sesterces, and made a shrine for its reception at his villa at Tusculum. Euphranor’s pupil was Antidotus. Works by the latter are a<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Antidotus</span></span> Combatant with a Shield at Athens and a Wrestler and a Trumpeter which has been exceptionally praised. Antidotus himself was more careful in his work than prolific, and severe in his use of colours; his chief distinction was being the teacher of the Athenian Nicias, who was an extremely careful<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Nicias the younger.</span></span> painter of female portraits. Nicias kept a strict watch on light and shade, and took the greatest pains to make his paintings stand out from the panels. Works of his are: a Nemea, brought to Rome from<span class="marginNote right">75 <span class="sc">b.c.</span></span> Asia by Silanus and deposited in the Senate-house as we have said, and also the Father Liber or Dionysus<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">§ 27.</span><span class="br"></span> in the Shrine of Concord, a Hyacinthus with which Caesar Augustus was so delighted that when he took<span class="marginNote right">30 <span class="sc">b.c.</span></span> Alexandria he brought it back with him—and consequently Tiberius Caesar dedicated this picture in the Temple<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL394_357_a" id="target_note_LCL394_357_a"><sup>a</sup></a> of Augustus—and a Danaë; while at Ephesus there is the tomb of a megabyzus or priest of Diana of Ephesus, and at Athens there is a Necyomantea<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL394_357_b" id="target_note_LCL394_357_b"><sup>b</sup></a> of Homer. The last the artist refused to sell to King Attalus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL394_357_c" id="target_note_LCL394_357_c"><sup>c</sup></a> for 60 talents, and preferred to present it to his native place, as he was a wealthy man. He also executed some large pictures, among them a Calypso, an Io<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL394_357_d" id="target_note_LCL394_357_d"><sup>d</sup></a> and an Andromeda; and also the very fine Alexander in Pompey’s Porticoes and a Seated Calypso are assigned to him.</p>
