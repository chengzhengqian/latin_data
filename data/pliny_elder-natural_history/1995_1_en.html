<p>Iron that has been heated by fire is spoiled unless it is hardened by blows of the hammer. It is not suitable for hammering while it is red hot, nor before it begins to turn pale. If vinegar or alum is sprinkled on it it assumes the appearance of copper. It can be protected from rust by means of lead acetate,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL394_237_a" id="target_note_LCL394_237_a"><sup>a</sup></a> gypsum and vegetable pitch; rust is called by the Greeks ‘antipathia,’ ‘natural opposite’ to iron. It is indeed said that the same result may also be produced by a religious ceremony, and that in the city called Zeugma<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL394_237_b" id="target_note_LCL394_237_b"><sup>b</sup></a> on the river Euphrates there is an iron chain that was used by Alexander the Great in making the bridge at that place, the links of which<span class="marginNote right">331 <span class="sc">b.c.</span></span> that are new replacements are attacked by rust although the original links are free from it.</p>
<p>XLIV. Iron supplies another medicinal service<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Medicinal uses of iron.</span></span> besides its use in surgery. It is beneficial both for adults and infants against noxious drugs for a circle to be drawn round them with iron or for a pointed iron weapon to be carried round them; and to have a fence of nails that have been extracted from tombs driven in in front of the threshold is a protection against attacks of nightmare, and a light prick made with the point of a weapon with which a man has been wounded is beneficial against sudden pains which bring a pricking sensation in the side and chest. Some maladies are cured by cauterization, but particularly the bite of a mad dog, inasmuch as even when the disease is getting the upper hand and when the patients show symptoms of hydrophobia they are relieved at once if the wound is cauterized. In many disorders, but especially in dysenteric cases, drinking water is heated with redhot iron.</p>
