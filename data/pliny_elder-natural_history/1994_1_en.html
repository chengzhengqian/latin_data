with oil, for fear that water might harden them and make them brittle. And it is remarkable that when a vein of ore is fused the iron becomes liquid like water and afterwards acquires a spongy and brittle texture. Human blood takes its revenge from iron, as if iron has come into contact with it, it becomes the more quickly liable to rust.</p>
<p>XLII. We will speak in the appropriate place<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Lode-stone.</span></span> about the lode-stone and the sympathy which it has<span class="marginNote right">xxxvi, 126 <span class="italic">sqq.</span></span> with iron. Iron is the only substance that catches the infection of that stone and retains it for a long period, taking hold of other iron, so that we may sometimes see a chain of rings; the ignorant lower classes call this ‘live iron,’ and wounds inflicted with it are more severe. This sort of stone forms in Biscaya also<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL394_235_a" id="target_note_LCL394_235_a"><sup>a</sup></a> not in a continuous rocky stratum like the genuine lodestone alluded to but in a scattered pebbly formation or ‘bubbling’—that is what they call it. I do not know whether it is equally useful for glass founding, as no one has hitherto tested it, but it certainly imparts the same magnetic property to iron. The architect Timochares had begun to use lodestone for constructing the vaulting in the Temple of Arsinoe<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL394_235_b" id="target_note_LCL394_235_b"><sup>b</sup></a> at Alexandria, so that the iron statue contained in it might have the appearance of being suspended in mid air; but the project was interrupted by his own death and that of King Ptolemy who had ordered the work to be done in honour of his sister.</p>
<p>XLIII. Iron ore is found in the greatest abundance of all metals. In the coastal part of Biscaya washed by the Atlantic there is a very high mountain which, marvellous to relate, consists entirely of that mineral, as we stated<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL394_235_c" id="target_note_LCL394_235_c"><sup>c</sup></a> in our account of the lands bordering on the Ocean.</p>
