This animal shows yet greater spitefulness in its secrecy about another plant; for there is one by which it is said to cure itself when bitten by a snake, but it does not crop it when a human being is looking on.</p>

Only the leaves are employed; it has no flower, no seed and no stem; its root is slender and without medicinal value. Even in Crete it does not grow widely, and the goats are wonderfully eager to hunt it out. A substitute for it is false dittany, which grows in many lands, like true dittany in leaf but with smaller branches, and called by some chondris.

The reading of the MSS. is very corrupt in this sentence, and the means of an approximate restoration are to be found in the following passages: XXII. § 41: unde et helxinen dictam volunt; VIII. §112: a partu duas, quae tamnus et seselis appellantur, pastae redeunt ad fetum; VIII. § 97: dictamnum herbam extrahendis sagittis cervi monstravere vere percussi eo telo pastuque herbae eius eiecto. A scribe with an aural memory of XXII. § 41 may have had it suggested to him by the similarity of <span class="italic">dictam</span> to <span class="italic">et tamnum</span> with <span class="italic">dictamnum</span> following a little later. <span class="italic">Seselin</span> is sufficiently like <span class="italic">helxinen</span> to the eye to set in motion latent aural memory, and the other change, the omission of a connecting particle before <span class="italic">dictamnum,</span> would follow naturally. Hermolaus Barbarus in 1492 saw that some restoration of the text was necessary, and would delete <span class="italic">dictamnum</span> before <span class="italic">vulneratae</span> and emend <span class="italic">dictam</span> to <span class="italic">dictamnum.</span> Whatever the details of the correct emendation may be, the corruption took place very early, before the archetype of our existing MSS. was written, as none of them has any sign that <span class="italic">helxine(n</span>) and <span class="italic">dictam</span> are wrong.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL393_203_ca').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
