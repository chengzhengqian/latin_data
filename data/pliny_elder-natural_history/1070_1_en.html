But after variety came into fashion, and luxury even in music, the reeds began to be cut before midsummer and made ready for use in three years, their tongues being wider open to modulate the sounds, and these continue to the present day. But at that time it was firmly believed that only a tongue cut from the same reed as the pipe in each case would do, and that one taken from just above the root was suitable for a left-hand pipe and one from just below the top for a right-hand<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL370_499_a" id="target_note_LCL370_499_a"><sup>a</sup></a> pipe; and reeds that had been washed by the waters of Cephisus itself were rated as immeasurably superior. At the present time the pipes used by the Tuscans in religious ritual are made of box-wood, but those for theatrical performances are made of nettle-tree and asses’ bones and silver.
