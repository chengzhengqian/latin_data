sumptuously, only with ivory, apart from metals—bronze, gold, electrum<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_37_a" id="target_note_LCL419_37_a"><sup>a</sup></a> and silver. In my opinion, the first specimens of our favourite marbles with their<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Chianmarble.</span></span> parti-coloured markings appeared from the quarries of Chios when the people of that island were building their walls.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_37_b" id="target_note_LCL419_37_b"><sup>b</sup></a> Hence the witty remark made at the expense of this work by Cicero. It was their practice to show it as a splendid structure to all their visitors; and his remark to them was ‘I should be much more amazed if you had made it of stone from Tibur.’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_37_c" id="target_note_LCL419_37_c"><sup>c</sup></a> And, heaven knows, painting would not have been valued at all, let alone so highly, had marbles enjoyed any considerable prestige.</p>
<p>VI. The art of cutting marble into thin slabs may<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Marble veneer.</span></span> possibly have been invented in Caria. The earliest instance, so far as I can discover, is that of the palace

<p>VII. The first man in Rome to cover with marble veneer whole walls in his house, which was on the Caelian Hill, was, according to Cornelius Nepos,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_37_f" id="target_note_LCL419_37_f"><sup>f</sup></a> Mamurra, a Roman Knight and a native of Formiae, who was Gaius (Julius) Caesar’s chief engineer in Gaul. That such a man should have sponsored the invention is enough to make it utterly improper. For this is the Mamurra who was reviled by Catullus of Verona in his poems, the Mamurra whose house, as a matter of fact, proclaims more clearly than Catullus
