<p>CX. But among mountain marvels—Etna always<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Volcanic mountains.</span></span> glows at night, and supplies its fires with fuel sufficient for a vast period, though in winter cloaked with snow and covering its output of ashes with hoar frost. Nor does nature’s wrath employ Mount Etna only to threaten the lands with conflagration. Mount Chimaera in the country of Phaselis<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL330_363_a" id="target_note_LCL330_363_a"><sup>a</sup></a> is on fire, and indeed burns with a flame that does not die by day or night; Ctesias of Cnidos states that water increases its fire but earth or dung puts it out.
