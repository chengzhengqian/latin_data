strength; the smaller of these ‘twins’ is damaged by a south wind, but the other winds give it nutriment, for instance on Mount Vesuvius and the hills of Sorrento, but in all other parts of Italy it only flourishes when trained on trees. The fifth kind is the ‘woolly’ grape—for, to prevent our being very much surprised at the Chinese or the Indians,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL370_201_a" id="target_note_LCL370_201_a"><sup>a</sup></a> it is covered with a coat of down.

wood of which is red, in consequence of which some people have called them the ‘ruddy vines.’ These produce less wine, as they have too much husk and lees, but they are very strong in resisting frost, and they suffer worse from drought than rain and from heat than cold, and consequently they hold the first place in cold and damp localities. The variety with a smaller berry is more productive, and the one with a cleft leaf less.</p>
<p>The ‘bee-vine’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL370_201_b" id="target_note_LCL370_201_b"><sup>b</sup></a> is so called because bees are<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">The muscatel.</span></span>
specially fond of it. It has two varieties, which also are covered with down in the young state; the difference between them is that one ripens more quickly than the other, although the latter also ripens fast. These vines do not object to cold situations, and nevertheless no others rot more quickly from rain. The wines made from them are sweet at first but acquire roughness in the course of years. In Tuscany this vine flourishes more than any other.</p>
<p>So far we assign the chief distinction to the vines<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Foreign vines naturalized in Italy.</span></span>
peculiar and indigenous to Italy. The remaining kinds have come from abroad. From Chios or Thasos is imported a Greek light wine not inferior in quality to the Aminaean vintages; the vine has a very tender
