<p>I. Let our next subject be ores, etc., of copper<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Base metals.</span></span> and bronze<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL394_127_a" id="target_note_LCL394_127_a"><sup>a</sup></a> the metals which in point of utility
have the next value; in fact Corinthian bronze is<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Bronze and copper.</span></span>
valued before silver and almost even before gold;
and bronze is also the standard of payments in
money as we have said: hence <span class="italic">aes</span> is embodied in the<span class="marginNote right"><span class="sc">xxxiii.</span> 43, 138.</span>
terms denoting the pay of soldiers, the treasury
paymasters and the public treasury, persons held
in debt, and soldiers whose pay is stopped. We
have pointed out for what a long time the Roman<span class="marginNote right"><span class="sc">xxxiii.</span> 42 <span class="italic">sqq.</span></span>
nation used no coinage except bronze; and by
another fact antiquity shows that the importance
of bronze is as old as the city—the fact that the
third corporation<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL394_127_b" id="target_note_LCL394_127_b"><sup>b</sup></a> established by King Numa was<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Trad. date</span> 715–672 <span class="sc">b.c.</span></span>
the Guild of Coppersmiths.</p>

has been stated. The metal is also got from a<span class="marginNote right"><span class="sc">xxxii.</span> 95 <span class="italic">sqq.</span></span> coppery stone called by a Greek name <span class="italic">cadmea</span>,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL394_127_c" id="target_note_LCL394_127_c"><sup>c</sup></a> a kind in high repute coming from overseas and also formerly found in Campania and at the present day in the territory of Bergamo on the farthest confines of Italy; and it is also reported to have been recently found in the province<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL394_127_d" id="target_note_LCL394_127_d"><sup>d</sup></a> of Germany.
