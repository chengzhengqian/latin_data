dealing with grafting, the Etereian, which its red skin renders more popular than the three-cornered chestnut and the common black ones called cooking chestnuts. The most highly commended chestnuts come from Taranto, and in Campania from Naples; all the other kinds are grown for pig-food; the pigs carefully chew up the shells as well, together with the kernels.</p>
<p>XXVI. Also the extremely sweet carob may be<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Carob.</span></span> thought to be not far remote from the chestnut, except that in the case of the carob the husk itself
is eaten. It is not longer than a man’s finger, and occasionally curved like a sickle, and it has the thickness of a man’s thumb. Acorns cannot be counted among fruits, and consequently they will be dealt with among trees of their own kind.</p>
<p>XXVII. The remaining fruits belong to the fleshy<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Soft fruits.</span></span> class, and they differ in their shape and in their flesh. Berries<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL370_355_a" id="target_note_LCL370_355_a"><sup>a</sup></a> have one kind of flesh, the mulberry another,
the strawberry-tree another; and the grape, etc., have a substance between skin and juice different from that of the myxa plum and from that of berries such as the olive. The flesh of the mulberry contains<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Mulberry.</span></span> a vinous juice, and the fruit has three successive colours, first white, then red, and when ripe black. The mulberry is one of the latest trees to blossom, but among the first to ripen. The juice of ripe mulberries stains the hand, but the stain can be washed out with the juice of unripe ones. In the case of this tree the devices of the growers have made the least improvement of any, and the mulberry of Ostia and that of Tivoli do not differ from that of Rome by named varieties or by grafting or in any other way except in the size of the fruit. A similar but much firmer berry<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL370_355_b" id="target_note_LCL370_355_b"><sup>b</sup></a> also grows on brambles.</p>
