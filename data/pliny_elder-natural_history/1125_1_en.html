3 ft. broad and even larger. When they have been planted, mounds 3 ft. high from the ground level should be heaped round them—the name for these mounds in Campania is ‘little altars’. The spacing must be settled according to the nature of the place: in level country it is suitable to plant the young trees wider apart. It is also proper to plant out poplars and ashes earlier, because they bud more quickly—that is, planting should start on the 13th of February: these trees also growing from cuttings.

Μago advises a year in advance, so as to let the holes absorb the sunshine and rain, or, if circumstances do not allow of this, he recommends making fires in the middle of the holes two months before, and only planting the seedlings in the holes so prepared just after rain has fallen.
