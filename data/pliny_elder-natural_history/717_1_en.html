Rabbits breed in every month of the year, and superfetate, as do hares; after giving birth they pair again at once. They conceive although still suckling their previous litter, but the young are blind. Elephants, as we have said,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL353_407_b" id="target_note_LCL353_407_b"><sup>b</sup></a> bear one young one at a time, of the size of a three months old calf. Camels carry their young twelve months; they begin breeding at the age of three, in the spring, and mate again a year after giving birth. Mares on the other hand are believed not to<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Horse-breeding.</span></span> be profitably sired till three years old, and not before a year after their last foaling; when they are unwilling, compulsion is used.

Immediately afterwards they change the colour of their coat for a deeper red or a darker hue of whatever their colour is: this marks their ceasing to be able to couple, even if willing to do so. Some are not hindered from work by foaling, and are in foal without its being known. We find it on record that a mare in foal belonging to a Thessalian named Echecratides won a race at Olympia.
