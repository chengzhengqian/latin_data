The South wind causes larger waves than the Northeast because the former being below blows from the bottom of the sea but the latter from the top; consequently earthquakes following South winds are specially destructive. The South wind is more violent at night and the North-east wind in the daytime; and easterly winds continue longer than westerly. North winds usually stop after blowing an odd number of days, an observation that holds good in many other departments of nature also: this is why the odd numbers are thought to be masculine. The sun both increases and reduces the force of the wind—the former when rising and setting, the latter at midday in summer seasons; consequently the winds are usually lulled at midday or midnight, because either excessive cold or excessive heat makes them slack. Also winds are lulled by rain; but they are most to be expected from quarters where the clouds have broken, revealing a clear sky.</p>
<p>Eudoxus however thinks that (if we choose to study the minimal circuits) there is a regular recurrence of all phenomena—not only of winds but largely of other sorts of bad weather as well—in four-yearly periods, and that the period always begins in a leap-year at the rising of Sirius.
These are our observations with regard to the winds that are regular.</p>
