<p>XCVIII. Phalangitis is called by some phalangion,<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">phalangitis.</span></span> by others leucanthemum, or, as I find in some copies, leucacantha. It has little branches, never fewer than two, which grow in opposite directions; white flowers like the red lily in shape, a black, broad seed, of the shape of half a lentil, but much thinner,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL393_467_a" id="target_note_LCL393_467_a"><sup>a</sup></a> and a slender root of a grass-green colour. The leaves, flowers or seed of this plant are of help for the treatment of wounds inflicted by scorpions, poisonous spiders, and serpents; they are also good for griping colic.</p>
<p>XCIX. To describe phyteuma is in my opinion a<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Phyteuma.</span></span> waste of time, because it is used only for love-philtres.</p>
<p>C. Phyllon is the name given by the Greeks to a<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Phyllon.</span></span> plant that grows on rocky heights. The female is more grass-green in colour than the male, with a slender stem and a small root. The seed is like the round seed of a poppy. This kind causes births of its own sex, the male those of males, differing from the female merely in its seed, which resembles that of the olive when it is just beginning to form. Both kinds are taken in wine.</p>
<p>CI. Phelandrion grows in marshy places, and has<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Phelandrion.</span></span> leaves resembling celery. Its seed is taken in drink for<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL393_467_b" id="target_note_LCL393_467_b"><sup>b</sup></a> stone and troubles of the bladder.</p>
<p>CII. Phaleris has a stalk which is long and slender<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Phaleris.</span></span> as a reed; at the top is a drooping flower; the seed resembles sesame seed, and is one of the remedies that break up stone in the bladder, being taken in wine, vinegar, or with honey and milk; it also cures complaints of the bladder.</p>
