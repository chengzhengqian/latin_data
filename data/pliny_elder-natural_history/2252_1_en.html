weasel’s liver, testicles, uterus, or paunch, dried with coriander, as I have said<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL418_337_a" id="target_note_LCL418_337_a"><sup>a</sup></a>; likewise its ash, or a wild weasel taken whole in food. All the same good qualities are praised in the ferret. A green lizard, with seasonings to banish any nausea, the feet and head being taken off, and an application of snails, reduced to ash, with linseed, nettle seed, and honey, are also cures. The Magi recommend the tail of a python attached as an amulet in gazelle skin by deer sinews, or the bits of stone from the crops of baby swallows fastened to the left upper arm; for swallows are said to administer a bit of stone to each chick when hatched. But if, at the first attack of epilepsy, the chick from the first egg laid is given to the patient in food, he is freed from that complaint; afterwards the treatment is swallows’ blood with frankincense, or eating<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL418_337_b" id="target_note_LCL418_337_b"><sup>b</sup></a> a fresh swallow’s heart. Moreover, a little stone, taken from a swallow’s nest and laid on the patient, is said to give immediate relief, and worn as an amulet permanent protection. Highly praised also is eating a kite’s liver or a snake’s slough, a vulture’s liver pounded with its blood and taken in drink for thrice seven days, or the heart of a vulture’s chick worn as an amulet. But they recommend also the vulture itself to be given in food, and that too when it has eaten its fill from a human corpse. Some are of opinion that a vulture’s breast should be taken in drink in a cup made of Turkey-oak wood, or the testicles of a cock in water and milk, after abstinence from wine for five days; for this purpose the testicles are preserved. There have also been some who gave in drink twenty-one red flies, and that too from a corpse,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL418_337_c" id="target_note_LCL418_337_c"><sup>c</sup></a> but fewer to weak patients.</p>
