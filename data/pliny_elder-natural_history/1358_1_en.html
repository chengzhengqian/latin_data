<p>XLIV. A cursory description can suffice for the rest<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Other plants for salad.</span></span> of the plants. The best time for sowing basil is said to be at the Feast of Pales,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL371_521_a" id="target_note_LCL371_521_a"><sup>a</sup></a> and some say in autumn also, advising that when it is sown for winter the seed should be moistened with vinegar. Also rocket and cress can be grown very easily either in summer or in winter. Rocket particularly thinks nothing of cold. Its properties are quite different from those of lettuce, and it acts as an aphrodisiac; consequently it is usually blended with lettuce in a salad, so that the excessive chilliness of the lettuce may be tempered and counter-balanced by being mingled with an equal amount of heat.

Rue was held in special importance in old times: I find that honied wine flavoured with rue was given to the public by Cornelius, Quintus Flamininus’s colleague in the consulship, after the<span class="marginNote right">323 <span class="sc">b.c.</span></span>
election had been concluded. Rue is so friendly with the fig that it grows better under this tree than anywhere else.
