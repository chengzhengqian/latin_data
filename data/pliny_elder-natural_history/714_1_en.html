gnaws it off. The viper is the only land animal that bears eggs inside it; they are of one colour and soft like fishes’ roe. After two days she hatches the young inside her uterus, and then bears them at the rate of one a day, to the number of about twenty; the consequence is that the remaining ones get so tired of the delay that they burst open their mother’s sides, so committing matricide. All the other kinds of snakes incubate their eggs in a clutch on the ground, and hatch out the young in the following year. Crocodiles take turns to incubate, male and female.</p>
<p>But let us give an account of the mode of reproduction of the remaining land animals as well.</p>
<p>LXXXIII. Man is the only viviparous biped.<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Mating period of animals.</span></span>
Man is the only animal with which mating for the first time is followed by repugnance,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL353_401_a" id="target_note_LCL353_401_a"><sup>a</sup></a> which is doubtless an augury of life as sprung from regrettable source. All the other animals have fixed seasons of the year for mating, but man, as has been said,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL353_401_b" id="target_note_LCL353_401_b"><sup>b</sup></a> mates at every hour of the day and night. All the others experience satiety in coupling, but with man this is almost entirely absent. Claudius Caesar’s consort Messalina, thinking that this would be a truly regal triumph, selected for a competition in it a certain maid who was the most notorious of the professional prostitutes, and beat her in a twenty-four hours’ match, with a score of twenty-five. In the human race the males have devised every out-of-the-way form of sexual indulgence, crimes against nature, but the females have invented abortion. How much more guilty are we in this department than the wild animals! Hesiod<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL353_401_c" id="target_note_LCL353_401_c"><sup>c</sup></a> has stated that men have stronger sexual appetites in winter and women in summer.</p>
