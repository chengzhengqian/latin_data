<p>XLV. The seventh kind is surnamed dendroïdes, and is called by some cobios, and by others lepto-phyllos.
It grows among rocks, and is the most thickly headed of all the kinds. It has very large,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL393_317_aa" id="target_note_LCL393_317_aa"><sup>a</sup></a> reddish stems, and an abundance of seed. The properties are the same as those of characias.</p>
<p>XLVI. Apios ischas or raphanos agria spreads out<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Apios ischas.</span></span> on the ground two or three rush-like stalks of a reddish colour with leaves like those of rue. The root is like that of an onion, but bigger, and this is the reason why some call it the wild radish. Inside it has a white pap, outside, dark skins. It grows in rough, hilly spots, sometimes also in grass land. Dug up in spring, it is pounded and immersed in an earthen vessel.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL393_317_b" id="target_note_LCL393_317_b"><sup>b</sup></a> After throwing away what floats on the surface they use the juice that remains as a purge and emetic, the dose being an obolus and a half in hydromel. Prepared after this fashion a dose of an acetabulum is also given for dropsy. The dried root powdered is also sprinkled in a draught. They

In Pliny we have “immersed in an earthen vessel,” in Dioscorides “throw into a bowl of water and stir.” In Pliny again the floating part is thrown away and the remainder used; in Dioscorides (unless, unnaturally, ξήραινε governs ῥίζας)it is collected, dried and used. Did Pliny follow a different account or did he read ἀποβαλῶν where now is read ἀναλέγων?</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL393_317_b').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
