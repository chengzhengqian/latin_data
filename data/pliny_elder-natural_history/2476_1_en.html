at a place called Thoricus. They are always less massive than the others,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_221_b" id="target_note_LCL419_221_b"><sup>b</sup></a> but are more handsome when seen at a distance. These stones too are often<span class="marginNote right">§ 68.</span>
marred by lead-like inclusions, as a result of which they resemble lead when they are seen in sunlight. One peculiarity is that some of these stones show the effects of age as their green colour gradually fades away and, moreover, are damaged by exposure to the sun.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_221_c" id="target_note_LCL419_221_c"><sup>c</sup></a> After these come the Median stones,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_221_d" id="target_note_LCL419_221_d"><sup>d</sup></a> which show a great variety of tints and on occasion are even blended to some extent with lapis lazuli.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_221_e" id="target_note_LCL419_221_e"><sup>e</sup></a> These stones have undulating bands and contain inclusions resembling various objects, for example, poppy heads, birds, the young of animals or feathers. Such stones, in spite of their varied colours, seem to be green by nature, since they may be improved by being steeped in oil<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_221_f" id="target_note_LCL419_221_f"><sup>f</sup></a>; and there is no variety that displays larger specimens. The ‘smaragdi’ of Chalcedon have perhaps completely disappeared now that the copper-mines
in the district have failed; and, in any case, they were always worthless and very small. Moreover, they were brittle and of a nondescript colour, this being more or less bright according to the angle at which it was viewed, like the green feathers in a peacock’s tail or on a pigeon’s neck. Furthermore, they were marked with veins and were scaly. They had also a characteristic defect called ‘sarcion,’ that is a kind of fleshy growth on the stone. There is a
