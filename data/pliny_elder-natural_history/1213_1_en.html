<p>XII. There are several kinds of wheat<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL371_231_a" id="target_note_LCL371_231_a"><sup>a</sup></a> that have<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Wheat, its qualities and local varieties.</span></span>

Foreign wheat can only be compared with that of the mountain regions of Italy; among foreign kinds Boeotia has obtained the first rank, then Sicily, and after that Africa. The third place for weight used to belong to Thracian and Syrian wheat and later also to Egyptian, by the vote of athletes in those days, whose capacity for cereals, resembling that of cattle, had established the order of merit that we have stated.
