Two-drachmae doses of the seed, taken in a sextarius
of hydromel, are used for sciatica. It loosens the bowels, brings away bile, and is applied to burns.</p>

It grows in cultivated fields,
and has bracing<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL393_413_c" id="target_note_LCL393_413_c"><sup>c</sup></a> qualities more powerful than those of the lentil, its other uses being the same. A decoction of the seed checks fluxes of the stomach and bowels.</p>
<p>XXII. In my authorities I have found no description<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Alcibium.</span></span>
of alcibium, but only that its pounded root and leaves are applied locally, and taken in drink, for snake bite; a handful of the pounded leaves with three cyathi of neat wine, or three drachmae by weight of the root with the same measure of wine.</p>
<p>XXIII. Alectoros lophos, which we Romans call<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Alectoros laphos.</span></span> “comb” (<span class="italic">crista</span>), has several leaves like a cock’s comb, a slender stem, and black seed in pods. Boiled with ground beans it is useful for cough, and with the addition of honey for film on the eyes. The seed is
cast whole into the eye; it does no harm but attracts the film to itself. Changing colour it begins to turn from black to white, swells, and works out by itself.</p>
