family likewise looses teeth when two-and-a-half years old, and again six months later; those that have not foaled before they shed their last teeth are sure to be barren.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL353_539_a" id="target_note_LCL353_539_a"><sup>a</sup></a> Oxen change their teeth at the age of two.

<p>When this indication has come to an end, old age in horses and other beasts of burden is inferred from prominence of the teeth and greyness of the brows and hollows round them, when they are judged to be about sixteen years old.</p>
<p>Human teeth contain a kind of poison, for they<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Other facts as to teeth.</span></span> dim the brightness of a mirror when bared in front of it and also kill the fledglings of pigeons.

<p>LXV. Not all species have tongues on the same<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">The tongue</span></span> plan. With snakes the tongue is extremely slender and three-forked, darting, black in colour, and if drawn out to full length extremely long; with lizards it is cleft in two and hairy, and with seals also it is double; but with the species above mentioned it is of the fineness of a hair. With the rest it is available for licking round the jaws, but with fish it adheres through a little less than its whole length, and with crocodiles the whole of it. In aquatic species on the other hand the fleshy palate serves instead of the tongue in tasting. With lions, leopards, and all the species of that genus, even cats, the tongue is rough and corrugated like a file, and can scrape away the human skin by licking, which provokes even those that have been tamed
