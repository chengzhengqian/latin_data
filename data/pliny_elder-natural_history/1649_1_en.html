aizoüm.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL393_27_a" id="target_note_LCL393_27_a"><sup>a</sup></a> A third variety has the same smell, and therefore also the same name; it is rather small, with a stem as thick as a finger, and with rough, slender, pale leaves, growing on rocky soils. All three are<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL393_27_b" id="target_note_LCL393_27_b"><sup>b</sup></a> plants, not trees, but should be considered here because their names are derived from that of the pine. They are good for the stings of scorpions, and also for the liver when applied with dates or quinces, as is a decoction of them with barley meal for the kidneys and bladder. Decoctions of them in water are taken also for jaundice and for strangury. The last mentioned kind mixed with honey counteracts the poison of serpents, and in this form too purges the uterus when used as a pessary. Taken as drink it draws away extravasated blood.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL393_27_c" id="target_note_LCL393_27_c"><sup>c</sup></a> Rubbing with it promotes perspiration, and it is particularly good for the kidneys. It is also made up into pills with figs for dropsy; these purge the bowels.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL393_27_d" id="target_note_LCL393_27_d"><sup>d</sup></a> In doses of one victoriatus by weight in wine it ends lumbago, and also coughs if taken in good time. A decoction in vinegar taken as a drink is said to expel at once the dead foetus.</p>
<p>XXI. For a like reason honourable mention shall<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Pityusa.</span></span>
be made of pityusa also, which some include in the same class as tithymalus. It is a shrub like the pitch-pine,
with a small, purple<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL393_27_e" id="target_note_LCL393_27_e"><sup>e</sup></a> flower. Bile and phlegm are carried off in the stools by a decoction of the root, the dose being one hemina, and by suppositories made of a spoonful of the seed. A decoction of the leaves in vinegar removes scaly eruptions on the skin and, mixed with a decoction of rue, is good for affections of the breasts, for griping pains, for snake bites and for gatherings in general in their early stages.</p>
