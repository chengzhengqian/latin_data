fired and ground to a soft powder. The powder from the mortar is called the ‘<span class="italic">scudes</span>’ and the silver that comes out from the furnace the ‘sweat’; the dirt thrown out of the smelting-furnace in the case of every metal is called ‘<span class="italic">scoria</span>,’ slag. In the case of gold the scoria is pounded and fired a second time; the crucibles for this are made of tasconium, which is a white earth resembling clay. No other earth can stand the blast of air, the fire, or the intensely hot material.</p>
<p>The third method will have outdone the achievements of the Giants. By means of galleries driven for long distances the mountains are mined by the light of lamps—the spells of work are also measured by lamps,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL394_55_a" id="target_note_LCL394_55_a"><sup>a</sup></a> and the miners do not see daylight for many months.</p>

Consequently arches are left at frequent intervals to support the weight of the mountain above. In both kinds of mining masses of flint are encountered, which are burst asunder by means of fire and vinegar, though more often, as this method makes the tunnels suffocating through heat and smoke, they are broken to pieces with crushing-machines carrying 150 lbs. of iron, and the men carry the stuff out on their shoulders, working night and day, each man passing them on to the next man in the dark, while only those at the end of the line see daylight. If the bed of flint seems too long, the miner follows along the side of it
