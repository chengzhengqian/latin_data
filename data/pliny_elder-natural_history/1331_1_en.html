manure. Both gourds and cucumbers are grown from seed sown in a hole dug in the ground eighteen inches deep, between the spring equinox and midsummer, but most suitably on the day of the Parilia.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL371_467_a" id="target_note_LCL371_467_a"><sup>a</sup></a> Some people however prefer to start sowing gourds on March 1 and cucumbers on March 7, and to go on through the Feast of Minerva.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL371_467_b" id="target_note_LCL371_467_b"><sup>b</sup></a> These two plants both climb upward with shoots creeping over the rough surface of walls right up to the roof, as their nature is very fond of height.
