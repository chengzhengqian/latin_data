<p>Of the bronze which was renowned in early days,<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Corinthian bronze.</span></span> the Corinthian is the most highly praised.

In order therefore to refute them we will state the periods to which these artists belong; of course it will be easy to turn the Olympiads into the years since the foundation of our city by referring to the two corresponding dates given
