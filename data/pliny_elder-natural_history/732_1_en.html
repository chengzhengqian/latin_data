For the same people actually say that these creatures have not got a voice, in spite of all the buzzing of bees and chirping of tree-crickets, and make other statements the value of which will be judged in their places. For when I have observed Nature she has always induced me to deem no statement about her incredible; nor do I see why such creatures should be more able to live without breathing than to breathe without vital organs, which we have proved<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL353_437_a" id="target_note_LCL353_437_a"><sup>a</sup></a> to occur even in the case of marine creatures in spite of the fact that their breath is barred by the density and depth of the water.
