The ore is sometimes red, sometimes ash-coloured. It cannot be smelted except when combined with lead or with the vein of lead, called galena,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL394_75_a" id="target_note_LCL394_75_a"><sup>a</sup></a> lead ore, which is usually found running near veins of silver ore. Also when submitted to the same process of firing, part of the ore precipitates as lead while the silver floats on the surface, like oil on water.</p>
<p>Silver is found in almost all the provinces, but the finest is in Spain, where it, as well as gold, occurs in sterile ground and even in the mountains; and wherever one vein is found another is afterwards found not far away. This indeed also occurs in the case of almost every metal, and accounts it seems for the word ‘metals’ used by the Greeks.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL394_75_b" id="target_note_LCL394_75_b"><sup>b</sup></a> It is a remarkable fact that the shafts initiated by Hannibal<span class="marginNote right">221–219 <span class="sc">b.c.</span></span> all over the Spanish provinces are still in existence; they are named from the persons who discovered them; one of these mines, now called after Baebelo, furnished Hannibal with 300 pounds weight of silver a day, the tunnelling having been carried a mile and a half into the mountain. Along the whole of this distance watermen are posted who all night and day in spells measured by lanterns bale out the water and make a stream. The vein of silver nearest the surface is called ‘the raw.’ In early days the excavations used to stop when they found alum, and no further search was made; but recently the discovery of a vein of copper under the alum has removed all limit to men’s hopes. The exhalations<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL394_75_c" id="target_note_LCL394_75_c"><sup>c</sup></a> from silver mines are dangerous to all animals, but specially to dogs. Gold and silver are more beautiful the softer they are. It surprises most people that silver traces black lines.</p>
