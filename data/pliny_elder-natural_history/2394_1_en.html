in the Circus Maximus was cut by King Psemetnep-serphreus,
who was reigning when Pythagoras was in Egypt, and measures 85 feet and 9 inches, apart from its base, which forms part of the same stone. The obelisk in the Campus Martius, however, which is 9 feet less, was cut by Sesothis.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_57_a" id="target_note_LCL419_57_a"><sup>a</sup></a> Both have inscriptions comprising an account of natural science according to the theories of the Egyptian sages.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_57_b" id="target_note_LCL419_57_b"><sup>b</sup></a></p>
<p>XV. The one in the Campus was put to use in a remarkable way by Augustus of Revered Memory so as to mark the sun’s shadow and thereby the lengths of days and nights. A pavement was laid down for a distance appropriate to the height<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_57_ca" id="target_note_LCL419_57_ca"><sup>c</sup></a> of the obelisk so that the shadow cast at noon on the shortest day of the year might exactly coincide with it. Bronze rods let into the pavement were meant to measure the shadow day by day as it gradually became shorter and then lengthened again. This device deserves to be carefully studied, and was contrived by the mathematician Novius Facundus. He placed on the pinnacle a gilt ball, at the top of which the shadow would be concentrated, for otherwise the shadow cast by the tip of the obelisk would have lacked definition. He is said to have understood the principle from observing the shadow cast by the human head. The readings thus given have for about thirty years past failed to correspond to the calendar, either because the course of the sun itself is anomalous and has been altered by some change
