<p>LIII. There are some plants that are sown in company<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Poppy.</span></span> with others, for instance the poppy, which is sown with cabbage and purslain, and rocket is sown with lettuce. There are three kinds of cultivated poppy: the white, the seed of which in old days used to be roasted and served with honey at second course; it is also sprinkled on the top crust of country loaves, an egg being poured on to make it stick, while celery and git are used to give the bottom crust a festival flavour. The second kind of poppy is the black poppy, from which a milky juice is obtained by making an incision in the stalk. The third kind i called by the Greeks <span class="italic">rhoeas</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL371_529_a" id="target_note_LCL371_529_a"><sup>a</sup></a> and in our country wild poppy; it does indeed grow uncultivated, but chiefly in fields sown with barley; it resembles rocket, and grows eighteen inches high, with a red flower which falls very quickly, and which is the origin of its Greek name. We shall speak of the remaining kinds of<span class="marginNote right">XX. 198.</span> self-sown poppy under the head of drugs. That the poppy has always been in favour at Rome is indicated by the story of Tarquinius the Proud, who knocked off the heads of the tallest poppies in his garden and by means of this unspoken rebus conveyed to the envoys sent to him by his son that sanguinary answer of his.</p>
<p>LIV. Again there is another group of plants which<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Mustard and other autumn-sown herbs.</span></span> are sown at the autumn equinox—coriander, dill, orage, mallow, sorrel, chervil, the Greek name for which is lad’s love, and mustard, which with its pungent taste and fiery effect is extremely beneficial for the health. It grows entirely wild, though it is improved by being transplanted: but on the other hand when it has once been sown it is scarcely possible to get the place free of it, as the seed when it falls germinates at once.
