pounded leaves of hemlock, and root of mandrake—it
is cut into slices as is cucumber,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL393_357_a" id="target_note_LCL393_357_a"><sup>a</sup></a> hung first over must, then in smoke, and finally pounded<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL393_357_ba" id="target_note_LCL393_357_ba"><sup>b</sup></a>—taken in wine or vinegar. It is beneficial too to foment with myrtle wine, or to use as an ointment two ounces of mint with one ounce of native sulphur beaten up together in vinegar, or soot mixed with vinegar. There are several kinds of erysipelas, among them one called zoster,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL393_357_c" id="target_note_LCL393_357_c"><sup>c</sup></a> which goes round the patient’s waist, and is fatal if the circle becomes quite complete. Remedies are: plantain with Cimolian chalk, peristereos
by itself and the root of persollata; as remedies for the creeping forms can be used root of cotyledon with honey wine, aizoüm, and the juice of linozostis with vinegar.</p>

Root of polypodium made up into liniment is a remedy<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL393_357_d" id="target_note_LCL393_357_d"><sup>d</sup></a> for dislocations, and the pain and swelling are taken away by seed of psyllion, plantain leaves beaten up with a little salt, ground seed of verbascum boiled in wine, and hemlock with axle-grease.

Contrast for instance <span class="italic">secatur in asses ut cucumis etc.</span> with τέμνουσι δὲ τροχίσκους ὥσπερ ῥαφανῖδος καὶ ἐνείραντες ὑπὲρ γλεύκους ἐκρέμασαν ἐπὶ καπνῷ. Hort translates: “they cut little balls of it, as of radishes, and making a string of them hang them up in the smoke over must.” Mayhoff joins his <span class="italic">teritur</span> with <span class="italic">e vino aut aceto.</span> But as <span class="italic">teritur</span> has no MS. authority, and the parenthesis gives a very Plinian character to the sentence, it seems unwise to resort to emendation. Mayhoff himself suggests that the text may be <span class="italic">tunditur, datur,</span> “is pounded and administered.” It is difficult to discriminate between <span class="italic">tero, tundo, contero</span> in this connection, except that the first seems to denote less thorough and violent pounding. “Assume that the original text had <span class="italic">secatur</span> after <span class="italic">radix</span> and <span class="italic">siccatur</span> after <span class="italic">fumo.</span> Take <span class="italic">tunditur</span> with the following phrase. There is then no difficulty in translating.” A. C.
