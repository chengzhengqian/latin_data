part of the substance being separated out by the flames and the blast and becoming attached in proportion to its degree of lightness to the roof-chambers and side-walls of the furnaces, the thinnest being at the very mouth of the furnace, which the flames have belched out; it is called ‘smoky <span class="italic">cadmea</span>’ from its burnt appearance and because it resembles hot white ash in its extreme lightness. The part inside is best, hanging from the vaults of the roofchamber, and this consequently is designated ‘grapecluster <span class="italic">cadmea’</span>: this is heavier than the preceding kind but lighter than those that follow—it is of two colours, the inferior kind being the colour of ash and the better the colour of pumice—and it is friable, and extremely useful for making medicaments for the eyes. A third sort is deposited on the sides of furnaces, not having been able to reach the vaults because of its weight; this is called in Greek ‘placitis,’ ‘caked residue,’ in this case by reason of its flatness, as it is more of a crust than pumice, and is mottled inside; it is more useful for itchscabs
and for making wounds draw together into a scar. Of this kind are formed two other varieties, onychitis which is almost blue outside but inside like the spots of an onyx or layered quartz, and ostracitis ‘shell-like residue’ which is all black and the dirtiest of any of the kinds; this is extremely useful for wounds. All kinds of <span class="italic">cadmea</span> (the best coming from the furnaces of Cyprus) for use in medicine are heated again on a fire of pure charcoal and, when it has been reduced to ash, if being prepared for plasters it is quenched with Amminean wine, but if intended for itch-scabs with vinegar. Some people pound it and then burn it in earthenware pots, wash it in
