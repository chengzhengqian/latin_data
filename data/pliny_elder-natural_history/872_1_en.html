<p>The recipe for making unguents contains two<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Materials for making perfumes.</span></span>
ingredients, the juice and the solid part, the former of which usually consists of various sorts of oil and the latter of scented substances, the oils being called ‘astringents’ and the scents ‘sweetenings.’ Together with these there is a third factor that many people neglect—that of colour, for the sake of which cinnabar<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL370_103_a" id="target_note_LCL370_103_a"><sup>a</sup></a> and alkanet should be added. A sprinkle of salt serves to preserve the properties of the oil, but to scents containing an admixture of alkanet salt is not added. Resin or gum are added to retain the scent in the solid part, as it evaporates and disappears very quickly if these are not added.</p>
<p>The unguent most quickly made and probably the<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Various perfumes described.</span></span> first invented was made of bryon and behen-oil, of which we have spoken above. Later the Mendes XII. 108. scent came in, made of behen-oil, resin and myrrh, and at the present day metopium is even more popular; this is an oil made in Egypt, pressed out of bitter almonds, with the addition of omphacium,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL370_103_b" id="target_note_LCL370_103_b"><sup>b</sup></a> cardamom, rush, flag, honey, wine, myrrh, seed of balsam, galbanum and terebinth-resin. One of the commonest unguents indeed—and at the present day it is consequently believed also to be one of the oldest—is one made of myrtle-oil, reed, cypress, Cyprus, mastic-oil and pomegranate rind. But I am inclined to believe that the scents most widely used are those made from the rose, which grows in great abundance everywhere; and so the simplest compound was for a long time that of oil of roses, though additional ingredients used are omphacium, rose and saffron blossoms, cinnabar, reed, honey,
