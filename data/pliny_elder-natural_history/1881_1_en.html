who would not admit this to be more mythical still? It was the hand and what is more the left<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL394_9_a" id="target_note_LCL394_9_a"><sup>a</sup></a> hand, that first won for gold such high esteem; not indeed a Roman hand, whose custom it was to wear an iron ring as an emblem of warlike valour.</p>
<p>As to the Roman kings I find it hard to make a<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Rings and brooches in the Roman monarchic period;</span></span> statement. The statue of Romulus in the Capitol has nothing, nor has any other king’s statue excepting
those of Numa and Servius Tullius, and not even that of Lucius Brutus.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL394_9_b" id="target_note_LCL394_9_b"><sup>b</sup></a> I am especially surprised at this in the case of the Tarquins, who came originally from Greece, the country from which this fashion in rings came, although an iron ring is worn in Sparta even at the present day. But of all, Tarquinius Priscus, it is well known, first presented his son with a golden amulet when while still of an age to wear the bordered robe<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL394_9_c" id="target_note_LCL394_9_c"><sup>c</sup></a> he had killed an enemy in battle; and from that time on the custom of the amulet has continued as a distinction to be worn by the sons of those who have served in the cavalry, the sons of all others only wearing a leather strap. Owing to this I am surprised that the statue of that Tarquin has no ring. All the same, I notice that there is a difference of opinion even about the actual word for a ring. The Greek name<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL394_9_d" id="target_note_LCL394_9_d"><sup>d</sup></a> for it is derived from the word meaning a finger; with ourselves, in early days it was called ‘ungulus,’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL394_9_e" id="target_note_LCL394_9_e"><sup>e</sup></a> but afterwards both our people and the Greeks give it the name of ‘symbolum.’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL394_9_f" id="target_note_LCL394_9_f"><sup>f</sup></a> For a long period indeed, it is quite
