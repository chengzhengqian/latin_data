toxicum. For they surround with pieces of wool strings fastened across a bow,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL393_301_a" id="target_note_LCL393_301_a"><sup>a</sup></a> and drag it over the plant; to this wool adhere the dew-like tufts of ladanum. I have said more about the plant in my section on unguents.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL393_301_b" id="target_note_LCL393_301_b"><sup>b</sup></a> This ladanum has a very strong smell and is very hard to the touch. In fact a great deal of earth sticks to it, while the most valued kind is clean, scented, soft, green and resinous. Its nature is to soften, to dry, to mature abscesses, and to induce sleep. It prevents the hair from falling off, and preserves its dark colour. It is poured into the ears with hydromel or rose-oil. With the addition of salt it cures scurf on the skin and running sores, and chronic cough when taken with storax; it is also a very effective carminative.</p>

chondris, also called pseudodictamnum. Hypocisthis, called by some orobothron, which is like an unripe pomegranate, grows as I have said<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL393_301_ca" id="target_note_LCL393_301_ca"><sup>c</sup></a> under the cisthus, and from this fact derives its name.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL393_301_d" id="target_note_LCL393_301_d"><sup>d</sup></a> Either kind of hypocisthis (there are two; the white and the red), dried in the shade and taken in dark-red, dry wine, checks looseness of the bowels. The part used is the juice, which braces and dries, and it is the red kind that arrests better stomach catarrhs, spitting of blood when three oboli are taken with starch in drink, and dysentery when taken in drink ore injected; similarly vervain given in water, or in Aminnean wine if there is no fever, the dose being five spoonfuls added to three cyathi of wine.</p>
