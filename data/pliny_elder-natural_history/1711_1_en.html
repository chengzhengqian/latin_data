shape, and is an amazing plant in other ways; for when snakes begin to cast their slough it springs up to the height of about two feet, and then buries itself in the ground when snakes do so, and while it is concealed no snake at all is anywhere to be seen. This by itself would be a kindly service of Nature, if it only warned us and pointed out the time of danger.</p>

same. When Germanicus Caesar had moved forward
his camp across the Rhine, in a maritime district of Germany there was only one source of fresh water. To drink it caused within two years the teeth to fall out and the use of the knee-joints to fail. Physicians used to call these maladies stomacace<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL393_151_a" id="target_note_LCL393_151_a"><sup>a</sup></a>
and scelotyrbe.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL393_151_b" id="target_note_LCL393_151_b"><sup>b</sup></a> A remedy was found in the plant called britannica, which is good not only for the sinews and for diseases of the mouth, but also for the relief of quinsy and snake-bite. It has dark, rather long<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL393_151_c" id="target_note_LCL393_151_c"><sup>c</sup></a> leaves, and a dark root. Its juice is extracted even from the root. The blossom is called vibones; gathered before thunder is heard, and swallowed, it keeps away the fear of quinsy for a whole year. It was pointed out to our men by the Frisians, at that time a loyal tribe, in whose territory our camp lay. Why the plant was so called I greatly wonder, unless perhaps, living on the shore of the British ocean, they have so named the britannica because it is, as it were, a near neighbour of Britain.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL393_151_da" id="target_note_LCL393_151_da"><sup>d</sup></a> It is certain that the plant was not so named because it grew abundantly in that island: Britain was at that time an independent state.</p>
