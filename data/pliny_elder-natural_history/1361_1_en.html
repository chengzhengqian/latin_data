<p>XLIX. The caraway is also an exotic, and bears a<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Caraway.</span></span> name derived from the country<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL371_527_a" id="target_note_LCL371_527_a"><sup>a</sup></a> it belongs to; it is chiefly for the kitchen. It will grow in any country if cultivated in the same way as black-herb, though the kind most highly spoken of grows in Caria, and the next best in Phrygia.</p>
<p>L. Lovage grows wild in the mountains of its native<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Lovage.</span></span> Liguria, but is cultivated everywhere; the cultivated kind is sweeter but lacks strength. Some people call it <span class="italic">panax,</span> but the Greek writer Crateuas gives that name to cow-cunila, though all others call that <span class="italic">conyza,</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL371_527_b" id="target_note_LCL371_527_b"><sup>b</sup></a> which is really cunilago, while real cunila they call <span class="italic">thymbra.</span> With us cunila has another name also,<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Savory.</span></span> being called satureia and classed as a spice. It is sown in February; and it is a rival of wild marjoram,<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Marjoram.</span></span> the two never being used as ingredients together, because they impart a similar flavour; but only the Egyptian wild marjoram is reckoned superior to cunila.</p>
<p>LI. Pepperwort also was originally an exotic. It<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Pepperwort.</span></span> is sown after the spring west wind starts, and then, when it has begun to shoot, it is cut down close to the ground and afterwards hoed and manured. Subsequently the plant thus treated is serviceable for two years with the same shoots, provided it is not attacked by a severe winter, as it is very incapable of bearing cold. It grows to a height of as much as eighteen inches; it has the leaves of the bay-tree, but softer. It is always used mixed with milk.</p>
