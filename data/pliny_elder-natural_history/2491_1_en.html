‘pioniae,’ or ‘fatty stones,’ because of their greasy lustre, and finally a third kind that is backed with silver foil.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_251_a" id="target_note_LCL419_251_a"><sup>a</sup></a> The Indian stones are translucent, whereas the Arabian are somewhat opaque.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_251_b" id="target_note_LCL419_251_b"><sup>b</sup></a> Others are found also in Epirus near Leucas and in Egypt; <span class="marginNote right">IV. 5.</span>
and these are backed with gold foil. Among sards too there are male and female stones, of which the former shine the more intensely, while the latter are less lively and have a duller lustre. In ancient times no gemstone was more commonly used than the sard—this, at any rate, is the gem that is flaunted in the plays of Menander and Philemon—and no<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">c</span> 342–290 <span class="sc">b.c.</span> <span class="italic">and</span> 361–262 <span class="sc">b.c.</span> <span class="italic">respectively.</span></span>
other translucent gems lose their lustre less readily
when they are covered with moisture: olive oil
affects them more than any other liquid. Of these stones, the honey-coloured meet with disapproval, which is even stronger in the case of those that look like earthenware.</p>
<p>XXXII. Peridot still preserves its special reputation.<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Green stones. Peridot.</span></span>
It is a greenish variety of its own and, when
first discovered, was preferred to any other. Once some Troglodytes, or Cave-dwellers, who were pirates, came ashore, exhausted by hunger and stormy weather, on an Arabian island, the name of which was Cytis; and it so happened that, while they were digging up plants and roots, they unearthed a peridot. This, at least, is the account accepted by Archelaus. Juba states that Topazos is the name of an island situated in the Red Sea at a distance of some 35 miles from the mainland.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_251_c" id="target_note_LCL419_251_c"><sup>c</sup></a> According to him, the island is fogbound: consequently sailors often have to search for it, and this is why it has acquired its name; for in the Troglodyte language <span class="italic">topazin</span> means ‘to
