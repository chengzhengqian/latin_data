With these races loss of the hair is rare in the case of a woman and unknown in eunuchs, and never occurs in any case before sexual intercourse has taken place; and they are never bald below the brainpan or the crown of the head, or round the temples and the ears. Man is the only species in which baldness occurs, except in cases of animals born without hair, and only with human beings and horses does the hair turn grey, in the former case always starting at the forehead and only afterwards at the back of the head.</p>
<p>XLVIII. In human beings only a double-crowned<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">The skull.</span></span> skull occurs in some cases. The bones of the human skull are flat and thin and have no marrow; they are constructed with interlockings serrated like the teeth of a comb. When broken they cannot form again, but the removal of a moderate piece is not fatal, as its place is taken by a scar of flesh. The skull of the bear is the weakest and that of the parrot the hardest, as we have stated in the proper place.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL353_515_b" id="target_note_LCL353_515_b"><sup>b</sup></a></p>

For the rest a man’s brain is larger than a woman’s. With all human beings it has no blood or veins, and in some cases no fat. The learned teach that it is distinct from marrow
