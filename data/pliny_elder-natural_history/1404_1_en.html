diuretic, aids the menses and the after-birth, and restores bruises to their natural colour if they are fomented with a decoction of the seed. Applied with white of egg, or boiled in water and drunk, parsley cures kidney troubles, and ulcers in the mouth when pounded up in cold water. The seed with wine, or the root with old wine, breaks up stones in the bladder. The seed is also given, in white wine, to jaundice patients.</p>
<p>XLV. Hyginus gives the name of apiastrum to<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Apiastram.</span></span> melissophyllum, but by general consent the Sardinian variety is condemned as poisonous; I must however include in the same class all plants so placed by Greek writers.</p>
<p>XLVI. Olusatrum (alexanders), also called hipposelinum<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Alexanders.</span></span> (horse parsley), is antipathetic to scorpions. Its seed taken in drink cures colic and intestinal worms. The seed too, boiled and drunk in honey wine, cures dysuria. Its root, boiled in wine, expels stone, besides curing lumbago and pains in the side. Taken in drink and applied as liniment it cures the bite of a mad dog. A draught of its juices warms those who have been chilled. A fourth kind of parsley is made by some authorities out of oreoselinum
(mountain parsley), a straight shrub a palmm<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Mountain parsley.</span></span> high, with a seed like cummin, beneficial to the urine and the menses. Heleoselinum (wild celery) is wad<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">celery.</span></span> especially valuable for the bites of spiders; this variety and oreoselinum taken in wine promotes the menses.</p>
<p>XLVII. Another kind of parsley, which grows on<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Rock parsley.</span></span> rocks, is called by some petroselinum (rock parsley); it is especially good for abscesses, two spoonfuls of the juice making a dose with one cyathus of juice of horehound and three cyathi of warm water.
