For the eclipse of both sun and moon within 15 days of each other has occurred even in our time, in the year of the third consulship of the elder Emperor Vespasian and the second consulship of the younger.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL330_207_b" id="target_note_LCL330_207_b"><sup>b</sup></a></p>

This fact proves that the planets are of greater magnitude than the moon, since these occasionally become visible even on reaching 7 degrees’ distance; but their altitude makes them appear smaller, just as the sun’s radiance makes the fixed stars invisible in daytime, although they are shining as much as in the night, which becomes manifest at a solar eclipse and also when the star is reflected in a very deep well.</p>
