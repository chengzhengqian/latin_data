<p>XLVI. This then is the opinion of Cato<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL371_293_a" id="target_note_LCL371_293_a"><sup>a</sup></a>: ‘In thick<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Cato’s advice for various crops.</span></span>
and fertile land wheat should be sown; but if the same land is liable to fog, turnip, radishes, common and Italian millets. In cold or damp land sowing should be done earlier, but in warm land later. In a ruddle-soil or in dark or sandy soil, if it is not damp, sow lupine; in chalk and red earth and rather damp land, emmer wheat; in dry land that is free from grass and not overshaded, wheat; beans in strong soil, but vetch in the least damp and weedy soil; common and other bare wheats in an open and elevated locality that gets the warmth of the sun as long as possible; lentils in poor and ruddle-soil that is free from grass; barley in fallow land and also in land that can produce a second crop; three-month wheat where the land could not ripen an ordinary crop and which is rich enough to produce a second crop.’</p>
<p>The following also is acute advice:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL371_293_b" id="target_note_LCL371_293_b"><sup>b</sup></a> ‘In a rather<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Varro’s advice.</span></span>
thin soil crops should be sown that do not need much
moisture, for instance tree-medick, and such of the leguminous plants, except chick-pea, as are gathered by being pulled up out of the ground and not by being cut—which is the reason why they are called “crops”, because that is how they are “cropped”—, but in rich land the plants that need greater nutriment, such as greens, wheat, common wheat, flax. Under this method consequently thin soil will be assigned to barley, as its root demands less nourishment, while more easily worked and denser earth will be allotted to wheat. In a rather damp place emmer will be sown in preference to other wheat, but in soil of medium quality this and also barley. Hillsides produce a stronger wheat but a smaller crop of it. Emmer and common wheat can do with both chalky and marshy soil.’</p>
