<p>I. The face of man has also been afflicted with new<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">New diseases.</span></span>
diseases, unknown in past years not only to Italy but also to almost the whole of Europe, and even then they did not spread all over Italy, or through Illyricum, the Gauls, and the Spains to any great extent, or in fact anywhere except in and around Rome. Though they are painless and without danger to life, yet they are so disfiguring that
any kind of death would be preferable.</p>

The most severe of these they called by a<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Lichens.</span></span> Greek name lichens<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL393_265_aa" id="target_note_LCL393_265_aa"><sup>a</sup></a>; in Latin, because it generally began on the chin, it was called mentagra,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL393_265_b" id="target_note_LCL393_265_b"><sup>b</sup></a> at first<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Mentagra.</span></span>
by way of a joke—so prone are many men to make a
jest of the misfortunes of others—the name passing presently into common use. The disease seized in many cases<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL393_265_c" id="target_note_LCL393_265_c"><sup>c</sup></a> at least the whole of the face, with the eyes only unaffected, but passed down however also to the neck, chest and hands, covering the skin with a disfiguring, scaly eruption.</p>
