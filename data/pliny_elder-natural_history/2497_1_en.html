and lastly there is the Egyptian. It is very commonly counterfeited by tinting other stones, and this is a famous achievement of the kings of Egypt, whose records also mention the name of the king who first tinted stones in this way.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_263_a" id="target_note_LCL419_263_a"><sup>a</sup></a> ‘Cyanus,’ too, is divided into male and female varieties. Sometimes inside
‘cyanus’ there is a golden dust, which, however, differs from that which occurs inside lapis lazuli; for there the gold glistens as dots.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_263_b" id="target_note_LCL419_263_b"><sup>b</sup></a></p>

Moreover, they are useless for engraving, because cores like rock-crystal interfere with this. Lapis lazuli which is of the colour of azurite is regarded as a male variety.</p>

purple stones or those varieties that deviate from them. Here the first rank is held by the amethysts of India, although amethysts are found also in that part of Arabia, known as Petra, which borders on Syria, as well as in Lesser Armenia, Egypt and Galatia, while the most imperfect and worthless specimens occur in Thasos and Cyprus. The name
‘amethyst’ has been explained by the supposed fact that the brilliant colour of the stone closely approaches that of wine, but stops short of absorbing it and ends in a violet shade. Others, again, offer the explanation that the characteristic purple colour contains an element that is not quite bright red, but fades into the colour of wine.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_263_da" id="target_note_LCL419_263_da"><sup>d</sup></a> However this may be, all
