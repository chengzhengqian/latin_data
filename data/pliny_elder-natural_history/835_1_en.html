an indescribably sweet scent and the fruit resembles a lupine, and is so prickly that no animal can touch it. On a more elevated plateau in the same island there are trees<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL370_29_a" id="target_note_LCL370_29_a"><sup>a</sup></a> that bear wool, but in a different manner to those<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL370_29_b" id="target_note_LCL370_29_b"><sup>b</sup></a> of the Chinese, as the leaves of these trees have no growth on them, and might be thought to be vine-leaves
were it not that they are smaller; but they bear gourds of the size of a quince, which when they ripen burst open and disclose balls of down from which an expensive linen for clothing is made.</p>
<p>XXII. Their name for this tree is the gossypinus; it also grows in greater abundance on the smaller island of Tyros, which is ten miles distant from the other. Juba says that this shrub has a woolly down growing round it, the fabric made from which is superior to the linen of India. He also says that there is an Arabian tree called the cynas<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL370_29_c" id="target_note_LCL370_29_c"><sup>c</sup></a> from which cloth is made, which has foliage resembling a palm-leaf.
Similarly the natives of India are provided with clothes by their own trees. But in the Tyros islands there is also another tree<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL370_29_d" id="target_note_LCL370_29_d"><sup>d</sup></a> with a blossom like a white violet but four times as large; it has no scent, which may well surprise us in that region of the world.</p>
<p>XXIII. There is also another tree which resembles<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">An evergreen tree.</span></span> this one but has more foliage and a rose-coloured blossom, which it closes at nightfall and begins to open at sunrise, unfolding it fully at noon: the natives speak of it as going to sleep. The same island also produces palm-trees, olives and vines, as well as figs and all the other kinds of fruit-trees. None of the trees there sheds its leaves; and the island is watered by cold springs, and has a considerable rainfall.</p>
