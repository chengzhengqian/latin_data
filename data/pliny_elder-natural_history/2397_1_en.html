Some of the writers mentioned record that 1600 talents were spent on radishes, garlic and onions alone. The largest pyramid covers an area of nearly 5 acres. Each of the four sides has an equal measurement from corner to corner of 783 feet; the height from ground-level to the pinnacle amounts to 725 feet,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_63_ca" id="target_note_LCL419_63_ca"><sup>c</sup></a> while the circumference of the pinnacle is 16 1/2 feet.
