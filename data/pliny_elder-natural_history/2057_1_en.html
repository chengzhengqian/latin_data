Timomachus of Byzantium<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Timomachus.</span> 46 <span class="sc">b.c.</span></span> in the period of Caesar’s dictatorship<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL394_361_a" id="target_note_LCL394_361_a"><sup>a</sup></a> painted an Ajax and a Medea, placed by Caesar in the temple of Venus Genetrix, having been bought at the price of 80 talents (Marcus Varro rates the Attic talent at 6000 denarii). Equal praise is given to Timomachus’s Orestes, his Iphigenia among the Tauri and his Gymnastic-Master Lecythion; also his Noble Family and his Two Men wearing the Pallium, whom he has represented as about to converse; one is a standing figure and the other seated. It is in his painting of a Gorgon<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL394_361_b" id="target_note_LCL394_361_b"><sup>b</sup></a> however that his art seems to have given him most success.</p>
<p>Pausias’s son and pupil Aristolaus was one of the<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Aristolaus.</span></span> painters of the very severe style; to him belong an Epaminondas, a Pericles, a Medea, a Virtue, a Theseus, a figure representing the Athenian People, and a Sacrifice of Oxen. Some persons also admire Nicophanes, who was likewise a pupil of Pausias,<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Nicophanes.</span></span> for his careful accuracy which only artists can appreciate, though apart from that he is hard in his colouring and lavish in his use of ochre. As for Socrates he is justly a universal favourite; popular<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Socrates.</span></span> pictures by him are his group of Asclepius with his daughters Health, Brightness, Ail-Heal and Remedy, and his Sluggard, bearing the Greek name of Ocnos, Laziness, and represented as twisting a rope of broom which an ass is nibbling.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL394_361_c" id="target_note_LCL394_361_c"><sup>c</sup></a></p>
<p>Having so far pointed out the chief painters in both branches,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL394_361_d" id="target_note_LCL394_361_d"><sup>d</sup></a> we will also mention those of the rank next to the first: Aristoclides who decorated the<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Aristoclides and others.</span></span> Temple of Apollo at Delphi, Antiphilus who is praised for his Boy Blowing a Fire, and for the apartment, beautiful in itself, lit by the reflection
