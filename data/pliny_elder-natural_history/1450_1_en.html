To all other things in fact she gave birth because of their usefulness, and to serve as food, and so has assigned them their ages and years; but blossoms and their perfumes she brings forth only for a day—an
obvious warning to men that the bloom that pleases the eye most is the soonest to fade. Not even the painter’s art, however, suffices to copy their colours and the variety of their combinations, whether two kinds are woven together alternately, and also more than two, or whether with separate festoons of the different kinds chaplets are run through chaplets to form a circle, or crosswise, or sometimes forming a coil.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL392_161_ba" id="target_note_LCL392_161_ba"><sup>b</sup></a></p>

<span class="italic">Alterni</span>: two kinds of flowers interwoven alternately.<span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="italic">Multiplices</span>: several kinds interwoven according to various patterns.<span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="italic">Privatis generum funiculis</span>: strings or festoons of flowers, one kind only on each string. These are made into hoops or rings, which pass through one another, each ring being a link in a chain. This chain of rings could easily be shaped who would find them unnecessary, being perfectly familiar with them.<span class="linebreak"></span>
Another translation has been suggested to me by Professor W. B. Anderson, who thinks that <span class="italic">alterni</span> may have its late sense of <span class="italic">in vicem,</span> and that <span class="italic">quaedam</span> does not mean “certain,”
but “as it were,” “so to speak.” He would translate:
“whether they are intertwined with one another in elaborate convolutions, or form as it were garlands within garlands with strings of particular flowers arranged in rings or slantwise or running right round.”<span class="linebreak"></span>
If with the old editors we put a stop (or even a semicolon) at <span class="italic">ambitum</span>, the sense of the first part of the sentence is improved, for <span class="italic">funiculi</span> could be twined <span class="italic">in orbem</span> etc. more naturally than could strings of <span class="italic">coronae.</span> The difficulty however remains of distinguishing <span class="italic">in orbem</span> from <span class="italic">in ambitum,</span> and the words <span class="italic">quaedam . . . currunt</span> by themselves form a very jerky and obscure sentence. <span class="italic">in orbem,</span> or coiled, like a watch-spring, <span class="italic">in ambitum,</span> or bent at an angle <span class="italic">in oblicum.</span> The last however may refer to pairs of separate rings, the smaller passing through the larger at right-angles.<span class="linebreak"></span>
Warmington’s explanation is:—
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line"><span class="italic">In orbem</span>: forming (filled in) disks;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line"><span class="italic">In oblicum</span>: forming spirals, or coils;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line"><span class="italic">In ambitum</span>: forming rings (hollow disks not filled in<span class="linebreak"></span> nor spiral). <span class="italic">Ambitus</span> suggests a closed periphery, not<span class="linebreak"></span> filled in.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
