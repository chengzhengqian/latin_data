It is better when softened by fire, and with wax-salve cleanses the thickened lips of ulcers and arrests corrosive sores. The pounded plant when applied should be covered with its own leaves. Suppurations, gatherings and pitted ulcers are also dried up by chelidonia, wounds are healed so well that it is even used instead of spodium. It is also applied with axle-grease to sores that are already despaired of. Dittany taken in drink forces out arrows; an external application causes to fall out other kinds of weapons—the dose for a draught is an obolus of the leaves in a cyathus of water—and bastard dittany is almost as effective; both too disperse suppurations. Aristolochia
also eats away festering ulcers, with honey cleanses those that are foul, expels worms, the callosities also that form in ulcers and all things embedded in the flesh, especially with resin arrows and bone splinters; but the pits of ulcers it fills up by itself or with the addition of iris. For fresh wounds it is used in vinegar; for chronic ulcers vervain is used, or cinquefoil with salt and honey. The roots of persollata are applied to fresh wounds that have been inflicted by iron, and the leaves to old wounds, axle-grease being added to both<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL393_371_ca" id="target_note_LCL393_371_ca"><sup>c</sup></a> with a covering of the plant’s leaves.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL393_371_d" id="target_note_LCL393_371_d"><sup>d</sup></a> Other applications are damasonium, used as for scrofula, and the leaves of verbascum in vinegar or wine.
