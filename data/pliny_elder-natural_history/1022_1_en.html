<p>In respect of the trees themselves the one that<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Varieties of oak and of oak-timber.</span></span> bears the largest acorn is called the hemeris;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL370_403_a" id="target_note_LCL370_403_a"><sup>a</sup></a> this is a comparatively low-growing oak which forms a circle of bushy foliage and which is frequently hollow at the spread of the branches.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL370_403_b" id="target_note_LCL370_403_b"><sup>b</sup></a> The wood of the common oak is stronger and less liable to decay; this variety also has many branches, but grows higher and has a thicker trunk; but the loftiest kind is the aegilops<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL370_403_c" id="target_note_LCL370_403_c"><sup>c</sup></a> which likes wild uncultivated country.</p>
<p>Next to this in height is the broad-leaved oak, but it is less useful for builders’ timber and for charcoal, and when hewn with the axe is liable to split, on which account it is used in the unhewn state. As charcoal it only pays to use it in a copper-smith’s workshop, because as soon as the bellows stop it dies down and has to be rekindled repeatedly; but it gives out a great quantity of sparks. A better charcoal is obtained from young trees. Piles of freshly cut sticks are fitted closely together and made into an oven with clay, and the structure is set fire to, and the shell as it hardens is prodded with poles and so discharges its moisture.</p>
<p>The worst kind both for charcoal and for timber is the one called in Greek the ‘sea-cork’ oak, which has a very thick bark and trunk, the latter usually hollow and spongy; and no other variety of the oak class is so liable to rot, even while it is alive. Moreover it is very frequently struck by lightning, although it is not particularly lofty; consequently it is not thought right to use its wood for sacrifices either. Also it rarely bears acorns, and when it does they are bitter, so that no animal will touch them
