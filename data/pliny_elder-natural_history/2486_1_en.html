Satyrus asserts that Indian ‘carbunculi’ lack brilliance and look generally flawed, with a ‘parched’
lustre; and that the Ethiopian stones look greasy and shed no lustre at all, but burn with a fire that is compressed within them. Callistratus holds that a
‘carbunculus’ ought to cast a brilliant, colourless refulgence, so that when placed on a surface it enhances the lustre of other stones that are clouded at the edges, thanks to its own glowing brilliance. Hence many people call such a stone the white
