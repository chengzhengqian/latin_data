In India they have curved tusks 18 in. long: two project from the jaw, and two from the forehead like a calf’s horns. The wild boar’s hair is a sort of copper colour; that of the other species is black. But the hog genus does not occur in Arabia.</p>

In the case of no other kind of animal is<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Wild varieties of domestic species.</span></span> it so easy to cross with the wild variety; the offspring of such unions in old days were called ‘hybrids,’ meaning half-wild, a term also applied as a nickname to human beings, for instance, to Cicero’s colleague in the consulship,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL353_149_a" id="target_note_LCL353_149_a"><sup>a</sup></a> Gaius Antonius.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL353_149_b" id="target_note_LCL353_149_b"><sup>b</sup></a> But not only in pigs but in all animals as well whenever there is any tame variety of a genus there is also found a wild one of the same genus, inasmuch as even in the case of man an equal number of savage races have been predicted to exist. Nevertheless the formation of the goat is transferred to a very large number of similar species: there are the goat, the chamois and the ibex—an animal of marvellous speed, although its head is burdened with enormous horns resembling the sheaths of swords, towards which it sways itself as though whirled with a sort of catapult, chiefly when on rocks and seeking to leap from one crag to another, and by means of the recoil leaps out more nimbly to the point to which it wants to get. There are also the oryx, the only species according to certain authorities clothed with hair lying the wrong way, towards the head, and the antelope, the white-rumped antelope, the twisted-horn antelope and a great many other not dissimilar species.
