<p>XXVIII. We have also the lotometra,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL392_333_aa" id="target_note_LCL392_333_aa"><sup>a</sup></a> a plant derived from the lotus. From its rotted seed, which is like millet, are made by the shepherds in Egypt loaves that they knead mostly with water or milk. It is said that no bread is more healthful or lighter than this, so long as it is warm, but when cold it becomes heavy and difficult of digestion. It is an established fact that those who live on it are never attacked by dysentery, tenesmus, or any other disease of the bowels. Accordingly it is considered to be one of the remedies for such ailments.</p>
<p>XXIX. I have spoken more than once<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL392_333_b" id="target_note_LCL392_333_b"><sup>b</sup></a> of the<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Heliotropium.</span></span> marvel of heliotropium, which turns round with the sun even on a cloudy day, so great a love it has for
that luminary. At night it closes its blue flower as though it mourned.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL392_333_c" id="target_note_LCL392_333_c"><sup>c</sup></a> There are two varieties—tricoccum
and helioscopium. The latter is the taller, although neither is more than half a foot in height, and sends out branches from a single<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL392_333_d" id="target_note_LCL392_333_d"><sup>d</sup></a> root. Its seed, enclosed in a pod, is gathered at harvest time. It grows nowhere but in a rich, well cultivated soil, but tricoccum grows everywhere. I find it said that, boiled, it is an agreeable sauce, that in milk it is a gentle laxative, and that a draught of the decoction is a most drastic purge. The juice of the taller plant is collected in summer at the sixth hour; it is mixed with wine, which makes it keep longer.
