<p>II. But who could revere enough the diligent<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Aconite.</span></span> research of the ancients? It is established that of all poisons the quickest to act is aconite, and that death occurs on the same day if the genitals of a female creature are but touched by it. This was the poison that Marcus Caelius accused Calpurnius Bestia of using to kill his wives in their sleep. Hence the damning peroration of the prosecutor’s speech accusing the defendant’s finger. Fable has it that aconite sprang out of the foam of the dog Cerberus when Hercules dragged him from the underworld, and that this is why it grows around Heraclea in Pontus, where is pointed out the entrance to the underworld used by Hercules. Yet even aconite the ancients have turned to the benefit of human health, by finding out by experience that administered in warm wine it neutralizes the stings of scorpions. It is its nature to kill a human being unless in that being it finds something else to destroy. Against this alone it struggles, †regarding it as more pressing than the find.† [This is the only fight, when the aconite discovers a poison in the viscera.]<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL393_391_aa" id="target_note_LCL393_391_aa"><sup>a</sup></a> What a marvel!

Müller, Mayhoff brackets <span class="italic">sola</span> . . . <span class="italic">reperit</span>, which certainly looks like a marginal explanation of the preceding sentence added to the text by a subsequent scribe. <span class="italic">Sola haec pugna est</span> corresponds to <span class="italic">cum eo solo conluctatur</span>, and <span class="italic">reperit</span> to <span class="italic">invento</span>. We should therefore expect in the first sentence something to correspond to <span class="italic">venenum</span> and to <span class="italic">in visceribus.</span> It might be <span class="italic">veneno</span> for the first and <span class="italic">intus</span> for the second. The whole would be <span class="italic">veneno praesenti inlus invento</span>,
“the quick-acting poison found inside.” In XVI 51 occurs <span class="italic">praesentis veneni.</span> The reading of Hermolaus Barbarus is brilliant, but if it is the original how did <span class="italic">praesentius</span> arise? I leave the text and translation within daggers, as I consider my own suggestion too conjectural. The sense, however, of the text of Hermolaus Barbarus is excellent: “as though it had found inside a foe to match it.” Professor Andrews thinks that the text is sound, with the sense: “as though it had found something more urgent, and so fights solely with this.”</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL393_391_aa').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
