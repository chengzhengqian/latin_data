<p>XIII. The Persian plum or peach, it is true, is<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">The peach.</span></span> shown by its very name to be an exotic even in Asia Minor and in Greece, and to have been introduced
from Persia. But the wild plum is known to grow everywhere, which makes it more surprising that this fruit is not mentioned by Cato, especially as he pointed out the way of storing some wild fruits also. As for the peach-tree, it was only introduced lately, and that with difficulty, inasmuch as in Rhodes, which was its first place of sojourn after leaving Egypt, it does not bear at all. It is not true that the peach grown in Persia is poisonous and causes torturing pain, and that, when it had been transplanted into Egypt by the kings to use as a punishment, the nature of the soil caused it to lose its dangerous properties; for the more careful writers relate this of the persea,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL370_319_a" id="target_note_LCL370_319_a"><sup>a</sup></a> which is an entirely different tree, resembling the red myxa, and which has refused to grow anywhere but in the east. The sebesten also, according to the more learned authorities, was not introduced from Persia for punitive purposes, but was planted at Memphis by Perseus, and it was for that reason that Alexander, in order to do honour to his ancestor, established the custom of using wreaths of it for crowning victors in the games<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL370_319_b" id="target_note_LCL370_319_b"><sup>b</sup></a> at Memphis. It always has leaves and fruit upon it, fresh ones sprouting immediately after the others. But it will be obvious that all our plums also have been introduced since the time of Cato.</p>
