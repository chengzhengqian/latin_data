The heads and tails of mice, reduced to ash and made into an ointment with honey, restore, they say, clearness of vision; much better the ash of a dormouse or wild mouse, or the brain of an eagle or the gall with Attic honey.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL418_259_a" id="target_note_LCL418_259_a"><sup>a</sup></a> The ash and fat<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL418_259_b" id="target_note_LCL418_259_b"><sup>b</sup></a> of the shrew-mouse, beaten up with antimony, is very good for watery eyes—what antimony is I shall say when I speak<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL418_259_c" id="target_note_LCL418_259_c"><sup>c</sup></a> of metals—the ash of the weasel for cataract, likewise of the lizard, or the brain of the swallow.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL418_259_d" id="target_note_LCL418_259_d"><sup>d</sup></a> Pounded snails applied to the forehead relieve eye fluxes, either by themselves or with fine flour or with frankincense; so applied they are also good for sunstroke.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL418_259_e" id="target_note_LCL418_259_e"><sup>e</sup></a> To burn them alive also, and to use as ointment the ash with Cretan honey is very good for dimness of vision.
