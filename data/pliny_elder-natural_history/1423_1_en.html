it always removes leprous sores and psoriasis easily, as well as the sores left by scars. It is said that in cases of tooth-ache, if it be attached to the arm on the side where the pain is, this is diverted to it.</p>
<p>LXXI. Git is by some Greeks called melanthium,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL392_107_a" id="target_note_LCL392_107_a"><sup>a</sup></a><span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Git or Roman coriaander.</span></span> by others, melaspermon.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL392_107_b" id="target_note_LCL392_107_b"><sup>b</sup></a> The best has the most pungent smell and the darkest colour. It cures the wounds of serpents and of scorpions. I find that it is applied in vinegar and honey, and that by burning it serpents are kept away. A dose of one drachma also is taken in drink for the wounds of spiders. Pounded, and smelt in a piece of linen it stops running from the nose, and headaches if applied in vinegar; poured into the nostrils with iris juice it cures fluxes and swellings of the eyes, tooth-ache when boiled with vinegar, ulcers in the mouth when pounded or chewed; likewise leprous sores and freckles when added to vinegar, difficulty of breathing when taken in drink with soda, and indurations, chronic swellings and suppurations, when used as liniment. It increases the flow of women’s milk if taken daily for a few days. Its juice is collected in a similar way to that of henbane, and like it is poisonous if taken in too large doses, a fact more remarkable because the seed actually makes a most pleasant seasoning for loaves of bread. It cleanses the eyes also, is diuretic and an emmenagogue. Moreover, I find that merely by tying thirty grains to the body in a piece of linen, the after-birth is brought away. It is also said that pounded and applied in urine it cures corns on the feet, and that fumigation with it kills gnats as well as flies.</p>
<p>LXXII. Anise too is taken in wine for the stings of scorpions, being one of the few remedies specially praised, whether raw or boiled, by Pythagoras.
