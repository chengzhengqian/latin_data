a sound by rubbing against it. He thinks that flies, bees and other similar creatures begin and cease to give an audible sound when they begin and cease to fly, as the sound is caused by friction and by the air inside them, not by breathing; and that locusts make a sound by rubbing their wings against their thighs. It is indeed believed that among aquatic creatures scallops similarly make a rushing sound when they fly, but that shell-fish and crustaceans have no voice nor sound of any kind. But the other fishes, although they lack lungs and windpipe, are not entirely devoid of any sound at all—people advance the quibble that their hiss is made with the teeth—and the fish in the river Achelous called the boar-fish<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL353_601_a" id="target_note_LCL353_601_a"><sup>a</sup></a> has a grunt, and so have others about which we have spoken.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL353_601_b" id="target_note_LCL353_601_b"><sup>b</sup></a> Oviparous species have a hiss—snakes a long one, tortoises an abrupt one. Frogs have a special kind of voice, as has been said,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL353_601_c" id="target_note_LCL353_601_c"><sup>c</sup></a> unless in their case also we are to allow some uncertainty, because ‘voice’ means a sound formed in the mouth, not in the chest. Still in the case of frogs the nature of the localities also makes a great deal of difference: the frogs in Macedonia are reported to be dumb, and also the boars. Among birds the smaller ones are more talkative, and particularly at the mating season. Some birds, e.g. quails, give a cry when fighting, others, e.g. partridges, before a fight, others, e.g. domestic fowls, when they have won. With the latter the cocks have a crow of their own, but with other birds, for instance the nightingale class, the hens also have the same note. Some birds sing all the year, some at certain seasons, as has been said in dealing with the species separately. The elephant squeezes out a sound like a sneeze from its actual mouth, not through
