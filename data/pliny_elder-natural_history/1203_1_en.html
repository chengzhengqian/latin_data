Scaevola’s farmhouse would not hold the produce of his farm and Lucullus’s farm was not big enough for his house—a sort of extravagance that occasioned the censor’s rebuke that there was less ground to plough than floor-space to sweep. The proper arrangement requires a certain amount of technical skill. Quite recently Gaius Marius, who was seven times consul, built a country house in the district of Miseno, but he relied on the skill he had acquired in planning the lay-out of a camp, so that even Sulla<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL371_211_a" id="target_note_LCL371_211_a"><sup>a</sup></a> the Fortunate declared that all the others had been blind men in comparison with Marius. It is agreed that a country house ought not to be put near a marsh nor with a river in front of it—although Homer has stated with the greatest truth that in any case<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL371_211_b" id="target_note_LCL371_211_b"><sup>b</sup></a> there are always unhealthy currents of air rising from a river before dawn. In hot localities the house should look north, in cold ones south and in temperate situations due east.</p>
<p>As to proofs by which the quality of the land<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Quality of land.</span></span>
itself can be judged, we may possibly be thought to have spoken of these with sufficient fullness when discussing the best kind of soil, but nevertheless we<span class="marginNote right">XVII. 25 ff.</span>
will still supplement the indications we have given by some words of Cato<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL371_211_c" id="target_note_LCL371_211_c"><sup>c</sup></a> more particularly: ‘The danewort
or the wild plum or the bramble, the small-bulb,
trefoil, meadow grass, oak, wild pears and wild apple are indications of a soil fit for corn, as also is black or ash-coloured earth. All chalk land will scorch the crop unless it is an extremely thin soil, and so will sand unless it also is extremely fine; and the same soils answer much better for plantations on level ground than for those on a slope.’</p>
