(6) Next, the sun’s course is divided into 360 parts, but in order that an observation taken of the shadows that it casts may come round to the starting-point, five and a quarter days <span class="italic">per annum</span> are added; consequently to every fourth<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL330_191_a" id="target_note_LCL330_191_a"><sup>a</sup></a> year an intercalary day is added to make our chronology tally with the course of the sun.</p>
