It is cropped in rocky localities and is full of juice, being a very efficacious remedy, either by the mouth or as an ointment, for the poison of serpents, and also for disordered stomach, chronic cough, phlegm collected in the throat, ruptures, sprains and pain in the side. It reduces the spleen, promotes menstruation, and is diuretic, being for this reason efficacious in incipient dropsy, a handful of its sprays being boiled down to one-third in a sextarius and a half of water. It is ground in water to make lozenges for the purposes mentioned above. With honey it also heals abscesses and chronic sores, even when foul.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL393_95_a" id="target_note_LCL393_95_a"><sup>a</sup></a> There is also made from it a wine, which is useful for troubles of the chest.

leaves which resemble those of the olive—they are bitter, however, and scented—growing in rocky places and not exceeding a span in height.
