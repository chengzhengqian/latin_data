other hand, am prepared to explain the methods of detecting false gems, since it is only fitting that even luxury should be protected against deception. Apart, then, from the details that I have given in describing the best stones of each class, it is recommended that transparent stones in general should be tested early in the morning or, if necessary, up to ten o’clock, but on no account later than this. Tests are made in many different ways: first by weight, because genuine stones are heavier; then by coolness, since genuine stones also feel colder in the mouth; and after this by structure. For artificial stones show globules deep below the surface, rough patches on the surface itself, filaments, an inconsistent lustre and a brightness that fails to strike the eye. The most effective test is to knock off a piece of the stone so that it can be baked on an iron plate, but dealers in precious stones not unnaturally object to this, and likewise to testing with a file. Flakes of obsidian will not scratch a genuine stone, but on a false stone every scratch leaves a white mark. Furthermore, there is a great difference as between one stone and another in that some cannot be engraved with an iron tool and some only with a blunt iron tool, although all can be worked with a diamond point.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_327_a" id="target_note_LCL419_327_a"><sup>a</sup></a><span class="marginNote right">§ 60.</span>
But what is most effective in working gemstones is the heat generated by the drill.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_327_ba" id="target_note_LCL419_327_ba"><sup>b</sup></a></p> <p>The rivers that produce gems are the Chenab
