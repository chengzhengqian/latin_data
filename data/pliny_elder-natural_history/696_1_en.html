sides; but there are some that fly with their wings for the greater part folded, and after giving one stroke, or others also a repeated stroke, are borne by the air: by as it were squeezing it tight between their wings, they shoot upward or horizontally or downward. Some you would think to be flung forward, or again in some cases to fall from a height and in other cases to leap upward. Only ducks and birds of the same kind soar up straight away, and move skyward from the start, and this even from water; and consequently they alone when they have fallen into the pits that we use for trapping wild animals get out again. Vultures and the heavier birds in general cannot fly upward except after a run forward or when launching from a higher eminence; they steer with their tail. Some birds turn their gaze round, others bend their necks; and some eat things they have snatched with their feet. Many do not fly without a cry, others on the contrary are always silent when in flight. They move upward, downward, slanting, sideways, straight forward, and some even with the head bent backward; consequently if several kinds are seen at the same time, they might be thought not to be travelling in the same element.</p>
<p>LV. The greatest flyers are the species resembling<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Flight of swifts.</span></span> swallows called <span class="italic">apodes</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL353_365_a" id="target_note_LCL353_365_a"><sup>a</sup></a> (because they lack the use of feet) and by others ‘cypseli.’ They build their nests on crags. These are the birds seen all over the sea, and ships never go away from land on so long or so unbroken a course that they do not have <span class="italic">apodes</span> flying round them. All the other kinds alight and perch, but these never rest except on the nest: they either hover or lie on a surface.</p>
