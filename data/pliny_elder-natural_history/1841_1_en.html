They relieve too hiccoughs. This plant, as it causes barrenness, must not be given to women.</p>
<p>XVIII. Asclepias has leaves like those of ivy, long<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Asclepias.</span></span> branches, numerous roots that are slender and scented, stinking flowers, and a hatchet-shaped seed.

Its stem has two or three oblong leaves, and on the top are little heads with rays like stars. In drink it is also taken for snake bites. But as medicine for the groin it is enjoined to be plucked with the left hand, and to be tied as an amulet next the girdle. As an amulet it is also good for sciatica.</p>
<p>XX. Ascyron and ascyroides are like one another<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Ascyron.</span></span> and also like hypericon, but what is called ascyroides
has larger branches, which are like fennel-giant, red<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL393_411_da" id="target_note_LCL393_411_da"><sup>d</sup></a> . . . and with small yellow heads.
