<p>XXXVI. An exceptionally remarkable thing occurs<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Peculiarities of foliage.</span></span> in the case of the elm, lime, olive, white poplar and willow: after midsummer their leaves turn right round, and no other indication shows with greater certainty that the season is finished. Also their leaves contain in themselves a variation that is common to

leaves and the myrtle, pomegranate and olive narrow
ones; those of the pine and cedar are like hairs, those
of the holly and one kind of holm-oak pricklyâ€”indeed the juniper has a spine instead of a leaf. The leaves of the cypress and tamarisk are fleshy, those of the
