ordered the fires to be put out, thus showing his
respect for the mighty block when he had felt none
for the city itself. There are also two other obelisks

by King Necthebis, and it proved to be a
greater achievement to carry it down the river and
erect it than to have quarried it. According to

the blocks was double that of the obelisk, since their
total cubic capacity was twice as great. In this way,
the ships were able to come beneath the obelisk,
which was suspended by its ends from both banks of
the canal. Then the blocks were unloaded and the
ships, riding high, took the weight of the obelisk.
It was erected on six stone baulks from the same
