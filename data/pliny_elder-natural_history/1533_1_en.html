their kinds are an antidote to the sting of the scorpion.</p>
<p>XXII. Hartshorn is a longish plant with fissures.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL392_327_a" id="target_note_LCL392_327_a"><sup>a</sup></a><span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Hartshorn,</span></span> Sometimes it is cultivated, because its root, roasted
in hot ashes, is a splendid remedy for coeliac complaints.</p>
<p>XXIII. Alkanet too has a useful root, which is of<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Alkanet</span> (<span class="italic">Anchusa officinalis</span>).</span> the thickness of a finger. It is split into small divisions
like the papyrus, and stains the hands the colour of blood; it prepares wools for costly colours.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL392_327_b" id="target_note_LCL392_327_b"><sup>b</sup></a> Applied in wax ointment it heals ulcerous sores, especially those of the aged, and also burns. Insoluble in water, it dissolves in oil, and this is the
test of genuineness. A drachma of it is given to be taken in wine for pains in the kidneys, or if there be fever, in a decoction of behen nut; also for affections of the liver and spleen and for violent biliousness. It is applied in vinegar to leprous sores and freckles. The pounded leaves, with honey and meal, are applied to sprains, and doses of two drachmae in honey wine check looseness of the bowels. Fleas are said to be killed by a decoction of the root in water.</p>
<p>XXIV. There is also another plant, which being like alkanet is called bastard alkanet, though some call it echis<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL392_327_c" id="target_note_LCL392_327_c"><sup>c</sup></a> or doris<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL392_327_d" id="target_note_LCL392_327_d"><sup>d</sup></a> or by many other names; it is more downy than the other and less fleshy, the leaves are thinner and more flabby. The root in oil does not give out a red juice, by which test it is distinguished from true alkanet. The leaves or seed taken in drink are a very sure antidote to snake bite. The leaves are applied to stings and bites, and their strong smell keeps snakes away. A draught too is made from the plant for affections of the spine.
