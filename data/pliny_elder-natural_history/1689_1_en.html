beneficial for snake-bites if one takes aron in a draught of dark<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL393_107_a" id="target_note_LCL393_107_a"><sup>a</sup></a> wine. It is said that cheese keeps very well if wrapped in leaves of aron.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL393_107_b" id="target_note_LCL393_107_b"><sup>b</sup></a></p>
<p>XCIII. The dracunculus I have referred to is dug up when the barley is ripening and the moon is crescent. Merely to have it on the person keeps away serpents. All the more beneficial a draught is it said to be to those who have been bitten; and its potency to be greater if iron does not touch the plant. Earache too is relieved by its juice.</p>
<p>That plant, however, which the Greeks call dracontium<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Dracontium.</span></span>
has been pointed out to me in three illustrations; the first<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL393_107_c" id="target_note_LCL393_107_c"><sup>c</sup></a> has leaves like those of beet, a thyrsus and a purple flower; this is like the aron. Others have pointed out a kind with a long root, which is as it were stamped and knotted, and with three stems in all, prescribing a decoction of its leaves in vinegar for the bite of serpents. The third plant pointed out had a leaf larger than that of the cornel and a root like that of a reed, the knots on it being, they said, as many as the plant is years old, the leaves too being also equal in number. They prescribed this plant in wine or water for snake-bite.</p>
<p>XCIV. There is also a plant called the aris, which<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Aris and other plants.</span></span>
too is a native of Egypt. It is similar to the aron, only itself and its leaves are smaller, as is also the root in particular, though it is as big as a full-sized olive. The white kind puts out twin stems, the other kind one only. Either is good for running sores as well as for burns, and for fistula also if a suppository made
