oil makes an unguent, provided that the stacte kind<span class="marginNote right">XII. 68.</span> is used—otherwise it produces too bitter a flavour. Unguent of Cyprus produces a green colour, lily unguent gives a greasy consistency, oil of Mendes makes the mixture black, attar of roses white, and myrrh gives a pale hue.</p>
<p>These are the kinds of perfumes invented in early times, and the subsequent pilferings of the factories. We will now speak of what is the very climax of luxury and the most important example of this commodity.</p>
<p>What then is called the ‘royal’ unguent, because<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">‘Royal’ perfume.</span></span> it is a blend prepared for the kings of Parthia, is made of behen-nut juice, costus, amomum, Syrian cinnamon, cardamom, spikenard, cat-thyme, myrrh, cinnamon-bark, styrax-tree gum, ladanum, balm, Syrian flag and Syrian rush, wild grape, cinnamon-leaf, serichatum, cyprus, camel’s thorn, all-heal, saffron, gladiolus, marjoram, lotus, honey and wine. And none of the components of this scent is grown in Italy, the conqueror of the world, and indeed none in the whole of Europe excepting the iris<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL370_109_a" id="target_note_LCL370_109_a"><sup>a</sup></a> in Illyria and nard in Gaul—for as to wine and roses and myrtle leaves and olive oil, they may be taken as belonging to pretty well all countries in common.</p>
<p>III. What are called sprinkling powders are made<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">How to keep scents.</span></span> of dried scents, the dregs of unguents being termed ‘magma.’ Among all the scents employed the one added last is the most powerful. Unguents keep best in alabaster boxes, scents when mixed with oil, and the fatter it is, as for instance oil of almonds, the better it helps to preserve them for a long time; and the unguents themselves improve with age. Sunshine is detrimental to them, and therefore they are stored in the shade, in vessels made of lead.
