half the circle is subtracted by the interposition of the earth at the centre, the measure of the sun‘s altitude comprises about 1/6th of this conjecturally estimated immense space of the solar circle round the earth, and the moon‘s altitude 1/12th, since the moon runs in a circuit that is much shorter than the sun‘s; so that it comes between the sun and the earth. It is marvellous to what length the depravity of man‘s intellect will go when lured on by some trifling success, in the way in which reason furnishes impudence with its opportunity in the case of the calculations above stated. And when they have dared to guess the distances of the sun from the earth they apply the same figures to the sky, on the ground that the sun is at its centre, with the consequence that they have at their finger’s ends the dimensions of the world also. For they argue that the circumference of a circle is 22/7 times its diameter, as though the measure of the heavens were merely regulated from a plumb-line!
The Egyptian calculation published by Petosiris and Nechepsos infers that one degree of the lunar circle measures (as has been said) just over 4 1/8 miles at the least, one degree of the widest circle, Saturn’s, twice that size, and one of the sun’s circle, which we stated to be in the middle, the mean between the other two. This computation is a most shameful business, since the addition of the distance of the zodiac itself to the circle of Saturn produces a multiple that is even beyond reckoning.</p>

The Greeks call them ‘comets,’ in our language ‘long-haired stars,’ because they have a blood-red
