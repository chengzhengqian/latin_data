A black is also produced with dyes from the black florescence which adheres to bronze pans. One is also made by burning logs of pitch-pine and pounding the charcoal in a mortar. The cuttle-fish has a remarkable property in forming a black secretion, but no colour is made from this.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL394_293_c" id="target_note_LCL394_293_c"><sup>c</sup></a> The preparation of all black is completed by exposure to the sun, black for writing ink receiving an admixture of gum and black for painting walls an admixture of glue.
