About its use there is general agreement, for it is a plant very easily found, and one of the most useful, being moreover especially honoured at the religious rites of the Roman people, seeing that at the Latin festival there is a race for four-horse chariots on the Capitoline Hill, the winner of which takes a draught of wormwood, our ancestors thinking, I believe, that health was a very grand prize to give. It strengthens the stomach and for this reason it is used, as I have said,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL393_417_a" id="target_note_LCL393_417_a"><sup>a</sup></a> to give a flavour to wines. A decoction in water, which is afterwards cooled in the open for a day and a night, is also taken; six drachmae of the leaves with their branches are boiled down in three sextarii of rain water; salt too should be added. When very old it can still be used.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL393_417_ba" id="target_note_LCL393_417_ba"><sup>b</sup></a> There is also administered an infusion of wormwood in water; for this preparation should be styled “infusion,” and an essential of the infusion is that, whatever quantity<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL393_417_c" id="target_note_LCL393_417_c"><sup>c</sup></a> of water is used, for three days the preparation should be wholly enclosed.
