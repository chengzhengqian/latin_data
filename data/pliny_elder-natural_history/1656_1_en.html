are styptic,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL393_41_a" id="target_note_LCL393_41_a"><sup>a</sup></a> and have the property of closing wounds.
The inner bark in particular relieves leprous sores, as also does a local application of the leaves soaked in vinegar. One denarius of the bark, taken in a hemina of cold water, purges the bowels, being specific for carrying off phlegms and watery humours. Its tear is also applied locally to gatherings, wounds and burns, which it is good to foment with a decoction. The moisture forming in the pods of this tree brings a brightness to the skin and makes the looks more pleasing. The tips of the little stalks of the leaves boiled down in wine cure tumours and draw out the pus through fistulas. The same property is shown by the inner barks. Many hold that the bark when chewed is very good for wounds, and that the leaves, pounded and sprinkled with water, are so for swollen feet. An application of the moisture too, that exudes, as I have said,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL393_41_b" id="target_note_LCL393_41_b"><sup>b</sup></a> from the pith of the tree when lopped, restores hair to the scalp and prevents it from falling out.</p>

Only its leaves, however, are used both for babies’ sores and for those in the mouth; they may be chewed or a decoction may be made of them; they
are diuretic. Applied locally they check menstruation; taken in drink they draw off extravasated blood.</p>
