Beyond these men, there are not a great many more that are famous. The reputation of some, distinguished though their work may be, has been obscured by the number of artists engaged with them on a single task, because no individual monopolizes the credit nor again can several of them be named on equal terms.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_29_c" id="target_note_LCL419_29_c"><sup>c</sup></a> This is the case with the Laocoon in the palace of General Titus, a work superior to any painting and any bronze.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_29_d" id="target_note_LCL419_29_d"><sup>d</sup></a> Laocoon, his children and the wonderful clasping coils of the
