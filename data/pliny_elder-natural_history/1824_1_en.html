<p>XC. For diseases of women a very good general<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Diseases of women.</span></span> remedy is the black seed, taken in hydromel, of the plant paeonia; its root also has the same property. An emmenagogue is seed of panaces with wormwood, and a sudorific emmenagogue is scordotis, taken internally or<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL393_377_a" id="target_note_LCL393_377_a"><sup>a</sup></a> applied locally. Betony in doses of one drachma to three cyathi of wine is taken for all uterine affections, and for those that result from child-birth. Excessive menstruation is checked by an application of achillia or<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL393_377_a" id="target_note_LCL393_377_a"><sup>a</sup></a> a sitz bath in a decoction of it. To the breasts is applied henbane seed in wine—but
to the uterus henbane root in a plaster<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL393_377_b" id="target_note_LCL393_377_b"><sup>b</sup></a>—and also chelidonia. A pessary of panaces roots brings away retarded after-birth or the dead foetus. The uterus is purged by panaces, taken by itself in wine, and by a pessary of it with honey. Polemonia taken in wine forces out the after-birth, and the fumes of it when burnt correct the uterus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL393_377_c" id="target_note_LCL393_377_c"><sup>c</sup></a> Juice of the lesser centaury taken in drink or used as a fomentation is an emmenagogue, and the root of the greater centaury, used in the same ways, is good for uterine pains, while if it is scraped and applied as a pessary it brings away a dead foetus. Plantain is applied as a pessary<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL393_377_d" id="target_note_LCL393_377_d"><sup>d</sup></a> in wool for pain in the uterus; for hysterical suffocation it is taken in drink. But it is dittany that is of the greatest efficacy; it is an emmenagogue, and forces out the foetus when dead or lying transversely—an
obolus of the leaves is taken in water—being so efficacious in these respects that it is not even introduced into the bedroom of pregnant women. Not only when taken in drink but also when used as embrocation or a fumigation it has medicinal power. Bastard dittany is very nearly as good, but for an emmenagogue it is boiled down with neat wine, the
