and in shut-in valleys that have no current of air through them, whereas windy places and high ground on the contrary are free from it. Among the vices of corn is also over-abundance, when the stalks fall down under the burden of fertility. But a vice common to all cultivated crops is caterpillars, which even attack chick-pea when rain makes it taste sweeter by washing away its saltness.</p>
<p>There is a weed that kills off chick-pea and bitter vetch by binding itself round them, called orobanche<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL371_287_a" id="target_note_LCL371_287_a"><sup>a</sup></a>; and in a similar way wheat is attacked by darnel, barley by a long-stalked plant called aegilops and lentils by an axe-leaved plant<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL371_287_b" id="target_note_LCL371_287_b"><sup>b</sup></a> which the Greeks call axe-grass from its resemblance; these also kill the plants by twining round them. In the neighbourhood of Philippi<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL371_287_c" id="target_note_LCL371_287_c"><sup>c</sup></a> they give the name of ateramum to a weed growing in rich soil that kills the bean plant, and the name teramum to one that has the same effect in thin soil, when a particular wind has been blowing on the beans when damp. Darnel has a very small seed enclosed in a prickly husk. When used in bread it very quickly causes fits of giddiness, and it is said that in Asia and Greece when the managers of baths want to get rid of a crowd they throw darnel seed on to hot coals. Also the phalangium, a little creature of the spider class, breeds in bitter vetch, if there is a wet winter. Slugs breed amongst vetch, and sometimes small snails which are produced from the ground and eat away the vetch in a surprising manner.—These broadly speaking are the diseases of grain.</p>
