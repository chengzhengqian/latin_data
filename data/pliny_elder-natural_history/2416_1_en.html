<p>XXV. As we pass from marble to the other remarkable<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Magnetite.</span></span>
varieties of stone, no one can doubt that it is the magnet that first of all comes to mind. For what is more strange than this stone? In what field has Nature displayed a more perverse wilfulness? She has given to rocks a voice which, as I have explained, <span class="marginNote right">§ 100.</span> echoes that of Man, or rather interrupts it as well. What is more impassive than the stiffness of stone? And yet we see that she has endowed the magnet with senses and hands.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_101_b" id="target_note_LCL419_101_b"><sup>b</sup></a> What is more recalcitrant than the hardness of iron? We see that she has bestowed on it feet and instincts. For iron is attracted by the magnet, and the substance that vanquishes all other things rushes into a kind of vacuum<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_101_ca" id="target_note_LCL419_101_ca"><sup>c</sup></a> and, as it approaches the magnet, it leaps towards it and is held by it and clasped in its embrace. And so the magnet is called by the Greeks by another name, the ‘iron stone,’ and by some of them the ‘stone of Heracles.’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_101_d" id="target_note_LCL419_101_d"><sup>d</sup></a> According to Nicander, it was called ‘magnes’ from the name of its discover, who found it on Mount Ida.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_101_e" id="target_note_LCL419_101_e"><sup>e</sup></a> Incidentally, it is to be found in many places, including Spain.
