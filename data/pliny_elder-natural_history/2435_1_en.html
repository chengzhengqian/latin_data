<p>LIV. Of sand, there are three varieties: there is<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Sand.</span></span>
quarry sand, to which has to be added one-quarter of its weight in lime; and river or alternatively sea sand, to which must be added one-third. If one-third of crushed potsherds also is added, the material will be improved.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_139_c" id="target_note_LCL419_139_c"><sup>c</sup></a> No quarry sand is found from the Apennines as far as the Po, nor does it occur overseas.</p>
<p>LV. The chief reason for the collapse of buildings in Rome is the purloining of lime, as the result of which the rough stones are laid on each other without any proper mortar. It is also a fact that the slurry improves with keeping.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_139_d" id="target_note_LCL419_139_d"><sup>d</sup></a> In the old building laws is to be found a regulation that no contractor is to use a slurry that is less than three years old. Consequently, old plaster work was never disfigured by cracks. Stucco never possesses the required brilliance <span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Stucco.</span></span>
unless three coats of sand mortar<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_139_e" id="target_note_LCL419_139_e"><sup>e</sup></a> and two of marble stucco<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_139_f" id="target_note_LCL419_139_f"><sup>f</sup></a> are laid on. Buildings exposed to damp or erected in a locality where they may be affected by moisture from the sea may with profit be given an undercoat of plaster made from pounded potsherds. In Greece sand mortar for plaster work is, furthermore, worked up in a trough with wooden poles before it is spread. The test for ascertaining that marble stucco has been worked to the correct consistency
