a broad, long leaf, and covers the banks of borders and the flat tops of the raised portions of gardens.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL392_347_b" id="target_note_LCL392_347_b"><sup>b</sup></a> One is thorny and curled, which is the shorter; the other is smooth, and is called by some paederos, by others melamphyllum. Its roots are wonderfully good for burns, sprains, ruptures, convulsions, and those threatened with consumption; for which reason they are boiled for food, mostly in barley water.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL392_347_c" id="target_note_LCL392_347_c"><sup>c</sup></a> For gouty limbs too they are applied, pounded and hot.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL392_347_d" id="target_note_LCL392_347_d"><sup>d</sup></a></p>

Hippocrates recommends it as a food, Glauco and Nicander<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL392_347_e" id="target_note_LCL392_347_e"><sup>e</sup></a> as a medicine. Its seed counteracts the poison of serpents. The leaves or the juice they apply in wine for the removal of the afterbirth, and the leaves with salt and wine for scrofulous swellings. Its root is given in wine for snake bites and as a diuretic.</p>
