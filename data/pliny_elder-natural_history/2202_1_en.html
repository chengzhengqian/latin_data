<p>XXVI. A help against snake-bite is also flesh of<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Remedies: from birds.</span></span> doves or swallows freshly torn away, and the feet of a horned owl burnt with the herb plumbago. Speaking
of this bird I will not omit a specimen of Magian fraud, for besides their other monstrous lies they declare that an horned owl’s heart, placed on the left breast of a sleeping woman, makes her tell all her secrets, and that men carrying it into battle are made braver by it. From the horned owl’s egg they prescribe recipes for the hair. Now who, I ask, could have ever looked at an horned owl’s egg, when it is a portent to have seen the bird itself? Who in any case could have tried it, particularly on the hair? The blood, indeed, of a horned owl’s chick is guaranteed even to curl the hair.

Its blood also with thistle the Magi praise as one of the sovereign remedies for snake-bite.</p>

Its wound is more painful than that of the wasp, and it lives especially near furnaces and mills. One remedy is to show to the bitten person another phalangium of the same kind; for this purpose are kept dead<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL418_237_b" id="target_note_LCL418_237_b"><sup>b</sup></a> specimens. Their dry bodies are also found, which are pounded and taken as a remedy, as are a weasel’s young prepared as I have described.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL418_237_c" id="target_note_LCL418_237_c"><sup>c</sup></a> Among classes of spiders the
