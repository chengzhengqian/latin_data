grainings in the fibre run crosswise, and consequently even vessels made of beechwood were highly valued in old days: Manius Curius declared on oath that he had touched nothing of the booty taken in a battle except a flask made of beech-wood, to use in offering sacrifices.</p>

each part of it sinking deeper the nearer it was to the root. Some timbers have fibre without veins, consisting of thin filaments merely; these are the easiest to split. Others have no fibre, and break more quickly than they split, for instance olives and vines. But on the other hand in the fig-tree the body consists entirely of flesh, while the holm-oak, cornel, hard oak, cytisus, mulberry, ebony, nettle-trees and those we have stated to be without marrow, consist<span class="marginNote right">§ 183.</span>
entirely of bone. The timber of all of these is of a blackish colour except the cornel, hunting spears made of which are bright yellow when notched with incisions for the purpose of decoration. The cedar, the larch and the juniper are red. The female larch contains wood called in Greek aegis, of the colour of honey; this wood<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL370_509_a" id="target_note_LCL370_509_a"><sup>a</sup></a> when made into panels for pictures has been found to last for ever without being split by any cracks; it is the part of the trunk nearest to the pith; in the fir-tree the Greeks call this ‘lusson.’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL370_509_b" id="target_note_LCL370_509_b"><sup>b</sup></a> The hardest part of the cedar also is the part nearest the pith—as the bones are in the body—provided the slime<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL370_509_c" id="target_note_LCL370_509_c"><sup>c</sup></a> has been scraped off. It is reported<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL370_509_d" id="target_note_LCL370_509_d"><sup>d</sup></a> that the inner part of the elder also is remarkably firm, and some people prefer hunting spears made of it to all others, as it consists entirely of skin and bones.</p>
