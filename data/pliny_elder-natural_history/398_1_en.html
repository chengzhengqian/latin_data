<p>XXVII. Nearchus writes that the length of the<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Carmania.</span></span> coast of Carmania is 1250 miles, and the distance
from its beginning to the river Sabis 100 miles; and that from that river to the river Ananis, a space of 25 miles, there are vineyards and arable land. The district is called Armysia; and towns of Carmania
are Zetis and Alexandria.</p>
<p>XXVIII. Moreover in this region the sea then<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">The Red Sea and Persian Gulf.</span></span>
makes a double inroad<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL352_421_a" id="target_note_LCL352_421_a"><sup>a</sup></a> into the land; the name
given to it by our countrymen is the Red Sea, while
the Greeks call it Erythrum, from King Erythras, or, according to others, in the belief that the water is given a red colour by the reflexion of the sun, while others say that the name comes from the sand and
the soil, and others that it is due to the actual water being naturally of such a character. However, this sea is divided into two bays. The one to the east is called the Persian Gulf, and according to the report of Eratosthenes measures 2500 miles round. Opposite is Arabia, with a coastline 1500 miles in length, and on its other side Arabia is encompassed by the second bay, named the Arabian Gulf; the ocean flowing into this is called the Azanian Sea. The width of the Persian Gulf at its entrance some make five and others four miles; the distance in a straight line from the entrance to the innermost part of the Gulf has been ascertained to be nearly 1125 miles, and its outline has been found to be in the likeness of a human head. Onesicritus and Nearchus write that from the river Indus to the Persian Gulf and from there to Babylon by the marshes of the Euphrates is a voyage of 1700 miles.</p>
