vote I spoke of gave him the honour when Hannibal was driven from Italy,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL392_303_a" id="target_note_LCL392_303_a"><sup>a</sup></a> and the crown was the only one placed on the recipient’s head by the hand of the State itself, and—a special feature in the case of Fabius—it was the only one given by the whole of Italy.</p>
