into lozenges. These, dissolved in three cyathi of white wine, are given for thirty days to cure splenic affections, the spleen being reduced either by blood in the urine or through the bowels, as is plain immediately from the tenth day. The boiled leaves too are diuretic, and also beneficial to asthmatics; they aid delivery and bring away the after-birth if taken in drink in a similar way.</p>

This seed is bitter, a good stomachic, and an ingredient of antidotes.</p>
<p>XCVI. Polygala is a full span in height, with<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Polygala.</span></span> leaves, like those of lentil, on the top of the stem, and with an astringent taste.

<p>XCVII. Poterion, or as some call it, phrynion<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Poterion.</span></span> or neuras, is a spreading shrub, shrivelled and prickly, with thick down, small round leaves, long branches that are soft, flexible and slender, and a long flower of a grass-green colour. The seed is not used in medicine, but has a sharp, aromatic taste. The plant is found on moist hills. It has two or three roots, two cubits in depth, sinewy, white and firm. It is dug up in autumn, and when the shrub has been cut away,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL393_465_d" id="target_note_LCL393_465_d"><sup>d</sup></a> the root yields a juice like gum. An application of the root is said to be a wonderful healer of wounds, especially of sinews even when they have been severed. A decoction of the root also, taken with honey, is good for relaxed, weak, or cut sinews.</p>
