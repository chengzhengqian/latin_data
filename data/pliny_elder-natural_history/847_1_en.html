<p>The prices vary with the supply of buyers; that of<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Prices of myrrh.</span></span> stacte ranges from 3 to 50 denarii a pound, whereas the top price for cultivated myrrh is 11 denarii and for Erythrean 16—this kind is passed off as Arabian—and
for the kernel of Cave-dweller 16½, but for the variety called scented myrrh 12. Myrrh is adulterated with lumps of lentisk and with gum, and also with cucumber juice to give it a bitter taste, as it is with litharge of silver to increase its weight. The rest of the impurities can be detected by taste, and gum by its sticking to the teeth. But the adulteration most difficult to detect is that practised in the case of Indian myrrh, which is collected in India from a certain thorn-bush; this is the only commodity imported from India that is of worse quality than that of other countries—indeed it is easily distinguished because it is so very inferior.</p>
<p>XXXVI. Consequently Indian myrrh passes over<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Mastich.</span></span> into<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL370_53_a" id="target_note_LCL370_53_a"><sup>a</sup></a> mastich, which is also obtained from a thorn in India, and in Arabia as well; it is called laina. Of mastich also there are two kinds, since in Asia and Greece there is also found a plant sending out from its root leaves and a prickly head like an apple, full of seed and of juice which spurts out when an incision is made in the top, so that it can scarcely be distinguished from true mastich. Moreover, there is also a third kind in Pontus which is more like bitumen; but the kind most highly praised is the white mastich of Chios, which fetches a price of 10 denarii a pound, while the black kind costs 2 denarii. It is said that the Chian mastich exudes from the lentisk like a kind of gum. Like frankincense it is adulterated with resin.</p>
