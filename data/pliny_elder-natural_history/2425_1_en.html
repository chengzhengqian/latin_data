It is useful for treating burns and more useful than ruddle for any purpose. The fifth is ‘schistos,’ and this when taken as a draught reduces piles.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_119_a" id="target_note_LCL419_119_a"><sup>a</sup></a> Sotacus goes on to say that three drachms of any haematite pounded in oil should be swallowed on an empty stomach to counteract blood ailments.
