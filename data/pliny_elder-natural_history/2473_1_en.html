<p>XVII. There are twelve kinds of ‘smaragdus.’<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Emeralds.</span></span>
The most notable is the Scythian,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_215_c" id="target_note_LCL419_215_c"><sup>c</sup></a> so called from the nation in whose territory it is found. No kind is deeper in colour or more free from defects: it differs as widely in quality from the other ‘smaragdi’ as they from the other gems. Next to this in esteem, as also in locality, is the Bactrian. These stones are said to be gathered by the natives in the fissures of rocks when the Etesians<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_215_d" id="target_note_LCL419_215_d"><sup>d</sup></a> blow. For at this season the ground is uncovered and the stones glitter here and there because the sands of the desert are shifted violently by these winds.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_215_e" id="target_note_LCL419_215_e"><sup>e</sup></a> These stones, however, are said to be much smaller than the Scythian. Third in order come those of Egypt, which are dug near Coptos, a city of the Thebaid, from mines in the hills.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_215_f" id="target_note_LCL419_215_f"><sup>f</sup></a></p>
