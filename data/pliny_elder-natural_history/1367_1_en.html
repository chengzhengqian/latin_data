It is only used for the table mixed with pearl-barley, which gives it a softer and more agreeable flavour. The wild variety supplies a number of drugs. (And so careful has research been to overlook nothing, that I actually find it stated in a poem<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL371_539_a" id="target_note_LCL371_539_a"><sup>a</sup></a> that if the seeds of leek, rocket, lettuce, parsley, endive and cress are planted enclosed in hollow pellets of goat’s dung, each seed in a separate pellet, they come up wonderfully. With plants of which there is also a wild variety, the latter are thought to be more dry and acrid than the cultivated sort.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL371_539_b" id="target_note_LCL371_539_b"><sup>b</sup></a>)</p>

The only flavour not found in plants is the taste of salt, though occasionally it is present as a sort of external layer, like a dust, and this only in the case of the chickling vetch.</p>
