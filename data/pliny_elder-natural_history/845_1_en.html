<p>XXXIII. Some authorities have stated that myrrh<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Myrrh: its source and localities.</span></span> is the product of a tree growing in the same forests among the frankincense-trees, but the majority say that it grows separately; and in fact it occurs in many places in Arabia, as will appear when we deal with its varieties. A kind highly spoken of is also<span class="marginNote right">§§ 69 f.</span> imported from islands, and the Sabaei even cross the sea to the Cave-dwellers’ Country<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL370_49_a" id="target_note_LCL370_49_a"><sup>a</sup></a> to procure it.
