<p>XXVII. Hazelwort also has the property of nard,<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Hazelwort.</span></span> indeed some people actually call it ‘wild nard.’ It
has the leaves of the ivy, only rounder and softer, a purple flower, the root of Gallic nard, and seed like grape-stones, which has a warm taste with a flavour of wine. On shady mountains it flowers twice a year. The best variety grows in Pontus, the next best in Phrygia and the third in Illyricum. When it begins to shed its leaves it is dug up and dried in the sun, as it quickly becomes mouldy and loses its strength. A plant<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL370_35_a" id="target_note_LCL370_35_a"><sup>a</sup></a> has also lately been found in Thrace the leaves of which do not differ at all from the Indian nard.</p>
<p>XXVIII. The clustered amomum<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL370_35_b" id="target_note_LCL370_35_b"><sup>b</sup></a> is much in use;<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Amomum.</span></span> it is obtained from the Indian wild-vine, or as other people have supposed from a twisted shrub a hand
high, and it is plucked with its root and then gently pressed together into bundles, as it is liable to break at once. The kind most highly spoken of is the one with leaves like those of the pomegranate and devoid of wrinkles, coloured red. The second best kind is of a pale colour; the grass-coloured one is not so good, and the white kind is the worst; it also goes white with age. The price of clustered amomum is 60 denarii a pound, but as dust it fetches only 48 denarii. It grows in the part of Armenia called Otene, and also in Media and in Pontus.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL370_35_c" id="target_note_LCL370_35_c"><sup>c</sup></a> It is adulterated with the leaves of the pomegranate and with liquid gum to make the leaves stick together and form a cluster like a bunch of grapes.</p>
<p>There is also another substance called amomis,<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Amomis.</span></span> which is not so full of veins and is harder and has less scent, showing that it is either a different plant or amomum that has been gathered unripe.</p>
