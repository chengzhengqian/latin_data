embrocation to the belly goat’s blood with barley meal and resin. For all fluxes from the belly an application of soft cheese is recommended, but matured cheese powdered<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL418_141_a" id="target_note_LCL418_141_a"><sup>a</sup></a> is used for coeliac disorders and dysentery, the dose being a cyathus of cheese in three cyathi of ordinary wine. A decoction of goat’s blood with goat’s marrow is beneficial for dysentery, roasted she-goat’s liver for coeliac complaints, or, better still, that of a he-goat boiled down in dry wine and drunk, or applied to the navel in myrtle oil. Some boil it down from three sextarii of water to one hemina with rue added. They also use the roasted spleen of a she-goat or he-goat with the suet of a he-goat in bread baked over hot ashes, the best suet being from the kidneys of a she-goat, which should be swallowed by itself, and be immediately followed by a draught of moderately cold water. Some prescribe also a decoction of the suet in water, made into a stew with other ingredients—pearl barley, cummin, dill, and vinegar. They also rub the belly of sufferers from coeliac disorders with a decoction of honey and goat’s dung. For both complaints they also use kid’s rennet, of the size of a bean, taken in myrtle wine, or kid’s blood made into a food, called “blood pudding.” They also inject into dysentery patients bull glue dissolved in hot water. Flatulence is dispersed by calf dung boiled down in wine. Disorders of the intestines are greatly benefited by a decoction of deers’ rennet with lentils and beet, and so taken in food, by the ash of hare’s fur boiled down with honey, by a draught of goat’s milk boiled down with mallows with the addition of a little salt; if goat’s rennet too is added the beneficial effects will be much greater. The same is the effect
