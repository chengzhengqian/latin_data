lasting on in the winter after the leaves have fallen. It contains a kernel resembling the kernel of pine-cones; this grows in winter and opens out in spring. When the leaves have begun to grow, the whole ball falls off. Such is the multiplicity of products in addition to the acorn that are borne by hard-oaks; but they also produce edible fungi and hog-mushrooms, the most recently discovered stimulants of the appetite, which grow round their roots; those of the common oak are the most esteemed, but those of Valonia and cypress and pine are harmful. Valonias also produce mistletoe, and honey as well according to Hesiod, and it is an accepted fact that<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">w.d.</span> 232.</span> honey-dew falling from the sky,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL370_409_a" id="target_note_LCL370_409_a"><sup>a</sup></a> as we said, deposits itself on the leaves of no other tree in preference to<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">xi. 30</span><span class="br"></span> Valonia oak; and it is well known that Valonia wood when burnt produces a nitrous ash.</p>

This is a grain, and looks at first like a roughness on a shrub, which is the small pointed-leaf holmoak.
The grain is called scolecium, ‘litte worm’.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL370_409_b" id="target_note_LCL370_409_b"><sup>b</sup></a> It furnishes the poor in Spain with the means of paying
