inhospitable roughness called the Axine,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL352_339_a" id="target_note_LCL352_339_a"><sup>a</sup></a> owing to a peculiar jealousy on the part of Nature, which here indulges the sea’s greed without any limit, actually spreads into Europe and Asia. The Ocean was not content to have encircled the earth, and with still further cruelty to have reft away a portion of her surface, nor to have forced an entrance through a breach in the mountains and rent Gibraltar away from Africa, so devouring a larger area than it left remaining, nor to have swallowed up a further space of land and flooded the Sea of Marmara through the Dardanelles; even beyond the Straits of Constantinople also it widens out into another desolate expanse, with an appetite unsatisfied until the Sea of Azov links on its own trespass to its encroachments. That this event occurred against the will of the earth is proved by the number of narrows, and by the smallness
of the gaps left by Nature’s resistance, measuring at the Dardanelles 875 paces,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL352_339_b" id="target_note_LCL352_339_b"><sup>b</sup></a> at the Straits of Constantinople and Kertsch the passage being actually fordable by oxen—which fact gives both of them their name<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL352_339_c" id="target_note_LCL352_339_c"><sup>c</sup></a>;—and also by a certain harmonious affinity contained in their disseverance, as the singing of birds and barking of dogs on one side can be heard on the other, and even the interchange of human speech, conversation going on between the two worlds, save when the actual sound is carried away by the wind.</p>
