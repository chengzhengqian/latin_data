coolness in addition. But as the diggers go deeper, the clods should prove continually moister, and the spades cut down more easily. When wells have been<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Wells and well-digging.</span></span> sunk deep, the well-diggers are killed if they meet with sulphurous or aluminous fumes. A test for this danger is to let down a lighted lamp and see if it goes out. If it does, vent-holes are sunk at the side of the well, on the right and on the left, to take off the oppressive gas. Apart from these injurious substances, mere depth makes the air oppressive; it is dissipated by continuous fanning with linen cloths. When water has been reached, walls are built from the bottom no cement being used lest the springs be dammed up. Some water, the source of which is not at a height, is cooler right from the beginning of spring—for it is made up of winter rain—some is cooler after the rising of the Dog-star<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL418_409_a" id="target_note_LCL418_409_a"><sup>a</sup></a>; in Macedonia at Pella are both kinds. For before the town there is a marsh stream that is cold at the beginning<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Cool waters.</span></span> of summer; then in the higher parts of the town the water is very cold even in the height of summer. A similar phenomenon occurs in Chios also, the relative position of harbour and town being the same. At Athens, Enneacrunos in a cloudy summer is cooler than the well in the Garden of Juppiter, while this latter is very cold during summer droughts. Wells however generally run dry about Arcturus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL418_409_b" id="target_note_LCL418_409_b"><sup>b</sup></a> not in the actual summer, and all sink low during the four days of its rising. Moreover many wells fail throughout the winter, as those around Olynthus, the water returning first in the spring. In Sicily indeed, in the region of Messana and Mylae, springs in winter dry up altogether, but in the actual summer overflow and form rivers. At Apollonia in Pontus a spring
