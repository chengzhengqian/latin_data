So high was the value already set on the art of painting. This must have occurred at about the time of Romulus, since Candaules<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL394_303_b" id="target_note_LCL394_303_b"><sup>b</sup></a> died in the 18th Olympiad, or,<span class="marginNote right">708–705 <span class="sc">b.c.</span></span> according to some accounts, in the same year as Romulus, making it clear, if I am not mistaken,<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">trad.</span> 717 <span class="sc">b.c.</span></span> that the art had already achieved celebrity, and in fact a perfection.
