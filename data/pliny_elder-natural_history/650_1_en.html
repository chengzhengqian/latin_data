to say, after six months of life they melt invisibly back into mud, and again in the waters of springtime are reborn what they were before, equally owing to some hidden principle of nature, as it occurs every year. Also mussels and scallops are produced<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Non-sexual reproduction.</span></span> by spontaneous generation in sandy waters; fish with harder shells, like the two varieties of purple-fish, are generated by a sticky juice like saliva, as gnats are by moisture turning sour; the anchovy by sea-foam growing warm when rain gets into it; but fish protected by a flinty covering, like oysters, are generated by rotting mud, or by the foam round ships that stay moored for some time, and especially round stakes fixed in the ground, and timber. It has recently been discovered in oyster-beds that a fertilizing moisture flows out of these fish like milk. Eels rub against rocks and the scrapings come to life; this is their only way of breeding. Different kinds of fish do not mate together, except the angel-shark and the ray, the cross between which is like a ray in front, and bears in Greece a name<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL353_273_a" id="target_note_LCL353_273_a"><sup>a</sup></a> derived from the names of both parents.</p>

away at a fixed season. Among fish the bass and the shad breed twice a year, and so do all the rock-fish; some breed three times, for instance the pilchard; carp six times; sea-scorpions and sargue twice, in spring and autumn: of the flat fish only the angel-shark
twice, in the autumn and at the setting of the Pleiads; most fish in the three months of April, May and June; the saupe in the autumn, the sargue, the torpedo and the <span class="italic">squalus</span> at the season
