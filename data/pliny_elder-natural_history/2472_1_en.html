several reasons to the ‘smaragdus.’ Certainly, no colour has a more pleasing appearance. For although we gaze eagerly at young plants<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_213_a" id="target_note_LCL419_213_a"><sup>a</sup></a> and at leaves, we look at ‘smaragdi’ with all the more pleasure because, compared with them, there is nothing whatsoever that is more intensely green. Moreover, they alone of gems, when we look at them intently, satisfy the eye without cloying it. Indeed, even after straining our sight by looking at another object, we can restore it to its normal state by looking at a ‘smaragdus’; and engravers of gemstones find that this is the most agreeable means of refreshing their eyes: so soothing to their feeling of fatigue is the mellow green colour of the stone. Apart from this property, ‘smaragdi’ appear larger when they are viewed at a distance because they reflect their colour upon the air around them.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_213_b" id="target_note_LCL419_213_b"><sup>b</sup></a> They remain the same in sunlight, shadow or lamplight, always shining gently and allowing the vision to penetrate to their further extremity owing to the ease with which light passes through them, a property that pleases us also in respect of water. ‘Smaragdi’ are generally concave in shape, so that they concentrate the vision.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_213_ca" id="target_note_LCL419_213_ca"><sup>c</sup></a> Because of these properties, mankind has decreed

This is improbable, because a green gemstone would hardly serve the purpose. Moreover, although magnifying mirrors were known in antiquity, there is no certain evidence that anything was known of magnifying lenses, although magnifying lenses of short focus may possibly have been used by engravers.
