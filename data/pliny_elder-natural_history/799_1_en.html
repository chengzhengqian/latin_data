Where there are sinews, the inner ones contract the limbs and the ones on the surface reverse the movement.</p>
<p>LXXXIX. Between the sinews lie the arteries,<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">The arteries and veins.</span></span> which are the passages for the breath, and on these float the veins, which are the channels for the blood. The pulse of the arteries being particularly evident at the extremity of the limbs is usually a sign of diseases; with remarkable scientific skill it has been reduced by that high priest of medicine, Herophilus, to definite rhythms and metrical rules throughout the periods of life—steady or hurried or slow. This sign<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL353_571_a" id="target_note_LCL353_571_a"><sup>a</sup></a> has been neglected because of its excessive subtlety, but yet really it<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL353_571_a" id="target_note_LCL353_571_a"><sup>a</sup></a> supplies<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL353_571_a" id="target_note_LCL353_571_a"><sup>a</sup></a> a rule for the guidance of life by observation of the pulse-beat, rapid or languid.

Birds have not got either veins or arteries, nor yet have snakes, tortoises and lizards, and they have only a very small amount of blood.</p>
<p>The veins spread underneath the whole skin, finally ending in very thin threads, and they narrow down into such an extremely minute size that the blood cannot pass through them nor can anything else but the moisture passing out from the blood in innumerable small drops which is called sweat. The junction and meeting point of the veins is at the navel.</p>
<p>XC. Creatures whose blood is copious and thick<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">The blood.</span></span> are hot-tempered. The blood of males is darker than that of females, and that of youth than that of old age; and it is thicker in the lower part of the body. The blood also contains a large proportion of vitality,
