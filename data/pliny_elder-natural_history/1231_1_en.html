instead of stable manure to fertilize the ground it is grown in; consequently in the districts of Macedon and Thessaly when it begins to blossom the farmers plough up the fields. It also grows wild in most places, for example the islands of the North Sea, for which our name is consequently the Bean Islands,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL371_267_a" id="target_note_LCL371_267_a"><sup>a</sup></a> and it also grows wild all over Mauretania, though this bean is very hard and incapable of being cooked. It<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL371_267_b" id="target_note_LCL371_267_b"><sup>b</sup></a> also grows in Egypt, where it has a thorny stalk<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Egyptian bean.</span></span>
which makes the crocodiles keep away from it for
fear of injuring their eyes. The stalk is two yards long at most and the thickness of a finger: if it had knots in it, it would be like a soft reed; it has a head like a poppy, is rose-coloured, and bears not more than thirty beans on each stalk; the leaves are large; the actual fruit is bitter even in smell, but the root is a very popular article of diet with the natives, and is eaten raw and cooked in every sort of way; it resembles the roots of reeds. The Egyptian bean also grows in Syria and Cilicia, and at the Lake of Torone in Chalcidice.</p>
<p>XXXI. Vegetables sown in autumn or spring are<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Lentils and peas.</span></span>
the lentil and in Greece the pea. The lentil likes a thin soil better than a rich one, and in any case a dry climate. Egypt has two kinds of lentil, one rounder and blacker, the other the normal shape, which has given the name of lenticle applied to small flasks. I find it stated in writers that a lentil diet conduces to an equable temper. Peas must be sown in sunny places, as they stand cold very badly; consequently in Italy and in severer climates they are only sown in spring, in yielding soil that has been well loosened.</p>
