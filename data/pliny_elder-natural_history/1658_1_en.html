<p>XXXVI. The juniper, even above all other remedies,<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">The juniper.</span></span>
is warming and alleviates symptoms; for the rest, it resembles the cedrus. Of it there are two species,
one smaller than the other. Either kind when set on fire keeps off snakes. The seed is beneficial for pains in the stomach, chest and side, dispels flatulence and the feeling of chill, relieves coughs and matures indurations.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL393_45_a" id="target_note_LCL393_45_a"><sup>a</sup></a> Applied locally it checks tumours; the berries taken in dark wine bind the bowels, and a local application reduces tumours of the belly. The fruit is also an ingredient of antidotes and of digestive remedies,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL393_45_b" id="target_note_LCL393_45_b"><sup>b</sup></a> and is diuretic. It is also applied locally to the eyes for fluxes, and it is used for sprains, ruptures, colic, uterine disorders and sciatica, either in doses of four berries with white wine, or a decoction of twenty in wine. There are also some who smear the body with an extract of the seed as a protection against snake-bite.</p>

with water, the ash from the burnt bark of the tips of the branches cures corns and callosities. It removes spots on the face, more thoroughly when mixed with willow juice. This juice, however, is of three kinds: one exudes like gum from the tree itself; the second flows from an incision, three fingers wide, made in the bark while the tree is in blossom. This sort<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL393_45_c" id="target_note_LCL393_45_c"><sup>c</sup></a> is useful for clearing away humours that obstruct the eyes, also for thickening<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL393_45_d" id="target_note_LCL393_45_d"><sup>d</sup></a> where that is necessary, for promoting urine and for draining outwards all gatherings. The third kind of juice is obtained by lopping
