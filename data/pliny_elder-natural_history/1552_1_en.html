Those fungi will be poisonous which become harder in cooking; comparatively harmless will be those that are cooked with some soda added—at any rate if they are thoroughly cooked. They become safer when cooked with meat, or with pear stalks. Pears too are good to take immediately after them. The nature of vinegar too is opposed to them and neutralizes any poisonous action.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL392_365_b" id="target_note_LCL392_365_b"><sup>b</sup></a></p>
<p>XLVIII. All these fungus growths spring up with<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Silphium.</span></span> showers, and silphium<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL392_365_c" id="target_note_LCL392_365_c"><sup>c</sup></a> too, as has been mentioned,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL392_365_d" id="target_note_LCL392_365_d"><sup>d</sup></a>
first grew with a shower. At the present day it is imported chiefly from Syria, this Syrian silphium being not so good as the Parthian, though better than the Median; the silphium of Cyrene, as I have said,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL392_365_e" id="target_note_LCL392_365_e"><sup>e</sup></a> is now wholly extinct. The leaves of silphium are used in medicine to purge the uterus and to bring away the dead unborn baby; a decoction of them is made in white, aromatic wine, to be drunk after the bath in doses of one acetabulum. The root is good for soreness of the windpipe, and is applied to collections of extravasated blood; but it is hard to digest when taken as food, causing flatulence and belchings. It is injurious to the passing of urine, but with wine and oil most beneficial for bruises, and with wax for scrofulous swellings. Warts in the seat fall off if fumigated with it several times.</p>
<p>XLIX. Laser, which is distilled from silphium in<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Laser.</span></span> the way I have said, being reckoned one of the most precious gifts of Nature, is used as an ingredient in very many medical prescriptions; but by itself it warms after chills, and taken in drink it alleviates affections of the sinews. In wine it is given to women, and on soft wool is used as a pessary to promote menstruation.
