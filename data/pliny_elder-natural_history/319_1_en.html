its volume consequently reduced. But if anybody is inclined to accept the possibility of Timaeus’s explanation that the waters of the river are drawn out of the earth, there is the fact that in these regions absence of shadows goes on continuously at this season.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL352_263_a" id="target_note_LCL352_263_a"><sup>a</sup></a></p>
<p>The Nile begins to rise at the next new moon after midsummer, the rise being gradual and moderate while the sun is passing through the Crab and at its greatest height when it is in the Lion; and when in Virgo it begins to fall by the same degrees as it rose. It subsides entirely within its banks, according to the account given by Herodotus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL352_263_b" id="target_note_LCL352_263_b"><sup>b</sup></a> on the hundredth day, when the sun is in the Scales. The view has been held that it is unlawful for kings or rulers to sail on the Nile when it is rising. Its degrees of increase are detected by means of wells marked with a scale. An average rise is one of 24 feet. A smaller volume of water does not irrigate all localities, and a larger one by retiring too slowly retards agriculture; and the latter uses up the time for sowing because of the moisture of the soil, while the former gives no time for sowing because the soil is parched. The province takes careful note of both extremes: in a rise of 18 feet it senses famine, and even at one of 19½ feet it begins to feel hungry, but 21 feet brings cheerfulness, 22½ feet complete confidence and 24 feet delight.
