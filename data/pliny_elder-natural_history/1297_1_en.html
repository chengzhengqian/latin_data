help must be afforded to the understanding even of persons unacquainted with the subject: the rule is to examine the position of the sun at noon, as that is always the same, whereas the sunrise is at a different point in the sky every day from where it was yesterday, so nobody must suppose that the right plan is to take a line on sunrise.</p>
<p>Having thus worked out a part of the heavens, the end of the line next to north on the east side of it will give the point of sunrise at the summer solstice, that is on the longest day, and the position of the north-east<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL371_399_a" id="target_note_LCL371_399_a"><sup>a</sup></a> wind, the Greek name for which is Boreas.<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">North-east wind.</span></span> You should plant trees and vines facing this point;
but beware of ploughing or sowing corn or scattering seed when this wind is blowing, for it nips and chills the roots of trees that you will bring to plant. Be taught in advance: some conditions are good for strong full-grown trees and others for saplings. (Nor have I forgotten that the Greeks place in this quarter the wind they call Caecias; but Aristotle, a man of immense acuteness, who took that very view, also gives the earth’s convexity as the reason why the north-east wind blows in the opposite direction to the African wind.) And nevertheless the farmer need not fear a north-east wind all the year round in the operations mentioned above; at midsummer it is softened by the sun, and changes its name—it is called Etesias. Consequently be on your guard when you feel the wind cold, and when a northeaster is forecast, as it does so much more damage than a wind due north. North-east is the direction in which the trees and vines should face in Asia, Greece, Spain, the coastal parts of Italy, Campania and Apulia. Breeders who desire to get male stock
