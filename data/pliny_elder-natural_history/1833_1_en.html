view that aconite is also a very health-giving ingredient of preparations for the eyes, openly declaring their belief that no evil<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL393_395_a" id="target_note_LCL393_395_a"><sup>a</sup></a> at all is without some admixture of good. It will therefore be right for me, who have described no poisons, to point out the nature of aconite, if only for the purpose of detecting it. It has leaves like those of cyclamen or of cucumber, not more than four, rising from the root and slightly hairy, and a root of moderate size, like a crayfish (<span class="italic">cammarus</span>), whence some have called it <span class="italic">cammaron,</span> and others <span class="italic">thelyphonon,</span> for the reason I have given already. The end of the root curves up a little like a scorpion’s tail, whence some have called it also scorpion. There have been some who would prefer to call it <span class="italic">myoctonos,</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL393_395_b" id="target_note_LCL393_395_b"><sup>b</sup></a> since at a distance, even a long distance, its smell kills rats and mice. The plant grows on bare crags which are called <span class="italic">aconae,</span> and for that reason some have given it the name of aconite, there being nothing near, not even dust,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL393_395_c" id="target_note_LCL393_395_c"><sup>c</sup></a> to give it nourishment. This then is the reason for its name given by some; others have thought it was so named because it had the same power to cause rapid death as whetstones<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL393_395_d" id="target_note_LCL393_395_d"><sup>d</sup></a> had to give an edge to an iron blade; no sooner was the stone applied than its rapid action was noticeable.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL393_395_ea" id="target_note_LCL393_395_ea"><sup>e</sup></a></p>

In the latter is given the effect of aconite on scorpions with its antidote in the touch of white hellebore. The preceding sentence is: ῥίζα ὁμοία σκορπίου οὐρᾷ, στίλβουσα ἀλαβαστροειδῶς. For this last Pliny has only: <span class="italic">cauda radicis incurvatur paulum scorpionum modo.</span> The phrase cauda radicis is peculiar, and suggests that Pliny had a Greek text before him in which ῥίζα and οὐρὰ (or some case of it) were side by side. There is nothing in Dioscorides corresponding to <span class="italic">arida,</span> which appears to have arisen from its partial likeness to <span class="italic">cauda.</span></a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL393_395_ea').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
