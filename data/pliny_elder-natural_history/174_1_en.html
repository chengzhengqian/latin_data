At Seville there is one well in the actual town that has the same nature, though all the others are as usual. The Black Sea always flows out into the Sea of Marmora—the tide never sets inward into the Black Sea.</p>
<p>CI. All seas excrete refuse at high tide, some<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Tidal refuse.</span></span> also periodically. In the neighbourhood of Messina and Mylae scum resembling dung is spat out on to the shore, which is the origin of the story that this is the place where the Oxen of the Sun are stalled.
