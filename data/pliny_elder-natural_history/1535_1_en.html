It is gathered in spring on thin soils or near foot-paths, and put by for making chaplets. At the same season physicians also make up into lozenges the pounded leaves, as well as the blossom and the root. All three are mixed and given in doses of one drachma for the bites of every kind of snake. Taken in drink they bring away the dead foetus, are emmenagogues and diuretic, as well as good for stone, flatulence,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL392_331_b" id="target_note_LCL392_331_b"><sup>b</sup></a> affections of the liver, for excessive secretion of bile and for fistula of the eye; chewed it heals running sores.
