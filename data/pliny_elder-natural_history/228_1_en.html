lakes drain into the river Nera, which from these derives the river Tiber with its sulphurous waters, and they are replenished by the Avens which runs down from Monte Fiscello near the Groves of Vacuna and Rieti and loses itself in the lakes in question. In another direction the Teverone rising in Mount Trevi drains into the Tiber three lakes famous for their beauty, from which Subiaco takes its name. In the district of Rieti is the lake of Cutilia, which is said by Marcus Varro to be the central point of Italy, and to contain a floating island. Below the Sabine territory lies Latium, on one side of it Picenum, and behind it Umbria, while the ranges of the Apennines fence it in on either side.</p>
<p>XIII. The fifth region is that of Picenum, which<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Picenum (Abbruzzo)</span></span>
formerly was very densely populated: 360,000 Picentines took the oath of allegiance to Rome.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL352_81_a" id="target_note_LCL352_81_a"><sup>a</sup></a> They derived their origin from the Sabines, who had made a vow to celebrate a Holy Spring.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL352_81_b" id="target_note_LCL352_81_b"><sup>b</sup></a> The territory that they took possession of began at the river Aterno, where are now the district and colony of Adria, 6 miles from the sea. Here is the river Vomanus, the territories of Praetutia and Palma, also the New Camp, the river Batinus, Tronto with its river, the only Liburnian settlement left in Italy, the river Albula, Tessuinum, and Helvinum where the region of the Praetutii ends and that of Picenum begins; the town of Cupra, Porto di Fermo, and above it the colony of Ascoli, the most famous in Picenum. Inland is Novana, and on the coast Cluana, Potentia, Numana founded by the Sicilians, and Ancona, a colony founded by the same people on the promontory of Cunerus just at the elbow of the coast where it bends round, 183 miles from Monte Gargano.
