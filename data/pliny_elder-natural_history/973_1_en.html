then to crush them in oil-mills and put them under the press a second time. People do not approve of pressing more than a hundred pecks of olives at a time: this is called a ‘batch,’ and what is squeezed out first after the millstone is called the ‘flower.’ It is a fair amount for three batches to be pressed in twenty-four hours by gangs of four men using a double holder.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL370_305_a" id="target_note_LCL370_305_a"><sup>a</sup></a></p>
