is in spring, as at midsummer they tend to crack. For buildings, only bricks two years old are recommended; moreover the material for them when it has been pounded should be well soaked before they are moulded.</p>
<p>Three kinds of bricks are made: the ‘didoron,’ the one employed by us, eighteen inches long and a foot wide, second the ‘tetradoron’ and third the ‘pentadoron,’ <span class="italic">doron</span> being an old Greek word meaning the palm of the hand<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL394_387_a" id="target_note_LCL394_387_a"><sup>a</sup></a>—from which comes <span class="italic">doron,</span> meaning a gift, because a gift was given by the hand. Consequently the bricks get their names from four or five palms’ length as the case may be. Their breadth is in all cases the same. In Greece the smaller kind is used for private structures and the larger in public buildings. At Pitana in Asia Minor as also in the city states of Maxilua and Callet in Further Spain bricks are made which when dried will not sink in water, being made of pumicelike earth, which is an extremely useful material when it is capable of being worked. The Greeks preferred brick walls except in places permitting of a limestone<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL394_387_b" id="target_note_LCL394_387_b"><sup>b</sup></a> structure, as brick walls last for ever if built exactly perpendicular. Consequently that was how they built both public works and kings’ palaces—the wall at Athens that faces towards Mount Hymettus, at Patrae the Shrines of Zeus and of Heracles (although the columns and architraves with which they surrounded these were of stone), and the royal palace of Attalus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL394_387_c" id="target_note_LCL394_387_c"><sup>c</sup></a> at Tralles and likewise the palace of Croesus at Sardis, which<span class="marginNote right">560–546 <span class="sc">b.c.</span></span> they converted into a house of elders,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL394_387_d" id="target_note_LCL394_387_d"><sup>d</sup></a> and that of
