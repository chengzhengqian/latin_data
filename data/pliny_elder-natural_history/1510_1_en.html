<p>XCV. The plant oenanthe grows on rocks,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL392_281_a" id="target_note_LCL392_281_a"><sup>a</sup></a> and<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Oenanthe.</span></span> has a leaf like that of carrot and a large root, with several heads.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL392_281_b" id="target_note_LCL392_281_b"><sup>b</sup></a> Its stem and leaves taken with honey and dark wine make childbirth easy and bring away the after-birth; taken in honey they are a cure for coughs, and also diuretic. The root also cures complaints of the bladder.</p>
<p>XCVI. Heliochrysus is called by some chrysanthemon.<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Heliochrysus.</span></span> It has sprigs of a shining white, and
leaves of a dull whitish colour, like those of southernwood, with as it were clusters hanging down all round it, which glisten like gold when reflecting the light of the sun, and never fade. For this reason they make chaplets of it for the gods, a custom which Ptolemy king of Egypt very faithfully observed. It grows in shrubberies. Taken in wine it is diuretic and promotes menstruation. It disperses indurations and inflammations; for burns it is applied with honey. For snake bites and lumbago it is taken in drink. With honey wine it removes congealed blood in the belly or bladder. Three oboli by weight of its leaves, pounded and taken in white wine, check excessive menstruation. It protects clothes by its smell, which however is not unpleasant.</p>
<p>XCVII. The hyacinth grows chiefly in Gaul.<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Uses of hyacinth.</span></span> There they use it to impart a shade to the dye hysginum.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL392_281_c" id="target_note_LCL392_281_c"><sup>c</sup></a> The root is bulbous, and well known to slave-dealers, for applied in sweet wine it checks the signs of puberty, and does not let them develop. It relieves colic and counteracts the bites of spiders. It is diuretic. For snake bites, scorpion stings and jaundice its seed is given mixed with southernwood.</p>
