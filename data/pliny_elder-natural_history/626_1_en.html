These surrounded it when it was going back at night, and aroused the guards, who were astounded by its strangeness: in the first place its size was unheard of and so was its colour as well, and it was smeared with brine and had a terrible smell; who would have expected to find a polyp there, or who would recognize it in such circumstances? They felt they were pitted against something uncanny, for by its awful breath it also tormented the dogs, which it now scourged with the ends of its tentacles and now struck with its longer arms, which it used as clubs; and with difficulty they succeeded in despatching it with a number of three-pronged harpoons. They showed its head to Lucullus—it was as big as a cask and held 90 gallons,—and
(to use the words of Trebius himself) ‘its beards which one could hardly clasp round with both one’s arms, knotted like clubs, 30 ft. long, with suckers or cups like basins holding three gallons, and teeth corresponding to its size.’ Its remains, kept as a curiosity, were found to weigh 700 lbs. Trebius<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Large cuttle fish.</span></span> also states that cuttle-fish of both species of the same size have been driven ashore on that coast. In our own seas one kind is taken that measures 7 ½ ft. in length and the other kind 3 ft. These fish also do not live more than two years.</p>
