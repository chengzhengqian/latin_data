The plant grows on shaded rocks. The root checks excessive menstruation, two-drachma doses, with honey, being taken in the form of an electuary for a few successive days.

Something or other must (XXIII § 97), “takes away roughness from a cough.” Then <span class="italic">septica</span> may be a mistake, either of Pliny or of a scribe, for <span class="italic">smectica.</span> In XXX § 29 <span class="italic">septica</span> is actually found as a variant of the correct reading <span class="italic">smectica</span> (<span class="italic">vi</span>). The translation would then be: “the root is cleansing, and clears away sores, and so it heals lacrimal fistulas.” So also <span class="italic">exulcerat</span> in § 112.<span class="linebreak"></span>

An old reading <span class="italic">stiptica</span> (i.e., <span class="italic">styptica,</span> “styptic”) is mentioned by Dalecamp, and may be right. At any rate it shows that the passage puzzled the old commentators. As Detlefsen and Mayhoff agree in their text, and as Littré raises no doubts, I have left text and translation within daggers.<span class="linebreak"></span>

Professor Andrews thinks that the text is correct, referring to the drastic treatment of eye-fistulas in early times. be wrong. Unfortunately Dioscorides (II 183) is of no help here, for although he mentions the cure, he says nothing about the properties of the root: ἡ δὲ ῥίζα καταπλασθεῖσα αἰγιλώπια ἰᾶται.<span class="linebreak"></span>

I suggest that <span class="italic">exulceratrix</span> means, not “ulcerating,” but “clearing away ulcers,” just as <span class="italic">exulcerare corpus</span> in XXIII § 22 means “free the flesh from sores.” Cf. <span class="italic">tussim exasperant</span></a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL393_453_ea').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
