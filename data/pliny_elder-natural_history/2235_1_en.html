axle grease. A green lizard is attached as an amulet; after thirty days the weasel should be changed for another. Some keep a weasel’s heart in a small silver vessel for scrofula in woman or man.

They recommend also the application of a cricket dug up with its earth, also the application of dove’s dung by itself, or with barley meal or oatmeal in vinegar, or of mole ash with honey.

Others cut off the head, pound it with the earth of a mole-hill, work into lozenges in a pewter box, and use for all swellings, for what are called apostemata, and for affections of the neck; during the treatment the eating of pork is forbidden. There are earth beetles like ticks that are called “bulls”—a name given because of their little horns—and by some “earth lice.” These too throw up earth that is applied to scrofulous and similar sores, and also to gouty parts, not being washed off for three days. The efficacy of this treatment lasts for a year. To these creatures are assigned all the properties I have mentioned when speaking of crickets. Some also use for this purpose the earth thrown up by ants, others
