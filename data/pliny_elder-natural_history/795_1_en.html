<p>LXXXI.

But at Briletum and Tharne stags have four kidneys while the species possessing feathers and scales have none.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL353_563_b" id="target_note_LCL353_563_b"><sup>b</sup></a> For the rest, they are attached to the top of the loins. In all cases the right kidney is higher, and not so fat, and drier; but with both the fat is discharged out of the middle, except in the seal.

Between the bladder and the belly are the tubes called the groin, stretching to the private parts.
