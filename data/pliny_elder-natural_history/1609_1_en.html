The juice of boiled dates used to be given by the ancients to invalids instead of hydromel to restore their strength and to assuage thirst; for this purpose they used to prefer Thebaic dates, which are also useful, especially in food, for the spitting of blood. The dates called caryotae are applied with quinces, wax, and saffron to the stomach, bladder, belly and intestines. They heal bruises. The kernels of dates, if they are burnt in a new earthen vessel and the ashes washed, take the place of spodium, are an ingredient of eye-salves, and with the addition of nard make lotions for the eyebrows.</p>

Dioscorides says that the date is Egyptian, and resembles the Arabian myrobalanum. According to him the <span class="italic">spalhe</span> is “the covering of the fruit of palma when these are at their prime (?):” περικάλυμμά ἐστι τοῦ καρποῦ τῶν φοινίκων ἀκμὴν ἀνθούντων. Pliny on the other hand speaks of “the palm which bears the myrobalanum,” giving it (or its fruit) the properties attributed by Dioscorides to the Egyptian date. He goes on to say that the <span class="italic">spathe</span> was a palm with medicinal properties in its sprigs, leaves and bark.<span class="linebreak"></span>
Among Pliny’s mistakes seems to be the confusion of ben nut (myrobalanum) with what is called by Dioscorides φοινικοβάλανος. Cf. Pliny XII. § 103. The conjecture of Hardouin (<span class="italic">refert</span>) clears away one discrepancy between Dioscorides and Pliny if we take <span class="italic">palma</span> in the first sentence of § 98 to mean “date,” but then the words <span class="italic">in balanis</span> become oddly otiose. No emendation, however, can make <span class="italic">spathe</span> in § 99 mean anything but a tree; it certainly cannot mean the περικάλυμμα τοῦ καρποῦ of Dioscorides.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL392_479_da').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
