compels me to speak next of lyncurium,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_205_aa" id="target_note_LCL419_205_aa"><sup>a</sup></a> since, even when they refrain from asserting that this lyncurium is amber, they still claim that it is a gemstone, stating that it is formed indeed from the urine of the lynx, but also from a particular kind of earth. They say that the creature, bearing a grudge towards mankind, immediately conceals its urine, <span class="marginNote right">VIII. 137.</span>
which forms a stone in the same place. The stone is said to have the same fiery colour as amber, to be capable of being engraved and to attract not merely leaves or straws, but also shavings of copper and iron, a belief which even Theophrastus accepts on the<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">de Lap.</span> 28.</span>

and resembles brown tourmaline without possessing its electrical properties. The form <span class="italic">lyncurium</span> is probably due to a false etymology. λιγγούριον, cited by Strabo (IV. 6, 2) as a Ligurian term for amber, may be a more correct form.<span class="linebreak"></span>
It is suggested that the term originally meant ‘the Ligurian stone’ and was applied to amber (<span class="italic">cf.</span> §§ 33 and 34). Later the term may have been applied to one or more kinds of hard gemstone similar to amber in their colour and electrical properties (J. H.
