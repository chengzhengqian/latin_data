this to sing with, as we shall say.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL353_491_a" id="target_note_LCL353_491_a"><sup>a</sup></a> For the rest, there is nothing on the belly. When they are disturbed and fly away, they give out moisture, which is the only proof that they live on dew; moreover they are the only creatures that have no aperture for the bodily excreta. Their eyes are so dim that if anybody comes near to them contracting and straightening out a finger, they pass by as if it were a leaf flickering. Some people make two other classes of tree-crickets, the twig-cricket which is the larger, and the corn-cricket, which others call the oat-cricket, because it appears at the same time as the crops begin to dry. Tree-crickets do not occur where trees are scarce—consequently they are not found at Cyrenae except in the neighbourhood of the town—nor in plains or in chilly or shady woods. These creatures also make some difference between localities; in the district of Miletus they occur in few places, but there is a river in Cephallania which makes a boundary with a few of them on one side and many on the other; again in the Reggio territory they are all silent but beyond the river in the region of Locri they sing. They have the same wing-structure as bees, but larger in proportion to the body.</p>

Of insects some have two wings, for<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Structure of various insects.</span></span> instance, flies, and some four, for instance bees, The tree-cricket also flies with its membranes. Those armed with a sting in the belly have four wings, but none having a weapon in the mouth has more than two wings to fly with, for the former have this weapon bestowed on them for the sake of vengeance but the latter for the purpose of greed. No insects’ wings when torn off grow again. None that has a sting in the belly is two-winged.</p>
