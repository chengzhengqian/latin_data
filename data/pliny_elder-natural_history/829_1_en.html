<p>We will now describe the trees that aroused the wonder of the victorious expedition of Alexander the Great when that part of the world was first revealed.</p>
<p>XI. The Indian fig-tree<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL370_17_a" id="target_note_LCL370_17_a"><sup>a</sup></a> bears exceptionally fine<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">The Indian banyan.</span></span> fruit, and it is self-propagating, as it spreads its branches to an enormous width and the bottom ones
bend down to the earth so heavily that in a year’s time they take root, and produce for themselves a fresh offspring planted in a circle round the parent tree like the work of an ornamental gardener. Inside this bower the shepherds dwell in summer, as it is at once shaded and protected by the fence of the tree—a very attractive sight when looked at from below or from a distance, with its vaulted dome. Its higher branches, however, shoot upward to a great height from the main bulk of the mother tree, forming an extensive grove, so as in many cases to enclose a circle sixty yards across, while they cover with their shade a space of a quarter of a mile. The broad leaves have the shape of an Amazon’s shield; consequently they cover over the fruit and prevent it from growing, and it is scanty and not larger in size than a bean; but as it is ripened by the rays of the sun shining through the foliage it has an extremely sweet taste, and is worthy of the marvellous tree that produces it. This fig grows mostly in the neighbourhood of the river Chenaub.</p>
<p>XII. There is another fig the fruit of which is larger<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">The banana.</span></span> and superior in flavour; the sages of India live on it.
The leaf of this tree resembles birds’ wings, and is a yard and a half long and a yard broad. The fruit grows out of the bark, and is remarkable for the sweetness of its juice; one bunch is enough for four
