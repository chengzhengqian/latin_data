Parched they also cure catarrh, pounded too and taken in hydromel they cure chronic cough; some add grains of pepper, others take them in raisin wine. Pistachio nuts have the same uses as pine kernels, and are besides, whether eaten or taken in drink, beneficial for snake bites. Chestnuts check effectually fluxes of the stomach and belly; they encourage peristaltic action of the bowels,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL392_517_a" id="target_note_LCL392_517_a"><sup>a</sup></a> arrest haemoptysis, and increase the growth of flesh.</p>
<p>LXXIX. Fresh carobs, injurious to the stomach,<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Carobs.</span></span> relax the bowels; dried carobs are astringent and prove more beneficial to the stomach; they are diuretic. For pain in the stomach some persons boil down to one half three Syrian carobs in a sextarius of water, and drink this decoction. The sap that sweats from a branch of the cornel tree is caught on a red-hot iron plate without the wood touching it; the resulting rust is applied as a cure for incipient lichen.
