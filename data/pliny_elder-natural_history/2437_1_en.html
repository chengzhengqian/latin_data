seventh. Another kind of column is that known as the Attic, which is quadrangular and equilateral.</p>
<p>LVII. Lime is commonly used also in pharmacy, preferably when freshly calcined and unslaked. It has caustic, dispersive and drawing effects, and checks an onset of ulcers which shows signs of spreading quickly. It brings about the formation of scars when it is mixed as a liniment with vinegar and rose oil and is later blended with wax and rose oil. It is a cure also for dislocations when applied with liquid resin or pork fat mixed with honey, and the same mixture, moreover, cures scrofulous sores.</p>

lime, a lump of which is slaked in wine and then pounded together with pork fat and figs, both of which are softening agents. Maltha is the most adhesive of substances and grows harder than stone. Anything that is treated with it is first thoroughly rubbed with olive oil.</p>

The gypsum of Cyprus, Perrhaebia and Tymphaea was the mineral, and that of Syria and Thurii plaster of Paris obtained by heating the mineral. Bailey suggests that the gypsum of Tymphaea was a fullers’ earth because Theophrastus states that it was used for cleaning clothes, a purpose for which gypsum in the ordinary sense of the term would be unsuitable. In fact, Theophrastus states merely that it was used ‘for cloaks.’ Later he adds that gypsum in general is <span class="italic">sprinkled</span> on cloaks by fullers, a remark which implies that it was used not for cleaning cloaks, but for <span class="italic">whitening</span> them. Powdered dehydrated gypsum would have served this purpose well.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL419_143_ba').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
