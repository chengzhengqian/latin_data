in the temple of the Sosian Apollo<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_23_a" id="target_note_LCL419_23_a"><sup>a</sup></a> was the work of Scopas or of Praxiteles. Similarly, we cannot tell which of the two carved the Father Janus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_23_b" id="target_note_LCL419_23_b"><sup>b</sup></a> which was dedicated in its rightful temple by Augustus after being brought here from Egypt; and now a covering of gilt has hidden its secret still more. Equally, there is a controversy about the Cupid Holding a Thunderbolt in the Hall of Octavia. Only one thing<span class="marginNote right">§ 15. </span> is stated with conviction, namely that the figure is that of Alcibiades,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_23_c" id="target_note_LCL419_23_c"><sup>c</sup></a> the most handsome youth of that time. In the same salon there are many pleasing works of which the authors are unknown, for example, the Four Satyrs, of whom one is carrying on his shoulders Father Liber dressed in a robe and another is likewise carrying Ariadne,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_23_d" id="target_note_LCL419_23_d"><sup>d</sup></a> while a third stops a child crying and a fourth gives a drink to another child out of a mixing-bowl; and the Two Breezes, who are spreading their cloaks like sails. There is just as much dispute as to the makers of the Olympus and Pan and the Chiron With Achilles in the Voting Enclosure, even though their fame pronounces them to be so valuable that their keepers must answer for their safety with their lives.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_23_e" id="target_note_LCL419_23_e"><sup>e</sup></a></p>

This is the tomb that was built by Artemisia for her husband Mausolus, the viceroy of Caria, who died in the second year of the 107th Olympiad.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_23_fa" id="target_note_LCL419_23_fa"><sup>f</sup></a> These
