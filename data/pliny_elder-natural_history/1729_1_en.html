It is like origanum but with narrower and longer leaves; it has an angular, bushy stem a span high, a flower like that of lychnis, a slight root of no use in medicine, but with healing qualities in its juice. The plant itself is gathered in autumn, and the juice is extracted from the leaves. Some cut up and soak the stems, extracting the juice at the end of eighteen days. This centaury the Romans call the “gall of earth” on account of its extreme bitterness, while the Gauls call it exacum, because a draught of it evacuates from the body by stool all harmful drugs.</p>
<p>XXXII. There is a third, centauris surnamed<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Triorchis.</span></span>
triorchis. Those who cut it nearly always wound themselves. The juice it gives out is of the colour
of blood. Theophrastus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL393_187_a" id="target_note_LCL393_187_a"><sup>a</sup></a> relates that it is defended by a species of hawk called triorchis, which attacks those who gather it. From this too it has received its name. The uninformed confuse these characteristics<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL393_187_b" id="target_note_LCL393_187_b"><sup>b</sup></a> and assign them all to the first kind of centaury.</p>
<p>XXXIII. Clymenus is a plant called after the<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Clymenus.</span></span>
king of that name. It has leaves like those of ivy, many branches, a hollow stem girded with joints, a strong smell, and seed like that of ivy; it grows in wooded, hilly districts. I shall say later what diseases it cures if taken in drink; but at the moment
I must point out that, while it cures, even men are made sterile by the draught. The Greeks have said that it is like the plantain, with a square stem and seed-bags intertwined like the tentacles of the polypus. The juice too is used in medicine, as it has very great powers of cooling.</p>
