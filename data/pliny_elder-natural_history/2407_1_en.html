sesterces (if references to expenditure can impress anyone now that miserliness has become an obsession) just for the house in which he lived. This amazes me for my part just as much as the mad schemes of kings; and therefore I regard the fact that Milo himself incurred debts amounting to 70,000,000 sesterces as one of the oddest manifestations of the human character. But at that time elderly men still admired the vast dimensions of the Rampart,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_83_a" id="target_note_LCL419_83_a"><sup>a</sup></a> the substructures of the Capitol and, furthermore, the city sewers, the most noteworthy achievement of all,<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">The Cloaca Maxima and its branches.</span> § 94.</span> seeing that hills were tunnelled and Rome, as we mentioned a little earlier, became a ‘hanging’ city, beneath which men travelled in boats<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_83_b" id="target_note_LCL419_83_b"><sup>b</sup></a> during Marcus Agrippa’s term as aedile after his consulship.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_83_c" id="target_note_LCL419_83_c"><sup>c</sup></a> Through the city there flow seven rivers meeting in one channel. These, rushing downwards like mountain torrents, are constrained to sweep away and remove everything in their path, and when they are thrust forward by an additional volume of rain water they batter the bottom and sides of the sewers. Sometimes the backwash of the Tiber floods the sewers and makes its way along them upstream. Then the raging flood waters meet head on within the sewers, and even so the unyielding strength of the fabric resists the strain. In the streets above, massive blocks of stone are dragged along, and yet the tunnels do not cave in. They are pounded by falling buildings, which collapse of their own accord or are brought crashing to the ground by fire.
