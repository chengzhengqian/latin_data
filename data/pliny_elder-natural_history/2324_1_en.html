Equally remarkable is the might of Nature in those creatures also which are amphibious, such as the beaver, which they call <span class="italic">castor</span> and its testes <span class="italic">castoreum.</span> Sextius, a very careful inquirer into medical subjects, denies that the beaver himself bites off his own testes when it is being captured; he says that on the contrary these are small, tightly knit, attached to the spine, and not to be taken away without destroying the creature’s life. Castoreum (beaver-oil) he says is however adulterated by beaver’s kidneys, which are large, while the real testes are found to be very small. Moreover, they cannot even be the creature’s bladders, for they are twin, and no animal has two bladders. In these pouches (he goes on) is found a liquid, which is preserved in salt. Accordingly one of the tests of fraud is whether two pouches hang down from one connection, while the liquid itself is adulterated by adding to it cummin and beaver blood or ammoniacum,
