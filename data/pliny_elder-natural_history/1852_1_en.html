<p>XLVII. Dipsacos has leaves like those of lettuce,<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Dipsacus.</span></span> with prickly knobs on the middle of their backs. The stem, two cubits long and rough with the same prickles, has joints enfolded by pairs of leaves, forming hollow axils in which collects a salt, dewy fluid. On the top of the stem are little heads, which bristle with prickles. The plant grows on watery ground. A decoction of the root in wine heals chaps of the anus; fistulas as well, but the decoction must be reduced to the consistency of wax, so that a suppository may be inserted into the fistula. It also removes warts of all kinds, for which purpose some apply the juice that is found in the axils which I mentioned above.</p>
<p>XLVIII. Dryopteris, which is like fern, grows on<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Dryopteris.</span></span> trees; it has sweetish leaves with a slight indentation and a hairy root.

<p>XLIX. Drabe is a similar plant to phonos, with<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Drabe.</span></span> slender stalks a cubit high surrounded on either side by leaves the size of a thumb, similar to those of oxymyrsine, but whiter and softer. The blossom is white and like that of the elder. The stalks are eaten boiled, but its seed is used instead of pepper.</p>
<p>L. Elatine has leaves like those of cassia, very<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Elatine.</span></span> small, shaggy and round, with five or six little branches, half a foot long, which are covered with leaves right from the root. The plant grows among the corn, is harsh to the taste and therefore good for fluxes of the eyes; the leaves are pounded with pearl barley and applied, a napkin being placed
