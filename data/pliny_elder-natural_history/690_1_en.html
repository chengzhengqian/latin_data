by human labour. Also in Egypt near the town of Coptos there is an island sacred to Isis which they fortify with a structure to prevent its being destroyed by the same river, strengthening its point with chaff and straw when the spring days begin, going on for three days all through the nights with such industry that it is agreed that many birds actually die at the work; and this spell of duty always comes round again for them with the returning year. There is a third kind of swallows<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL353_353_a" id="target_note_LCL353_353_a"><sup>a</sup></a> that make holes in banks and so construct their nests in the ground. (Their chicks when burnt to ashes are a medicine for a deadly throat malady and many other diseases of the human body.) These birds do not build proper nests, and if a rise of the river threatens to reach their holes, they migrate many days in advance.</p>
<p>L. There is a species of titmouse<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL353_353_b" id="target_note_LCL353_353_b"><sup>b</sup></a> that makes<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Other species remarkable for their nests.</span></span>
its nest of dry moss finished off in such a perfect ball that its entrance cannot be found. The bird called the thistle-finch<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL353_353_c" id="target_note_LCL353_353_c"><sup>c</sup></a> weaves its nest out of flax in the Came shape. One of the woodpeckers hangs by a twig at the very end of the boughs, like a ladle on a peg, so that no four-footed animal can get to it. It is indeed asserted that the witwall purposely takes its sleep while hanging suspended by the feet, because it hopes thus to be safer. Again, it is a common practice of them all carefully to choose a flooring of branches to support their nest, and to vault it over against the rain or roof it with a penthouse of thick foliage. In Arabia<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL353_353_d" id="target_note_LCL353_353_d"><sup>d</sup></a> a bird called cinnamolgus makes a nest of cinnamon twigs; the natives bring these birds down with arrows weighted with lead, to use them for trade. In Scythia a bird of the size of a bustard lays two eggs
