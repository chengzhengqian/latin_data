Black Sea; the same is the case with the sole, though the turbot does enter it. Nor does the sepia occur there, though the cuttle-fish is found. Of rock-fish the thrush-wrasse and merle-wrasse are lacking, as are some purple-fish, though oysters are plentiful; but they all winter in the Aegean. Of those entering the Black Sea the only kind that never returns is the <span class="italic">trichia</span> or pilchard—it will be convenient to use the Greek names in most cases, as different districts have called the same species by a great variety of names—, but these alone enter the Danube and float down from it by its underground channels into the Adriatic, and consequently there also they are regularly seen going down stream and never coming up from the sea. The season for catching tunny is from the rise<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL353_199_a" id="target_note_LCL353_199_a"><sup>a</sup></a> of the Pleiads to the setting<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL353_199_b" id="target_note_LCL353_199_b"><sup>b</sup></a> of Arcturus; during the rest of the winter time they lurk at the bottom of the water unless tempted out by a mild spell or at full moon.

This attaches itself with a spike under the fin of both the tunny and the
fish called sword-fish, which often exceeds the size of a dolphin, and torments them so painfully that they frequently jump out of the water into ships. This is also done on other occasions from fear of the violence of other fish, especially by mullet, which are so exceptionally swift that they sometimes leap right over ships that lie across their path.</p>
