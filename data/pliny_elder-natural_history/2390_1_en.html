It is suitable too, when burnt, for plasters. It occurs in the neighbourhood of Thebes in Egypt and of Damascus in Syria. The latter variety is whiter than the rest, but that of Carmania is the most excellent. Next comes the Indian, and then of course there is that of Syria and the province of Asia, while the least valuable is the Cappadocian, which has no lustre whatsoever. The specimens most warmly recommended are the honey-coloured, marked with spirals, and opaque. A colour resembling that of horn, or else gleaming white, and any suggestion of a glassy look are serious faults in onyx marble.</p>

Many people consider that for the preservation of unguents there is little to choose between onyx marble and the ‘lygdinus,’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_49_b" id="target_note_LCL419_49_b"><sup>b</sup></a> which is found in<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Lygdinus.</span></span> Paros in pieces no larger than a dish or mixing bowl, although in earlier times it was normally imported only from Arabia. It is of an exceptionally brilliant whiteness. Two stones of a directly opposed character are also greatly esteemed. There is the coral<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Coralimestone.</span></span> stone found in the province of Asia in sizes not exceeding two cubits, with a white colour close to that of ivory and a certain resemblance to it in appearance. On the other hand, the stone named after Alabanda, its place of origin, although it occurs Almandine. also at Miletus, is black. In appearance, however, this stone tends rather to have a reddish tinge. It can, moreover, be melted by fire and fused to serve as glass.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_49_c" id="target_note_LCL419_49_c"><sup>c</sup></a> The Thebaic stone mottled with gold<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Red granite.</span></span> spots is found in a part of Africa that has been assigned
