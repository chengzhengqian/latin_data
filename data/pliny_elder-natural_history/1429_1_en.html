next best test is to put it in a lamp, when it should burn with a bright, clear flame, and smell only when it has gone out; adulterated opium does not behave in this fashion. Adulterated opium is also harder to light, and is continually going out. A further test of pure opium is by water, on which it floats as a light cloud, while the impure gathers into blisters. But especially wonderful is the fact that pure opium is detected by the summer sun. For pure opium sweats and melts until it becomes like freshly gathered juice. Mnesides thinks that opium is best kept by adding the seed of henbane, others by putting it in beans.</p>
<p>LXXVII. Intermediate between the cultivated poppy and the wild is a third kind, for though growing on cultivated land it is self-sown; we have called it rhoeas or roving poppy.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL392_119_a" id="target_note_LCL392_119_a"><sup>a</sup></a> Some gather it and eat it straight away with the whole calyx. It acts as a purge; five heads boiled in three heminae of wine also induce sleep.</p>
<p>LXXVIII. Of the wild poppy one kind is called<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Horned poppy.</span></span> ceratitis. Black-seeded, a cubit high, with a thick root covered with a hard skin, it has a little calyx curved like a little horn. Its leaves<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL392_119_b" id="target_note_LCL392_119_b"><sup>b</sup></a> are smaller and thinner than those of the other wild varieties. The seed is small, ripening at harvest; half an acetabulum of it, taken in honey wine, acts as a purge. The pounded leaves with oil cure eye-ulcers of beasts of burden. Its root, in the proportion of one acetabulum to two sextarii of water, boiled down to one half, is given for complaints of the loins and liver. Its leaves applied in honey are a cure for carbuncles. This variety is called glaucion<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL392_119_c" id="target_note_LCL392_119_c"><sup>c</sup></a> by some and paralium<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL392_119_d" id="target_note_LCL392_119_d"><sup>d</sup></a> by others, for it grows within reach of the sea breezes or in alkaline soils.</p>
