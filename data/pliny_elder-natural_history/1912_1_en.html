The mixture is made with Cyprian copper verdigris and the urine of a boy<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL394_71_c" id="target_note_LCL394_71_c"><sup>c</sup></a> who has not reached puberty with the addition of soda<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL394_71_d" id="target_note_LCL394_71_d"><sup>d</sup></a>; this is ground with a pestle
