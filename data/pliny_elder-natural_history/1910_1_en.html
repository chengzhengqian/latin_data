The ash remaining is kept in an earthenware jar, and eruptions on the face may well be cleansed away by being smeared with this lotion<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL394_67_a" id="target_note_LCL394_67_a"><sup>a</sup></a> from the jar. It also cures fistulas and what are called hæmorrhoids. With the addition of ground pumicestone it relieves putrid and foul-smelling

A more highly spoken of variety of the same metal has been ascertained to be formed in copper mines, and the next best in silver-mines. A less valuable sort also with an element of gold is also found in lead mines.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL394_67_c" id="target_note_LCL394_67_c"><sup>c</sup></a> In all these mines however an artificial variety is produced that is much inferior to the natural kind referred to; the method is to introduce a gentle flow of water into the vein all winter and go on till the beginning of June and then to dry it off in June and July, clearly showing that gold-solder is nothing else than the putrefaction of a vein of metal.
