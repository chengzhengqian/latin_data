<p>XLIII. Nightingales pour out a ceaseless gush of<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">The nightingale: range and variety of its song.</span></span>
song for fifteen days and nights on end when the buds of the leaves are swelling—a bird not in the lowest rank remarkable. In the first place there is so loud a voice and so persistent a supply of breath in such a tiny little body; then there is the consummate knowledge of music in a single bird: the sound is given out with modulations, and now is drawn out into a long note with one continuous breath, now varied by managing the breath, now made staccato by checking it, or linked together by prolonging it, or carried on by holding it back; or it is suddenly lowered, and at times sinks into a mere murmur, loud, low,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL353_345_a" id="target_note_LCL353_345_a"><sup>a</sup></a> bass, treble, with trills, with long notes, modulated when this seems good—soprano, mezzo, baritone; and briefly all the devices in that tiny throat which human science has devised with all the elaborate mechanism of the flute, so that there can be no doubt that this sweetness was foretold by a convincing omen when it made music on the lips of the infant Stesichorus.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL353_345_b" id="target_note_LCL353_345_b"><sup>b</sup></a> And that no one may doubt its being a matter of science, the birds have several songs each, and not all the same but every bird songs of its own. They compete with one another, and there is clearly an animated rivalry between them; the loser often ends her life by dying, her breath giving out before her song. Other younger birds practise their music, and are given verses to imitate; the pupil listens with close attention and repeats the phrase, and the two keep silence by turns: we notice improvement in the one under instruction and a sort of criticism on the part of the instructress. Consequently they fetch the prices that are given<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Trade in trained nightingales</span></span>
for slaves, and indeed larger prices than were paid
