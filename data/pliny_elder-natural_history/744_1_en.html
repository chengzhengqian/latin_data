<p>XVI. There has been a great deal of minute<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Reproduction of bees—various views as to.</span></span>
enquiry among the learned as to the manner in which bees reproduce their species; for sexual intercourse among them has never been observed. A majority of authorities have held the view that the offspring are formed in the mouth, by blending together blossoms of the reed and the olive; some think it is by copulation with a single male which in each swarm is called the king; and that this is the only male, and is of exceptional size, so as not to grow weary; and that consequently offspring is not produced without him, and the rest of the bees accompany him as women accompany a husband, not as their leader.

on other grounds, is refuted by the production drones; for what reason can there be why the same act of union should engender some perfect offspring and others imperfect? The former opinion would be nearer to the truth, were it not that again another difficulty meets us: it is a fact that sometimes larger bees are born in the extremities of the combs which drive away all the rest. This mischievous creature is<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Varieties of offspring.</span></span>
called a gadfly—being born in what possible manner if the female bees themselves shape it? One certain fact is that they sit on their eggs in the way that hens do. The offspring hatched at first looks like a white maggot, lying crosswise and sticking so closely to the wax that it seems to be part of it. The king is from the start of the colour of honey, as if made from a special blossom chosen out of the whole supply, and is not a maggot but has wings from the start. The remaining throng when they begin to take shape are called pupae, while the sham ones<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL353_461_a" id="target_note_LCL353_461_a"><sup>a</sup></a> are called sirens or drones.
