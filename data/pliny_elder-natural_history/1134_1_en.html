pith would not take more. But subsequently a more elaborate method is for as many as six grafts to be added to reinforce their liability to die and their number,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL371_73_a" id="target_note_LCL371_73_a"><sup>a</sup></a> a cleft being carefully made through the middle of the trunk and being kept open by means of a thin wedge until the graft, the end of which has been pared into a point, goes right down into the crack.</p>
<p>In this process a great many precautions have to be observed. First of all we must notice what kind of tree will stand grafting of this nature, and what tree it will take a graft from. Also the sap is variously distributed, and does not lie under the bark in the same parts with all trees: in vines and figs the middle is drier, and generation starts from the top, shoots for grafting being consequently taken from the top of the tree, whereas in olives the sap is round the middle and grafts are also taken from there, the tops being parched up. Grafts and trunk grow together most easily when they have the same kind of bark and when they flower at the same time, so that they have the affinity of the same season and a partnership of juices; whereas it is a slow business when there is incompatibility between dry tissues and damp ones, and between hard and soft barks. The other points to be observed are not to make the cleft at a knot, as the inhospitable hardness repudiates a new-comer; to make it at the shiniest place; not to make it much more than three inches long, nor on a slant, nor so as to be transparent.
