a remarkably important plant, the Greek name for which is <span class="italic">silphium</span>; it was originally found
in the province of Cyrenaica. Its juice is called <span class="italic">laser</span>, and it takes an important place in general use and among drugs, and is sold for its weight in silver denarii. It has not been found in that country now for many years, because the tax-farmers who rent the pasturage strip it clean by grazing sheep on it, realizing that they make more profit in that way. Only a single stalk has been found there within our memory, which was sent to the Emperor Nero. If a grazing flock ever chances to come on a promising young shoot, this is detected by the indication that a sheep after eating it at once goes to sleep and a goat has a fit of sneezing. And for a long time now no laserwort has been imported to us except what grows in Persia or Media and Armenia, in abundant quantity but much inferior quality to that of Cyrenaica, and even so adulterated with gum, <span class="italic">sacopenium</span>, or with crushed beans; this makes it even more necessary for us not to omit to state the facts that in the consulship of Gaius Valerius and Marcus Herennius, 30 pounds of<span class="marginNote right">93 <span class="sc">b.c.</span></span> laserwort plant was imported to Rome by the government, and that during the dictatorship of Caesar, at the beginning of the civil war he produced<span class="marginNote right">49 <span class="sc">b.c.</span></span> out of the treasury together with gold and silver 1500 lbs. of laserwort plant.</p>
