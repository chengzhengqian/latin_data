let alone gemstones, is the ‘adamas,’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_207_a" id="target_note_LCL419_207_a"><sup>a</sup></a> which for long was known only to kings, and to very few of them. ‘Adamas’ was the name given to the ‘knot of gold’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_207_b" id="target_note_LCL419_207_b"><sup>b</sup></a> found very occasionally in mines in association with gold and, so it seemed, formed only in gold. Our ancient authorities thought that it was found only in the mines of Ethiopia between the temple of Mercury and the island of Meroe,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_207_c" id="target_note_LCL419_207_c"><sup>c</sup></a> and stated that the specimens discovered were no larger than a cucumber seed and not unlike one in colour. Now, for the first time, as many as six kinds of ‘adamas’ are recognized. There is the Indian, which is not formed in gold and has a certain affinity with rock-crystal, which it resembles in respect of its transparency and its smooth faces meeting at six corners.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_207_d" id="target_note_LCL419_207_d"><sup>d</sup></a> It tapers to a point in two opposite directions and is all the more remarkable because it is like two whorls joined together at their broadest parts. It can be as large even as a hazel nut. Similar to the Indian, only smaller, is the Arabian, which is, moreover, formed under similar conditions. The rest have a silvery pallor and are liable to be formed only in the midst of the finest gold. All these stones can be
