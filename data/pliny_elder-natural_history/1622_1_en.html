<p>LXVIII. As for wild plums, their fruit or the skin<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">wild plums.</span></span> of their root, boiled down in dry wine from one hemina to one third, checks looseness of the bowels and colic. A cyathus of the decoction at a time makes a sufficient dose.</p>
<p>LXIX. Both on wild and on cultivated plum trees there forms a gummy substance called lichen by the Greeks and wonderfully beneficial for chaps and condylomata.</p>
<p>LXX. In Egypt and in Cyprus are mulberries of a<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Mulberries and their uses</span></span> unique sort, as I have already said.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL392_505_a" id="target_note_LCL392_505_a"><sup>a</sup></a> If the outer rind be peeled off they stream with copious juice; a deeper cut (so wonderful is their nature) finds them dry.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL392_505_b" id="target_note_LCL392_505_b"><sup>b</sup></a> The juice counteracts the poison of snakes, is good for dysentery, disperses superficial abscesses and all kinds of gatherings, heals wounds, and allays headache and ear-ache. For diseases of the spleen it is taken by the mouth and used as a liniment, as also for violent chills. It very quickly breeds worms. We Romans use the juice quite as much. Taken in wine it neutralizes aconite and the poison of spiders; it opens the bowels, expelling phlegm, tapeworm and similar intestinal parasites. The same effect also is produced by the pounded bark. The leaves boiled in rain water together with the bark of the dark fig and of the vine dye the hair. The juice of the fruit itself moves the bowels immediately; the fruit itself is for the time being good for the stomach, being cooling, though thirst-producing,
and if no other food is taken afterwards, it swells up. The juice of unripe mulberries is constipating; there are marvels to be noticed about this tree, mentioned by me in my description<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL392_505_c" id="target_note_LCL392_505_c"><sup>c</sup></a> of it, which suggest that it has some sort of soul.</p>
