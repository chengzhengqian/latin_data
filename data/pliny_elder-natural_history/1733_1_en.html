<p>XXXIX. The physician Themiso too has spread<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">The plantian.</span></span>
the fame of a common plant, the plantain, having published a treatise about it as though he were the discoverer. There are two kinds of it: the smaller, with narrower and darker leaves, resembles the tongue of a sheep; the stem is angular and bends downward. It grows in meadows. The other kind is larger and enclosed with leaves as it were with sides. Since these leaves are seven in number the plant is sometimes called heptapleuron. The stem too of this is a cubit high; when<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL393_195_a" id="target_note_LCL393_195_a"><sup>a</sup></a> it grows on wet soils it is much more efficacious. It has a wonderful power to dry and brace the body, having a cauterizing property. There is nothing that checks so well the fluxes called by the Greeks rheumatismoi, that is, catarrhs.</p>
<p>XL. Akin to the plantain is buglossos, which is<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Buglossos.</span></span>
like the tongue of an ox. The most conspicuous quality of this is that thrown into wine it increases the exhilarating effect, and so it is also called euphrosynum,
the plant that cheers.</p>
<p>XLI. Akin too is cynoglossos, which is like a dog’s<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Cynoglossos.</span></span>
tongue, and a most attractive addition to ornamental gardens. It is said that the root of the kind with three seed-bearing stems, if taken in water, is good for tertians, and that with four for quartans. There is also another plant like this which bears tiny burs. Its root taken in water neutralizes the poison of frogs<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL393_195_b" id="target_note_LCL393_195_b"><sup>b</sup></a> and snakes.</p>
<p>XLII. Another plant is buphthalmus, which is like<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Buphthalmus.</span></span>
