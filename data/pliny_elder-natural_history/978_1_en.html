The Naples quince is also highly esteemed. The smaller variety of the same kind, the sparrow-apple, gives out a rather pungent smell, and ripens late, whereas the must-quince
ripens very early. Grafting the ordinary quince on the sparrow-apple has produced a special kind, the Mulvian quince, which is the only one of the quinces that is eaten even raw; these at the present day are kept shut up in gentlemen’s reception-rooms, and are placed on the statues that share our nights with us.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL370_315_b" id="target_note_LCL370_315_b"><sup>b</sup></a> There is also a small wild quince, the scent of which is the most powerful next to that of the sparrow-apple and which grows in the hedges.</p>
