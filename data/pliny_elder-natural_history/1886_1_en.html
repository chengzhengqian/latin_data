of rings as recorded to have been sent by Hannibal
to Carthage. Also it was from a ring put up for

Not even at that period did all members of the
senate possess gold rings, seeing that in the memory
of our grandfathers many men who had even held
the office of praetor wore an iron ring to the end of
their lives—for instance, as recorded by Fenestella,
