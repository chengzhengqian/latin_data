Staves of all other kinds must be cut back every year. For the cross-bar, reeds tied together in bundles are best for the growth of the vine, and they last five years. When shorter branches are tied together with brushwood so as to make a sort of rope, the arcades made of them are called rope-trellises.</p>

leaps up to the cross-bar. Thereupon some growers ‘blind’ it by removing the eyes with a pruning-knife turned upward, with the object of making it grow longer—a most damaging practice, as the tree’s habit of putting out shoots is more profitable, and it is better to trim off leafy shoots from the plant tied to the cross-bar to the point where it is decided to let it make strength. Some people forbid touching it in the year after it is transplanted, and do not allow it to be trimmed with a pruning-knife till after 5 years, but then advise cutting it back to three buds. Others prune it back even the next year, but so as to let it add three or four new joints every year, and finally bring it up to the level of the cross-bar in the fourth year. Both methods make the tree slow to fruit, and also shrivelled and knotty, with the growth natural to dwarfs. But it is best for the mother to be strong and for the new growth to strike out boldly. Also there is no safety in a shoot covered with scars—that idea is a great mistake, due to inexperience: any growth of that sort arises from a blow, it is not due to the mother vine. She should
