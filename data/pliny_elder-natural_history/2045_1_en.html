Who his teacher was is believed to be unrecorded. Some people say that until the age of fifty he was also a ship-painter, and that this is proved by the fact that when he was decorating with paintings, on a very famous site at Athens, the gateway of the Temple of Athene, where he depicted his famous Paralus and Hammonias,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL394_337_a" id="target_note_LCL394_337_a"><sup>a</sup></a> which is by some people called the Nausicaa, he added some small drawings of battleships in what painters call the ‘side-pieces,’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL394_337_b" id="target_note_LCL394_337_b"><sup>b</sup></a> in order to show from what commencement his work had arrived at the pinnacle<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL394_337_c" id="target_note_LCL394_337_c"><sup>c</sup></a> of glorious display.

But the actual art displayed displeased him, nor was he able to diminish it, and he thought it was excessive and departed too far from reality—the
