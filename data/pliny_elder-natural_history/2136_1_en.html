<p>XLII. For I shall arrange remedies according to<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Remedies for snake bite.</span></span> each malady, serpents’ bites requiring very full treatment. Nobody is unaware that deer are their deadly enemies, in that they drag any they may find from their holes and eat them. Not only, however, when whole and alive are they the enemy of serpents; the parts of their body are so also. The fumes from their horns when burnt, as I have said,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL418_105_a" id="target_note_LCL418_105_a"><sup>a</sup></a> keep serpents away; but if the topmost bones of a stag’s neck have been burnt, serpents are said to assemble. The skins of the same animal make a bed on which one may sleep without fear of snakes, and the rennet taken in vinegar prevents being bitten; if it is merely handled, in fact, on that day no serpent strikes.

Stag’s blood, if with it are burnt on a lentisk-wood fire dracontion, cunilago and anchusa, is said to collect serpents together; then they scatter, it is said, if in place of blood pyrethrum is added. In my Greek authorities I find mentioned an animal that they call ophion,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL418_105_d" id="target_note_LCL418_105_d"><sup>d</sup></a> smaller than a stag and like it only
