places, according as they belong to the various kinds of agriculture. In the meantime we will not omit the principles of general application which occur to us, and particularly that most humane and most profitable advice of Cato,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL371_219_a" id="target_note_LCL371_219_a"><sup>a</sup></a> to do your best to win the esteem of your neighbours. Cato gives reasons for this advice, but for our part we imagine that nobody can doubt what the reasons are. Also one of Cato’s first pieces of advice<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL371_219_b" id="target_note_LCL371_219_b"><sup>b</sup></a> is a warning to keep your farm hands in good condition.

It is also said that ferns plucked up about midsummer do not spring up again, nor do those cut with a reed or ploughed up with a reed placed on the ploughshare. Similarly they also advise ploughing up reed with bracken placed on the ploughshare. A field grown over with rushes should be turned up with the spade after having been first broken with two-pronged forks. Brushwood is best removed by setting fire to it.
