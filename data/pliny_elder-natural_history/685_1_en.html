in the adjacent region of the Insubrians, do not come within eight miles of Lake Como. It is said that Mars’s woodpecker is not found in the district of Taranto. The kinds of pie called chequered pies and distinguished for their long tail, though hitherto rare, have lately begun to be seen between the Apennines and Rome; this bird has the peculiarity of moulting its feathers yearly at the time when the turnip is sown. Partridges do not fly across the frontier of Boeotia into Attica; nor does any bird fly across the temple dedicated to Achilles on the island<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL353_343_a" id="target_note_LCL353_343_a"><sup>a</sup></a> of the Black Sea where he is buried. In the district of Fidenae near Rome storks do not hatch chicks or make nests. But a quantity of pigeons every year fly from the sea to the district of Volterra. Neither flies nor dogs enter the temple of Hercules in the Cattle-market at Rome. There are many similar facts besides, which I am continually careful to omit in my account of the several kinds, to avoid being wearisome—for example Theophrastus states that even pigeons and peacocks and ravens are not indigenous in Asia, nor croaking frogs in Cyrenaica.</p>

song-birds; they usually change their colour and note with the season, and suddenly become different—which among the larger class of birds only cranes do, for these grow black in old age. The blackbird changes from black to red; and it sings in the summer, and chirps in winter, but at midsummer is silent; also the beak of yearling blackbirds, at all events the cocks, is turned to ivory colour. Thrushes are of a speckled colour round the neck in summer but self-coloured in winter.</p>
