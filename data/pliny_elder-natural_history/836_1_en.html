<p>XXIV. The country neighbouring on these islands,<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Utility trees of Arabia.</span></span> Arabia, calls for some detailed account of its products—inasmuch
as the parts of trees that are utilized include the root, the trunk, the bark, the juice, the
