<p>Nearchus and Onesicritus report that the Euphrates<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">The Euphrates.</span></span>
is navigable from the Persian Sea to Babylon, a
distance of 412 miles; but subsequent writers say it is navigable up to Seleucia, 440 miles, and Juba from Babylon as far as Charax, 175½ miles. Some report that it continues to flow in a single channel for a distance of 87 miles beyond Babylon before it is diverted into irrigation-channels, and that its entire course is 1200 miles long. This discrepancy of measurement is due to the variety of authors that have dealt with the matter, as even among the Persians different writers give different measurements for the length of the <span class="italic">schoenus</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL352_433_a" id="target_note_LCL352_433_a"><sup>a</sup></a> and the <span class="italic">parasang.</span> Where it ceases to afford protection by its channel, as it does when its course approaches the boundary of Charax, it immediately begins to be infested by the Attali, an Arabian tribe of brigands, beyond whom are the Scenitae. But the winding course of the Euphrates is occupied by the Nomads of Arabia right on to the desert of Syria, where, as we have stated, the river makes a bend to the south,<span class="marginNote right">V. 87.</span> quitting the uninhabited districts of Palmyra. The distance of Seleucia from the beginning of Mesopotamia is a voyage by the Euphrates of 1125 miles; its distance from the Red Sea, if the voyage by made by the Tigris, is 320 miles, and from Bridgetown 724 miles. Bridgetown is 175 miles from Seleucia on the Mediterranean coast of Syria. This gives the breadth of the country lying between the Mediterranean and the Red Sea.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL352_433_b" id="target_note_LCL352_433_b"><sup>b</sup></a> The extent of the kingdom of Parthia is 918 miles.</p>
