Ida, taken in doses of three denarii of the root to three cyathi of sweet wine, hastens delivery; it also brings away the afterbirth and acts as an emmenagogue. Taken in drink in the same way, the wild bay, called daphnoïdes, or by the names already<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL392_523_a" id="target_note_LCL392_523_a"><sup>a</sup></a> given to it, is beneficial; three drachmae of the leaves, fresh or dried, taken with salt in hydromel, relax the bowels.
