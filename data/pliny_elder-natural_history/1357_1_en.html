method of cultivation tried later has proved to be more useful, except that they now sow about February 13 by digging in the seed in heaps in little trenches, usually preparing the seed by soaking it in dung; as a result of this process the roots twine together and form tufts, which they plant out at spaces of a foot apart after the autumn equinox, the plants going on bearing for ten years. There is no soil that asparagus likes better than that of the kitchen-gardens at Ravenna, as we have pointed out.<span class="marginNote right">XVI. 173, XIX. 54.</span> I find it stated that corruda (which I take to be a wild asparagus, called by the Greeks <span class="italic">horminos</span> or <span class="italic">myacanthos</span>

The fact is it is well known that at Carthage and particularly at Cordova crops of thistles<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL371_519_a" id="target_note_LCL371_519_a"><sup>a</sup></a> yield a return of 6000 sesterces from small plots—since we turn even the monstrosities of the earth to purposes of gluttony, and actually grow vegetables which all four-footed beasts without exception shrink from touching. Thistles then we grow in two ways, from a slip planted in autumn and from seed sown before March 7, the seedlings from which are planted out before November 13, or in cold localities about the season<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL371_519_b" id="target_note_LCL371_519_b"><sup>b</sup></a> of the west wind. They are sometimes manured as well, if heaven so wills, and come up more abundantly. They are also preserved in honey diluted with vinegar, with the addition of laserwort root and cummin, so that there may be no day without thistles for dinner.</p>
