<p>XXXVI. Buprestis the Greeks with great inconsistency<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Buprestis.</span></span> went to the length of including among their praised foods, and yet they prescribed correctives
of it as though it were poison, and the mere name implies that it is poison to oxen at any rate,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL392_349_a" id="target_note_LCL392_349_a"><sup>a</sup></a> which it is allowed burst when they taste it. Wherefore it is one<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL392_349_b" id="target_note_LCL392_349_b"><sup>b</sup></a> of the plants about which I shall not speak at length. Is there indeed a reason why I should describe poisons when dealing with grass crowns, unless there be someone who thinks that for the sake of lust buprestis is desirable, which taken in drink is the most potent aphrodisiac known?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL392_349_ca" id="target_note_LCL392_349_ca"><sup>c</sup></a></p>
<p>XXXVII. Elaphoboscon (wild parsnip) is a plant<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Elaphoboscon.</span></span> like fennel-giant, with a jointed stem of the thickness
of a finger, the seed in clusters hanging down like hartwort, but not bitter, and with the leaves of olusatrum.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL392_349_d" id="target_note_LCL392_349_d"><sup>d</sup></a> This too has been praised as a food—in
fact it is even preserved for future use—being good as a diuretic, for soothing pains in the side, for curing ruptures and spasms, for dispersing flatulence and colic, and for the wounds of snakes and of all stinging creatures—in fact report has it that deer by eating it fortify themselves against snakes.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL392_349_e" id="target_note_LCL392_349_e"><sup>e</sup></a> Fistulas too are cured by the application of the root with saltpetre added, but when used in this way it must first be dried, so that it may not be soaking with its own juice, although the latter does not impair its efficacy as a remedy for snake bites.</p>
<p>XXXVIII. Scandix (chervil) too is classed by the<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Scandix.</span></span> Greeks as a wild vegetable, as Ophion and Erasistratus
report. A decoction of it too tones up loose
