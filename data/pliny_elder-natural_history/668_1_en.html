shape out of a hawk<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL353_309_a" id="target_note_LCL353_309_a"><sup>a</sup></a> at a certain season of the year, as the rest of the hawks do not appear then, except on a very few days, and the cuckoo itself also after being seen for a moderate period of the summer is not observed afterwards. But the cuckoo is alone among the hawks in not having crooked talons, and also it is not like the other hawks in the head or in anything else but colour: it rather has the general appearance of the pigeon. Moreover a hawk will eat a cuckoo, if ever both have appeared at the same time: the cuckoo is the only one of all the birds that is killed by its own kind. And it also changes its voice. It comes out in the spring and goes into hiding<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL353_309_b" id="target_note_LCL353_309_b"><sup>b</sup></a> at the rising of the dog-star, between which dates it lays its eggs in the nests of other birds, usually<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL353_309_c" id="target_note_LCL353_309_c"><sup>c</sup></a> wood-pigeons, for the most part one egg at a time, as does no other bird; it seldom lays two. Its reason for foisting its chicks on other birds is supposed to be that it knows itself to be hated by the whole of the birds, for even the very small birds attack it; consequently it thinks that a progeny will not be secured for its race unless it has escaped notice, for which reason it makes no nest; it is a timid creature in general. Therefore the brooding hen in the nest thus cuckolded rears the changeling. The young cuckoo<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL353_309_d" id="target_note_LCL353_309_d"><sup>d</sup></a> being by nature greedy snatches the bits of food away from the rest of the chicks, and so gets fat and attracts the mother bird to itself by its sleek appearance. She delights in its beauty and admires herself for having borne such a child, while in comparison with it she convicts her own chicks of not belonging to her, and lets them be eaten up even under her own eyes, until finally the cuckoo,
