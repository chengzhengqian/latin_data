the whole of its breadth, but without going at all outside it. The planet Mercury diverges very widely from these, but without wandering over more than 8 of the 12 degrees of latitude of the zodiac, and these 8 not uniformly but two in the middle of the zodiac, four above it and two below it. Then the sun travels unevenly in the middle of the zodiac between the two halves with a wavy serpentine course, the planet Mars over 4 degrees in the middle, Jupiter one in the middle and two above it, Saturn two like the sun. This will be the principle of the latitudes of the planets when setting towards the South or rising towards the North. Most people have supposed that with this system agrees also the third mentioned above,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL330_215_a" id="target_note_LCL330_215_a"><sup>a</sup></a> that of their rising from the earth to the sky, and that this ascent also is made simultaneously; but this is a mistake. To refute them it is necessary to develop an extremely abstruse argument that embraces all the causes mentioned.</p>
<p>It is agreed<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL330_215_b" id="target_note_LCL330_215_b"><sup>b</sup></a> that the planets are nearest to the earth<span class="marginNote right">(2) <span class="italic">in relation to the earth.</span></span> in both altitude and latitude at their evening setting, and that their morning risings occur at the beginning of both altitude and latitude, while their stations occur in the middle sections of the altitudes, called ‘ecliptics.’ It is similarly admitted<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL330_215_c" id="target_note_LCL330_215_c"><sup>c</sup></a> that their velocity increases as long as they are in the neighbourhood of the earth and decreases when they withdraw from it to a height: this theory is specially supported by the apogees of the moon. It is equally undoubted<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL330_215_d" id="target_note_LCL330_215_d"><sup>d</sup></a> that the three higher ones<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL330_215_e" id="target_note_LCL330_215_e"><sup>e</sup></a> moreover increase their motion in their morning risings and diminish it from their first (morning) stations to their second (evening) stations. In view of these facts it will be evident that the latitudes are ascended from
