hard. The old name for the edge of the upper eyelid was <span class="italic">cilium</span>; hence our word for the brows. When the eyelid is cleft by a wound it does not grow together again, as is the case with a few other parts of the human body.</p>
<p>LVIII.

<p>LIX. The face between the cheek-bones displays<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">The nose.</span></span> merriment and laughter, and higher up, but in man only, stands the nose, which modern fashion has made the organ of sly mockery. No other animal has projecting nostrils, birds, snakes and fishes only having apertures for smelling, without nostrils and this is the origin of the surnames Snubby and Pug.

<p>LX. The viviparous species have lips—whence the<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">The mouth.</span></span> surnames Lippy and Blubber-lips—and a well-shaped or rather harsh mouth. Instead of lips birds have pointed beaks of horn, which are hooked in birds of prey, straight in those that live by pecking, and broad in those that dig up grass and mud, like the snouts of the swine class. Cattle use their mouths instead of a hand for gathering fodder. Beasts that live by tearing up their prey have mouths that open wider.</p>
<p>No creature but man has a chin, any more than<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">The jaw.</span></span> cheeks. The crocodile moves only the upper jaw; four-footed land animals open the mouth in the same way as all other creatures and in addition move the lower jaw sideways.</p>
