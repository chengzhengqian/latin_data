For this reason we will pursue the subject of manufactures as well, so that just as the principle of foodstuffs is learnt in food, so everybody who takes pleasure in the class of things in question may be well-informed on the subject of that which is the prize of their mode of life. Shellfish supplying purple dyes and scarlets—the material of these is the same but it is differently blended—are

The trumpet-shell clings only to rocks and can be gathered round crags.</p>

feeds on rotting slime and the seaweed-purple

The pebble-purple is named after a pebble in the sea, and is remarkably suitable for purple dyes; and far the best for these is the
