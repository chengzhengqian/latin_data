which is black, is in a pod, and it ripens at the same time as barley. This seed is of a bracing<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL393_329_a" id="target_note_LCL393_329_a"><sup>a</sup></a> quality, checks diarrhoea and promotes urine; it is taken with wine for bladder troubles.</p>
<p>LIV. There is another hypericon, called by some caro, having a leaf like that of the tamarisk—it grows underneath it—but more fleshy and less red.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL393_329_ba" id="target_note_LCL393_329_ba"><sup>b</sup></a> It is scented, more than a span high, with a sweet and rather pungent<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL393_329_c" id="target_note_LCL393_329_c"><sup>c</sup></a> taste. The seed is of a heating nature and therefore causes inflammation, but it is not injurious to the stomach; it is particularly good for strangury, if the bladder is not ulcerated. Taken in wine it is also good for pleurisy,</p>
<p>LV. as moreover is callithrix for the bladder if beaten up with cummin and administered in white wine. Vervain too if boiled down with the leaves to one third, or its root in warm honey wine, expels stone from the bladder, as does also perpressa, which grows near Arretium and in Illyricum; it is taken in drink, boiled down in water from three heminae to one. Trefoil, taken in wine, and chrysanthemum, have the same effect. Stone is expelled also by anthemis, which has five small leaves growing from the root, two long stems

<span class="italic">minutis</span>) so as to bring Pliny closer to Dioscorides, who has μικρότερον (φύλλον). On the other hand the MSS. give no variant, and it is hard to see why a scribe should alter an easy reading, whether <span class="italic">minoribus</span> or <span class="italic">minutis,</span> to <span class="italic">minus.</span> It is to be noted that Pliny has <span class="italic">pinguioribus . . . et minus rubentibus,</span>
but Dioscorides μικρότερον δὲ καὶ λιπαρώτερον καιὶ ἐρυθρόν. If the Greek before Pliny (or his reader) had the adjectives in Pliny’s order, without connecting particles (λιπαρώτερον, μικρότερον, ἐρυθρόν), it is just possible that they were taken to mean “more fleshy and a little less red.” So, after long hesitation, I have kept the MSS. reading. Note that Pliny read μυρίκης for ἐρείκης.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL393_329_ba').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL393_329_c"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL393_329_c" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">c</sup><span class="italic">Acutus</span> when used of <span class="italic">sapores</span> seems to mean merely “sharp”; <span class="italic">acer,</span> on the contrary, means not only pungent, but salty and with a vinegary flavour.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL393_329_c').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
