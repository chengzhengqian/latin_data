ædile as a colleague of Quintus Anicius of Palestrina, who a few years previously had been an enemy at war with Rome,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL394_17_a" id="target_note_LCL394_17_a"><sup>a</sup></a> while Gaius Poetilius and Domitius,
whose fathers had been consuls, were passed over. Flavius had the additional advantage of being tribune of the plebs at the same time. This caused such an outburst of blazing indignation that we find in the oldest annals ‘rings were laid aside.’ The common belief that the Order of Knighthood also did the same on this occasion is erroneous, inasmuch as the following words were also added: ‘but also harness-bosses were put aside as well’; and it is because of this clause that the name of the Knights has been added; and the entry in the annals is that the rings were laid aside by the nobility, not by the entire Senate.

This event took place in the 449th year from the foundation of the city, and<span class="marginNote right">305 <span class="sc">b.c.</span></span> is the earliest evidence to be found of the use of rings. There is however a second piece of evidence for their being commonly worn at the time of the Second Punic War, as had this not been the case it
