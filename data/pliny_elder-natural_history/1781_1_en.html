For spitting of blood also agaric is of help; a victoriatus by weight is pounded and given in five cyathi of honey wine. For this complaint amomum is equally good. For liver complaints fresh teucria is specific, taken in the proportion of four drachmae to one hemina of vinegar and water, or betony, one drachma to three cyathi of hot water: the same amount of betony, in two cyathi of cold water, is given for heart affections. The juice of cinquefoil is a remedy for affections of the liver and lungs, for spitting of blood, and for all internal blood impurities.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL393_291_ba" id="target_note_LCL393_291_ba"><sup>b</sup></a> Both kinds of anagallis are wonderfully good for liver complaints. Those who have eaten the plant called capnos (smoke) pass bile in their urine.

Literally the clause seems to mean “fights any blood complaint within,” or “advances to the inside against any blood complaint.” This might mean that impure blood in the internal organs was purified, or that trouble in the constitution of the blood anywhere was rectified.
