springs up among shrubs. Without perfume and without the yellow anthers in the centre, it resembles the lily only in colour, being as it were a first attempt by Nature when she was learning to produce lilies. White lilies are propagated by all the means that roses are;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL392_179_a" id="target_note_LCL392_179_a"><sup>a</sup></a> more than this, by a peculiar tear-like gum of its own, as is also horse-parsley. No plant is more prolific, a single root often sending out fifty bulbs. There is also a red lily that the Greeks call crinon,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL392_179_b" id="target_note_LCL392_179_b"><sup>b</sup></a> some calling its blossom the dog-rose.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL392_179_c" id="target_note_LCL392_179_c"><sup>c</sup></a> The most esteemed kind grows at Antioch and at Laodicea
in Syria, next to them comes that of Phaselis. The fourth place is held by the kind growing in Italy.</p>
<p>XII. There is also a bright-red lily,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL392_179_d" id="target_note_LCL392_179_d"><sup>d</sup></a> having sometimes a double stem, and differing from other lilies only in having a fleshier root and a larger bulb, and that undivided. It is called the narcissus. Another variety of it has a white flower and a reddish bud. There is this further difference between the ordinary lily and the narcissus, that the leaves of the latter grow straight out of the root. The most popular sort is found on the mountains of Lycia. A third kind has all its characteristics the same as those of the other kinds, except that the cup<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL392_179_e" id="target_note_LCL392_179_e"><sup>e</sup></a> is light green. All the narcissi blossom late, for the flower comes after the rising of Arcturus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL392_179_f" id="target_note_LCL392_179_f"><sup>f</sup></a> and during the autumnal equinox.</p>
