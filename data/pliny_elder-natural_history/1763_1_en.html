vervain chewed with its root, or the juice of a decoction in wine or vinegar used as a mouth-wash, and also that of the root of cinquefoil boiled down to one-third in wine or vinegar. Before it is boiled down it is washed in sea water or salt water, and the decoction should be kept in the mouth for a long time. Some prefer to use the ash of cinquefoil as a dentrifrice. The root of verbascum too is boiled down in wine to make a mouth-wash for the teeth, for which purpose also hyssop is employed and the juice of peucedanum with poppy juice; or the juice of anagallis roots, by preference of the female plant, is poured<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL393_255_a" id="target_note_LCL393_255_a"><sup>a</sup></a> into the nostril opposite to where pain is felt.</p>
