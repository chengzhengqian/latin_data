its taste, which dries up the mouth and leaves a pleasant flavour.</p>
<p>The price of nard is 100 denarii a pound. The nard-leaf market is graded according to the size of the leaf: the kind called hadrosphaerum in larger pills costs 40 denarii; the smaller-leaved sort called mesosphaerum sells at 60 denarii; and the most highly-spoken
of, microsphaerum, is made of the smallest leaves and its price is 75 denarii. All the kinds have an agreeable scent, stronger when they are fresh. The better nard has a blacker colour, if it is old when gathered. In our part of the world<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL370_33_a" id="target_note_LCL370_33_a"><sup>a</sup></a> the next most highly praised kind is the Syrian, then that from Gaul, and in the third place is the Cretan, which some call agrion and others phun<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL370_33_b" id="target_note_LCL370_33_b"><sup>b</sup></a>; it has a leaf like that of alexanders, a stalk 18 inches long, knotted and coloured whitish purple, and a crooked hairy root resembling birds’ claws. Wild nard is called baccaris<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL370_33_c" id="target_note_LCL370_33_c"><sup>c</sup></a>; we shall speak about it<span class="marginNote right">XX. 135.</span> among flowers. All of these kinds of nard, however, are herbs except the Indian. Among them the Gallic kind is plucked with the root as well, and washed in wine, dried in a shady place, and done up with paper in small parcels; it does not differ much from the Indian nard, but it is lighter in weight than the Syrian. Its price is 3 denarii. In the case of these varieties the only way to test them is that the leaves must not be brittle and parched instead of merely dry. With Gallic nard there always grows the herb called ‘little goat’ because of its offensive smell, like the smell of a goat; it is very much employed to adulterate nard, from which it is distinguished by having no stem and smaller leaves, and by its root, which is not bitter and also has no smell.</p>
