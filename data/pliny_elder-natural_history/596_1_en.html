<p>I. <span class="sc">We</span> have indicated the nature of the species that<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">zoology</span> (<span class="italic">contd.</span>):—<span class="italic">Aquatic animals.</span></span> we have designated land animals, as living in some kind of association with men. Of the remaining kinds it is agreed that birds are the smallest. We will therefore first speak of the creatures of the seas, rivers and ponds.</p>
<p>There are however a considerable number of these<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Remarkable aquatic species.</span></span> that are larger even than land animals. The obvious cause of this is the lavish nature of liquid. Birds, which live hovering in the air, are in a different condition. But in the sea, lying so widely outspread and so yielding and productive of nutriment, because the element receives generative causes from above and is always producing offspring, a great many actual monstrosities are found, the seeds and first principles intertwining and interfolding with each other now in one way and now in another, now by the action of the wind and now by that of the waves, so ratifying the common opinion that everything born in any department of nature exists also in the sea, as well as a number of things never found elsewhere. Indeed we may realize that it contains likenesses of things and not of animals only, when we examine the ‘sea-grape’, the sword-fish, the saw-fish, and the cucumber-fish, the last resembling a real cucumber both in colour and scent; which makes it less surprising that in marine snails that are so tiny there are horses’ heads projecting.</p>
