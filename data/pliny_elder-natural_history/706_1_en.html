<p>LXXIII. The reproductive system of birds appears<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Mating of birds.</span></span>
to be simple, although even this possesses marvels of its own, since even four-footed creatures produce eggs—chamaeleons and lizards and those we have specified<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL353_385_a" id="target_note_LCL353_385_a"><sup>a</sup></a> among aquatic species, and also snakes. But among feathered creatures those that have hooked talons are unfertile. Of these only the lesser kestrel produces more than four eggs at a time. Nature has bestowed on the bird kind the attribute that the species among them that are shy are more prolific than the brave ones; only ostriches, hens and partridges bear very numerous broods. Birds have two methods of coupling, the hen sitting on the ground as in the case of the domestic fowl or standing up as in the case of the crane.</p>

with the dove and partridge, in others pale-coloured, as with waterfowl, in others spotted, as those of the guinea-hen, in others of a red colour, as in the case of the pheasant and the lesser kestrel. The inside of every bird’s egg is of two colours; in that of the aquatic birds there is more yellow than white, and that yellow is brighter than with the other species. Fishes’ eggs are of one colour, which contains no bright white. Birds’ eggs are made easily breakable by heat, snakes’ eggs are made flexible by cold, and fishes’ eggs are softened by liquid. Aquatic species have round eggs, but almost all others oval-shaped ones. They are laid with their roundest part in front, the shell of whatever portions they emerge with being soft but becoming hard immediately after the process. Long-shaped eggs are thought by Horace<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL353_385_b" id="target_note_LCL353_385_b"><sup>b</sup></a> to have a more agreeable flavour. Eggs of a rounder formation produce a hen chicken and
