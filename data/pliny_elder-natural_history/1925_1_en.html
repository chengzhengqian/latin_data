as good, while if it turns red it is of the next quality, and if black it has no value at all. But fraud has found its way even into this test; if the shovels are kept in men’s urine the silver shaving is stained by it during the process of being burnt, and counterfeits whiteness. There is also one way of testing polished silver in a man’s breath—if it at once forms surface moisture and dissipates the vapour.</p>
<p>XLV. It has been believed that only the best<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Reflecting qualities and uses of silver. Mirrors.</span></span> silver is capable of being beaten out into plates and producing an image. This was formerly a sound test, but nowadays this too is spoiled by fraud.</p>
<p>Still, the property of reflecting images is marvellous; it is generally agreed that it takes place owing to the repercussion of the air which is thrown back into the eyes. In a similar way, owing to the same force, in employing a mirror if the thickness of the metal has been polished and beaten out into a slightly concave shape the size of the objects reflected is enormously magnified: such a difference does it make whether the surface welcomes<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL394_97_a" id="target_note_LCL394_97_a"><sup>a</sup></a> the air in question or flings it back.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL394_97_b" id="target_note_LCL394_97_b"><sup>b</sup></a> Moreover bowls can be made of such a shape, with a number of looking-glasses so to speak beaten outward inside them, that if only a single person is looking into them a crowd of images is formed of the same number as the facets in question. Ingenuity even devises vessels that do conjuring tricks, for instance those deposited as votive offerings in the temple at Smyrna: this is brought about by the shape of the material, and it makes a very great difference whether the vessels are concave and shaped like a bowl or convex like a Thracian shield, whether their centre is recessed or projecting, whether the oval<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL394_97_c" id="target_note_LCL394_97_c"><sup>c</sup></a> is horizontal or oblique,
