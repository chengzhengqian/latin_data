blood retreats and is nowhere to be found, and that many creatures do not shed blood when stabbed, which happens only to a human being. For those which we have spoken of<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL353_575_a" id="target_note_LCL353_575_a"><sup>a</sup></a> as changing their colour really assume the colour of some other object by a sort of reflexion; only man actually changes colour in himself. All diseases and death reduce the amount of blood.</p>
<p>XCII There are persons who think that subtlety<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Psycho-physiology</span></span> of mind is not due to thinness of the blood, but that animals are more or less brutish owing to their skin and bodily coverings, as for instance molluscs and tortoises; and that the hides of oxen and bristles of pigs obstruct the thinness of the air when being inhaled, and it is not transmitted pure and liquid; so also in man, when his skin being thicker or more callous shuts it outâ€”just as if crocodiles did not possess both a hard hide and cunning.</p>
<p>XCIII. The skin of the hippopotamus is so thick that it is used for the points of spears, and yet its mind possesses a certain medical ability.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL353_575_b" id="target_note_LCL353_575_b"><sup>b</sup></a> The hides of elephants also supply impenetrable bucklers (though nevertheless . they are credited with the most outstanding mental subtlety of all quadrupeds); and consequently their skin itself is devoid of sensation, especially in the head. It does not heal up when wounded in any place where there is only skin and no flesh, as in the cheek and eyelid.</p>
<p>XCIV. Viviparous species have bristles, but oviparous<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Bristles, feathers and scales.</span></span> ones have feathers or scales, or shells like tortoises, or bare skin like snakes. Feathers in all cases have hollow stalks; when cut off they do not grow again, but when plucked out others grow in their place. Insects use fragile membranes to fly
