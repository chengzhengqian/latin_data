the richest comes from sheep’s—it is also made from goat’s—but in winter the milk is warmed, while in summer the butter is extracted merely by shaking it rapidly in a tall vessel. This has a small hole to admit the air, made just under the mouth, which is otherwise completely stopped. There is added a little water<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL418_95_a" id="target_note_LCL418_95_a"><sup>a</sup></a> to make the milk turn sour. The part that curdles most, floating on the top, [is skimmed off, and with salt added is called oxygala; the rest they boil down in pots. What comes to the surface<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL418_95_ba" id="target_note_LCL418_95_ba"><sup>b</sup></a>] is butter, a fatty substance. The stronger the taste, the more highly is butter esteemed. When matured it is used as an ingredient for several mixtures. It is by nature astringent, emollient, flesh-forming, and cleansing.</p>

it on entering their homes. Lard is matured in two ways, with salt or by itself; it is so much the more beneficial when matured. The name axungia (axlegrease)
is the one adopted by the Greeks also in their writings. Nor is the cause of its properties a mystery, for the pig feeds on the roots of plants, so that there are very many uses even for its dung.
