petals. A wonderful thing about this flower is that the head bends over, and from the joints grow<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL392_197_a" id="target_note_LCL392_197_a"><sup>a</sup></a> curved petals inclosing yellow seed forming a small corolla of several colours.

<p>XXVI. The chrysocome (immortelle?) or chrysitis<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Chrysocome.</span></span> has no Latin name. It is a palm in height, flowering

root, which is dark, and it grows in rocky, shady places.</p>
<p>XXVII. Having now nearly exhausted the subject<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Chaplets.</span></span> also of the most popular colours, I ought to pass on
to those chaplets that please only because of the
variety in their make-up. They are of two kinds:
some are made of flowers, others of leaves. Among
the flowers I would include greenweed—for the
yellow blossom of this too is gathered—also the oleander, and the jujubes of the kind called Cappadocian,
having a scent like that of olive flowers. Among brambles grows the cyclamen, about which I shall say more elsewhere.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL392_197_d" id="target_note_LCL392_197_d"><sup>d</sup></a> Its flower, Colossae purple in colour, is used to make up chaplets.</p>
