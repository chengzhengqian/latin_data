the hairs embracing the seed curve over with a fringed tuft. There are also varieties of panic, for instance the full-breasted kind, clustered with small tufts growing out of the ear, and with a double point; moreover these grasses are of various colours, white, black, red and even purple. Bread of several kinds is made even from millet, but very little from panic; but there is no grain heavier in weight or that swells more in baking: they get sixty pounds of bread out of a peck, and a peck of porridge out of three-sixteenths of a peck soaked in water. A millet has been introduced into Italy from India within the last ten years that is of a black colour, with a large grain and a stalk like that of a reed. It grows to seven feet in height, with very large hairs—they are called the mane—and is the most prolific of all kinds of corn, one grain producing three-sixteenths of a peck. It should be sown in damp ground.</p>

Wheat<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL371_225_a" id="target_note_LCL371_225_a"><sup>a</sup></a> has four articulations in each stalk, emmer six and barley eight; but the ear does not begin to form before the above-mentioned number of articulations is complete; when this has given signs of occurring, in four or at latest five days they begin to blossom, and after the same number of days or a few more they finish flowering; but with barley this happens in seven days at latest. Varro states<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL371_225_b" id="target_note_LCL371_225_b"><sup>b</sup></a> that the grains are fully formed in thirty-six days and are ready for reaping after eight months.</p>
