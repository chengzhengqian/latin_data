being far superior to that of Cyprus and Spain and Africa, although some people think that Cyprus <span class="italic">sori</span> is more useful for treatment of the eyes; but whatever its provenance the best is that which has the most pungent odour,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL394_217_a" id="target_note_LCL394_217_a"><sup>a</sup></a> and which when ground up takes a greasy, black colour and becomes spongy. It is a substance that goes against the stomach so violently that with some people the mere smell of it causes vomiting. This is a description of the <span class="italic">sori</span> of Egypt. That from other sources when ground up turns a bright colour like <span class="italic">misy,</span> and it is harder; however, if it is held in the cavities<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL394_217_b" id="target_note_LCL394_217_b"><sup>b</sup></a> and used plentifully as a mouth-wash it is good for toothache and for serious and creeping ulcers of the mouth.

Some people have reported that <span class="italic">Misy</span><span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Misy.</span></span> is made by burning mineral in trenches, its fine yellow powder mixing itself with the ash of the pine wood burnt; but as a matter of fact though got from the mineral<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL394_217_c" id="target_note_LCL394_217_c"><sup>c</sup></a> above mentioned, it is part of its substance and separated from it by force, the best kind being obtained in the copper-factories of Cyprus, its marks being that when broken it sparkles like gold and when it is ground it has a sandy appearance, without earth, unlike chalcitis. A mixture of <span class="italic">misy</span> is employed in the magical purification of gold.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL394_217_d" id="target_note_LCL394_217_d"><sup>d</sup></a> Mixed with oil of roses it makes a useful infusion for suppurating ears and applied on wool a serviceable plaster for ulcers of the head. It also reduces chronic roughness of the eyelids, and is especially useful for the tonsils and against quinsy and suppurations.
