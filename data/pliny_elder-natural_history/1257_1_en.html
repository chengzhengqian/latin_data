But it is universally agreed that sowing must not be done in the period of mid-winter, for the convincing reason that winter seeds when sown before mid-winter break out in a week, but if sown after it scarcely begin to appear in four weeks. There are some who hasten matters on and put forward the dictum that, while sowing in haste often proves deceptive, sowing late always does. Others on the opposite side think that sowing even in spring is preferable to sowing in a bad autumn, and that if this is necessary it should be done between the arrival of the west wind<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL371_319_a" id="target_note_LCL371_319_a"><sup>a</sup></a> and the spring equinox.

Thus these latter writers pay no attention to Nature, while the previous set pay too much, and consequently their elaborate theorizing is all in the dark, as the issue lies between countrymen and literary, not merely astronomical, pundits! And it must be confessed that these matters do chiefly depend on the weather—as in fact Virgil<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL371_319_c" id="target_note_LCL371_319_c"><sup>c</sup></a> enjoins first before all else to learn the winds and the habits of the stars, and to observe them just in the same way as they are observed for navigation. It is an arduous and a vast aspiration—to succeed in introducing the divine science of the heavens to the ignorance of the rustic, but it must be attempted, owing to the vast benefit it confers on life.
