In frogs the tip of the tongue is attached but the inner part is loose from the throat; it is with this that the males croak, at the time when they are called croakers; this happens at a fixed season, when they are calling the females to mate. In this process they just drop the lower lip and take into the throat a moderate amount of water and let the tongue vibrate in it so as to make it undulate, and a croaking sound is forced out; during this the curves of the cheeks are distended and become transparent, and the eyes stand out blazing with the exertion. Creatures with stings in their hinder part have teeth and a tongue as well, bees even a very long tongue, and cicalas also a projecting one; but those with a tubular sting in the mouth have neither tongue nor teeth. Some insects have a tongue inside the mouth, for instance ants; moreover, the elephant’s tongue also is particularly little visible. With the rest of the animals according to their kind the tongue is always quite free, but with man alone it is often so tightly bound by veins<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL353_541_b" id="target_note_LCL353_541_b"><sup>b</sup></a> that they have to be cut.

Many people on the other hand are endowed with such skill in using the tongue that they can give imitations of the cries of birds and animals that are indistinguishable from the real thing.</p>
