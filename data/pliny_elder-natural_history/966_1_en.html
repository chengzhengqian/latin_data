Virgil<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL370_291_a" id="target_note_LCL370_291_a"><sup>a</sup></a> said that there are three kinds of olive, the orchites,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL370_291_b" id="target_note_LCL370_291_b"><sup>b</sup></a> the shuttle-olive<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL370_291_c" id="target_note_LCL370_291_c"><sup>c</sup></a> and the posia;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL370_291_d" id="target_note_LCL370_291_d"><sup>d</sup></a> he also stated that the olive-tree does not require raking or pruning or any attention. There is no doubt that even in the case of olives the soil and the climate are of very great importance; but nevertheless they are also pruned at the same time as the vine, and they like the ground to be raked between them as well. Olive-picking follows the vintage, and making olive-oil requires even more science than making wine, as the same olive-tree produces a variety of oils. The first oil of all is obtained from the raw olive and when it has not yet begun to ripen—this has the best flavour; moreover its first issue from the press is the richest, and so on by diminishing stages, whether the olives are crushed in wicker sieves or by enclosing the spray in narrow-meshed strainers, a method recently invented. The riper the berry is, the greasier and less agreeable in flavour is the juice. The best age for picking olives, as between quantity and flavour, is when the berry is beginning to turn black, at the stage when they are called druppae with us and drypetides by the Greeks. For the rest, it makes a difference at that stage whether the maturing of the berry takes place in the presses or on the boughs, and whether the tree has been watered or the berry has only been moistened by its own juice and has drunk nothing else but the dews of heaven.</p>

gives it an unpleasant flavour, and at the end of a year it is already old. Herein, if one chooses to understand it, Nature shows her forethought, inasmuch as there is no necessity to use up wine, which is produced for the purpose of intoxication—rather
