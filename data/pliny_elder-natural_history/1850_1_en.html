would have us understand the tree which in Italy is called aquifolium.</p>
<p>XLI. Crocodileon is like black chamaeleon in<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Crocodileon.</span></span> shape, with a long root uniformly thick, and a pungent smell. It grows in sandy places. Taken in drink it causes copious epistaxis of thick blood; it is also<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL393_429_b" id="target_note_LCL393_429_b"><sup>b</sup></a> said to reduce the spleen.</p>
