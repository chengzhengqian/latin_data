Nymphodorus’s<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL394_205_a" id="target_note_LCL394_205_a"><sup>a</sup></a> process is to burn on hot coals the most heavy dense piece of <span class="italic">cadmea</span> that can be obtained, and when it is thoroughly burnt to quench it with Chian wine, and pound it, and then to sift it through a linen cloth and grind it in a mortar, and then macerate it in rainwater and again grind the sediment that sinks to the bottom till it becomes like white lead and offers no grittiness to the teeth.

Certain persons also add salt, and some use alum instead of sulphur, while others add nothing at all, but only sprinkle the copper with vinegar. When burnt it is pounded in a mortar of Theban stone, washed with rainwater, and then again pounded with the addition of a larger quantity of water, and left till it settles, and this process is repeated several times, till it is reduced
