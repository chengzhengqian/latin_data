Although betony in general lies heavy on the stomach, yet taken in drink, or if the leaves are chewed, it cures its troubles; aristolochia also may be taken in drink or dry agaric chewed, neat wine being drunk after a while, and nymphaea heraclia or juice of peucedanum may be applied locally.

and a root four fingers long, at the end of which is a head like that of garlic. Some give it the name of syron.
