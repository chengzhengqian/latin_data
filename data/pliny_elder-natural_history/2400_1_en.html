ground comprising many miles of ‘walks’ or ‘rides,’ such as we see exemplified in our tessellated floors or in the ceremonial game played by our boys in the Campus Martius,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_69_a" id="target_note_LCL419_69_a"><sup>a</sup></a> but doors are let into the walls at frequent intervals to suggest deceptively the way ahead and to force the visitor to go back upon the very same tracks that he has already followed in his wanderings. This Cretan labyrinth was the next in succession after the Egyptian, and there was a third in Lemnos and a fourth in Italy, all alike being roofed with vaults of carefully worked stone. There is a feature of the Egyptian labyrinth which I for my<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">The Egyptian Labyrinth.</span></span> part find surprising, namely an entrance and columns made of Parian marble.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_69_b" id="target_note_LCL419_69_b"><sup>b</sup></a> The rest of the structure is of Aswan granite, the great blocks of which have been laid in such a way that even the lapse of centuries cannot destroy them. Their preservation has been aided by the people of Heracleopolis, who have shown remarkable respect for an achievement that they detest.</p>
<p>The ground-plan and the individual parts of this building cannot be fully described because it is divided among the regions or administrative districts known as nomes, of which there are 21, each having a vast hall allotted to it by name.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_69_c" id="target_note_LCL419_69_c"><sup>c</sup></a> Besides these halls, it contains temples of all the Egyptian gods; and, furthermore, Nemesis<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_69_da" id="target_note_LCL419_69_da"><sup>d</sup></a> placed within the 40 shrines
