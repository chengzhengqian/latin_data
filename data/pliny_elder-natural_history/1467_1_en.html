<p>XXIII. Without a doubt no effort of ours can<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Amaranth.</span></span> compete with the amaranth. Yet it is more truly a purple ear than a flower, and is itself without scent.
A wonderful thing about it is that it likes to be plucked, growing again more luxuriant<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL392_195_a" id="target_note_LCL392_195_a"><sup>a</sup></a> than ever.
