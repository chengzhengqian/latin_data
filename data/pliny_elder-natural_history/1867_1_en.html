boil it down until the water becomes sweet, pour this off, pound the root, and work it into lozenges, which they dry in the sun and use afterwards for sores on the head and all other ailments that call for a detergent. Moreover, they give in wine a three-finger pinch for cough, and an electuary made of it for pleurisy or pneumonia. They also give it to be taken in wine for sciatica, for colic, and as an emmenagogue.</p>
<p>XCIII. Peplis, called by some syce, by others<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Peplis.</span></span> meconion or mecon aphrodes, grows into a shrub from one slender root, and has leaves like those of rue but a little broader. Under the leaves is a round seed, smaller than that of the white poppy. It is generally gathered among vines at harvest time, and is dried with its seed after a vessel has been placed beneath to catch this. Taken in drink it relaxes the bowels, bringing away bile and phlegm. A moderate dose is an acetabulum in three heminae of hydromel. It is sprinkled over foods and relishes to loosen the bowels.</p>
<p>XCIV. Periclymenon too is a plant which grows<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Periclymenon.</span></span> into a shrub, having after an interval two leaves which are whitish and soft. And at the top among the leaves is a seed which is hard, and difficult to pluck.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL393_463_aa" id="target_note_LCL393_463_aa"><sup>a</sup></a> The plant grows in cultivated fields and in hedges, climbing round supports of any kind.

Pliny is inclined to treat any plant name as feminine, regardless of what it is, probably with <span class="italic">herba</span> in his mind. <span class="italic">Ipsa</span> therefore means ‘this plant.’ As I study this passage, it seems to me that Pliny in condensing probably omitted a description of the flower-head after <span class="italic">fruticat.</span> There is one odd feature of the genus <span class="italic">Lonicera.</span> Quite a few of the species have a flower growing on an axillary bracted peduncle. A little below the flower-head (<span class="italic">ex intervallo</span>) there are two pairs of these bracts, so conjoined that each seems to be a single leaf. This is a fairly distinctive feature, one likely to be noted for purposes of recognition.” (A.C.A.)</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL393_463_aa').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
