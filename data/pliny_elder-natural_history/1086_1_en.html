<p>LXXX. There are four kinds of pests that attack<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Creatures injurious to timber.</span></span>
timbers. Borer-worms<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL370_531_a" id="target_note_LCL370_531_a"><sup>a</sup></a> have a very large head in proportion
to their size, and gnaw away wood with their teeth; these worms are observed only in the sea, and it is held that they are the only ones to which the name of borer-worm properly applies. The land variety are called moths, but the name for those resembling gnats is thrips, and there is also a fourth kind belonging to the maggot class, of which some are engendered by the wood itself when its sap becomes putrid and others are produced by the worm called horned-worm—as they are in trees—which
when it has gnawed away enough to be able to turn round, gives birth to another. The birth of these insects is prevented however in some trees, for instance the cypress, by the bitter taste of the wood, and in others, for instance the box, by its hardness. It is also said that the fir will not decay in water if about the time of budding and at the lunar period we stated it is stripped of its bark. The<span class="marginNote right">§ 190.</span> companions of Alexander the Great stated that on the island of Tylos<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL370_531_b" id="target_note_LCL370_531_b"><sup>b</sup></a> in the Red Sea there are trees<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL370_531_c" id="target_note_LCL370_531_c"><sup>c</sup></a> used for building ships, the timbers of which have been found continuing free from rot for two hundred years even though they were under water. They further reported that the same island contains a shrub growing only thick enough for a walking stick, marked with stripes like a tiger skin, heavy and liable to break like glass when it falls on to things of harder substance.</p>
