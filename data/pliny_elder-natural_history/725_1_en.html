There are quarrels between swans and eagles; between the raven and the golden oriole<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL353_423_a" id="target_note_LCL353_423_a"><sup>a</sup></a> when searching for one another’s eggs by night; similarly between the raven and the kite when the former snatches the latter’s food before he can get it; between crows and owls, the eagle and the gold-crest—if we can believe it, as the eagle is called the king of birds; between owls and the other smaller birds; again birds with land animals—the weasel and the crow, the turtle-dove and the <span class="italic">pyrallis,</span> ichneumon-flies and spiders; the water-birds <span class="italic">brenthos</span> and gull and goshawk and buzzard; shrewmice and herons lying in wait for each other’s young; that very tiny bird the titmouse<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL353_423_b" id="target_note_LCL353_423_b"><sup>b</sup></a> with the ass, which by rubbing itself against thorns for the sake of scratching dislodges the nests of the titmouse, which is so scared that when it merely hears the sound of an ass braying it throws its eggs out of the nest, and the chicks themselves in fear fall out, and consequently the bird flies at the ass and hollows out its sores with its beak; foxes and kites; snakes and weasels and pigs.
