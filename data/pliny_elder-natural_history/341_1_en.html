Priene. At the part of the coast called Troglea is the river Gessus. The district is sacred with all Ionians, and is consequently called Panionia. Next there was formerly a town founded by refugees—as
its name Phygela indicates—and another called Marathesium. Above these places is Magnesia, distinguished by the name of Magnesia on Maeander, an offshoot from Magnesia in Thessaly; it is 15 miles from Ephesus, and 3 miles more from Tralles. It previously had the names of Thessaloche and Androlitia. Being situated on the coast it has appropriated the Derasides islands from the sea.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL352_307_a" id="target_note_LCL352_307_a"><sup>a</sup></a> Inland also is Thyatira, washed by the Lycus; once it was called Pelopian or Euhippian Thyatira.</p>

It is built on the slope of Mount Pion, and is watered by the Cayster, which rises in the Cilbian range and brings down the waters of many streams, and also drains the Pegasaean Marsh, an overflow of the river Phyrites. From these comes a quantity of mud which advances the coastline and has now joined the island of Syrie on to the mainland by the flats interposed. In the city of Ephesus is the spring called Callippia, and a temple of Diana surrounded by two streams, both called Selinus, coming from different directions.</p>
<p>After leaving Ephesus there is another Matium,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL352_307_c" id="target_note_LCL352_307_c"><sup>c</sup></a> which belongs to Colophon, and Colophon itself lying more inland, on the river Halesus. Then the temple of Clarian Apollo, Lebedos—formerly there
