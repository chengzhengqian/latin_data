island reached, a town of the Semberritae, governed by a queen, and another town named Asara; on the second island, the town of Darde; the third island is called Medoë, and the town on it is Asel; the fourth is Garroë, with a town of the same name.

Above is the region of Sirbitum, where the mountain range ends, and which is stated by some writers to be occupied by Ethiopian coast-tribes, the Nisicathae and Nisitae, names that mean ‘men with three’ or ‘with four eyes’—not because they really are like that but because they have a particularly keen sight in using arrows.

Then come regions that are purely imaginary: towards the west are the Nigroi, whose king is said to have only one eye, in his forehead; the Wild-beast-eaters, who live chiefly on the flesh of panthers and lions; the Eatalls, who devour everything; the Man-eaters, whose diet is human flesh; the Dog-milkers, who have dogs’ heads; the Artabatitae,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL352_483_b" id="target_note_LCL352_483_b"><sup>b</sup></a> who have four legs and rove about like wild animals; and then the Hesperioi, the Perorsi and the people we have mentioned as inhabiting<span class="marginNote right">V. 10.</span> the border of Mauretania. One section of the Ethiopians live only on locusts, dried in smoke and salted to keep for a year’s supply of food; these people do not live beyond the age of forty.</p>
