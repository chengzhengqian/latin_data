food. Apion tells us that the largest<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL418_477_a" id="target_note_LCL418_477_a"><sup>a</sup></a> of the fishes is the pig-fish, which the Lacedaemonians call <span class="italic">orthagoriscus,</span>
saying that it grunts when it is caught. That this accident of nature, however (to increase our wonder), is also met with in certain localities, is suggested by a ready example, seeing that salted foods of every kind, as is well known, at Beneventum in Italy have to be resalted.</p>
<p>X. That sea fish were commonly eaten immediately after the foundation of Rome is told us by Cassius Hemina,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL418_477_b" id="target_note_LCL418_477_b"><sup>b</sup></a> whose very words on the subject I will quote here. “Numa ordained that scaleless fish should not be provided at sacrificial meals, being induced by reasons of economy, so that provision could be more easily made for public and private banquets and for feasts of the gods, to prevent caterers on those sacred occasions from being extravagant and buying up the market.”</p>

Coral is also found in the Red Sea, but this is of a darker colour; also in the Persian Gulf—this is called <span class="italic">lace</span>—the
most valued is in the Gallic Gulf around the Stoechades Islands, in the Sicilian Gulf around the Aeolian Islands, and around Drepana. Coral also grows at Graviscae and before Naples in Campania; but that at Erythrae, which is very red indeed,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL418_477_d" id="target_note_LCL418_477_d"><sup>d</sup></a> is soft and therefore thought worthless.</p>
<p>In shape coral is like a shrub, and its colour is green. Its berries are white under the water and soft; when taken out they immediately harden and grow red, being like, in appearance and size, to those of
