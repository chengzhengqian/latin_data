or ‘favourite,’ although we may ask to which colour we should assign a stone bearing a name that is so often bandied about among beautiful objects of different kinds<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_271_a" id="target_note_LCL419_271_a"><sup>a</sup></a> that the mere term has become a guarantee of beauty. However, the species which the name claims as its very own<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_271_b" id="target_note_LCL419_271_b"><sup>b</sup></a> likewise fulfils our great expectations. Here, indeed, with the transparency of the rock-crystal are associated a characteristic sky-green tint, along with a brilliant glint of purple and of golden wine, of which the last colour is always the last to be seen, but always has a purple halo. All these colours, both individually and collectively, seem to pervade the stone; and there is no gemstone that can match its clarity, which is delightfully agreeable to the eye. The most highly valued kind is found in India, where it is known as
‘sangenon,’ while the second-best occurs in Egypt,<span class="marginNote right">§ 84.</span>
where the name used is ‘tenites.’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_271_c" id="target_note_LCL419_271_c"><sup>c</sup></a> Third in order is a variety found in Arabia, but this kind is rough. Then there is the ‘paederos’ from Pontus, which has a weaker lustre, and the kind from Thasos, which is still weaker. Finally, there are the stones of Galatia, Thrace and Cyprus. The defects of the ‘paederos’
are faintness and the intrusion of uncharacteristic colours, as well as those that belong to all other gems.</p>
<p>XLVII. Next among the bright colourless stones<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Asteria.</span></span>
is the ‘asteria,’ or ‘star stone,’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_271_d" id="target_note_LCL419_271_d"><sup>d</sup></a> which holds its high position owing to a natural peculiarity, in that a light is enclosed in it, stored in something resembling the pupil of the eye. This light is transmitted and, as the stone is tilted, is displayed successively in different places, as if capable of locomotion within.
