leather. It is applied to itch scab and leprous sores; if it is boiled with wheat, the decoction when drunk produces an abundance of milk in nurses. The root, famous for many uses, is pounded and taken in doses of two drachmae for snake bite. It removes spots and blotches on the face, freckles, bruises and scars; a decoction in oil is equally efficacious. It is given also in drink for epilepsy, as well as for nervous disorders and giddiness, the daily dose being a drachma by weight for a whole year.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL392_431_a" id="target_note_LCL392_431_a"><sup>a</sup></a> In larger doses, however, even the root itself sometimes disorders the senses.
