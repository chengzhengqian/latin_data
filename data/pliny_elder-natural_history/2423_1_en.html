inscribed in it on earthenware is indelible. When it is burnt it gives off a smell like that of sulphur. What is remarkable is that it is ignited by water and quenched by oil.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_115_a" id="target_note_LCL419_115_a"><sup>a</sup></a> The kindling of jet drives off snakes and relieves suffocation of the uterus. Its fumes detect attempts to simulate a disabling illness or a state of virginity. Moreover, when thoroughly boiled with wine it cures toothache and, if combined with wax, scrofulous tumours. The Magi are said to make use of it in what they call ‘divination by axes’; and they assert it will not burn away completely if a wish is destined to come true.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_115_b" id="target_note_LCL419_115_b"><sup>b</sup></a></p>
<p>XXXV. Sponge stones are found in sponges, and therefore belong to the sea.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_115_c" id="target_note_LCL419_115_c"><sup>c</sup></a> They are sometimes called in Greek ‘stone-solvents’ because they cure affections of the bladder and break up stone in it if they are taken in wine.</p>
<p>XXXVI. Phrygian stone is so called from the people of that name and occurs as porous lumps.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL419_115_d" id="target_note_LCL419_115_d"><sup>d</sup></a> After being soaked in wine it is roasted, and bellows are used to fan it until it turns red, whereupon it is quenched with sweet wine, and the process is repeated three times on each occasion. It is of use only in dyeing garments.</p>
<p>XXXVII. ‘Schistos’ and haematite are closely<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Haematite.</span></span>
related. Haematite is found in mines, and when roasted reproduces the colour of red-lead. It is roasted in the same way as the Phrygian stone, <span class="marginNote right">§ 143.</span>
