The same effects, he said, resulted from taking them in drink and from using them for fomentations. He dropped the juice into foul-smelling ears, and with the juice and old wine made an embrocation for the abdomen. The leaves he applied to fluxes from the eyes. A decoction of it with myrrh and frankincense he prescribed for strangury and bladder troubles. For loosening the bowels, however, or for fever, a handful of the plant should be boiled down to one half in two sextarii of water. This is drunk with the addition of salt and honey, and if the decoction has been made with a pig’s foot or a chicken added, the draught is all the more beneficial. Some have thought that as a purge both kinds should be administered, either by themselves or with mallows added to the decoction.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL393_167_b" id="target_note_LCL393_167_b"><sup>b</sup></a> They purge the abdomen<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL393_167_c" id="target_note_LCL393_167_c"><sup>c</sup></a> and bring away bile, but they are injurious to the stomach.
