<p>VIII. They recommend making dung-heaps in the<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Season for manuring.</span></span>
open air in a hole in the ground made so as to collect moisture, and covering the heaps with straw to prevent
their drying up in the sun, after driving a hard-oak stake into the ground, which will keep snakes from breeding in the dung. It pays extremely well to throw the manure on the ground when a west wind is blowing and during a dry moon; most people misunderstand this and think that it should be done when the west wind is just setting in, and only in February, whereas most crops require manuring in other months also. Whatever time is chosen for the operation, care must be taken to do it when the wind is due west and the moon on the wane and accompanied by dry weather. Such precautions increase the fertilizing effect of manure to a surprising degree.</p>

the principles of climate and soil, we will now describe
the trees that are produced by the care and skill of mankind. There are almost as many varieties of these as there are of those that grow wild, so bountifully have we repaid our debt of gratitude to Nature; for they are produced either from seed or from root-cuttings
or by layering or tearing off a slip or from a cutting or by grafting in an incision in the trunk of a tree. As for the story that at Babylon they plant palm-leaves and produce a tree in that way, I am surprised that Trogus believed it.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL371_41_a" id="target_note_LCL371_41_a"><sup>a</sup></a> Some trees however can be grown by several of the above methods, and some by all of them.</p>
