of Mercury in Capricorn, of the moon in the Bull, at the middle of each, and the points lowest and nearest to the centre of the earth are opposite. The result of this is that they appear to move slower and to be smaller when they are travelling at the highest point of their circuit, but to be larger and travel faster when they have come nearer to the earth, not because they actually accelerate or reduce their natural motions, which are fixed and individual to them, but because lines drawn from the top of the arc to the centre necessarily converge like the spokes of a wheel, and the same motion at one time is perceived as faster and at another slower according to its distance from the centre.</p>
<p>Another reason of their elevations is because they have the points of their arcs highest from their centre in different signs—Saturn in the 20th degree of the Scales, Jupiter in the 15th of the Crab, Mars in the 28th of Capricorn, the sun in the 29th of the Ram, Venus in the 27th of the Fishes, Mercury in the 15th of Virgo, the moon in the 4th of the Bull.</p>
<p>A third explanation of their altitudes is explained by the dimensions of the firmament, not that of a circle, the eye judging them to rise or to sink through the depth of the air.</p>
<p>Linked with this is the cause of the latitudes of<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Orbits of the planets (1) in relation to the zodiac;</span></span> the zodiac and of its obliquity. The stars we have mentioned<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL330_213_a" id="target_note_LCL330_213_a"><sup>a</sup></a> travel through the zodiac, and the only habitable part of the earth is what lies beneath it—all
the other parts towards the poles are frost-bound. Only the planet Venus goes two degrees outside the zodiac; this is understood to be the reason that causes some animals to be born even in the desert places of the world. The moon also wanders through
