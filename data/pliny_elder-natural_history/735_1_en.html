<p>VI. The first foundations are termed by experts<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Three materials.</span></span>

Commosis is the first crust, of a bitter flavour. Pissoceros comes above it,
as in laying on tar, as being more fluid than wax. Propolis is obtained from the milder gum of vines and poplars, and is made of a denser substance by the addition of flowers, and though not as yet wax it serves to strengthen the combs; with it all approaches of cold or damage are blocked, and besides it has itself a heavy scent, being in fact used by most people as a substitute for galbanum.</p>

It is obtained in fig trees—blacker in colour when an east wind is blowing and of better quality and a reddish colour when north winds blow—and in the largest quantity in Greek nut-trees.
