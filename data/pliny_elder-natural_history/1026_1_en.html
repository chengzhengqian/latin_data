acorn-bearing tree the one called the aegilops alone carries strips of dry cloth<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL370_411_a" id="target_note_LCL370_411_a"><sup>a</sup></a> covered with white mossy tufts; this substance not only grows on the bark but hangs down from the branches in streamers eighteen inches long, and it has a strong scent, as we<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">xii. 108.</span><span class="br"></span> said when dealing with perfumes.</p>
<p>The cork is a very small tree, and its acorns are<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Cork-tree.</span></span> very bad in quality and few in number; its only useful product is its bark, which is extremely thick and which when cut grows again; when flattened out it has been known to form a sheet as big as 10 feet square. This bark is used chiefly for ships’ anchor drag-ropes and fishermen’s<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL370_411_b" id="target_note_LCL370_411_b"><sup>b</sup></a> drag-nets and for the bungs of casks, and also to make soles for women’s winter shoes. Consequently the Greek name for the tree is ‘bark-tree,’ which is not inappropriate.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL370_411_c" id="target_note_LCL370_411_c"><sup>c</sup></a> Some people also call it the female holm-oak, and in places where the holm-oak does not grow, for instance in the districts of Elis and Sparta, use cork-tree timber instead of holm-oak, especially for wainwright’s
carpentry. It does not grow all over Italy or anywhere in Gaul.</p>

They employ it for making panniers and baskets, and larger flat receptacles used for carrying corn at harvest-time and grapes at the vintage, and the roof-eaves of cottages.
