difference between the two varieties is this: the former is more prolific but the latter, the Tereus chestnut, of better quality.</p>
<p>XXVII. It is mere accident that by its own ingenuity<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Propagation by planting branches.</span></span>
has devised the remaining kinds of reproduction; it taught us to break off branches from trees and
plant them because stakes driven into the earth had taken root. This method is used to grow many trees, especially the fig, which can be grown in all the other ways except from a cutting; the best plan indeed is to take a comparatively large branch and point it at the end like a stake and drive it deep into the earth, leaving a small head above ground and covering up even this with sand. Pomegranates also are grown from a branch, the passage into the hole having first been widened with stakes; and so also the myrtle; in all of these a branch is used that is three feet long and not so thick as a manâ€™s arm, and the bark is carefully preserved and the trunk<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL371_87_a" id="target_note_LCL371_87_a"><sup>a</sup></a> sharpened to a point at the end.</p>
<p>XXVIII. The myrtle is grown from cuttings as<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Planting cuttings.</span></span>
well as in other ways, and that is the only way used for the mulberry, because superstitious fear of lightning forbids its being grafted on an elm. Consequently we must now speak about the planting of cuttings. In this care must be taken above all that
the cuttings are made from trees that bear well, that they are not bent in shape nor scabbed or forked, that they are thick enough to fill the hand and not less than a foot long, that they are planted without injury to the bark and always with the cut end and the part that was nearest the root downward, and during the process of budding the plant is kept heaped over with earth until it attains strength.</p>
