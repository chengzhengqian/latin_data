<p>XIII. In the Dardanelles there are no islands<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Islands of the Black Sea.</span></span>
that deserve mention belonging to Europe. There are two in the Black Sea, 1½ miles from the European coast and 14 miles from the mouth of the straits, the Fanari, called by others the Symplegades, these being the islands about which there is the tradition that they once clashed together: the story is due to the fact that they are separated by so small a gap that by persons entering the Black Sea directly facing them they were seen as two, and then when the line of sight became slightly oblique they gave the appearance of coming together. On this side of the Danube there is one of the islands<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL352_191_a" id="target_note_LCL352_191_a"><sup>a</sup></a> called Apollonia, 80 miles from the Thracian Bosphorus; from this island Marcus Lucullus brought the statue<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL352_191_b" id="target_note_LCL352_191_b"><sup>b</sup></a> of Apollo of the Capitol. We have stated the places in the Delta of the Danube.<span class="marginNote right">§ 79.</span>
Off the mouth of the Dnieper is the Island of Achilles mentioned above, which also has the Greek<span class="marginNote right">§ 83.</span>
names of the White Island and Island of the Blest. Modern investigation shows the position of this island to be 140 miles from the Dnieper, 120 from the Dniester, and 50 from the island of Peuce. It is about 10 miles in circuit. The remaining islands in the Gulf of Carcinites are Cephalonnesus, Spodusa and Macra. Before we leave the Black Sea, we must not omit the opinion held by many persons that all the waters of the Mediterranean are derived from this source, and not from the Straits of Gibraltar; the reason that they give for this view is not an improbable one—viz. that the tide is always flowing out of the Black Sea and never ebbing in the other direction.</p>
<p>Next we must leave the Black Sea to describe the<span class="marginNote right"><span class="italic">Islands of the Northern Ocean.</span></span>
outer regions of Europe, and crossing the Ripaean
