—never! These stings will not leave my mind sooner than life; he who suffers
will perish more quickly than the suffering itself. If the celestials, to
whom in all things I belong, believe me in this, perchance I shall be deemed
worthy of a little succour and they will change my abode to one free from
the Scythian bow; should I pray for more than that, my lips will be bold
indeed.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">II. To Maximus</span></h3>
<p>Maximus, you who fill out the measure of a mighty name doubling nobility of
birth by that of soul, you for whose birth, though three hundred fell, one
day did not destroy all the Fabii<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL151_271_1" id="target_note_LCL151_271_1"><sup>1</sup></a>—perchance you may
ask by whom this letter is sent and wish to be told who am I that talk with
you. Ah me! what am I to do? I fear that when you read the name you will

shall venture the confession that I have written to you. . . . I, who
admitting that I have deserved a worse punishment, can scarce endure one

native land, peace had been taken from me—enemies who, to double with a
cruel wound the causes of death, smear every dart with viper’s gall.
Equipped with these the horseman circles the frightened walls as a wolf runs
about the fenced sheep. The light bow once bent with its horsehair string
remains with its bonds ever unrelaxed. The roofs bristle with implanted
arrows as if shrouded in a veil, and the gate scarce repels attack with
sturdy bar.</p>
