have been in union with him from his earliest years, finding favour with him
by virtue of a talent that equals your character. Under your guidance as a
speaker he forthwith attains fiery eloquence, in you he has one to lure
forth his words by your own. When you have finished and mortal lips have
become quiet, closed in silence for a short space, then arises the youth
worthy of the Iulean<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL151_345_1" id="target_note_LCL151_345_1"><sup>1</sup></a> name, as rises Lucifer from the eastern
waters, and as he stands in silence, his posture, his countenance are those
of an orator, and his graceful robe gives hope of eloquent words.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL151_345_2" id="target_note_LCL151_345_2"><sup>2</sup></a>
Then after a pause he opens his godlike lips and one might take oath that

worthy of a prince,” such nobility is in his utterance.</p>

touching the very stars with your head, yet you consider the writings of an
exiled bard worthy of consideration. Surely there is some bond of harmony
between kindred spirits, each keeping the compacts that belong to his
pursuit. The peasant loves the farmer, the soldier him who wages war, the
sailor the pilot of the swaying ship. You too are possessed with devotion to
the Pierians, studious one; you, talented yourself, look with favour on my
talent. Our work differs, but it derives from the same sources; we are both
worshippers of liberal art. The thyrsus and laurel tasted by me are foreign
to you;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL151_345_3" id="target_note_LCL151_345_3"><sup>3</sup></a> but we both need fire: as my numbers receive vigour from your
eloquence, so I lend brilliance to your words. </p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL151_345_1"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL151_345_1" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">1</sup><span class="italic">See
