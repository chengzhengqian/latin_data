suited not to be their comrade, but their leader, not to seek an example,
but to offer one. You who admit that I, the exiled one, did naught but
“err,” take pleasure in uprightness and duty for their own sakes. In your
judgment worth is dissevered from reward and is to be sought for herself,
even unaccompanied by outward goods. You think it base to drive away a
friend because he is to be pitied, to forbid him your friendship because he
is ill-starred. ’Tis more merciful to support his weary chin even with a
finger than to thrust the swimmer’s face beneath the clear waves.</p>

involves no little madness. Do you also accept the praise meet for mighty
heroes and, as you are doing, bring what aid you can to one who is fallen.
If I know you well, if even now you are what you used to be, and your
courage has not failed you, the greater Fortune’s rage, the more do you
resist her, taking care, as is fitting, that she does not conquer you; and
your own fight is rendered strong by the strong battling of the foe. Thus
the same thing both helps and injures me. Yea, ’tis an unworthy thing in
your sight, dear youth, to become a companion of the goddess who stands on
the sphere. You are steadfast and since the sails of the battered ship are
not what you would wish, you control them, such as they are. The craft is so
