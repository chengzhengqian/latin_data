have returned, I am no more in a remote land; as of old I am safe in the
midst of the city. I see the faces of the Caesars as I used before to see
them; of this prayer’s fulfilment I have scarce had any hope. I salute the
deity of heaven as I used to do: even should I return, no greater gift, I
think, have you to bestow upon me. What do my eyes lack save only the
Palatine? And that place, if Caesar is removed, will be worthless. As I gaze
on him I seem to look on Rome, for he embodies the likeness of our
fatherland. Am I wrong or do the features of his portrait show anger against
me? Is his form somehow grim and threatening? Spare me, thou who art
mightier in thy virtues than the measureless world, check the reins of thy
just vengeance. Spare me, thou imperishable glory of our age, lord of the
world because of thine own care. By the name of our country which is dearer
to thee than thyself, by the gods who are never deaf to thy prayers, by thy
