<p>thy slender body in my arms say, “Love for me hath wasted thee so,” and amid
mutual tears tell thee of my sufferings, enjoying a talk I have never hoped
for, and offering to the Caesars and the wife who is worthy of Caesar, true
gods, the incense due from my grateful hand. Would that Memnon’s mother,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL151_291_1" id="target_note_LCL151_291_1"><sup>1</sup></a>
when the Prince is softened, might with rosy lips call forth this day as
soon as may be!</p>
<h3><span class="sc">V. To Maximus</span></h3>
<p>’Tis he who was once not last among your friends—’tis Naso, asks you,
Maximus, to read his words. Seek not in them my native wit lest you seem
unaware of my banishment. You see how inactivity spoils an idle body, how
water acquires a taint unless it is in motion. For me, too, whatever skill I
had in shaping song is failing, diminished by inactive sloth. Even this that
you read, Maximus, if in anything you believe me, I write forcing it with
difficulty from an unwilling hand. There is no pleasure in straining the
mind to such a task, nor does the Muse come at one’s call to the stern
Getae. Yet, as you see, I am struggling to weave verses, but the fabric is
not softer than my fate. When I read it over I am ashamed of my work because
I note many a thing that even in my own, the maker’s judgment, deserves to
be erased. Yet I do not correct it. This is a greater labour than the
writing, and my sick mind has not the power to endure anything hard. Am I
forsooth to use the file more bitingly, subjecting single words to
criticism? Does fortune indeed </p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL151_291_1"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL151_291_1" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">1</sup>Aurora.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL151_291_1').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
