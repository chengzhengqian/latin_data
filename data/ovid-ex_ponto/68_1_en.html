is yours, for you have a noble breast, with the candour of Hercules.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL151_399_1" id="target_note_LCL151_399_1"><sup>1</sup></a>
Envy, the vice of cowardice, enters not into lofty character, but creeps
like a hidden snake along the ground. Your mind towers aloft above even your
birth, for your name is not greater than your character. So let others
injure the wretched and desire to be feared; let them carry missiles dipped
in corroding poison; your house at least is used to assisting suppliants. In
their number, I beseech you, count me also.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">IV. To Rufinus</span></h3>
<p>These words that bring no empty greeting your Naso sends from the town of
Tomis, and he entrusts to you the fostering of his “Triumph,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL151_399_2" id="target_note_LCL151_399_2"><sup>2</sup></a>
Rufinus, if after all it has reached your hands. ’Tis a humble work, not
equal to your preparations,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL151_399_3" id="target_note_LCL151_399_3"><sup>3</sup></a> yet such as it
is, he requests for it your guardianship. Strong things have powers of their
own, and need no Machaon<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL151_399_4" id="target_note_LCL151_399_4"><sup>4</sup></a>; the sick man in his danger has recourse to
the art of healing. Great poets need no favouring reader: they hold even the
unwilling or him who is hard to please. I, whose talent has been diminished
by long sorrows—or perhaps even of old I had no talent—weakened now, am
strong in your generosity; if you take that from me, I should deem all else
torn away. And though all my work rests upon kindly favour, that poem has a
special right of indulgence. </p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL151_399_1"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL151_399_1" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">1</sup>The Fabii claimed
