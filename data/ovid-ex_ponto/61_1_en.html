<p>The “Health,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL151_385_1" id="target_note_LCL151_385_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Cotta, of my sending which you read here, may
it, I pray, be sent in truth and reach you. For your weal takes away much
from my sufferings, causing a good part of me to be well. When many fall
away and abandon the storm-blown sails, you remain the sole anchor of the
shattered bark. Grateful, therefore, is your loyalty. I pardon those who
along with Fortune have betaken themselves to flight. Though they smite but
one, not one alone do the lightnings affright, and the throng around the
stricken ever quakes with fear. When a wall has given warning of its coming
fall, anxiety and fear empty the place. What timid man does not avoid
contact with the sick, fearing lest he contract a disease so near? I too
because of the excessive dread and alarm of my friends, not because of their
hatred, was abandoned by some. They lacked not loyalty, nor the will to
duty; they dreaded the hostile gods. They can be deemed too cautious and
timid, yet they have not deserved to be called wicked. Or else my charity
pardons friends who are dear to me and favours them so much that from me
they bear no blame. Let them be content with this indulgence and they shall
be free to boast that their act is justified even by my testimony.</p>
