Thou knowest there is another thing that has injured thee more. Whatever
this is (for neither should the painful tale itself be repeated nor canst
thou say that thou art free from guilt), though <span class="italic">thou</span>

every altar burns with fragrant flames, while the holy temple affords an
easy approach, we may hope that our prayers can have some effect.”</p>
