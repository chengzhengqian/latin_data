<p>O sea first lashed by Jason’s oars, O land never free from cruel enemies and
snows, will a time ever come when I, Naso, shall leave you, bidden to an
exile in a place less hostile? Or must I ever live in such a barbaric land,
am I destined to be laid in my grave in the soil of Tomis? With peace from
thee<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL151_373_1" id="target_note_LCL151_373_1"><sup>1</sup></a>—if any peace thou hast—O land of Pontus, ever
trodden by the swift horses of a neighbouring foe,—with peace from thee
would I say: thou art the worse element in my hard exile, thou dost increase
the weight of my misfortunes. Thou neither feelest spring girt with wreaths
of flowers nor beholdest the reaper’s naked bodies; to thee autumn extends
no clusters of grapes; but all seasons are in the grip of excessive cold.
Thou holdest the flood ice-bound, and in the sea the fishes often swim in
water enclosed beneath a roof. Thou hast no springs except those almost of
sea water; quaff them, and doubt whether thirst is allayed or increased.
Seldom is there a tree—and that unproductive—rising in the open fields, and
the land is but the sea </p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL151_373_1"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL151_373_1" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">1</sup>A bitter pun on the literal meaning of <span class="italic">pax</span> and
