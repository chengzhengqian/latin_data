save the evils of a bitter country and to pray that I may die in a
pleasanter region? I write so often of the same things that scarce any
listen, and my words, which they feign not to understand, are without
result. And yet the words are always the same, I have not written to the
same persons: my cry, always the same, seeks aid through many. Should I—that
some reader might not twice find the same sense—petition you alone, Brutus,
among my friends? It was not worth the price; pardon the confession, ye men
of taste! Cheaper in my eyes is the reputation of my work than my own weal.
In fine though he himself may have fashioned the subject, the poet
introduces many a variation when led by his judgement. My Muse is but too
true an index of my misfortunes; she has all the weight of an incorruptible
witness. Not to produce a book, but to send a letter to each has been the
object of my care. Later I collected them and put them together somehow,
without order—not to have you think perchance that for this work I have made
selections. Grant indulgence to my writings, for their purpose has been not
my renown but my advantage, and to do homage to others.</p>
