recognize my features should you see them, and you would ask what has become
of my former colour. But little vigour pervades my emaciated limbs; I am
paler than fresh wax. These troubles I have not brought upon myself by
immoderate drinking—you know that water is almost my only drink—nor do I
overload myself with food; even if I had a passion for it, there is no
opportunity in the Getic country. My strength is not impaired by Venus’
ruinous passion; she is not wont to approach the couch of sorrow. ’Tis the
water and the country that injure me together with a cause still
stronger—the mental worry which ever attends me.</p>

mitigating this worry, scarce would my mind have borne the burden of my
sorrow. You are like a kindly land to a shattered boat; you bring me the aid
which many deny. Give it me always, I beseech you, for I shall always need
it as long as divine Caesar shall feel anger against me. That he may lessen,
not end, his deserved wrath, let each of you as suppliants implore your
gods.</p>
