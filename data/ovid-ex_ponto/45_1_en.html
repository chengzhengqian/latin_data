already become a habit; as the falling drops by their constant force hollow
the rock, so am I wounded by the steady blows of fate until now I have
scarce space upon me for a new wound. The ploughshare is not more thinned by
constant use, the Appia<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL151_353_1" id="target_note_LCL151_353_1"><sup>1</sup></a> more worn by the curving wheels than my heart
