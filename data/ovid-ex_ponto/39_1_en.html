side, every portico, every street; the hollow theatre found us in adjoining
seats. In short our affection, dear friend, was always as strong as that of
the scions of Aeacus and Nestor. Not even were you drinking draughts of
care-dispelling Lethe, could I believe that all this could fall from your
heart. Sooner shall the long days come to pass in winter, sooner shall the
nights of summer be longer than those of winter, Babylon have no heat,
Pontus no cold, sooner shall the lily surpass the Paestan rose in perfume
than you shall forget your relations with me. Not so black is any part of my
fate. But beware lest this trust of mine be called fallacious or my belief
foolish; with steadfast faith defend your old comrade in what way you can
and in so far as I shall not be burdensome.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">V. To Salanius</span></h3>
<p>A poem framed in unequal numbers I, Naso, send to my Salanus, prefaced by a
wish for his weal. May this be so, I earnestly desire, and I pray that you,
my friend, to prove the omen in fact, may be able to read it safe and sound.
Your noble nature, a thing almost at the point of death in this age,
requires such prayer from me. For though I was joined to you by only
moderate association, they say that you have grieved over my exile; when you
read verses sent from the Euxine Pontus. your kindness helped them whatever
their worth; you wished Caesarâ€™s health and a relaxation of his anger
against me, a wish, that if he knew, he would yet permit. To your character
was due so kind a wish, and it is none the less pleasing </p></section><notes></notes></section>
