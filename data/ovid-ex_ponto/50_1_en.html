This thou hast in common with a god: that ye are both wont to aid your
petitioners. Will there be any reason for us to grant their usual honour to
the gods, if one robs them of their will to help? If Jupiter should turn
deaf ears to prayer, why should a victim fall in sacrifice before Jupiter’s
temple? If the sea should offer no calm for my journey, why should I offer
vain incense to Neptune? Should she cheat the ineffectual prayers of the
toiling husbandman, why should Ceres receive the entrails of a gravid sow?
The goat will not offer his throat in sacrifice to unshorn Bacchus, if no
must flows from beneath the tread of feet. We pray that Caesar may guide the
reins of the empire because he plans so wisely for his fatherland!</p>

gods, if each bestows in favour his own peculiar aid. Do thou also avail him
who lies within thy camp, Cotys, son worthy of thy father. ’Tis a fitting
pleasure for man to save man; there is no better way of seeking favour. Who
does not curse Antiphates the Laestrygonian? Who disapproves the character
of generous Alcinous? Thou hast for a father no Cassandrean<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL151_363_1" id="target_note_LCL151_363_1"><sup>1</sup></a> or man of

with defeat in arms, was yet never fond of blood when peace was made. Note
too that a faithful study of the liberal arts humanizes character and
permits it not to be cruel. No king has been better trained by them or given
more time to humane studies. Thy verse </p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL151_363_1"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL151_363_1" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">1</sup>Apollodorus of Cassandrea, a cruel
