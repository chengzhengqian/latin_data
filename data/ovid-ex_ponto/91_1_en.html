that none would recognize in them your real nature. But if you see any
injured by unjust Fortune, no woman is more tender than your heart. This I
felt above all when the most of my friends denied knowledge of me. I shall
forget them, but you I shall never forget, who lighten the woes of my
trouble. Sooner shall the Hister, all too near me, turn his march back from
the Euxine sea towards its source and, as if the age of Thyestean
banquets<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL151_444_1" id="target_note_LCL151_444_1"><sup>1</sup></a> should return, the chariot of the sun shall
sooner be driven towards the eastern waters than that any one of you who
have mourned my exile shall call me a forgetful ingrate.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">VII. To Vestalis</span></h3>
<p>Seeing that you have been sent to the Euxine waters, Vestalis, to dispense
justice to those lands which lie beneath the pole, you behold face to face
in what manner of country I am cast and you will bear witness that I am not
wont to utter false complaints. My words will receive through you, young
scion of Alpine kings, no idle support. You yourself see the Pontus stiffen
with ice, you yourself see the wine standing rigid with the frost; you
yourself see how the fierce Iazygian herdsman guides his loaded wagon over
the middle of Histerâ€™s waters. You behold how poison is hurled on the barbed
steel and the missile possesses two causes of death. And would that this
region had merely met your sight, that you had not also experienced it, in a
battle of your own! </p></section><notes></notes></section>
