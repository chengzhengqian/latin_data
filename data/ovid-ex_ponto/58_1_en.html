confess the truth, some return is owed to my services. That return thou dost
indeed make to me with usury, nor could rumour, even if she should wish,

the canvasser for my misfortunes. Toil that I may rest in a less hostile
region and no part of thy duty will halt. Great is my request, yet not one
that brings odium on the petitioner; shouldst thou not attain it, thy defeat
