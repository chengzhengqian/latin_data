your pursuit and you believe that the rites of our common warfare should be
preserved. Therefore may the friend through whom you win esteem remain, I
pray, yours unto the last moment of your life, and may he come to the
control of the world with his own reins. This is at once my prayer and that
of the people.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">VI. To Graecinus</span></h3>
<p>In verse, Graecinus, that Naso who used to greet you face to face in spoken
words, greets you sadly from the Euxine waters. An exile’s voice is this;
letters furnish me a tongue, and if I may not write, I shall be dumb.</p>
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span><p>You reprove as in duty bound the sins of your
foolish friend, showing me that the evils that I suffer are less than my
deserts. You are right, but too late is your reproof of my fault: relax the
harshness of your words for an accused who has confessed. At the time when I
could have passed Ceraunia with standing sails, so as to avoid the cruel
reefs, then it was that I should have had your warning. Now after my
shipwreck how does it profit me to learn what course my bark should have
run? Rather extend an arm to the weary swimmer’s grasp; repent not of
supporting his chin with your hand. That you are doing and, I pray, will
continue to do: so may your mother and wife, so may your brothers and all
your house be free from harm, and—as you are wont to pray with heart, with
voice—so for all your acts may you find the Caesars’ approval. It will be
shame </p></section><notes></notes></section>
