Caspian, if we may believe the native tale, founded it and gave it his own
name. The wild Getae took it after they had destroyed the Odrysii in a
warfare of surprise, and raised their arms against the king. He, mindful of
the mighty race which his own valour enhances, at once approached with a
following of countless warriors. Nor did he depart until with deserved
slaughter of the guilty [he beat down the presumptuous spirit of the
people.] May it be granted thee, bravest monarch of our time, ever to sway
the sceptre with thy honoured hand. Mayst thou, even as she grants it
now—for what fuller prayer could I make for thee—find approval with warlike
Rome along with mighty Caesar.</p>

I complain of the addition of cruel warfare to my misfortunes. Since I have
been separated from you, thrust down to the very shores of the Styx, the
rising of the Pleiads is now bringing on the fourth autumn. Yet believe not
thou that ’tis the joys of city life that Naso seeks—and yet even them he
seeks—for at times I have memories of you, my pleasant friends, at times
thoughts of my daughter and my dear wife steal over me, and from my own
house I am once again visiting the localities of the beautiful town, my mind
surveying everything with eyes of its own. Now the fora, now the temples,
now the theatres sheathed in marble, now every portico with its levelled
ground comes before me; now the greensward of the Campus that looks towards
the lovely gardens, the pools, the canals, and the water of the Virgo.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL151_307_1" id="target_note_LCL151_307_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
