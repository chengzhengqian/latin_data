<p>Whence comes the letter that you read, you ask? From this place where Hister
unites with the blue waves. Soon as the place is named the writer too should
come before you—he whose own talent injured him, Naso the poet. To you,

vouchsafed to hear them at their delivery, and to enjoy utterance so
eloquent! For albeit water that is brought to one tastes sweet, more
grateful is that which is drunk from the spring itself. </p></section><notes></notes></section>
