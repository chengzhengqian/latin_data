<section class="div1 language" lang="en"><header><hgroup><h1>Ex Ponto, II</h1></hgroup></header><section class="div2"><p class="noindent">The fish once wounded by the treacherous hook
fancies the barbed bronze concealed in every bit of food. Ofttimes the lamb
flees the distant sight of a dog in the belief that it is a wolf,
unwittingly avoiding its own protector. A wounded body shrinks from even a
delicate touch; an empty shadow inspires the anxious with fear. So I,
pierced by the unjust shafts of Fortune, fashion in my breast naught but
gloomy thoughts. Already it is clear to me that fate, keeping the course
begun, will continue always to run in a familiar path; the gods are watching
that no kind concession be made me and I think Fortune can scarcely be
cheated. She is working to destroy me—she who used to be fickle, is now
steadfastly and with determination injuring me. O believe, if I have been
known to you as a speaker of truth, (and it cannot be that my misfortunes
involve fraud,)<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL151_351_1" id="target_note_LCL151_351_1"><sup>1</sup></a> you will more quickly count the ears of a
crop by the Cinyphus, or the many blooms of thyme upon lofty Hybla, or count
the number of birds floating in air on vibrant wings or the fishes swimming
in the waters, than reckon the sum of woes I have borne on land, on sea.</p>
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">31</span><span class="br"></span><p>No race in the wide world is grimmer than the
Getae, yet they have lamented over my misfortunes. Should I attempt to a
full record of them in verse, there will be a long Iliad of my fate. I fear,
therefore, not that I think I need have fear of you of whose love I have
received a thousand pledges, but because every unfortunate is a thing full
of fear, because for a long time the door of joy has been closed for me.
