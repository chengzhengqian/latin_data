Enceladus and aroused war against the gods who rule the world; I have not,
like the rash hand of Tydeus’ son,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL151_325_1" id="target_note_LCL151_325_1"><sup>1</sup></a> aimed my spear
against the gods. My fault is heavy, but ’tis one which has dared to destroy
me alone, attempting no greater crime. No term save “senseless” and “timid”
can be applied to me; these are the two true words for my soul. It is
indeed, I admit, after I deserved Caesar’s anger, with justice that you are
hard to my entreaties; such is your devotion to all of the Iulean<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL151_325_2" id="target_note_LCL151_325_2"><sup>2</sup></a>

not through calm waters that my bark sails. Let safety be the quest of
others; uttermost misery is safe, for it lacks fear of an outcome still

stretches out his arms and grasps at thorns and hard rocks; in fear of the
hawk a bird on trembling wings ventures in weariness to come to man’s
protection; the doe hesitates not to trust herself to a house hard by when
