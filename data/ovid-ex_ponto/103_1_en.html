Pedo, what profit there has been in speaking so precisely, I would say, “I

Isthmos scarce passable for anyone, but you must show your love, a thing not
hard for one who has the wish. Is it so difficult to refrain from outraging

must not think that these words have been uttered by a complaining
tongue.</p>

smitten by the divine spear, bathed my wounds with your tears. </p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL151_469_1"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL151_469_1" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">1</sup>The robbers on the
