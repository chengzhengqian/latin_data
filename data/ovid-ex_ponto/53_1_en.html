greater part of a quickly gliding year—alas! how unlike that land to this of
the Getae! and how small a part are these of the things that we saw together
while you made every road pleasant for me! Whether we furrowed the blue
waves in a gaily painted boat or drove in a swift-wheeled carriage, often
the way seemed short through our interchange of talk, and our words, could
you count them, outnumbered our steps; often the day was not long enough for
our talk—even the long hours of summer did not suffice. ’Tis something to
have feared together the perils of the sea, together to have paid our vows
to the water gods, to have done deeds in common and again after those deeds
to be free to utter jests which bring no shame. When these thoughts steal
upon you, absent though I be, I shall be before your eyes as if you had just
seen me. And as for me, though I dwell beneath the pivot of the heavens
which is ever high above the clear waters yet I behold you in my heart—my
only way—and often talk with you beneath the icy axle.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL151_369_1" id="target_note_LCL151_369_1"><sup>1</sup></a> You are here and
know it not, you are full often by my side though far away, and you come at
my bidding from the midst of the city to the land of the Getae. Make me
recompense, and since yours is the happier land, there keep me ever in a
remembering heart.</p>

<p>This work, Rufus, hastily composed in a brief space, Naso sends to you—Naso,
the author of the ill-starred “Art”—that despite our separation by the whole
world’s width you may know that I remember you.</p>
