name, I should deny that a Thracian youth was the composer; and that beneath
this sky Orpheus might not be the only bard, by thy talent is the Bistonian
land made proud. As thou hast the courage, when need arises, to take arms
and stain thy hand with enemy’s blood, and as thou hast been trained to hurl
the javelin with a sweep of thine arm, or to guide the neck of the swift
horse, so when just time has been given to thy sire’s pursuits and the task
testing thy might in all its parts has come to rest, that thy leisure may
not waste away in idle sleep, thou dost press on the Pierian path towards
the bright stars.</p>

thee: each is a worshipper at the same shrine. As bard to bard I extend my
arms in prayer that thy land may be loyal to me in exile. I was not guilty
of murder when I came to Pontus’ shores, no baneful poison was mixed by my
hand; my seal was not convicted by a fraudulent tablet of having imprinted
on the linen<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL151_365_1" id="target_note_LCL151_365_1"><sup>1</sup></a> a lying mark. I have done naught that the law
forbids. Yet must I confess a weightier sin. Ask not what it is. But I have
composed a foolish “Art”; ’tis this prevents my hands from being clean. Have
I sinned further? Do not inquire—that my wrongdoing may hide beneath my
“Art” alone. Whatever it is, the avenger’s wrath was moderate. He took from
me nothing but my native land. Since I am deprived of that, let now thy
nearness warrant that I can be secure in a place I hate.</p>
