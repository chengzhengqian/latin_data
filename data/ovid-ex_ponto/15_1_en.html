Lixus flow into the Hebrus and Athos add leaves to the Alps? One must spare
a soul that has a wretched wound; oxen withdraw their chafed necks from a
burden. “But,” I suppose, “a reward is at hand, the most justifiable reason
for toil, and the field is returning the seed with much usury!” To the

devoted to sleep what hours my frame demands, how am I to spend the long
period of wakefulness? Forgetting the ways of my native land shall I learn
