<h3><span class="sc">VII. To Messalinus</span></h3>
<p>Letters, instead of spoken words, Messalinus, have brought you the greeting
which you read all the way from the fierce Getae. Is the place a token of
the author? Or unless you have read the name are you unaware that I who
write these words am Naso? Does any one of your friends except myself—who
pray that I am your friend—lie at the very edge of the world? May the gods
will that all who show you respect and love may have no knowledge of this
race! Enough that <span class="italic">I</span> should live midst ice and
Scythian arrows—if a kind of death must be considered life. Let me be hard
pressed by war on the earth or by the chill of heaven, the wild Getae
fighting with arms and the winter with its hail; let me be held in a country
that produces neither fruit nor grape, that has no side free from an enemy:
but safe be all the other throng of your clients, among whom, as mid a host,
I was but one of many. Alas for me if you take offence at such words as
these and deny that I have been connected with you in any respect. For even
though that were true, you ought to pardon my falsehood; your praise loses
nothing through this boast of mine. What acquaintance of the Caesars does
not imagine himself a friend! Pardon one who is worn out; to me you have
ever been a Caesar. And yet I do not force my way where I am not allowed to
go, and ’tis enough if you do not deny that your halls were open to me.
