my sin, by condoning my original mistake, to lie unnoticed, you take thought
of your old friend in his misfortunes, you soothe and help my wounds. For
this, should full petition be granted me, I should invoke a thousand
blessings upon you for your kindly service, but if I be allowed only your
own vows, I will pray, after Caesar’s weal, for that of your mother. This,
when you enriched the altar with incense, you were wont to ask first of all,
I remember, of the gods.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">IV. To Atticus</span></h3>
<p>Let Naso converse with you from the freezing Hister, Atticus, friend whom my
judgment should not doubt. Do you still remain at all mindful of your
unhappy friend or has your regard grown weak and abandoned its rôle? The
gods are not so harsh to me that I can believe and deem it just that you no
longer think of me. Before my eyes your image ever stands; I seem in thought
to see your features. I recall many serious talks that we have had and not a
few hours given over to pleasant jest. Oft did the hours seem too swift for
our long talks, oft the day was too short for my words. Oft came to your
ears a poem I had just composed; a new effort was subjected to your
criticism. What you had praised I considered had already pleased the public;
this was the pleasant reward of my latest efforts. To have my book touched
by the file of a friend I have more than once made an erasure at your
suggestion. </p></section><notes></notes></section>
