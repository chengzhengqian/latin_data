faulty, for I am almost a Getic poet. Ah! it brings me shame! I have even
written a poem in the Getic tongue, setting barbarian words to our measures:
I even found favour—congratulate me!—and began to achieve among the
uncivilized Getae the name of poet. You ask my theme? you would praise it: I
sang of Caesar. My novel attempt was aided by the god’s will. For I told how
