something of greater import, put off thy purpose and beware of ruining my
hope through haste. Nor again do I bid thee seek a time when she is wholly
idle—she scarce has leisure for the care of her own person …<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL151_383_1" id="target_note_LCL151_383_1"><sup>1</sup></a> thou too

countenance of Juno, see that thou dost maintain the part thou hast to play.
Defend not my deed: an ill cause admits no speech. Let thy words be naught
but sorrowing petitions. Then must thou release the barrier of tears, sink
to the earth, and stretch forth thy arms towards those immortal feet. Then
ask nothing except that I may withdraw from the neighbourhood of a fierce
enemy; let Fortune for me be enemy enough. More comes into my mind, but
confused with fear even this thou wilt scarce be able to utter with
stammering voice. This I think will not harm thee. She will perceive thy
dread of her majesty and if thy words are broken by sobbing it will do no
harm; for tears sometimes have the weight of spoken words.</p>

an enterprise and a suitable hour and favouring omens. But first kindle a
fire upon the holy altar, offer incense and pure wine to the great gods. Of
them all and before all worship the deity of Augustus, his loyal offspring
and his consort. May they be propitious to thee in their wonted fashion, and
view thy tears with kindly countenances.</p>
