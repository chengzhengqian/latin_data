<section class="div1 language" lang="en"><header><hgroup><h1>Ex Ponto, II</h1></hgroup></header><section class="div2"><p class="noindent">the request of your famed father whom I
worshipped from my earliest youth, if his shade, still eloquent, has aught
of sentience. This is the request of your brother too, though perchance he
may fear that care in saving me may bring you harm. All your house ask this,
nor can you yourself say that I too was not once a member of your throng. At
least my talent, which, as I have learned to feel, I have used but ill, was
oft, except only my “Art,” the subject of your praise. Nor can my life, so
you but take away its latest sins, bring shame upon your house. So,
therefore, may the home of your race thrive, so may those above, together
with the Caesars, watch over you—on condition that you implore that deity,
so merciful yet justly angry with me, to remove me from the wildness of the
Scythian land. ’Tis hard, I admit, yet virtue aims at what is hard, and
gratitude for such a service will be all the greater. No Polyphemus in the
lonely caverns of Aetna, no Antiphates will receive your words, but a calm
and lenient father ready to pardon, who often thunders without the aid of
the fiery lightning, who after a harsh decision is himself saddened, who
usually lays a penalty upon himself whenever he exacts one. Yet his mercy
was defeated by my fault, his wrath by compulsion reached its full strength.
But I am separated from my country by the whole world’s span, I cannot throw
myself before the deity’s feet. You worship him: be my priest and carry to
him my message, but add your own prayers to my words. Yet try this only if
you feel it will not injure me. Pardon! I am a shipwrecked man who fears
every sea.</p>
