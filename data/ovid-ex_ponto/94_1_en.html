<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">21</span><span class="br"></span><p>Do you, if you hope that anything can be
accomplished by petition, beseech with a suppliant’s prayer the gods you
worship. Your gods are—the young Caesar.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL151_451_1" id="target_note_LCL151_451_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Propitiate your
divinity. No altar surely is more familiar to you than this. That altar
never permits the supplications of its priest to be in vain: seek from it
succour for my fate. No matter how slight the breeze with which it aids me,
my bark now o’erwhelmed will rise once more from the midst of the waters.
Then will I offer to the devouring flames holy incense bearing witness to
the power of the divinity. I will rear no temple of Parian marble for thee,
Germanicus; that disaster tore away my wealth; temples will be built for
thee and thine by rich houses and cities; Naso will show gratitude with
verse, his only wealth. Poor indeed, I confess, is the gift that is rendered
for great service, if I give words in return for the grant of salvation. But
he who gives his utmost, is lavishly grateful and that loyal service has
reached its goal. The incense offered by the poor man from his humble censer
has not less effect than that given from a huge platter. The nursling lamb
as well as the victim fed on Faliscan grass dyes in sacrifice the Tarpeian
altar. Yet than the proffered tribute of poets’ verse naught else more
befits the leaders of men. Verse heralds abroad your praises and sees to it
that the glory of your deeds falls not to the ground. By verse virtue lives
on and, avoiding the tomb, becomes known to late posterity. Wasting time
consumes both steel and stone; no thing has a strength greater than that </p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL151_451_1"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL151_451_1" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">1</sup>Germanicus.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL151_451_1').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
