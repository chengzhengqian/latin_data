son<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL151_289_1" id="target_note_LCL151_289_1"><sup>1</sup></a> of Aeson, because he came to this region, receives from late
posterity. Yet his toil was lighter and smaller than mine, if only mighty
names do not keep down the truth. He set forth to Pontus dispatched by
Pelias who was scarce dreaded as far as the bounds of Thessaly. Caesar’s
anger wrought my ruin at whom the world of sunrise and of sunset alike
tremble. Haemonia is closer to ill-omened Pontus than Rome, and he completed
a shorter journey than I. He had as comrades the leaders of the Achaean
land, but I was abandoned of all on my journey. In a frail bark I ploughed
the vast sea; the one that carried Aeson’s son was a staunch ship. I had no

Juno; no deities defended my life. He was aided by the wily arts of Cupid;
would that Love had not learned them from me! He came back to his home; I
shall die in this land, if the weighty wrath of the injured god persists.
Harder then is my task, my faithful wife, than that which Aeson’s son
endured.</p>
