<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">49</span><span class="br"></span><p>Divine power plays with human affairs, and
sure trust can scarce be placed in the present hour. If anybody had said to
me, “You shall go to the Euxine shore and you shall fear wounds from a Getic
bow,” I would have said, “Go, drink a potion that clears the
brain—everything that Anticyra<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL151_435_1" id="target_note_LCL151_435_1"><sup>1</sup></a> produces.” Yet
have I suffered this. Though I might have guarded against the weapons of
mortals, yet I could not protect myself against those of a supreme god. See
that you too feel afraid and remember that what seems happiness to you has
power, while you speak, to change into sorrow.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">IV. To Sextus Pompeius</span></h3>
<p>No day is so drenching wet from the southern clouds that the rain pours in
uninterrupted flood. No place is so barren that it has no useful plant,
ofttimes intermixed with the tough brambles. Heavy fortune has rendered
nothing so wretched that no joys lessen in some part its sorrow. Behold how
I, reft from home and country and the sight of my own, driven like a wreck
to the waters of the Getic land, have yet found means to brighten my face
and to forget my fate. For as I strolled alone upon the yellow sand, behind
me, it seemed, wings rustled. I looked back; there was no form that I could
see, but my ear caught these words, “Lo, I come to bear thee a message of
gladness; I am Report, and I have flown through measureless distances of
air. Through the consulship of Pompey, who is dearer to you than any other,
the coming year will be bright and blessed.” </p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL151_435_1"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL151_435_1" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">1</sup>Anticyra produced an abundance of hellebore
