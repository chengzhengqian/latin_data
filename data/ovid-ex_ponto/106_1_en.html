<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">39</span><span class="br"></span><p>Only do you—by the gods of whom He is most
trustworthy under whose lead your honour has steadilyincreased—see to it by
watching over an exile with steadfast devotion that the breeze of hope does
not forsake my bark. What are my directions, you ask? May I die if it is not
hard to say—if only he who is already dead can die. I find nothing to do or
to wish or not wish, nor do I quite know what is to my advantage. Believe
me, foresight is the first thing to abandon the wretched, and along with
fortune sense and reason flee. Seek in person, I beg you, how you ought to
aid me, and over what shallows you may construct a way to accomplish my
wishes.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">XIII. To Carus</span></h3>
<p>To you who must be counted among my undoubted friends—to you who are in very
truth what you are called, Carus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL151_475_1" id="target_note_LCL151_475_1"><sup>1</sup></a>—greetings The
source of this salutation, the tone of this letter and the structure of the
verse can tell you, not that it is excellent, but ’tis at least not
commonplace; for whatever be its merit, ’tis clear to see that it is mine.
I, too, though you should tear the title from the head of your pages, could
tell, I think, what work is yours. No matter how many the books among which
you may be placed you will be recognized, discovered by signs I have
observed. The author will be betrayed by the vigour which we know to be
worthy of Hercules and suited to him of whom you yourself sing. My Muse too,
detected by her own complexion, can perhaps be distinguished by her very
blemishes. Ugliness prevented Thersites from escaping notice as much as
beauty made Nireus conspicuous.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL151_474_2" id="target_note_LCL151_474_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
