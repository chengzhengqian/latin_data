neither leaf nor tree, and that lifeless winter without break runs into
winter. Here am I fighting with cold, with arrows, with my own fate, in the
weariness of the fourth winter. My tears are limitless save when a lethargy
checks them, and a deathlike stupor possesses my breast. Happy Niobe, though
she saw so many deaths, for she lost the ability to feel pain when she was

happier dream, I behold the buildings of the native city I have left, I hold
