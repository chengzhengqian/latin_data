May the gods grant that at some moment my name may come into your mind, that
you may say, “Alas! what is that miserable man doing now?” If such words of
yours be reported to me by any, I shall at once confess that my exile is
easier to bear.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">V. To Sextus Pompeius</span></h3>
<p>On! light couplets, to the consul’s learned ears, and bear a message for the
honoured man to read. Long is the way, nor do you advance with even steps,
and a mantle of winter snow conceals the land. Crossing frozen Thrace with
Haemus hidden in clouds and the waters of the Ionian sea, on the tenth day
or before you will reach the imperial city though you make no hurried
journey. Forthwith then seek the house of Pompeius; none is closer to the
forum of Augustus. If any, as may happen in the crowd, asks who you are and
whence you come, beguile his ear with any name you will. For even though it
should be safe, as I think it is, to make confession, surely fictitious
words involve less danger. Nor will you have the power unhindered to see the
consul, even though you reach the threshold: either he will be ruling his
citizens by the law’s word while he sits high upon an ivory chair splendid
with carving, or beside the implanted spear<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL151_438_1" id="target_note_LCL151_438_1"><sup>1</sup></a> he will be
ordering the people’s revenues, not allowing the wealth of the mighty city
to suffer loss; or when the fathers have been summoned to Julius’s temple,
he will be debating matters worthy of a great consul; or he will be bringing
to Augustus and his son the accustomed greeting, seeking advice about an
unfamiliar duty. </p></section><notes></notes></section>
