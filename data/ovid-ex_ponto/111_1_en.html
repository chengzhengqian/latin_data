lands, an estate dear to your eyes, or whatever you hold by inheritance,
Sextus, or by purchase, so am I yours, and by reason of this sad gift you
cannot say that you own naught in the Pontus. Would that you could and that
a more pleasant estate might be given you, that you might establish your
property in a better place! Since this rests with the gods, try to soften by
prayer those deities whom you worship with constant devotion. For ’tis hard
to distinguish whether you are more the proof of my mistake or the
relief.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL151_485_1" id="target_note_LCL151_485_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">27</span><span class="br"></span><p>Nor do I plead because I doubt; but oft adown
the stream the oars hasten the voyage over the flowing waters. I feel shame
and apprehension always to be making the same request, lest your heart grow
justly weary. But what am I to do? My desire is measureless. Pardon my
fault, gentle friend. Though I often wish to write in a different vein, I
pass imperceptibly to the same theme; my very letters of their own accord
seek the opportunity. Yet whether your influence shall win its end or
whether a cruel fate bids me die beneath the freezing pole, I shall always
recall your services with unforgetting heart and my land shall hear that I
belong to you. It shall be heard by every land under any sky—if only my Muse
passes the confines of the wild Getae—that you are the cause and saviour of
my weal; that I am yours almost as if the scales and bronze had bought
me.</p>
