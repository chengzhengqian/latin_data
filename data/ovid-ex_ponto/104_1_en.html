ravished friend you had felt no further blow to stir lament. Not so has it
pleased the gods, for in their cruelty they have not thought it wrong to
despoil you of your pure wife. I have but just received a letter which told
me your sorrow, and I read of your loss with tears. But I should not venture
in folly to console one who is wiser than I, to repeat to you the familiar
words of the wise men; your grief has been for some time ended, I suppose,
if not by reasoning, then by the lapse of time. While your letter has been
on its way, while mine in answer is traversing so many lands and seas, a
year has passed. The service of consolation belongs to a definite period
while grief is still in progress and the stricken one is seeking aid. But
after long time has quieted the soul’s wounds, he who touches them out of
season, only reopens them. Moreover—and may this omen be true when it
reaches you!—you may already be happy through a new marriage.</p>
