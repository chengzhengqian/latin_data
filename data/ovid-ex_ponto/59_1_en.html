husband to the shades Laodamia would guide thee in thy deed. Iphias would
have to be kept before thine eyes, shouldst thou wish to hurl thyself
bravely upon the kindled pyre. But thou hast no need of death, no need of
the Icarian woman’s<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL151_381_1" id="target_note_LCL151_381_1"><sup>1</sup></a> web; thy lips must pray to Caesar’s spouse,
who by her virtue gives surety that the olden time conquers not our age in
praise of chastity; who, with the beauty of Venus, the character of Juno,
has been found alone worthy to share the divine couch. Why dost tremble and
fear to approach her? No impious Procne nor daughter<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL151_380_2" id="target_note_LCL151_380_2"><sup>2</sup></a> of Aeëtes must

universe holds nothing more illustrious from the sun’s rising to his
setting, save only Caesar. Choose well the time, already oft essayed, to
make thy petition, lest thy bark put forth into an adverse sea. Not always
do oracles give forth their holy prophecies, not at all times are even the
shrines open. When the condition of the city shall be such as I divine it
now to be, and no sorrow brings a frown upon the people’s brow, when
Augustus’s house, to be revered as it were the Capitol, shall be happy—as
now, I pray, and ever—and filled with peace, then may the gods grant thee an
opportunity to approach, then thou mayst believe that thy words will be of
some avail. If she is busy </p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL151_381_1"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL151_381_1" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">1</sup>Penelope, daughter of
