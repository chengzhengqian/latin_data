achieved fame when his steeds were swallowed up in the earth. If Ulysses had
wandered less, he would have been less famous; Philoctetes’ great name is
due to his wound. If there is some place among such mighty names for the
humble, I too am become a man of mark by reason of my fall.</p>
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">57</span><span class="br"></span><p>And thou art not permitted by my pages to be
unknown; thou hast a name not inferior to that of Coan Bittis. Whatever
therefore thou shalt do, thou shalt be viewed upon a mighty stage, thou
shalt be to many witnesses a loyal wife. I assure thee, as often as thou art
praised in my verse, he who reads the praise asks whether thou dost deserve
it. And just as many, I think, approve such virtues, so women not a few will
seek shortcomings in thy deeds. ’Tis for thee to make sure their jealousy
can never say, “This is she who is indifferent to her wretched husband’s
safety!”</p>
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">67</span><span class="br"></span><p>Since I am failing, no longer able to draw
the car, see that thou dost alone support the weakening yoke. I am a sick
man, gazing with failing pulse upon the doctor; while the last of life
remains to me, stand by to help; and what I would myself supply, were I
stronger than thou, that grant to me since thou art thyself the stronger.
This is demanded by our united love and marriage compact; this, my wife,
thou dost demand by virtue of thine own character. This thou dost owe to the
house<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL151_377_1" id="target_note_LCL151_377_1"><sup>1</sup></a> by which thou hast thy esteem, that thou
mayst cherish it not more in duty than in uprightness. Thou mayst do all
things, but unless thou shalt be a praiseworthy wife, it will not be
believed that thou hast honoured Marcia.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL151_377_2" id="target_note_LCL151_377_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
