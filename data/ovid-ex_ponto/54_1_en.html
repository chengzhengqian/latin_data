<p>Sooner shall I forget my own name than allow your loyalty to be driven from
my mind; sooner shall I give back this life to the empty air than gratitude
for your service become as naught. A great service I call the tears which
streamed over your face when my own was dry with chilling grief. A great
service I call the consolation of my sorrow when you bestowed it at once
upon me and upon yourself. By her own will and of herself my wife deserves
all praise, yet she is the better because of your admonitions: for what
Castor was to Hermione, Hector to Iulus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL151_371_1" id="target_note_LCL151_371_1"><sup>1</sup></a> this you are, I
rejoice to say, to my wife. She strives to be not unlike you in probity, she
proves herself by her life to be of your blood, and so that which she would
have done with no urging, she does more fully because you are her sponsor.
The mettlesome steed who will of his own accord race for the honour of the
palm will nevertheless, if you urge him, run with greater spirit. And
besides you perform with faithful care the directions of one who is absent;
there is no burden that you object to carrying. O may the gods recompense
you, since I have not the power; and they will recompense if they but see
deeds of loyalty. May you long have health to uphold your character, Rufus,
chief glory of Fundi’s land!</p>
