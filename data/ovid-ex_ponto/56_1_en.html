note is there of any bird save such as remote in the forests drink the
brackish water with raucous throat. Bitter wormwood bristles throughout the
empty plains, a crop suited in harshness to its site. Add fears too—the wall

dost not prevail in this, that thou canst restrain thy tears at my

has wrought and guard it well. Though I myself make no complaint, whilst I
am dumb fame will complain, as she ought, shouldst thou not have regard for
me. Fortune has set me forth to be viewed of all the people, she has given
me more celebrity than I had of yore. </p></section><notes></notes></section>
