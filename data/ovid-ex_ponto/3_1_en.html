race. I am a prophet, a monitor! Give place to one who bears holy objects!
Not by me, but by a mighty god that place is claimed. Because I have earned
or felt the Prince’s wrath, do not suppose that I would not worship the
Prince himself. I have seen one who confessed to have outraged the deity of
linen-wearing Isis sitting before Isis’s shrine. Another bereft of sight for
a like cause was crying out in the midst of the street that he had deserved
it. The gods rejoice in such heraldings that witnesses may attest their
power. Often do they mitigate penalties and restore the sight they have
taken away when they behold sincere repentance for sin. I too repent! O, if
any wretched man is believed in anything, I too repent! I feel the torture
of my own deed! Though exile is anguish, greater anguish is my fault and it
is a smaller thing to suffer the punishment than to have deserved it. What
though the gods and he who is more conspicuous than the gods should favour
me, my punishment can be removed, my fault will remain forever. Death at
least by his coming will put an end to my exile, my sin even death will not
remove.</p>
