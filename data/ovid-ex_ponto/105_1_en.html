shorten it and address you as Tuticănus. Nor can you enter into the verse as
Tŭticanus, so that the first long syllable is shortened; or so that the
second syllable, which is now short, should be long by extending its time.
If by such faults as these I should venture to distort your name, I should
be laughed at and they would say rightly that I had no taste.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL151_473_1a" id="target_note_LCL151_473_1a"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
