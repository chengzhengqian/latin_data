grandmother, the other by that of his father. To these I offer incense and
words of prayer as often as the day rises from the east. The whole land of
Pontus—you are free to inquire—will say that I am not fabricating this and
will bear witness to my devotion. The land of Pontus knows that on this
altar I celebrate with what offerings I can the birthday of the god, nor is
such service less known to whatsoever strangers the distant Propontis sends
to these waters. Even your brother, who had charge of ill-omened Pontus, may
perhaps have heard of it. My means are unequal to my wishes, but in such
service gladly, though poor, do I expend my scant resources. Nor do I bring
all these things before your eyes, far removed as I am from the city, but I
am content with an unspoken loyalty, and nevertheless this shall sometime
reach the ear of Caesar<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL151_463_2" id="target_note_LCL151_463_2"><sup>2</sup></a> from whom nothing which occurs in the whole
world is hidden. Thou at least knowest this, O Caesar, now one with the
gods, and seest it, since now the world is placed beneath thine eyes. Thou
hearest from thy place among the stars of heaven’s vault the prayers of my
anxious lips. Perchance even those poems may reach thee there which I have
composed and sent about thee, a new divinity. And so I prophesy that thy
holy will is yielding to these prayers, for not undeservedly hast thou the
gracious name of “Father.”</p>
