nothing is more useful than this art which has no use. From it I win
forgetfulness of my misfortune; this harvest is enough if my ground but
yields it. As for you—your goad may be renown; to read your poems and win
approval, devote your wakeful hours to the Pierian band. ’Tis enough for me
to compose what comes easily; I lack a reason for too earnest toil. Why
should I refine my verse with anxious labour? Should I fear that the Getan
will not approve them? Perchance ’tis bold of me, and yet I boast that the
Hister has no greater talent than mine. In this land where I must live ’tis
enough if I succeed in being a poet among the uncivilized Getae. Why should

this place to your region whither Boreas comes on failing wing. We are
separated by the heavens’ space, and the She Bear who is far from the city
of Quirinus gazes close at hand upon the shaggy Getae. Over so vast a
stretch of land, so many waters I can scarce believe it possible that a hint
of my work has leaped. Suppose it is read, and—marvellous indeed—suppose it
finds favour; that fact surely helps its author not at all. What profit to
you if you should be praised in hot Syene,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL151_295_1" id="target_note_LCL151_295_1"><sup>1</sup></a> or where the
