Through writing you know Agamemnon and everyone who bore arms with him or
against him. Who would know of Thebes and the seven leaders, were it not for
verse, or of all that went before and after? Even the gods, if ’tis right to
say this, are created by verse; their mighty majesty needs the bard’s voice.
By this it is that we know that Chaos became separated from that mass of
earlier nature and took on his divisions; by this that the Giants aiming at
the sovereignty of heaven were hurled to the Styx by the cloud-bearing

play. Just as Apollo is no sluggard either with lyre or bow but either
string is obedient to his sacred hands, so thou lackest the arts neither of
the scholar nor the prince, but in thy mind the Muse and Jupiter are wedded.
And since the Muse has not removed me from that spring<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL151_452_3" id="target_note_LCL151_452_3"><sup>3</sup></a> which the hollow
