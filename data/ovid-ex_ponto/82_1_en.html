my need nor has your coffer ever denied me generous aid. Even now your
clemency, not at all deterred by my sudden misfortune, offers and will
continue to offer succour to my life. Whence, perchance you ask, have I so
much confidence in the future? Every man watches over the work he has
wrought. Just as Venus is at once the work and glory of the Coan artist,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL151_427_2" id="target_note_LCL151_427_2"><sup>2</sup></a>

ivory or bronze wrought by the hand of Phidias, as Calamis claims renown for

last of your possessions, Sextus; I am known as the gift, the work of your
guardianship.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">II. To Severus</span></h3>
<p>That which you are reading, Severus, mightiest bard of mighty kings, comes
all the way from the land of the unshorn Getae, and that as yet my books
have made no mention of your name—if you will permit me to speak the
truth—brings me shame. Yet letters not in metre have never ceased to go on
their mission of friendship between us. Verse alone, bearing witness to your
thoughtful care, I have not given you: why should I give what you yourself
compose? Who would give honey to Aristaeus, Falernian wine to Bacchus, grain
to Triptolemus, fruit to Alcinous? You have a productive heart; of those who
cultivate Helicon, none displays </p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL151_427_1"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL151_427_1" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">1</sup>Ovid plays on <span class="italic">gratia</span> (thanks), <span class="italic">gratus</span>
