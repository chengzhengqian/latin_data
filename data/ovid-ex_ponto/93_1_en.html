to tell of your martial deeds there, how many you gave to death, who they
were and how they fell. Upon heaps of dead, the work of your sword, you trod
in victory; many a Getan lay beneath your planted foot. The soldiers of
lesser rank fought after the model of their centurion, enduring many wounds,
giving many. But your valour as far surpassed all others as Pegasus
distances a swift steed. Aegisos is conquered, and for all time, Vestalis,
my song bears witness to your deeds.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">VIII. To Suillitus</span></h3>
<p>Your letter, accomplished Suillius, has been late in reaching me, yet has it
brought me pleasure. Therein you say that so far as friendly loyalty can
soften the gods by petition you will bring me aid. Though you should give me
nothing more, your friendly purpose has placed me in your debt, for I term
the will to aid a service. Let only that impulse of yours endure for long
ages and let not your loyalty be worn out by my misfortunes. Some claim our
bonds of kinship make and I pray that these may ever last unweakened. For
she who is your wife is almost my daughter;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL151_449_1" id="target_note_LCL151_449_1"><sup>1</sup></a> she who calls you
son-in-law, calls me husband. Woe is me if when you read these verses you
frown and feel shame that you are my kinsman! Yet you will be able to
discover in me nothing to shame you save only Fortune, who to me has proved
blind. If you examine our lineage, we shall be found knights from our
earliest origins all through a line </p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL151_449_1"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL151_449_1" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">1</sup>Ovid’s step-daughter Perilla, <span class="italic">cf</span>. <span class="italic">T</span>. iii. 7.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL151_449_1').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
