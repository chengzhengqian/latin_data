books despite the fact that every man is all too fond of his own verse. A

may have called Thersites fair. Yet my judgment is not distorted by this
failing: whatever I beget does not forthwith please me. Why then, you ask,
if I perceive my mistakes, should I continue to err, permitting faults to
remain in my writing? ’Tis not the same story to feel and to cure a disease;
all men can feel, skill must remove the trouble. Often when I am desirous of
changing some word I leave it, and my strength forsakes my judgment.
Often—why should I hesitate to confess to you the truth?—it irks me to emend
and endure the burden of long toil. While writing the very toil gives
pleasure and itself is lessened, and the growing work glows with the
writer’s heart. But while to emend is as much easier as great Homer was
greater than Aristarchus, nevertheless it wears down the mind with a slow
chill of worry, as a driver restrains an eager steed. As truly as I hope
that the merciful gods may lessen Caesar’s wrath and allow my bones to rest
in peaceful soil, when I attempt to work carefully, sometimes the bitter
vision of my lot confronts me and I think myself hardly sane in composing
verses or in troubling to emend them among the wild Getae.</p>
