I am not at fault, Tomitae, for you I esteem, though I detest your land. Let
anyone you will examine the memorials of my toil, my letters have uttered no
complaints about you. Of the cold, of the raids to be feared from every
side, of the assaults by the enemy upon the wall I complain. Against the
land, not the people, I have uttered true charges; even you often criticize
