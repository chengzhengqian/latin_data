<h3><span class="sc">I. To Sextus Pompey</span></h3>
<p>Deign to receive a poem, Sextus Pompey, composed by him who is indebted to
you for his life. If you do not prevent me from uttering your name this also
will be added to the sum of your deserts: or if you frown, I shall indeed
confess my mistake, but its cause must nevertheless win approval. My heart
could not be restrained from gratitude; let not your anger be heavy, I
beseech you, upon my loyal service. Ah, how often have I thought myself
ungrateful in these books because nowhere was your name read! Ah, how often,
when I wished to write to another, has my hand all unconsciously placed your
name upon the wax! The very mistake I made in such slips gave me pleasure
and my hand was scarce willing to make the erasure. “Let him see it!” I
said, “though he may indeed complain! Ashamed am I not to have earned this
blame earlier!” Give me, if such thing there be, the waters of Lethe that
benumb the heart, yet I shall not be able to forget you. I beg you will
permit this nor reject in contempt my words, nor think that in my tribute
there is a sin. Let this slight gratitude be rendered to all your services;
if you do not, I shall be grateful even against your will.</p>
