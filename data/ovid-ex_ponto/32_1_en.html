the Roman gods whom you worship no less than the Tarpeian thunderer; be the
envoy of my message and undertake my cause, though no cause in my name is
good. Already nearly dead, at least a sick man who already feels death’s
chill, I shall be saved by you if only I am saved at all. Now in behalf of

empire and the world, beg him not to permit me to be a poor spoil for the
Getae, to grant a peaceful land for my wretched exile. A fitting time is at
hand for petitions: well is he and well, he sees, is it with the work of his
hands—thy strength, O Rome. In safety his consort guards her divine couch;
