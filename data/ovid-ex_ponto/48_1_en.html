attain the years of the Pylian<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL151_359_1" id="target_note_LCL151_359_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and thy mother
those of the Cumaean<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL151_359_2" id="target_note_LCL151_359_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and mayst thou be for long a son. Thou, too,
spouse suited to a mighty husband, listen with no cruel ear to the prayers
of a suppliant. So may thy husband be safe, so thy grandsons and their
offspring, so thy good sons’ wives and their children. So may that
Drusus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL151_359_3" id="target_note_LCL151_359_3"><sup>3</sup></a> whom cruel Germany tore away from thee, be
the only one of thy descendants to fall. So in the near future may the
avenger of his brother’s death drive, in purple clad, the snow-white steeds.
Assent to my timorous prayers, ye kind deities! Let it profit me somewhat to
have gods present before me. At Caesar’s coming the gladiator leaves the
arena in safety, for his countenance brings no slight aid. I too am helped
because, so far as I am allowed, I gaze upon the features of you all,
because three of the celestials have entered one home. Happy they who see
not likenesses, but the reality, the real persons of the gods face to face.
This has been begrudged me by hostile fate, and so I cherish the
countenances and figures which art has produced. Thus it is that men know
the gods whom the lofty aether conceals; they worship in Jupiter’s stead the
likeness of Jupiter. In fine make it your care that these your likenesses,
which are with me and shall ever be with me, be not in a hateful place. For
my head shall sooner leave my neck, sooner will I gouge out my eyes from my
cheeks, than be deprived, O deities of the state, of you. You shall be the
harbour, the altar of my exile. </p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL151_359_1"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL151_359_1" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">1</sup>Nestor.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL151_359_1').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL151_359_2"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL151_359_2" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">2</sup>The Cumaean Sibyl who was 700 years old when
