help an old friend in trouble. Just as it is shame to retire in battle and
not stand firm, shame to abandon a labouring ship, so it is shame to follow
luck and yield one’s friend to fate, and disown him except he be prosperous.
Not such was the life of the sons<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL151_349_1" id="target_note_LCL151_349_1"><sup>1</sup></a> of Strophius and
Agamemnon; not such was the loyalty of Aegeus’ son<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL151_349_2" id="target_note_LCL151_349_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and Pirithous.
Them past ages have admired, and ages to come will admire; to applaud them
the whole theatre roars. You too who have held to your friend through times
of stress deserve to have a name among such great men. You deserve it—yes,
and since praise is the just reward of your loyalty, my gratitude for your
service shall never be dumb. Trust me, if my song is not destined to die,
you shall be often on the lips of posterity. Only see that you remain
faithful to your weary friend, Graecinus, and let your impulse endure for
long. Though you do me this service, yet I use the oar while I have the
breeze: it does no harm to spur on the galloping steed.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">VII. To Atticus</span></h3>
<p>My letter sent from the scarce pacified Getae wishes first to salute you,
Atticus; close follows the wish to hear how you fare and whether, no matter
what your occupation, you have any interest in me. I doubt not you have, yet
the very dread of misfortunes often forces me to feel empty fears. Grant me
indulgence, I pray, pardon my excessive dread: the shipwrecked man shrinks
even from calm waters. </p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL151_349_1"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL151_349_1" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">1</sup>Pylades and Orestes.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL151_349_1').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note inline" id="note_LCL151_349_2"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL151_349_2" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">2</sup>Theseus.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL151_349_2').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
