repayment of your favours I promise for my part, and shall ever be found true to my promise, that in the pursuit of my public policy I shall not be found lacking in earnestness, nor in courage in the protection of the state from the perils that threaten it, nor in loyalty in the honest expression of my convictions, nor in freedom in the frustration, for the public good, of private designs, nor in energy in the endurance of toil, nor in grateful goodwill in endeavouring <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">25</span><span class="br"></span> to increase your general happiness. This ideal, fellow-citizens, shall be indelibly imprinted upon my heart, that I may be judged, not only by you, who are endowed in my thoughts with the power and sanctity of the immortal gods, but also by your descendants and by all nations, as fully worthy of a place in that community which expressed by its vote the unanimous conviction that, had it not won me back to itself, it could not possibly have retained its own proud position.</p>
