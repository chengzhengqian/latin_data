I did not doubt that, if she were restored, she herself <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">15</span><span class="br"></span> would bring me back with her. Or, having ascertained, as I had, that the consul for the forthcoming year would undoubtedly be Publius Lentulus, who, as curule aedile, had in the very midst of the state’s most hazardous crisis when I was consul been the sharer in all my counsels and the companion of all my perils, had I any ground for doubt that he would bring me back to health by applying a consul’s remedies to a frame stricken by wounds that a consul had dealt? Led by him, and with his humane and upright colleague at first neutral and later assisting, the remaining magistrates almost to a man came forward as the champions of my cause. In their number, Titus Annius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL158_119_a" id="target_note_LCL158_119_a"><sup>a</sup></a> and Publius Sestius,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL158_119_a" id="target_note_LCL158_119_a"><sup>a</sup></a> gentlemen of great magnanimity, uprightness, influence, and helpful resource, behaved towards me with extraordinary kindness and amazing unselfishness; and on the motion of Publius Lentulus, who was seconded by his colleague, a full senate, with but one dissentient voice and none raised in opposition, dwelt upon my merits in terms of the highest possible compliment, and recommended my cause to you, to <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">16</span><span class="br"></span> the corporate towns, and to the colonies. So it came about that, bereft of my kinsfolk, and with no influential connexions, I was constantly interceded for by consuls, praetors, tribunes of the plebs, senate, all Italy, and by all whom you had honoured with your distinguished bounties and offices; with Lentulus at their head they came before you, and not merely urged upon you the necessity of preserving me, but appeared to confirm, to attest, and to extol my actions.</p>
