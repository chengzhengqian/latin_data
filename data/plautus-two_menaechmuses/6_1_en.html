People who bind prisoners with chains and who put<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">80</span><span class="br"></span>
shackles on runaway slaves behave very stupidly, at least
in my opinion: if an unlucky fellow finds one bad thing
added to another, he’s all the more eager to run away and
behave badly. Yes, they get themselves out of the chains
in some way or other. Then those in shackles rub through<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">85</span><span class="br"></span>
the link with a file or knock the rivet off with a stone.
That’s just nonsense. Someone you want to watch over
well so he doesn’t run away ought to be bound with food
and drink. At a full table you can tie down a man’s snout.
So long as you provide him with food and drink, at his<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">90</span><span class="br"></span>
own discretion, to repletion, every day, he’ll never run
away, even if he’s committed a capital crime. You’ll guard
him easily so long as you bind him with this bond. Those
food chains are terribly tough indeed: the more you<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">95</span><span class="br"></span>
stretch them, the more tightly they tie; I’m going to
Menaechmus here, the bond servant of whose household
I’ve been for a long time already. I’m going of my own accord
so that he can bind me. Yes, he doesn’t simply feed
men, but nurtures and restores them. No one practices
the medical profession better. That’s what the young man<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">100</span><span class="br"></span>
