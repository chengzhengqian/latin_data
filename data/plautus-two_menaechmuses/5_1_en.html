I saw him being dunned loudly. So that you aren’t soon
mistaken, I’m already telling you now in advance: both
twin brothers have the same name. Now I have to return
to Epidamnus on foot in order to set you right on<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">50</span><span class="br"></span>
this other account: if anyone of you wants any business
sorted out in Epidamnus, let him command me boldly
and speak out, but in such a way that he gives the money

if he does give me the money . . . he’s behaving even more
like a fool. Well, I’m returning to the location I left and

away the feet of the child-displacer and dragged him
off to a very sticky end. That young man got very great
riches. This kidnapped twin lives there. Now that twin
who lives in Syracuse has come to Epidamnus today with<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">70</span><span class="br"></span>
his slave in order to look for this twin brother of his. ***<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">71</span><span class="br"></span></p></div>
