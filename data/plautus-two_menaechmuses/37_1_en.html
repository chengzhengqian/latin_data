<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">ero</span><p class="lineGroup">My dear Menaechmus, why are you standing in front of
the house? Follow me in.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">men</span><p class="lineGroup">Wait. Do you know what the reason is why I’m coming to
you?</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">ero</span><p class="lineGroup">Yes, so that you can get some pleasure from me.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">men</span><p class="lineGroup">No, please return that mantle I gave you a while ago. My
wife’s found out how the whole thing happened, from
first to last. I’ll buy you another mantle instead, twice as<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">680</span><span class="br"></span>
expensive, of your own choice.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">ero</span><p class="lineGroup">I gave it to you a little earlier to take to the embroiderer,
and that bracelet to take to the goldsmith to have a
makeover.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">men</span><p class="lineGroup">You gave me the mantle and the bracelet? You’ll never
find that this happened; after I gave it to you a while ago
and went off to the forum, I’m returning now, I’m seeing<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">685</span><span class="br"></span>
you now for the first time after that.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">ero</span><p class="lineGroup">I see what you’re up to. Because I gave you the opportunity
to cheat me, you’re taking that path.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">men</span><p class="lineGroup">No, I’m not asking for it in order to cheat you—rather, I
told you that my wife’s found out—</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">ero</span><p class="lineGroup">(<span class="italic">interrupting</span>)Well, I didn’t ask you to give it to me in the
first place. You yourself brought it to me of your own accord
and gave it to me as a present. Now you demand<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">690</span><span class="br"></span>
back that same mantle. I’ll put up with it. Have it for
yourself, take it away, use it, you or your wife, or even
shut it away in your money box. After this day you won’t
set a foot in here, don’t fool yourself. Since you despise
me even though I deserve well of you, you’ll bring me
your money for nothing, you can’t trick me. From now on<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">695</span><span class="br"></span>
find another woman to deceive.</p></div>
