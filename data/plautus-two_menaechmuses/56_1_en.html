strange ways. Some people deny that I am the one I am<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1040</span><span class="br"></span>
and lock me out; ***. This chap, whom I freed, even said
he was my slave. [For example that chap who just said he
was getting the money, who claimed that he was my slave
and that I was his master, and whom I just freed.] He said
he was going to bring me the wallet with the money. If he
brings it, I’ll tell him to go away from me as a free man
wherever he likes, so he doesn’t claim back the money<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1045</span><span class="br"></span>
from me when he’s become sane again. My father-in-law
and the doctor said I was mad. I wonder what this is all
about. It seems to be nothing short of dreams. Now I’ll go
inside to that prostitute, however angry she is with me, if
I can persuade her to return the mantle to me so I can
carry it back home. (<span class="italic">walks toward Erotium’s house</span>)</p></div>

men who had lifted you up and were carrying you off.
You were imploring the protection of gods and all men
when I ran to you and rescued you with might and main,
against their will. For that reason, because I rescued you,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1055</span><span class="br"></span>
you sent me off as a free man. When I said I was getting
the money and the luggage, you ran ahead as fast as you
could to meet me so that you could deny what you did.</p></div>
