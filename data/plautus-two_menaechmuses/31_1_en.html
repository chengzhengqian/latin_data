the aedile.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL061_485_19" id="target_note_LCL061_485_19"><sup>19</sup></a>] This is how a certain client kept me very
busy today and how I couldn’t do what I wanted or who I
wanted to do it with, to such an extent did he delay and
detain me. Before the aediles I spoke in defense of his<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">590</span><span class="br"></span>
countless misdeeds and proposed complicated and obscure
provisos. I spoke no more and no less than was required,
so that a settlement came about on both sides.
What did the man do †who gave a surety?† I’ve never
seen anyone caught more red-handed. For all his misdeeds<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">595</span><span class="br"></span>
three most stern witnesses stood present. May all
the gods destroy him: he ruined this day for me today,
and me to, whoever set my eyes on the forum today. I’ve
wasted a perfect day. I had a lunch prepared for me. My
girlfriend’s expecting me, I know that. As soon as I could,
I rushed off from the forum. She’s angry with me now, I<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">600</span><span class="br"></span>
believe; the mantle I gave her will mollify her, the one I
took away from my wife today and took to Erotium here.</p></div>
