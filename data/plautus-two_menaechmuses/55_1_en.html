<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">men</span><p class="lineGroup">May the gods always bless you, young man, whoever you
are: if it hadn’t been for you, I’d never have lived till sunset
today.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">mes</span><p class="lineGroup">Then if you were to do the right thing, master, you’d set
me free.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">men</span><p class="lineGroup">I should free you?</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">mes</span><p class="lineGroup">Yes, since I’ve saved you, master.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">men</span><p class="lineGroup">What’s that? Young man, you’re mistaken.<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1025</span><span class="br"></span></p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">mes</span><p class="lineGroup">What, I’m mistaken?</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">men</span><p class="lineGroup">I swear by Father Jupiter that I’m not your master.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">mes</span><p class="lineGroup">Won’t you be quiet?</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">men</span><p class="lineGroup">I’m not lying. My slave has never done anything of the
sort you did for me.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">mes</span><p class="lineGroup">Then let me go off like this, as a free man, if you say I
don’t belong to you.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">men</span><p class="lineGroup">As far as I’m concerned you can be free and go where you
wish.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">mes</span><p class="lineGroup">Are you telling me to do so?<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1030</span><span class="br"></span></p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">men</span><p class="lineGroup">Yes, I am, if I have any authority over you.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">mes</span><p class="lineGroup">Greetings, my patron. (<span class="italic">shaking his own hand</span>) “Messenio,
I’m happy that you’re free.” “I’m sure you mean
it.” But, my patron, I ask you not to command me any less
than when I was your slave. I’ll live with you and when
you go home, I’ll go together with you.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">men</span><p class="lineGroup">Certainly not.<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1035</span><span class="br"></span></p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">mes</span><p class="lineGroup">Now I’ll go to the inn and return the luggage and money
to you. The wallet with the traveling money is correctly
sealed in the traveling bag. I’ll bring it here to you now.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">men</span><p class="lineGroup">Yes, bring it quickly.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">mes</span><p class="lineGroup">I’ll return it to you safe and sound, just as you gave it to
me. Wait for me here.</p></div>
