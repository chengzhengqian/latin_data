<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">mes</span><p class="lineGroup">This is the touchstone for a good servant: that one is good
who secures, watches, arranges, and has in mind his master’s
business, so that when his master is away he guards
his master’s business as diligently as if he were present in
person or even better. A slave who has his heart in its<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">970</span><span class="br"></span>
proper place has to put his back above his gullet, his shins
above his belly. Let him remember what reward those
who are worthless are given by their masters, the lazy and
shameless ones: beatings, shackles, the mill, exhaustion,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">975</span><span class="br"></span>
hunger, harsh cold, these are the rewards of laziness. I’m
terribly afraid of this terrible suffering. That’s why I’m
resolved to be good rather than bad. I can bear a chiding
much more easily: I hate a hiding, and I much prefer to
eat what has been milled to doing the milling. For this<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">980</span><span class="br"></span>
reason I’m following my master’s command and carry it
out well and calmly. And that’s to my own good. Let others
be as they think it’s advantageous. I shall be as I ought
to be. I should retain a sense of fear and steer clear of<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">983</span><span class="br"></span>
guilt, so that I’m there for my master in all places. Those
slaves who are afraid when they’re free from guilt are
usually useful to their masters. Those who are not afraid
of anything are afraid after deserving a trashing. I shan’t
be greatly afraid. The time is close when my master will
reward me. I serve him on that principle, as I think it advantageous<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">985</span><span class="br"></span>
