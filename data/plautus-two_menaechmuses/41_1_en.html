me, I’m overgrown with old age, I’m moving a
burdened body, my strength has left me. How bad old
age is! It’s a bad lot for an ill man: it brings countless troubles
when it comes. If I were to speak about all of them,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">760</span><span class="br"></span>
my talk would be far too long. But this matter is a worry
in my breast and in my heart, what this business is that
my daughter has asked me suddenly like this to come to
her. And she doesn’t inform me what it is, what she wants,
what she’s summoning me for. But I practically know already
what’s the matter. I believe some argument has<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">765</span><span class="br"></span>
arisen with her husband. They’re always like that, those
women who expect their husbands to act as their slaves,
relying on their dowries and generally savage. And the
husbands are often not blameless either. But there’s a
limit to what a wife ought to put up with. And a daughter<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">770</span><span class="br"></span>
never summons her father unless the reason is some
offense or argument. But whatever it is, I’ll know in a
moment. And look, I can see her in person in front of the
house, and her husband with an unhappy expression. It’s
what I suspected. I’ll address her.<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">775</span><span class="br"></span>

I’ll go toward him. (<span class="italic">loudly</span>) Many greetings, my dear

you have me summoned? What are you upset about? And
why does he stand at a distance from you? You’ve had
some fight between you two. Tell me which of you is
guilty, but briefly, no long stories.</p></div>
