that you ever set foot into the house where you live, you
complete madman?</p></div>

<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">om</span><p class="lineGroup">No, you deny it in all untruth; unless you moved out
somewhere last night. (<span class="italic">turning to his daughter</span>) You
come over here, my daughter. What do <span class="italic">you</span> say? Did you

attention.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">sos</span><p class="lineGroup">Please, what business have I with you? Where are you
from, or who are you? What do I owe you, or for that

way?</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">wife</span><p class="lineGroup">(<span class="italic">to her father</span>) Can you see how green his eyes are? How
a pale color is arising from his temples and his forehead,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">830</span><span class="br"></span>
how his eyes are flaming, look!</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">sos</span><p class="lineGroup">(<span class="italic">aside</span>) Dear me! They say <span class="italic">I</span> am mad, when on the contrary<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">843</span><span class="br"></span>
they themselves are. Since they say that I’m mad,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">831</span><span class="br"></span>
what’s better for me than to pretend to be mad in order to
drive them away from me? (<span class="italic">moves and acts strangely</span>)</p></div>

possible.</p></div>
