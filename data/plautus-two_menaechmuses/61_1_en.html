<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">men</span><p class="lineGroup">Then how did you get the name Menaechmus later on?</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">sos</span><p class="lineGroup">After we received the message that you *** and that our
father had died, our grandfather changed it. He gave me
the name you have.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">men</span><p class="lineGroup">I believe it happened the way you say. But answer me<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1130</span><span class="br"></span>
this.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">sos</span><p class="lineGroup">Ask.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">men</span><p class="lineGroup">What was our mother’s name?</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">sos</span><p class="lineGroup">Teuximarcha.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">men</span><p class="lineGroup">Correct. My greetings, unhoped-for brother, whom I see
after so many years.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">sos</span><p class="lineGroup">And mine to you, my brother, whom I’ve been looking for
with much hardship and toil until now and whom I’m
happy to have found.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">mes</span><p class="lineGroup">(<span class="italic">to Sosicles</span>) That was why this prostitute addressed you<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1135</span><span class="br"></span>
by this man’s name. She thought you are him, I believe,
when she invited you to lunch.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">men</span><p class="lineGroup">Yes, indeed; I had a lunch prepared for me here today,
behind my wife’s back; I stole a mantle from her from
home a while ago. I gave it to her.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">sos</span><p class="lineGroup">My brother, do you mean this mantle I have? (<span class="italic">produces
it</span>)</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">men</span><p class="lineGroup">This is the one. How did it come into your hands?<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1140</span><span class="br"></span></p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">sos</span><p class="lineGroup">The prostitute who took me to lunch here said I’d given it
to her. I had a very good lunch, I drank, and lay with the
prostitute, and I took away this cloak and gold.</p></div>
