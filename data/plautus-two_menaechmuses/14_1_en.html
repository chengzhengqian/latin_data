than when they see land in the distance from the

please, why have we come to Epidamnus now? Are we

the sixth year that we’ve been busy with it. We’ve<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">235</span><span class="br"></span>
sailed round the people near the Danube, the Spaniards,
the people of Marseille, the Illyrians, the entire Adriatic,
Sicily, and all Italian shores, wherever the sea reaches. I

the needle long ago if it were ever to appear. We’re<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">240</span><span class="br"></span>
searching for a dead man among the living: if he were
alive, we’d have found him long ago.</p></div>

make an effort to find him beyond that. But on no other<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">245</span><span class="br"></span>
condition will I give up looking for him while I live. I
know how dear he is to my heart.</p></div>
