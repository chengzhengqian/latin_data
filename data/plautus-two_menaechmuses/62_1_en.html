<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">men</span><p class="lineGroup">I’m really happy if something good came your way because
of me: when she invited you, she thought that you<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1145</span><span class="br"></span>
are me.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">mes</span><p class="lineGroup">(<span class="italic">to Sosicles</span>)Do you have any objections against me being
free, as you said I should be?</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">men</span><p class="lineGroup">What he asks is absolutely good and fair, my brother. Do
it for my sake.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">sos</span><p class="lineGroup">(<span class="italic">to Messenio</span>) Be free.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">men</span><p class="lineGroup">I’m happy that you’re free, Messenio.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">mes</span><p class="lineGroup">But I need a better omen in order to be free for good.<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1150</span><span class="br"></span></p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">sos</span><p class="lineGroup">My brother, since this went according to our wishes, let’s
both return to our country.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">men</span><p class="lineGroup">My brother, I’ll do as you wish. I’ll hold an auction here
and sell whatever there is to sell. Now in the meantime
let’s go inside, my brother.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">sos</span><p class="lineGroup">Yes.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">mes</span><p class="lineGroup">Do you two know what I’m asking you for?</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">men</span><p class="lineGroup">No; what is it?<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1155</span><span class="br"></span></p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">mes</span><p class="lineGroup">Let me be the auctioneer.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">sos</span><p class="lineGroup">Yes.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">mes</span><p class="lineGroup">So do you want the auction to be announced now?</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">men</span><p class="lineGroup">Yes, it’s to be in six days.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">mes</span><p class="lineGroup">(<span class="italic">loudly, to the audience</span>) The auction of Menaechmus
will take place very early in six days. Slaves will be on sale,
furniture, country estates, the house, everything. This
will be on sale for whatever price it fetches in cash. There<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1160</span><span class="br"></span>
will also be on sale . . . a wife, if any buyer comes. I hardly
believe he’ll get five million sesterces in the entire auction.
Now, spectators, farewell and give us your loud
applause.</p></div>
