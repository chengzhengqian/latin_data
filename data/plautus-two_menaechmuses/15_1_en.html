Unless you return home, I believe you’ll be sorry when
you’re left with nothing while trying to catch sight of your
twin; this nation of people is like this: among the Epidamnians
there are the greatest hedonists and drinkers.
Then lots of impostors and cajolers live in this city. And<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">260</span><span class="br"></span>
then the prostitutes are said to be the most coaxing anywhere.
This city is called Epidamnus because practically
nobody puts up here without being damnified.</p></div>

You are a great lover of the ladies, Messenio, but I

the money I’ll prevent both these things: you committing
