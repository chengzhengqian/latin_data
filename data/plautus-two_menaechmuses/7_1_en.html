creates heaps on the tables and from the height of the
piles of pans he puts together. You have to stand on your
couch if you want to take something from the top. But
now I’ve had a gap of many days past. I’m constantly<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">105</span><span class="br"></span>
housebound in my house with my dear ones: I neither eat
nor buy except what is dearest. And now these dear ones
who are being marshaled are deserting me. Now I’ll visit
him. (<span class="italic">stops in front of Menaechmus’ house</span>) But the door

doing, what business I’m carrying out, what I’m seeking,
what I’m up to, what I’ve done outside. I’ve married a
customs officer: I have to state everything, whatever I’ve
done and am doing. I’ve spoiled you far too much. Now
I’ll tell you what I’m going to do. Since I’m providing you<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">120</span><span class="br"></span>
