darkness,—and even to eternity day makes these alternations<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL075_71_a" id="target_note_LCL075_71_a"><sup>a</sup></a> more numerous, not different when it is shorter and different again when it is longer. Hence, every day ought to be regulated as if it closed the series, as if it rounded out and completed our existence.</p>
<p>Pacuvius, who by long occupancy made Syria his own,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL075_71_b" id="target_note_LCL075_71_b"><sup>b</sup></a> used to hold a regular burial sacrifice in his own honour, with wine and the usual funeral feasting, and then would have himself carried from the dining-room to his chamber, while eunuchs applauded and sang in Greek to a musical accompaniment: “He has lived his life, he has lived his life!” Thus Pacuvius had himself carried out to burial every day. Let us, however, do from a good motive what he used to do from a debased motive; let us go to our sleep with joy and gladness; let us say:</p>

<span class="line">Is finished.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL075_71_c" id="target_note_LCL075_71_c"><sup>c</sup></a></span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p>And if God is pleased to add another day, we should welcome it with glad hearts. That man is happiest, and is secure in his own possession of himself, who can await the morrow without apprehension. When a man has said: “have lived!”, every morning he arises he receives a bonus.</p>
<p>But now I ought to close my letter. “What?” you say; “shall it come to me without any little offering?” Be not afraid; it brings something,—nay,
more than something, a great deal. For what is more noble than the following saying,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL075_71_d" id="target_note_LCL075_71_d"><sup>d</sup></a> of which I make this letter the bearer: “It is wrong to live under constraint; but no man is constrained to live under constraint.” Of course not. On all sides lie
