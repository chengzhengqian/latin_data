of intemperance. Why? Because this unseemly pursuit of the liberal arts makes men troublesome, wordy, tactless, self-satisfied bores, who fail to learn the essentials just because they have learned the non-essentials. Didymus the scholar wrote four thousand books. I should feel pity for him if he had only read the same number of superfluous volumes. In these books he investigates Homer’s birthplace,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL076_373_a" id="target_note_LCL076_373_a"><sup>a</sup></a> who was really the mother of Aeneas, whether Anacreon was more of a rake or more of a drunkard, whether Sappho was a bad lot,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL076_373_b" id="target_note_LCL076_373_b"><sup>b</sup></a> and other problems the answers to which, if found, were forthwith to be forgotten. Come now, do not tell me that life is long! Nay, when you come to consider our own countrymen also, I can show you many works which ought to be cut down with the axe.</p>
<p>It is at the cost of a vast outlay of time and of vast discomfort to the ears of others that we win such praise as this: “What a learned man you are!” Let us be content with this recommendation, less citified though it be: “What a good man you are!” Do I mean this? Well, would you have me unroll the annals of the world’s history and try to find out who first wrote poetry? Or, in the absence of written records, shall I make an estimate of the number of years which lie between Orpheus and Homer? Or shall I make a study of the absurd writings of Aristarchus, wherein he branded the text<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL076_373_c" id="target_note_LCL076_373_c"><sup>c</sup></a> of other men’s verses, and wear my life away upon syllables? Shall I then wallow in the geometrician’s dust<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL076_373_d" id="target_note_LCL076_373_d"><sup>d</sup></a>? Have I so far forgotten that useful saw “Save your time”? Must I know these things? And what may I choose not to know?</p>
