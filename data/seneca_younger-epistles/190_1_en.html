and this makes one a prey to care, as our Vergil says:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">I, whom of yore no dart could cause to flee,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Nor Greeks, with crowded lines of infantry,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Now shake at every sound, and fear the air,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Both for my child and for the load I bear.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL075_381_a" id="target_note_LCL075_381_a"><sup>a</sup></a></span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">This man in his first state is wise; he blenches neither at the brandished spear, nor at the clashing armour of the serried foe, nor at the din of the stricken city. This man in his second state lacks knowledge fearing for his own concerns, he pales at every sound; any cry is taken for the battle-shout and overthrows him; the slightest disturbance renders him breathless
with fear. It is the load that makes him afraid.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL075_381_b" id="target_note_LCL075_381_b"><sup>b</sup></a> Select anyone you please from among your favourites of Fortune, trailing their many responsibilities, carrying
their many burdens, and you will behold a picture of Vergil’s hero, “fearing both for his child and for the load he bears.”</p>
<p>You may therefore be sure that you are at peace with yourself, when no noise reaches you, when no word shakes you out of yourself, whether it be of flattery or of threat, or merely an empty sound buzzing about you with unmeaning din. “What then?” you say, “is it not sometimes a simpler matter just to avoid the uproar?” I admit this. Accordingly, I shall change from my present quarters. I merely wished to test myself and to give myself practice. Why need I be tormented any longer, when Ulysses found so simple a cure for his comrades,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL075_381_c" id="target_note_LCL075_381_c"><sup>c</sup></a> even against the songs of the Sirens? Farewell.</p>
