motion, is corporeal. You expect me, I suppose, to deny that “race” differs from “running,” that “heat” differs from “being hot,” that “light” differs from “giving light.” I grant that these pairs vary, but hold that they are not in separate classes. If good health is an indifferent<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL077_343_a" id="target_note_LCL077_343_a"><sup>a</sup></a> quality, then so is <span class="italic">being in good health</span>; if beauty is an indifferent quality, then so is <span class="italic">being beautiful.</span> If justice is a Good, then so is <span class="italic">being just.</span> And if baseness is an evil, then it is an evil to be base—just as much as, if sore eyes are an evil, the state of having sore eyes is also an evil. Neither quality, you may be sure, can exist without the other. He who is wise is a man of wisdom: he who is a man of wisdom is wise. So true it is that we cannot doubt the quality of the one to equal the quality of the other, that they are both regarded by certain persons as one and the same.</p>
<p>Here is a question, however, which I should be glad to put: granted that all things are either good or bad or indifferent—in what class does <span class="italic">being wise</span> belong? People deny that it is a Good: and, as it obviously is not an evil, it must consequently be one of the “media.” But we mean by the “medium,” or the “indifferent” quality that which can fall to the lot of the bad no less than to the good—such things as money, beauty, or high social position. But the quality of <span class="italic">being wise</span> can fall to the lot of the good man alone: therefore <span class="italic">being wise</span> is not an indifferent quality. Nor is it an evil, either: because it cannot fall to the lot of the bad man: therefore, it is a Good. That which the good man alone can possess, is a Good: now <span class="italic">being wise</span> is the possession of the good man only: therefore it is a Good. The objector replies: “It is only an accessory of wisdom.” Very well, then, I say, this quality which you call
