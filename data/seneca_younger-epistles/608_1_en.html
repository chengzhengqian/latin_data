<h2><span class="ac">CXIII. On the Vitality of the Soul and Its Attributes</span></h2>
<p>You wish me to write to you my opinion concerning this question, which has been mooted by our school—whether
justice, courage, foresight, and the other virtues, are living things.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL077_283_a" id="target_note_LCL077_283_a"><sup>a</sup></a> By such niceties as this, my beloved Lucilius, we have made people think that we sharpen our wits on useless objects, and waste our leisure time in discussions that will be unprofitable. I shall, however, do as you ask, and shall set forth the subject as viewed by our school. For myself, I confess to another belief: I hold that there are certain things which befit a wearer of white shoes and a Greek mantle.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL077_283_b" id="target_note_LCL077_283_b"><sup>b</sup></a> But what the beliefs are that have stirred the ancients, or those which the ancients have stirred up for discussion, I shall explain to you.</p>
<p>The soul, men are agreed, is a living thing, because of itself it can make us living things, and because “living things”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL077_283_c" id="target_note_LCL077_283_c"><sup>c</sup></a> have derived their name therefrom. But virtue is nothing else than a soul in a certain condition; therefore it is a living thing. Again, virtue is active, and no action can take place without impulse. And if a thing has impulse, it must be a living thing; for none except a living thing possesses impulse. A reply to this is: “If virtue is a living thing, then virtue itself possesses virtue.” Of course it possesses its own self! Just as the wise man does everything by reason of virtue, so virtue accomplishes everything by reason
