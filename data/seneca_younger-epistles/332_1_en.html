growing smaller because it is consumed from day to day, and that, on the other hand, it remains the same in size because the mountain is not devouring itself, but instead of this the matter which seethes forth collects in some subterranean valley and is fed by other material, finding in the mountain itself not the food which it requires, but simply a passage-way out. There is a well-known place in Lycia—called by the inhabitants “Hephaestion”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL076_203_a" id="target_note_LCL076_203_a"><sup>a</sup></a>—where the ground is full of holes in many places and is surrounded by a harmless fire, which does no injury to the plants that grow there.

Besides, the topic has served them all with happy results, and those who have gone before seem to me not to have forestalled all that could be said, but merely to have opened the way.</p>
