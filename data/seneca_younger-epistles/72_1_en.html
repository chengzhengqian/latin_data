<p>That which Epicurus could promise his friend, this I promise you, Lucilius. I shall find favour among later generations; I can take with me names that will endure as long as mine. Our poet Vergil promised an eternal name to two heroes, and is keeping his promise:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL075_145_a" id="target_note_LCL075_145_a"><sup>a</sup></a></p>
