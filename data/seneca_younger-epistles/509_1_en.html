they will not help you to do it in the proper way; and if they do not help you to this end, they do not conduct you to virtue. I grant you that, if warned, a man will do what he should; but that is not enough, since the credit lies, not in the actual deed, but in the way it is done. What is more shameful than a costly meal which eats away the income even of a knight? Or what so worthy of the censor’s condemnation<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL077_85_a" id="target_note_LCL077_85_a"><sup>a</sup></a> as to be always indulging oneself and one’s “inner man,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL077_85_b" id="target_note_LCL077_85_b"><sup>b</sup></a> if I may speak as the gluttons do? And yet often has an inaugural dinner cost the most careful man a cool million! The very sum that is called disgraceful if spent on the appetite, is beyond reproach if spent for official purposes! For it is not luxury but an expenditure sanctioned by custom.</p>
<p>A mullet of monstrous size was presented to the Emperor Tiberius. They say it weighed four and one half pounds (and why should I not tickle the palates of certain epicures by mentioning its weight?). Tiberius ordered it to be sent to the fish-market and put up for sale, remarking: “I shall be taken entirely by surprise, my friends, if either Apicius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL077_85_c" id="target_note_LCL077_85_c"><sup>c</sup></a> or P. Octavius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL077_85_c" id="target_note_LCL077_85_c"><sup>c</sup></a> does not buy that mullet.” The guess came true beyond his expectation: the two men bid, and Octavius won, thereby acquiring a great reputation among his intimates because he had bought for five thousand sesterces a fish which the Emperor had sold, and which even Apicius did not succeed in buying. To pay such a price was disgraceful for Octavius, but not for the individual who purchased the fish in order to present it to Tiberius,—though I should be inclined to blame the latter as well; but at any rate he admired a gift of which he thought Caesar worthy.</p>
