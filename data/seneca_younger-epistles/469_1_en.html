need the soul. A life is really long if it is a full life; but fulness is not attained until the soul has rendered to itself its proper Good,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL077_5_a" id="target_note_LCL077_5_a"><sup>a</sup></a> that is, until it has assumed control over itself. What benefit does this older man derive from the eighty years he has spent in idleness? A person like him has not lived; he has merely tarried awhile in life. Nor has he died late in life; he has simply been a long time dying. He has lived eighty years, has he? That depends upon the date from which you reckon his death! Your other friend,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL077_5_b" id="target_note_LCL077_5_b"><sup>b</sup></a> however, departed in the bloom of his manhood. But he had fulfilled all the duties of a good citizen, a good friend, a good son; in no respect had he fallen short. His age may have been incomplete, but his life was complete. The other man has lived eighty years, has he? Nay, he has existed eighty years, unless perchance you mean by “he has lived” what we mean when we say that a tree “lives.”</p>
<p>Pray, let us see to it, my dear Lucilius, that our lives, like jewels of great price, be noteworthy not because of their width but because of their weight.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL077_5_c" id="target_note_LCL077_5_c"><sup>c</sup></a> Let us measure them by their performance, not by their duration. Would you know wherein lies the difference between this hardy man who, despising Fortune, has served through every campaign of life and has attained to life’s Supreme Good, and that other person over whose head many years have passed? The former exists even after his death; the latter has died even before he was dead.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL077_5_d" id="target_note_LCL077_5_d"><sup>d</sup></a></p>
<p>We should therefore praise, and number in the company of the blest, that man who has invested well the portion of time, however little, that has been allotted to him; for such a one has seen the true light. He has not been one of the common herd.
