we ask, not what a thing truly is, but what it costs; we fulfil duties if it pays, or neglect them if it pays, and we follow an honourable course as long as it encourages our expectations, ready to veer across to the opposite course if crooked conduct shall promise more. Our parents have instilled into us a respect for gold and silver; in our early years the craving has been implanted, settling deep within us and growing with our growth. Then too the whole nation, though at odds on every other subject, agrees upon this; this is what they regard, this is what they ask for their children, this is what they dedicate to the gods when they wish to show their gratitude—as
if it were the greatest of all man’s possessions! And finally, public opinion has come to such a pass that poverty is a hissing and a reproach, despised by the rich and loathed by the poor.</p>
<p>Verses of poets also are added to the account—verses
which lend fuel to our passions, verses in which wealth is praised as if it were the only credit and glory of mortal man. People seem to think that the immortal gods cannot give any better gift than wealth—or even possess anything better:</p>

<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">Gold was the axle, golden eke the pole,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">And gold the tires that bound the circling wheels,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">And silver all the spokes within the wheels.</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">And finally, when they would praise an epoch as the best, they call it the “Golden Age.” Even among the Greek tragic poets there are some who regard pelf as better than purity, soundness, or good report:</p>
