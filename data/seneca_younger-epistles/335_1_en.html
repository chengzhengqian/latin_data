But, as the shadow sometimes precedes and sometimes follows or even lags behind, so fame sometimes goes before us and shows herself in plain sight, and sometimes is in the rear, and is all the greater in proportion as she is late in coming, when once envy has beaten a retreat. How long did men believe Democritus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL076_209_a" id="target_note_LCL076_209_a"><sup>a</sup></a> to be mad! Glory barely came to Socrates.
