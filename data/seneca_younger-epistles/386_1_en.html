<h2><span class="ac">LXXXVI. On Scipio’s Villa</span></h2>
<p>I am resting at the country-house which once belonged to Scipio Africanus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL076_311_a" id="target_note_LCL076_311_a"><sup>a</sup></a> himself; and I write to you after doing reverence to his spirit and to an altar which I am inclined to think is the tomb<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL076_311_b" id="target_note_LCL076_311_b"><sup>b</sup></a> of that great warrior.
