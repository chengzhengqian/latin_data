we have lost a friend, nor let them overflow. We may weep, but we must not wail.</p>
<p>Do you think that the law which I lay down for you is harsh, when the greatest of Greek poets has extended the privilege of weeping to one day only, in the lines where he tells us that even Niobe took thought of food<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL075_431_a" id="target_note_LCL075_431_a"><sup>a</sup></a>?
