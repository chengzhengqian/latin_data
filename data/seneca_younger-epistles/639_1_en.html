<span class="italic">being wise</span>—does it actively produce wisdom, or is it a passive concomitant of wisdom? It is corporeal in either case. For that which is acted upon and that which acts, are alike corporeal; and, if corporeal, each is a Good. The only quality which could prevent it from being a Good, would be incorporeality.</p>
<p>The Peripatetics believe that there is no distinction between <span class="italic">wisdom</span> and <span class="italic">being wise</span>, since either of these implies the other also. Now do you suppose that any man can <span class="italic">be wise</span> except one who possesses wisdom? Or that anyone who <span class="italic">is wise</span> does not possess wisdom? The old masters of dialectic, however, distinguish between these two conceptions: and from them the classification has come right down to the Stoics. What sort of a classification this is, I shall explain: A field is one thing, and the possession of the field another thing; of course, because “possessing the field” refers to the possessor rather than to the field itself. Similarly, wisdom is one thing and <span class="italic">being wise</span> another. You will grant, I suppose, that these two are separate ideas —the possessed and the possessor: wisdom being that which one possesses, and he who <span class="italic">is wise</span> its possessor. Now wisdom is Mind perfected and developed to the highest and best degree. For it is the art of life. And what is <span class="italic">being wise</span>? I cannot call it “Mind Perfected,” but rather that which falls to the lot of him who possesses a “mind perfected”; thus a good mind is one thing, and the so-called possession of a good mind another.</p>
<p>“There are,” it is said, “certain natural classes of bodies; we say: ‘This is a man,’ ‘this is a horse.’ Then there attend on the bodily natures certain movements of the mind which declare something about the body. And these have a certain essential quality
