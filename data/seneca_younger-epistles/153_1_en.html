<p>But how many masters is he creating in these very men! I have seen standing in the line, before the door of Callistus, the former master<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL075_307_a" id="target_note_LCL075_307_a"><sup>a</sup></a> of Callistus; I have seen the master himself shut out while others were welcomed,—the master who once fastened the “For Sale” ticket on Callistus and put him in the market along with the good-for-nothing slaves.
