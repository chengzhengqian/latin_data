all with me!” In other words, he deemed nothing that might be taken from him to be a good.</p>
<p>We marvel at certain animals because they can pass through fire and suffer no bodily harm; but how much more marvellous is a man who has marched forth unhurt and unscathed through fire and sword and devastation! Do you understand now how much easier it is to conquer a whole tribe than to conquer one <span class="italic">man</span>? This saying of Stilbo makes common ground with Stoicism; the Stoic also can carry his goods unimpaired through cities that have been burned to ashes; for he is self-sufficient. Such are the bounds which he sets to his own happiness.</p>
<p>But you must not think that our school alone can utter noble words; Epicurus himself, the reviler of Stilbo, spoke similar language<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL075_55_a" id="target_note_LCL075_55_a"><sup>a</sup></a>; put it down to my credit, though I have already wiped out my debt for the present day.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL075_55_b" id="target_note_LCL075_55_b"><sup>b</sup></a> He says: “Whoever does not regard what he has as most ample wealth, is unhappy, though he be master of the whole world.” Or, if the following seems to you a more suitable phrase,—for
we must try to render the meaning and not the mere words: “A man may rule the world and still be unhappy, if he does not feel that he is supremely happy.” In order, however, that you may know that these sentiments are universal,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL075_55_c" id="target_note_LCL075_55_c"><sup>c</sup></a> suggested, of course, by Nature, you will find in one of the comic poets this verse:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">Unblest is he who thinks himself unblest.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL075_55_d" id="target_note_LCL075_55_d"><sup>d</sup></a></span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p>For what does your condition matter, if it is bad in your own eyes? You may say: “What then? If yonder man, rich by base means, and yonder man, lord of many but slave of more, shall call themselves happy, will their own opinion make them happy?”
