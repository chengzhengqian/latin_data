respect for the man, or by the importunity of his request, or by hope.” Our feeling about every obligation depends in each case upon the spirit in which the benefit is conferred; we weigh not the bulk of the gift, but the quality of the good-will which prompted it. So now let us do away with guess-work; the former deed was a benefit, and the latter, which transcended the earlier benefit, is an injury. The good man so arranges the two sides of his ledger<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL076_223_a" id="target_note_LCL076_223_a"><sup>a</sup></a> that he voluntarily cheats himself by adding to the benefit and subtracting from the injury.</p>
<p>The more indulgent magistrate, however (and I should rather be such a one), will order us to forget the injury and remember the accommodation. “But surely,” you say, “it is the part of justice to render to each that which is his due,—thanks in return for a benefit, and retribution,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL076_223_b" id="target_note_LCL076_223_b"><sup>b</sup></a> or at any rate ill-will, in return for an injury!” This, I say, will be true when it is one man who has inflicted the injury, and a different man who has conferred the benefit; for if it is the same man, the force of the injury is nullified by the benefit conferred. Indeed, a man who ought to be pardoned, even though there were no good deeds credited to him in the past, should receive something more than mere leniency if he commits a wrong when he has a benefit to his credit. I do not set an equal value on benefits and injuries. I reckon a benefit at a higher rate than an injury. Not all grateful persons know what it involves to be in debt for a benefit; even a thoughtless, crude fellow, one of the common herd, may know, especially soon after he has received the gift; but he does not know how deeply he stands in debt therefor. Only the wise man knows exactly what value should be put
