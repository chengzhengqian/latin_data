Most men admire that which deceives them at a distance, and by the crowd good things are supposed to be big things.</p>
<p>Now, lest this happen also in our own case, let us ask what is the Good. It has been explained in various ways; different men have described it in different ways. Some define it in this way: “That which attracts and calls the spirit to itself is a Good.” But the objection at once comes up—what
if it does attract, but straight to ruin? You know how seductive many evils are.
