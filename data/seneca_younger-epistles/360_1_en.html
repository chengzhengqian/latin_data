toughness which matched its bulk, made spears, or any weapon hurled by the hand of man, glance off. It was finally destroyed by rocks equal in size to millstones. Are you, then, hurling petty weapons like yours even against death? Can you stop a lion’s charge by an awl?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL076_259_a" id="target_note_LCL076_259_a"><sup>a</sup></a> Your arguments are indeed sharp; but there is nothing sharper than a stalk of grain.

<h2><span class="ac">LXXXIII. On Drunkenness</span></h2>
<p>You bid me give you an account of each separate day, and of the whole day too; so you must have a good opinion of me if you think that in these days of mine there is nothing to hide. At any rate, it is thus that we should live,—as if we lived in plain sight of all men; and it is thus that we should think,—as if there were someone who could look into our inmost souls; and there is one who can so look. For what avails it that something is hidden from man? Nothing is shut off from the sight of God. He is witness of our souls,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL076_259_b" id="target_note_LCL076_259_b"><sup>b</sup></a> and he comes into the very midst of our thoughts—comes into them, I say, as one who may at any time depart. I shall therefore do as you bid, and shall gladly inform you by letter what I am doing, and in what sequence. I shall keep watching myself continually, and—a most useful habit—shall review each day.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL076_259_c" id="target_note_LCL076_259_c"><sup>c</sup></a> For this is what makes us wicked: that no one of us looks back over his own life. Our thoughts are devoted only to what we are about to do. And yet our plans for the future always depend on the past.</p>
