Your very porridge and water can fall under another’s jurisdiction; and besides, freedom comes, not to him over whom Fortune has slight power, but to him over whom she has no power at all. This is what I mean: you must crave nothing, if you would vie with Jupiter; for Jupiter craves nothing.”</p>
<p>This is what Attalus told us. If you are willing to think often of these things, you will strive not to <span class="italic">seem</span> happy, but to <span class="italic">be</span> happy, and, in addition, to seem happy to yourself rather than to others. Farewell.</p>

But the word which Cicero used seems to me most suitable: he calls them <span class="italic">cavillationes.</span> If a man has surrendered himself to them, he weaves many a tricky subtlety, but makes no progress toward real living; he does not thereby become braver, or more restrained, or loftier of spirit.</p>
