Thence came that most debased of prayers, in which Maecenas<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL077_165_a" id="target_note_LCL077_165_a"><sup>a</sup></a> does not refuse to suffer weakness, deformity, and as a climax the pain of crucifixion—provided only that he may prolong the breath of life amid these sufferings:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL077_165_b" id="target_note_LCL077_165_b"><sup>b</sup></a></p>
