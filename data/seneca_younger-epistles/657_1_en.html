<h2><span class="ac">CXX. More About Virtue</span></h2>
<p>Your letter roamed over several little problems, but finally dwelt upon this alone, asking for explanation: “How do we acquire a knowledge of that which is good and that which is honourable?” In the opinion of other schools,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL077_381_a" id="target_note_LCL077_381_a"><sup>a</sup></a> these two qualities are distinct; among our followers, however, they are merely divided. This is what I mean: Some believe the Good to be that which is useful; they accordingly bestow this title upon riches, horses, wine, and shoes; so cheaply do they view the Good, and to such base uses do they let it descend. They regard as honourable that which agrees with the principle of right conduct—such as taking dutiful care of an old father, relieving a friend’s poverty, showing bravery on a campaign, and uttering prudent and well-balanced opinions. We, however, do make the Good and the honourable two things, but we make them out of one: only the honourable can be good; also, the honourable is necessarily good. I hold it superfluous to add the distinction between these two qualities, inasmuch as I have mentioned it so many times.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL077_381_b" id="target_note_LCL077_381_b"><sup>b</sup></a> But I shall say this one thing—that we regard nothing as good which can be put to wrong use by any person.
