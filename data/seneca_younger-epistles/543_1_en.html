you will find nothing shoddy in his work: his words are well chosen and yet not hunted for; they are not unnaturally inserted and inverted, according to the present-day fashion; but they possess distinction, even though they are taken from ordinary speech. There you have honourable and splendid ideas, not fettered into aphorisms, but spoken with greater freedom. We shall of course notice passages that are not sufficiently pruned, not constructed with sufficient care, and lacking the polish which is in vogue nowadays; but after regarding the whole, you will see that there are no futile subtleties of argument. There may, doubtless, be no variety of marbles, no water-supply<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL077_153_a" id="target_note_LCL077_153_a"><sup>a</sup></a> which flows from one apartment to another, no “pauper-rooms,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL077_153_b" id="target_note_LCL077_153_b"><sup>b</sup></a> or any other device that luxury adds when ill content with simple charms; but, in the vulgar phrase, it is “a good house to live in.”</p>
<p>Furthermore, opinions vary with regard to the style. Some wish it to be polished down from all roughness; and some take so great a pleasure in the abrupt manner that they would intentionally break up any passage which may by chance spread itself out more smoothly, scattering the closing words in such a way that the sentences may result unexpectedly. Read Cicero: his style has unity; it moves with a modulated pace, and is gentle without being degenerate. The style of Asinius Pollio, on the other hand, is “bumpy,” jerky, leaving off when you least expect it.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL077_153_ca" id="target_note_LCL077_153_ca"><sup>c</sup></a> And finally, Cicero always stops gradually; while Pollio breaks off, except in the very few cases where he cleaves to a definite rhythm and a single pattern.</p>

“poor man’s cabin” by way of contrast to their other rooms or as a gesture towards simple living; Seneca uses the phrase figuratively for certain devices in composition.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL077_153_b').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL077_153_ca"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL077_153_ca" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">c</sup>Quintilian x. 1. 113 says: <span class="italic">multa in Asinio Pollione inventio, summa diligentia, adeo ut quibusdam etiam nimia</span> <span class="italic">videatur; et consilii et animi satis; a nitore et iucunditate Ciceronis ita longe abest, ut videri possit saeculo prior.</span></a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL077_153_ca').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
