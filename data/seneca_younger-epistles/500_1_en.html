There is the same difference between philosophical doctrines and precepts as there is between elements and members<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL077_67_a" id="target_note_LCL077_67_a"><sup>a</sup></a>; the latter depend upon the former, while the former are the source both of the latter and of all things.</p>

For that frank, simple virtue has changed into hidden and crafty knowledge; we are taught how to debate, not how to live.” Of course, as you say, the old-fashioned
wisdom, especially in its beginnings, was crude; but so were the other arts, in which dexterity developed with progress. Nor indeed in those days was there yet any need for carefully-planned cures. Wickedness had not yet reached such a high point, or scattered itself so broadcast.
