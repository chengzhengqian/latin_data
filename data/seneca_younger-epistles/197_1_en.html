Of course there are the other <span class="italic">genera</span>: but they are “special” <span class="italic">genera</span>: “man” being, for example, a <span class="italic">genus.</span> For “man” comprises, species: by nations,—Greek, Roman, Parthian; by colours,—white, black, yellow. The term comprises individuals also: Cato, Cicero, Lucretius. So “man” falls into the category <span class="italic">genus,</span> in so far as it includes many kinds; but in so far as it is subordinate to another term, it falls into the category <span class="italic">species.</span> But the <span class="italic">genus</span> “that which exists” is general, and has no term superior to it. It is the first term in the classification of things, and all things are included under it.</p>
<p>The Stoics would set ahead of this still another <span class="italic">genus,</span> even more primary; concerning which I shall immediately speak, after proving that the <span class="italic">genus</span> which has been discussed above, has rightly been placed first, being, as it is, capable of including everything. I therefore distribute “that which exists” into these two species,—things with, and things without, substance. There is no third class. And how do I distribute “substance”? By saying that it is either animate or inanimate. And how do I distribute the “animate”? By saying: “Certain things have mind, while others have only life.” Or the idea may be expressed as follows: “Certain things have the power of movement, of progress, of change of position, while others are rooted in the ground; they are fed and they grow only through their roots.” Again, into what species do I divide “animals”? They are either perishable or imperishable. Certain of the Stoics regard the primary <span class="italic">genus</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL075_395_a" id="target_note_LCL075_395_a"><sup>a</sup></a> as the “something.” I shall add the reasons they give for their belief; they say: “in the order of nature some things exist, and other things do not exist. And even the things that do not exist are really part of the order of
