correct men by pleading. Again, laws frighten one out of communicating crime, while precepts urge a man on to his duty. Besides, the laws also are of assistance towards good conduct, at any rate if they instruct as well as command. On this point I disagree with Posidonius, who says: “I do not think that Plato’s <span class="italic">Laws</span> should have the preambles<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL077_35_a" id="target_note_LCL077_35_a"><sup>a</sup></a> added to them. For a law should be brief, in order that the uninitiated may grasp it all the more easily. It should be a voice, as it were, sent down from heaven; it should command, not discuss. Nothing seems to me more dull or more foolish than a law with a preamble. Warn me, tell me what you wish me to do; I am not learning but obeying.” But laws framed in this way are helpful; hence you will notice that a state with defective laws will have defective morals. “But,” it is said, “they are not of avail in every case.” Well, neither is philosophy; and yet philosophy is not on that account ineffectual and useless in the training of the soul. Furthermore, is not philosophy the Law of Life? Grant, if we will, that the laws do not avail; it does not necessarily follow that advice also should not avail. On this ground, you ought to say that consolation does not avail, and warning, and exhortation, and scolding, and praising; since they are all varieties of advice. It is by such methods that we arrive at a perfect condition of mind. Nothing is more successful in bringing honourable influences to bear upon the mind, or in straightening out the wavering spirit that is prone to evil, than association with good men.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL077_37_b" id="target_note_LCL077_37_b"><sup>b</sup></a> For the frequent seeing, the frequent hearing of them little by little sinks into the heart and acquires the force of precepts.</p>
