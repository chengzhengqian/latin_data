<h2><span class="ac">XLIX. On the Shortness of Life</span></h2>
<p>A man is indeed lazy and careless, my dear Lucilius, if he is reminded of a friend only by seeing some landscape which stirs the memory; and yet there are times when the old familiar haunts stir up a sense of loss that has been stored away in the soul, not bringing back dead memories, but rousing them from their dormant state, just as the sight of a lost friend’s favourite slave, or his cloak, or his house, renews the mourner’s grief, even though it has been softened by time.</p>
<p>Now, lo and behold, Campania, and especially Naples and your beloved Pompeii,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL075_323_a" id="target_note_LCL075_323_a"><sup>a</sup></a> struck me, when I viewed them, with a wonderfully fresh sense of longing for you. You stand in full view before my eyes. I am on the point of parting from you. I see you choking down your tears and resisting without success the emotions that well up at the very moment when you try to check them. I seem to have lost you but a moment ago. For what is not “but a moment ago” when one begins to use the memory? It was but a moment ago that I sat, as a lad, in the school of the philosopher Sotion,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL075_323_b" id="target_note_LCL075_323_b"><sup>b</sup></a> but a moment ago that I began to plead in the courts, but a moment ago that I lost the desire to plead, but a moment ago that I lost the ability. Infinitely swift is the flight of time, as those see more clearly who are looking backwards. For when we are intent on the present, we do not notice it, so gentle is the passage of time’s headlong flight. Do you ask the reason for this? All past time is in the same place; it all presents the same aspect to us, it lies together. Everything slips into the same abyss.
