creation. The purpose is his object in so doing. Do you ask what God’s purpose is? It is goodness. Plato, at any rate, says:” What was God’s reason for creating the world? God is good, and no good person is grudging of anything that is good. Therefore, God made it the best world possible.” Hand down your opinion, then, O judge; state who seems to you to say what is truest, and not who says what is absolutely true. For to do that is as far beyond our ken as truth itself.</p>
