think that Zeno’s syllogism<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL076_255_a" id="target_note_LCL076_255_a"><sup>a</sup></a> is correct, but that the second<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL076_255_a" id="target_note_LCL076_255_a"><sup>a</sup></a> I mentioned, which is set up against his, is deceptive and wrong. But I for my part decline to reduce such questions to a matter of dialectical rules or to the subtleties of an utterly worn-out system. Away, I say, with all that sort of thing, which makes a man feel, when a question is propounded to him, that he is hemmed in, and forces him to admit a premiss, and then makes him say one thing in his answer when his real opinion is another.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL076_255_b" id="target_note_LCL076_255_b"><sup>b</sup></a> When truth is at stake, we must act more frankly; and when fear is to be combated, we must act more bravely.

<p>When a general is about to lead into action an army prepared to meet death for their wives and children, how will he exhort them to battle? I remind you of the Fabii,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL076_255_c" id="target_note_LCL076_255_c"><sup>c</sup></a> who took upon a single clan a war which concerned the whole state. I point out to you the Lacedaemonians in position at the very pass of Thermopylae! They have no hope of victory, no hope of returning. The place where they stand is to be their tomb. In what language do you encourage them to bar the way with their bodies and take upon themselves the ruin of their whole tribe, and to retreat from life rather than from their post? Shall you say: “That which is evil is not glorious; but death is glorious; therefore death is not an evil”? What a powerful discourse! After such words, who would hesitate to throw himself upon the serried spears of the foemen, and die in his tracks? But take Leonidas: how bravely did he address his men! He said: “Fellow-soldiers, let us to our breakfast, knowing that we shall sup in Hades!”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL076_255_d" id="target_note_LCL076_255_d"><sup>d</sup></a> The food
