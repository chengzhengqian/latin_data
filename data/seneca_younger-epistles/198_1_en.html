nature. What these are will readily occur to the mind, for example centaurs, giants, and all other figments of unsound reasoning, which have begun to have a definite shape, although they have no bodily consistency.”</p>
<p>But I now return to the subject which I promised to discuss for you, namely, how it is that Plato<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL075_397_a" id="target_note_LCL075_397_a"><sup>a</sup></a> divides all existing things in six different ways. The first class of “that which exists” cannot be grasped by the sight or by the touch, or by any of the senses; but it can be grasped by the thought. Any generic conception, such as the generic idea “man,” does not come within the range of the eyes; but “man” in particular does; as, for example, Cicero, Cato. The term “animal” is not seen; it is grasped by thought alone. A particular animal, however, is seen, for example, a horse, a dog.</p>
<p>The second class of “things which exist,” according
to Plato, is that which is prominent and stands out above everything else; this, he says, exists in a pre-eminent degree.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL075_397_b" id="target_note_LCL075_397_b"><sup>b</sup></a> The word “poet” is used indiscriminately,
for this term is applied to all writers of verse; but among the Greeks it has come to be the distinguishing mark of a single individual. You know that Homer is meant when you hear men say “the poet.” What, then, is this pre-eminent Being? God, surely, one who is greater and more powerful than anyone else.</p>
<p>The third class is made up of those things which exist in the proper sense of the term<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL075_397_c" id="target_note_LCL075_397_c"><sup>c</sup></a>; they are countless in number, but are situated beyond our sight. “What are these?” you ask. They are Plato’s own furniture, so to speak; he calls them “ideas,” and from them all visible things are created, and according to their pattern all things are fashioned.
