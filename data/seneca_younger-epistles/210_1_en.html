literature that has no power to heal; all these men are led astray by delights which are deceptive and short-lived—like drunkenness for example, which pays for a single hour of hilarious madness by a sickness of many days, or like applause and the popularity of enthusiastic approval which are gained, and atoned for, at the cost of great mental disquietude.</p>
<p>Reflect, therefore, on this, that the effect of wisdom is a joy that is unbroken and continuous.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL075_421_a" id="target_note_LCL075_421_a"><sup>a</sup></a> The mind of the wise man is like the ultra-lunar firmament<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL075_421_b" id="target_note_LCL075_421_b"><sup>b</sup></a>; eternal calm pervades that region.

<p class="noindent">Pleasure-lovers spend every night amid false-glittering
