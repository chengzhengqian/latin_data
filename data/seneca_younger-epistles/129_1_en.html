Reason grows in the same way; it is not large to the outward view, but increases as it does its work. Few words are spoken; but if the mind has truly caught them, they come into their strength and spring up.

Then of itself the mind also will produce bounteously in its turn, giving back more than it has received. Farewell.</p>

Seneca deprecates the use of the “cram,” which is only a memory-help, as a substitute for reading, on the ground that by its use one does not, in the first place, learn the subject, and, in the second place and chiefly, that one loses the inspiration to be derived by direct contact with great thinkers.
