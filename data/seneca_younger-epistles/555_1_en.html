agree are unsound. Moreover, those who are false are never steadfast: they are irregular and discordant. “But praise,” says the objector, “is nothing but an utterance, and an utterance is not a good.” When they<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL077_177_a" id="target_note_LCL077_177_a"><sup>a</sup></a> say that renown is praise bestowed on the good by the good, what they refer to is not an utterance but a judgment. For a good man may remain silent; but if he decides that a certain person is worthy of praise, that person is the object of praise. Besides, praise is one thing, and the giving of praise another; the latter demands utterance also. Hence no one speaks of “a funeral praise,” but says “praise-giving”—for its function depends upon speech. And when we say that a man is worthy of praise, we assure human kindness to him, not in words, but in judgment. So the good opinion, even of one who in silence feels inward approval of a good man, is praise.</p>
<p>Again, as I have said, praise is a matter of the mind rather than of the speech; for speech brings out the praise that the mind has conceived, and publishes it forth to the attention of the many. To judge a man worthy of praise, is to praise him. And when our tragic poet<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL077_177_b" id="target_note_LCL077_177_b"><sup>b</sup></a> sings to us that it is wonderful “to be praised by a well-praised hero,” he means, “by one who is worthy of praise.” Again, when an equally venerable bard says:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL077_177_c" id="target_note_LCL077_177_c"><sup>c</sup></a> “Praise nurtureth the arts,” he does not mean the giving of praise, for that spoils the arts. Nothing has corrupted oratory and all other studies that depend on hearing so much as popular approval.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL077_177_d" id="target_note_LCL077_177_d"><sup>d</sup></a> Reputation necessarily demands words, but renown can be content with men’s judgments, and suffice without the spoken
