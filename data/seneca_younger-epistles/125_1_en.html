<p>If your friend had been born in Parthia, he would have begun, when a child, to bend the bow; if in Germany, he would forthwith have been brandishing his slender spear; if he had been born in the days of our forefathers, he would have learned to ride a horse and smite his enemy hand to hand. These are the occupations which the system of each race recommends to the individual,—yes, prescribes for him. To what, then, shall this friend<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL075_251_a" id="target_note_LCL075_251_a"><sup>a</sup></a> of yours devote his attention? I say, let him learn that which is helpful against all weapons, against every kind of foe,—contempt of death; because no one doubts that death has in it something that inspires terror, so that it shocks even our souls, which nature has so moulded that they love their own existence; for otherwise<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL075_251_b" id="target_note_LCL075_251_b"><sup>b</sup></a> there would be no need to prepare ourselves, and to whet our courage, to face that towards which we should move with a sort of voluntary instinct, precisely as all men tend to preserve their existence. No man learns a thing in order that, if necessity arises, he may lie down with composure upon a bed of roses; but he steels his courage to this end,—that
he may not surrender his plighted faith to torture, and that, if need be, he may some day stay out his watch in the trenches, even though wounded, without even leaning on his spear; because sleep is likely to creep over men who support themselves by any prop whatsoever.</p>
<p>In death there is nothing harmful; for there must exist something to which it is harmful.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL075_251_ca" id="target_note_LCL075_251_ca"><sup>c</sup></a> And yet, if you are possessed by so great a craving for a longer life, reflect that none of the objects which vanish from our gaze and are re-absorbed into the

Seneca has in mind the argument of Epicurus (Diogenes Laërtius, x. 124–5): “Therefore the most dread-inspiring of all evils, death, is nothing to us; for when we exist, death is not present to us, and when death is present, then we do not exist. Therefore it does not concern either the living or the dead; for to the living it has no existence, and the dead do not themselves exist.”
Lucretius uses this argument, concluding it with (iii. 830): <span class="italic">Nil igitur mors est ad nos neque pertinet hilum.</span></a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL075_251_ca').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
