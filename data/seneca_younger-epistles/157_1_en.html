deliberation is necessary in settling than in propounding a problem! And this is particularly true when one thing is advantageous to you and another to me. Am I speaking again in the guise of an Epicurean<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL075_315_a" id="target_note_LCL075_315_a"><sup>a</sup></a>? But the fact is, the same thing is advantageous to me which is advantageous to you; for I am not your friend unless whatever is at issue concerning you is my concern also. Friendship produces between us a partnership in all our interests. There is no such thing as good or bad fortune for the individual; we live in common. And no one can live happily who has regard to himself alone and transforms everything into a question of his own utility; you must live for your neighbour, if you would live for yourself.

could not regard a friend’s advantage as identical with one’s own advantage. And yet they laid great stress upon friend-ship
as one of the chief sources of pleasure. For an attempt to reconcile these two positions see Cicero, <span class="italic">De Finibus,</span> i. 65 ff. Seneca has inadvertently used a phrase that implies a difference between a friend’s interests and one’s own. This leads him to reassert the Stoic view of friendship, which adopted as its motto κοινὰ τὰ τῶν φίλων.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL075_315_a').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
