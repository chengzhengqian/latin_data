a different subject matter. Some have added a department for which they use the Greek term “economics,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL076_385_a" id="target_note_LCL076_385_a"><sup>a</sup></a> the science of managing one’s own household. Still others have made a distinct heading
for the various kinds of life.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL076_385_b" id="target_note_LCL076_385_b"><sup>b</sup></a> There is no one of these subdivisions, however, which will not be found under the branch called “moral” philosophy.</p>
<p>The Epicureans<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL076_385_c" id="target_note_LCL076_385_c"><sup>c</sup></a> held that philosophy was two-fold,
natural and moral; they did away with the rational branch. Then, when they were compelled by the facts themselves to distinguish between equivocal ideas and to expose fallacies that lay hidden under the cloak of truth, they themselves also introduced a heading to which they give the name “forensic and regulative,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL076_385_d" id="target_note_LCL076_385_d"><sup>d</sup></a> which is merely “rational” under another name, although they hold that this section is accessory to the department
of “natural” philosophy. The Cyrenaic<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL076_385_e" id="target_note_LCL076_385_e"><sup>e</sup></a> school abolished the natural as well as the rational department, and were content with the moral side alone; and yet these philosophers also include under another title that which they have rejected. For they divide moral philosophy into five parts: (1) What to avoid and what to seek, (2) The Passions, (3) Actions, (4) Causes, (5) Proofs. Now the causes of things really belong to the “natural” division, the proofs to the “rational.” Aristo<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL076_385_f" id="target_note_LCL076_385_f"><sup>f</sup></a> of Chios remarked that the natural and the rational were not only superfluous, but were also contradictory. He even limited the “moral,” which was all that was
