What I see, is <span class="italic">body</span>, and upon this I concentrate my eyes and my mind. Again, I say: ‘Cato walks.’ What I say,” they continue, “is not body: it is a certain declarative fact concerning body—called variously an ‘utterance,’ a ‘declaration,’ a ‘statement.’ Thus, when we say ‘wisdom,’ we mean something <span class="italic">pertaining</span> to body: when we say <span class="italic">‘he is wise,</span>’ we are speaking <span class="italic">concerning</span> body.

I remarked a little while ago that a “field” was one thing, and the “possession of a field” another: of course, for possessor and possessed are of different natures: the latter is the land, and the former is the man who owns the land. But with regard to the point now under discussion, both are of the same nature—the possessor of wisdom, and wisdom itself.
