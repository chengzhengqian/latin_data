<p>In the first place, therefore, if you approve, I shall draw the distinction between wisdom and philosophy. Wisdom is the perfect good of the human mind; philosophy is the love of wisdom, and the endeavour to attain it. The latter strives toward the goal which the former has already reached. And it is clear why philosophy was so called. For it acknowledges by its very name the object of its love.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL076_381_a" id="target_note_LCL076_381_a"><sup>a</sup></a> Certain persons have defined wisdom as the knowledge of things divine and things human.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL076_381_b" id="target_note_LCL076_381_b"><sup>b</sup></a> Still others say: “Wisdom is knowing things divine and things human, and their causes also.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL076_381_c" id="target_note_LCL076_381_c"><sup>c</sup></a> This added phrase seems to me to be superfluous, since the causes of things divine and things human are a part of the divine system. Philosophy also has been defined in various ways; some have called it “the study of virtue,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL076_381_d" id="target_note_LCL076_381_d"><sup>d</sup></a> others have referred to it as “a study of the way to amend the mind,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL076_381_e" id="target_note_LCL076_381_e"><sup>e</sup></a> and some have named it “the search for right reason.” One thing is practically settled, that there is some difference between philosophy and wisdom. Nor indeed is it possible that that which is sought and that which seeks are identical. As there is a great difference between avarice and wealth, the one being the subject of the craving and the other its object, so between philosophy and wisdom. For the one is a result and a reward of the other. Philosophy does the going, and wisdom is the goal. Wisdom is that which the Greeks call σοφία. The Romans also were wont to use this word in the sense in which they now use “philosophy” also. This will be proved to your satisfaction by our old national
