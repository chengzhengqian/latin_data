<p>You will bring suit against me, I feel sure, when I set forth for you to-day’s little problem, with which we have already fumbled long enough. You will cry out again: “What has this to do with character?” Cry out if you like, but let me first of all match you with other opponents,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL077_397_a" id="target_note_LCL077_397_a"><sup>a</sup></a> against whom you may bring suit—such as Posidonius and Archidemus;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL077_397_b" id="target_note_LCL077_397_b"><sup>b</sup></a> these men will stand trial. I shall then go on to say that whatever deals with character does not necessarily produce good character. Man needs one thing for his food, another for his exercise, another for his clothing, another for his instruction, and another for his pleasure. Everything, however, has reference to man’s needs, although everything does not make him better. Character is affected by different things in different ways: some things serve to correct and regulate character, and others investigate its nature and origin. And when I seek the reason why Nature brought forth man, and why she set him above other animals, do you suppose that I have left character-study in the rear? No; that is wrong. For how are you to know what character is desirable, unless you have discovered what is best suited to man? Or unless you have studied his nature? You can find out what you should do and what you should avoid, only when you have learned what you owe to your own nature.</p>

Prove to me that so-called felicity is fickle and empty, and that the word easily admits of a syllable’s increase.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL077_397_c" id="target_note_LCL077_397_c"><sup>c</sup></a> I shall fulfil your want, encouraging
