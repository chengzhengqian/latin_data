Nothing becomes offensive so quickly as grief; when fresh, it finds someone to console it and attracts one or another to itself; but after becoming chronic, it is ridiculed, and rightly. For it is either assumed or foolish.</p>
<p>He who writes these words to you is no other than I, who wept so excessively for my dear friend Annaeus Serenus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL075_437_a" id="target_note_LCL075_437_a"><sup>a</sup></a> that, in spite of my wishes, I must be included among the examples of men who have been overcome by grief. To-day, however, I condemn
this act of mine, and I understand that the reason why I lamented so greatly was chiefly that I had never imagined it possible for his death to precede
mine. The only thought which occurred to my mind was that he was the younger, and much younger, too,—as if the Fates kept to the order of our ages!</p>
<p>Therefore let us continually think as much about our own mortality as about that of all those we love. In former days I ought to have said: “My friend Serenus is younger than I; but what does that matter? He would naturally die after me, but he may precede me.” It was just because I did not do this that I was unprepared when Fortune dealt me the sudden blow. Now is the time for you to reflect, not only that all things are mortal, but also that their mortality is subject to no fixed law. Whatever can happen at any time can happen to-day. Let us therefore reflect, my beloved Lucilius, that we shall soon come to the goal which this friend, to our own sorrow, has reached. And perhaps, if only the tale told by wise men is true<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL075_437_b" id="target_note_LCL075_437_b"><sup>b</sup></a> and there is a bourne to welcome us, then he whom we think we have lost has only been sent on ahead. Farewell.</p>
