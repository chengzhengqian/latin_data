are aware, one should not always cling. For mere living is not a good, but living well. Accordingly, the wise man will live as long as he ought, not as long as he can.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL076_59_a" id="target_note_LCL076_59_a"><sup>a</sup></a> He will mark in what place, with whom, and how he is to conduct his existence, and what he is about to do.
