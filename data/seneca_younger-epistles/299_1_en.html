unless he has leaped over the intervening years, and has projected himself into the trouble that is destined to arrive a generation later. In the same way, souls that enjoy being sick and that seize upon excuses for sorrow are saddened by events long past and effaced from the records. Past and future are both absent; we feel neither of them. But there can be no pain except as the result of what you feel. Farewell.</p>

<h2><span class="ac">LXXV. On the Diseases of the Soul</span></h2>
<p>You have been complaining that my letters to you are rather carelessly written. Now who talks carefully unless he also desires to talk affectedly<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL076_137_a" id="target_note_LCL076_137_a"><sup>a</sup></a>? I prefer that my letters should be just what my conversation<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL076_137_b" id="target_note_LCL076_137_b"><sup>b</sup></a> would be if you and I were sitting in one another’s company or taking walks together,—spontaneous
and easy; for my letters have nothing strained or artificial about them. If it were possible, I should prefer to show, rather than speak, my feelings. Even if I were arguing a point, I should not stamp my foot, or toss my arms about, or raise my voice; but I should leave that sort of thing to the orator, and should be content to have conveyed my feelings to you without having either embellished them or lowered their dignity. I should like to convince you entirely of this one fact,—that I feel whatever I say, that I not only feel it, but am wedded to it. It is one sort of kiss which a man gives his mistress, and another which he gives his children; yet in the father’s embrace also, holy and restrained as it is, plenty of affection is disclosed.</p>
