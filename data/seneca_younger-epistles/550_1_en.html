he mean by begging so vilely for life? He cannot ever have heard Vergil read the words:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">Tell me, is Death so wretched as that?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL077_167_a" id="target_note_LCL077_167_a"><sup>a</sup></a></span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">He asks for the climax of suffering, and—what is still harder to bear—prolongation and extension of suffering; and what does he gain thereby? Merely the boon of a longer existence. But what sort of life is a lingering death? Can anyone be found who would prefer wasting away in pain, dying limb by limb, or letting out his life drop by drop, rather than expiring once for all? Can any man be found willing to be fastened to the accursed tree,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL077_167_b" id="target_note_LCL077_167_b"><sup>b</sup></a> long sickly, already deformed, swelling with ugly tumours on chest and shoulders, and draw the breath of life amid long-drawn-out agony? I think he would have many excuses for dying even before mounting the cross!</p>
<p>Deny, now, if you can, that Nature is very generous in making death inevitable. Many men have been prepared to enter upon still more shameful bargains: to betray friends in order to live longer themselves, or voluntarily to debase their children and so enjoy the light of day which is witness of all their sins, We must get rid of this craving for life, and learn that it makes no difference when your suffering comes, because at some time you are bound to suffer. The point is, not how long you live, but how nobly you live. And often this living nobly means that you cannot live long. Farewell.</p>
