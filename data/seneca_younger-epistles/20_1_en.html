<p>When I commune in such terms with myself and with future generations, do you not think that I am doing more good than when I appear as counsel in court, or stamp my seal upon a will, or lend my assistance in the senate, by word or action, to a candidate? Believe me, those who seem to be busied with nothing are busied with the greater tasks; they are dealing at the same time with things mortal and things immortal.</p>
<p>But I must stop, and pay my customary contribution, to balance this letter.

What a quantity of sagacious verses lie buried in the mime! How many of Publilius’s lines are worthy of being spoken by buskin-clad actors, as well as by wearers of the slipper<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL075_41_e" id="target_note_LCL075_41_e"><sup>e</sup></a>!
