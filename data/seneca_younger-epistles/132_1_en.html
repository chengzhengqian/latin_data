real evidences, of an absent friend! For that which is sweetest when we meet face to face is afforded by the impress of a friend’s hand upon his letter,—recognition.</p>
<p>You write me that you heard a lecture by the philosopher Serapio,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL075_265_a" id="target_note_LCL075_265_a"><sup>a</sup></a> when he landed at your present place of residence. “He is wont,” you say, “to wrench up his words with a mighty rush, and he does not let them flow forth one by one, but makes them crowd and dash upon each other.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL075_265_b" id="target_note_LCL075_265_b"><sup>b</sup></a> For the words come in such quantity that a single voice is inadequate to utter them.” I do not approve of this in a philosopher; his speech, like his life, should be composed; and nothing that rushes headlong and is hurried is well ordered.
