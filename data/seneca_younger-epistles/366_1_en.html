how often the drunkard does things which make him blush when he is sober; state that drunkenness<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL076_271_a" id="target_note_LCL076_271_a"><sup>a</sup></a> is nothing but a condition of insanity purposely assumed. Prolong the drunkard’s condition to several days; will you have any doubt about his madness? Even as it is, the madness is no less; it merely lasts a shorter time. Think of Alexander of Macedon,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL076_271_b" id="target_note_LCL076_271_b"><sup>b</sup></a> who stabbed Clitus, his dearest and most loyal friend, at a banquet; after Alexander understood what he had done, he wished to die, and assuredly he ought to have died.</p>
<p>Drunkenness kindles and discloses every kind of vice, and removes the sense of shame that veils our evil undertakings.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL076_271_c" id="target_note_LCL076_271_c"><sup>c</sup></a> For more men abstain from forbidden actions because they are ashamed of sinning than because their inclinations are good. When the strength of wine has become too great and has gained control over the mind, every lurking evil comes forth from its hiding-place. Drunkenness does not create vice, it merely brings it into view; at such times the lustful man does not wait even for the privacy of a bedroom, but without postponement gives free play to the demands of his passions; at such times the unchaste man proclaims and publishes his malady; at such times your cross-grained fellow does not restrain his tongue or his hand. The haughty man increases his arrogance, the ruthless man his cruelty, the slanderer his spitefulness. Every vice is given free play and comes to the front. Besides, we forget who we are, we utter words that are halting and poorly enunciated, the glance is unsteady, the step falters, the head is dizzy, the very ceiling moves about as if a cyclone were whirling the whole house, and the stomach suffers torture when the wine generates gas and causes our very bowels to swell.
