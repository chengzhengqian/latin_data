two separate things and yet granted by you to be equally good. And just as there is no objection to regarding both wisdom and the possessor of wisdom as Goods, so there is no objection to regarding as a good both wisdom and the possession of wisdom,—in
other words, <span class="italic">being wise.</span> For I only wish to be a wise man in order to <span class="italic">be wise</span>. And what then? Is not that thing a Good without the possession of which a certain other thing cannot be a Good? You surely admit that wisdom, if given without the right to be used, is not to be welcomed!

If processes of torture are evil, then being tortured is an evil—with
this reservation, indeed, that if you take away the consequences, the former are not evil. Wisdom is a condition of “mind perfected,” and <span class="italic">being wise</span> is the employment of this “mind perfected.” How can the employment of that thing not be a Good, which without employment is not a Good? If I ask you whether wisdom is to be desired, you admit that it is. If I ask you whether the employment of wisdom is to be desired, you also admit the fact; for you say that you will not receive wisdom if you are not allowed to employ it. Now that which is to be desired is a Good. <span class="italic">Being wise</span> is the employment of wisdom, just as it is of eloquence to make a speech, or of the eyes to see things. Therefore, <span class="italic">being wise</span> is the employment of wisdom, and the employment of wisdom is to be desired. Therefore <span class="italic">being wise</span> is a thing to be desired: and if it is a thing to be desired, it is a Good.</p>
