<p>When people sit by the bedsides of their sick friends, we honour their motives. But when people do this for the purpose of attaining a legacy,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL077_87_a" id="target_note_LCL077_87_a"><sup>a</sup></a> they are like vultures waiting for carrion. The same act may be either shameful or honourable: the purpose and the manner make all the difference.
