shrink from work; ask for it. “But,” you say, “is not trifling and superfluous work, and work that has been inspired by ignoble causes, a bad sort of work?” No; no more than that which is expended upon noble endeavours, since the very quality that endures toil and rouses itself to hard and uphill effort, is of the spirit, which says: “Why do you grow slack? It is not the part of a man to fear sweat.” And besides this, in order that virtue may be perfect, there should be an even temperament and a scheme of life that is consistent with itself throughout; and this result cannot be attained without knowledge of things, and without the art<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL075_227_a" id="target_note_LCL075_227_a"><sup>a</sup></a> which enables us to understand things human and things divine. That is the greatest good. If you seize this good, you begin to be the associate of the gods, and not their suppliant.</p>
<p>“But how,” you ask, “does one attain that goal?” You do not need to cross the Pennine or Graian<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL075_227_b" id="target_note_LCL075_227_b"><sup>b</sup></a> hills, or traverse the Candavian<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL075_227_c" id="target_note_LCL075_227_c"><sup>c</sup></a> waste, or face the Syrtes,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL075_227_d" id="target_note_LCL075_227_d"><sup>d</sup></a> or Scylla, or Charybdis, although you have travelled through all these places for the bribe of a petty governorship; the journey for which nature has equipped you is safe and pleasant. She has given you such gifts that you may, if you do not prove false to them, rise level with God. Your money, however, will not place you on a level with God; for God has no property. Your bordered robe<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL075_227_e" id="target_note_LCL075_227_e"><sup>e</sup></a> will not do this; for God is not clad in raiment; nor will your reputation, nor a display of self, nor a knowledge of your name wide - spread throughout the world; for no one has knowledge of God; many even hold him in low esteem, and do not suffer for so doing. The throng of slaves which carries your litter along the city streets and in foreign places
