the word when we wish to indicate a happy state of mind. I am aware that if we test words by our formula,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL075_411_a" id="target_note_LCL075_411_a"><sup>a</sup></a> even pleasure is a thing of ill repute, and joy can be attained only by the wise. For “joy” is an elation of spirit,—of a spirit which trusts in the goodness and truth of its own possessions. The common usage, however, is that we derive great “joy” from a friend’s position as consul, or from his marriage, or from the birth of his child; but these events, so far from being matters of joy, are more often the beginnings of sorrow to come. No, it is a characteristic of real joy that it never ceases, and never changes into its opposite.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL075_411_b" id="target_note_LCL075_411_b"><sup>b</sup></a></p>
<p>Accordingly, when our Vergil speaks of</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">The evil joys of the mind,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL075_411_c" id="target_note_LCL075_411_c"><sup>c</sup></a></span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p>his words are eloquent, but not strictly appropriate. For no “joy” can be evil. He has given the name “joy” to pleasures, and has thus expressed his meaning. For he has conveyed the idea that men take delight in their own evil. Nevertheless, I was not wrong in saying that I received great “pleasure” from your letter; for although an ignorant<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL075_411_d" id="target_note_LCL075_411_d"><sup>d</sup></a> man may derive “joy” if the cause be an honourable one, yet, since his emotion is wayward, and is likely soon to take another direction, I call it “pleasure”; for it is inspired by an opinion concerning a spurious good; it exceeds control and is carried to excess.</p>
<p>But, to return to the subject, let me tell you what delighted me in your letter. You have your words under control. You are not carried away by your language, or borne beyond the limits which you have determined upon. Many writers are tempted by the charm of some alluring phrase to some topic
