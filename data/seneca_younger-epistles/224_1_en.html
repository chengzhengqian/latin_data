or do you think that we should avoid including, among the causes of a thing which has been made, that element without which the thing in question would not have been made?</p>
<p>To these four Plato adds a fifth cause,—the pattern which he himself calls the “idea”; for it is this that the artist gazed upon<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL075_449_a" id="target_note_LCL075_449_a"><sup>a</sup></a> when he created the work which he had decided to carry out. Now it makes no difference whether he has his pattern outside himself, that he may direct his glance to it, or within himself, conceived and placed there by himself. God has within himself these patterns of all things, and his mind comprehends the harmonies and the measures of the whole totality of things which are to be carried out; he is filled with these shapes which Plato calls the “ideas,”—imperishable, unchangeable, not subject to decay. And therefore, though men die, humanity itself, or the idea of man, according to which man is moulded, lasts on, and though men toil and perish, it suffers no change. Accordingly, there are five causes, as Plato says<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL075_449_b" id="target_note_LCL075_449_b"><sup>b</sup></a>: the material, the agent, the make-up, the model, and the end in view. Last comes the result of all these. Just as in the case of the statue,—to go back to the figure with which we began,—the material is the bronze, the agent is the artist, the make-up is the form which is adapted to the material, the model is the pattern imitated by the agent, the end in view is the purpose in the maker’s mind, and, finally, the result of all these is the statue itself. The universe also, in Plato’s opinion, possesses all these elements. The agent is God; the source, matter; the form, the shape and the arrangement of the visible world. The pattern is doubtless the model according to which God has made this great and most beautiful
