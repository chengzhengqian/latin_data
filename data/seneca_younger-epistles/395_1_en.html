<p>Marcus Cato the Censor, whose existence helped the state as much as did Scipio’s,—for while Scipio fought against our enemies, Cato fought against our bad morals,—used to ride a donkey, and a donkey, at that, which carried saddle-bags containing the master’s necessaries. O how I should love to see him meet to-day on the road one of our coxcombs,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL076_329_a" id="target_note_LCL076_329_a"><sup>a</sup></a> with his outriders and Numidians, and a great cloud of dust before him! Your dandy would no doubt seem refined and well-attended in comparison with Marcus Cato,—your dandy, who, in the midst of all his luxurious paraphernalia, is chiefly concerned whether to turn his hand to the sword or to the hunting-knife.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL076_329_b" id="target_note_LCL076_329_b"><sup>b</sup></a>

I see that there will be no end in dealing with such a theme unless I make an end myself. So
