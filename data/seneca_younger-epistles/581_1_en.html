and to attend uncomplainingly upon the God under whose guidance everything progresses; for it is a bad soldier who grumbles when following his commander. For this reason we should welcome our orders with energy and vigour, nor should we cease to follow the natural course of this most beautiful universe, into which all our future sufferings are woven.</p>
<p>Let us address Jupiter, the pilot of this world-mass,
as did our great Cleanthes in those most eloquent lines—lines which I shall allow myself to render in Latin, after the example of the eloquent Cicero. If you like them, make the most of them; if they displease you, you will understand that I have simply been following the practice of Cicero:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">Lead me, O Master of the lofty heavens,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">My Father, whithersoever thou shalt wish.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>

<span class="line">In sin and sorrow what I might have done</span><span class="linebreak"></span>

Here is your great soul—the man who has given himself over to Fate; on the other hand, that man is a weakling and a degenerate who struggles and maligns the order of the universe and would rather reform the gods than reform himself. Farewell.</p>
