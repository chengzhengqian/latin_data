impairing my standing among them, nor can I subscribe to such ideas without impairing my conscience. Your query is, whether the Stoic belief is true; that wisdom is a Good, but that <span class="italic">being wise</span> is not a Good.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL077_339_a" id="target_note_LCL077_339_a"><sup>a</sup></a> I shall first set forth the Stoic view, and then I shall be bold enough to deliver my own opinion.</p>
<p>We of the Stoic school believe that the Good is corporeal, because the Good is active, and whatever is active is corporeal. That which is good, is helpful. But, in order to be helpful, it must be active; so, if it is active, it is corporeal. They (the Stoics) declare that wisdom is a Good; it therefore follows that one must also call wisdom corporeal. But they do not think that <span class="italic">being wise</span> can be rated on the same basis.

<p>“What, then?” is the reply; “Why do we not say that <span class="italic">being wise</span> is a Good?” We do say so; but only by referring it to that on which it depends—in other words, wisdom itself. Let me tell you what answers other philosophers make to these objectors, before I myself begin to form my own creed and to take my place entirely on another side. “Judged in that light,” they say, “not even <span class="italic">living happily</span> is a Good. Willy nilly, such persons ought to reply that the happy life is a Good, but that <span class="italic">living happily</span> is not a Good.” And this objection is also raised against our school: “You wish to be wise. Therefore, <span class="italic">being wise</span> is a thing to be desired. And if it be a thing to be desired, it is a Good.” So our philosophers are forced to twist their words and insert another syllable into the word “desired,”—a syllable which our language does not normally allow to be
