<h2><span class="ac">LI. On Baiae and Morals</span></h2>
<p>Every man does the best he can, my dear Lucilius! You over there have Etna,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL075_337_a" id="target_note_LCL075_337_a"><sup>a</sup></a> that lofty and most celebrated mountain of Sicily; (although I cannot make out why Messala,—or was it Valgius? for I have been reading in both,—has called it “unique,” inasmuch as many regions belch forth fire, not merely the lofty ones where the phenomenon is more frequent,—presumably because fire rises to the greatest possible height,—but low-lying places also.) As for myself, I do the best I can; I have had to be satisfied with Baiae<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL075_337_b" id="target_note_LCL075_337_b"><sup>b</sup></a>; and I left it the day after I reached it; for Baiae is a place to be avoided, because, though it has certain natural advantages, luxury has claimed it for her own exclusive resort. “What then,” you say, “should any place be singled out as an object of aversion?” Not at all. But just as, to the wise and upright man, one style of clothing is more suitable than another, without his having an aversion for any particular colour, but because he thinks that some colours do not befit one who has adopted the simple life; so there are places also, which the wise man or he who is on the way toward wisdom will avoid as foreign to good morals. Therefore, if he is contemplating withdrawal from the world, he will not select Canopus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL075_337_c" id="target_note_LCL075_337_c"><sup>c</sup></a> (although Canopus does not keep any man from living simply), nor Baiae either; for both places have begun to be resorts of vice. At Canopus luxury pampers itself to the utmost degree; at Baiae it is even more lax, as if the place itself demanded a certain amount of licence.</p>
<p>We ought to select abodes which are wholesome
