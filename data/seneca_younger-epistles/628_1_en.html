not, after much contemplation of a far superior countenance, surpassing those which we are wont to look upon, mild-eyed and yet flashing with life-giving fire—should we not then, I say, in reverence and awe, give utterance to those famous lines of our poet Vergil:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">O maiden, words are weak! Thy face is more</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Than mortal, and thy voice rings sweeter far</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Than mortal man’s; . . . . . . . . . . . . . .</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Blest be thou; and, whoe’er thou art, relieve</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Our heavy burdens.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL077_323_a" id="target_note_LCL077_323_a"><sup>a</sup></a></span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">And such a vision will indeed be a present help and relief to us, if we are willing to worship it. But this worship does not consist in slaughtering fattened bulls, or in hanging up offerings of gold or silver, or in pouring coins into a temple treasury; rather does it consist in a will that is reverent and upright.</p>
<p>There is none of us, I declare to you, who would not burn with love for this vision of virtue, if only he had the privilege of beholding it; for now there are many things that cut off our vision, piercing it with too strong a light, or clogging it with too much darkness. If, however, as certain drugs are wont to be used for sharpening and clearing the eyesight, we are likewise willing to free our mind’s eye from hindrances, we shall then be able to perceive virtue, though it be buried in the body—even though poverty stand in the way, and even though lowliness and disgrace block the path. We shall then, I say, behold that true beauty, no matter if it be smothered by unloveliness. Conversely, we shall get a view of evil and the deadening influences of a sorrow-laden soul—in spite of the hindrance that results from the widespread gleam of riches that flash round about, and in spite of the false light—of official position
