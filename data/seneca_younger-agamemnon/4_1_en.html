<span class="line indent2">They desire to be feared and dread to be feared;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">no safe respite is afforded them</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">by gracious night,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">no ease comes to their hearts from sleep,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">tamer of cares.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent3">What citadels have answering crimes</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">not plunged in ruin,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">or kindred wars not weakened?</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">Right and shame</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">and the hallowed loyalties of marriage</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">abandon palaces;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">in place of these</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">comes grim Bellona with bloodstained hand</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">and the Erinys that dogs the proud,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">always attending immoderate homesâ€”</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">homes that any hour can bring</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">from on high to the ground.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent3">Though weapons sleep and treacheries cease,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">greatness sinks by its very weight,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">good fortune is a burden that crushes itself.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">Sails that are filled with favoring southerlies</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">fear the winds that are all too helpful;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">with its head thrust up to the very clouds</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">a tower is thrashed by rainy Auster,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">and a grove that casts a heavy shade</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">sees its ancient tree trunks shattered;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">the lofty hills are struck by lightning,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">larger physiques are prone to disease,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">and while the common</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">cattle run out to roam and graze,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">the loftiest neck is chosen for the ax.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">Whatever Fortune raises on high,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">she lifts to cast down.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
