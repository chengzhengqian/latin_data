a sheer headland that looks out on two seas, right and left: on one side to your Pelops’ shores and the Isthmus, whose narrow, recurving ground keeps the Ionian sea apart from Phrixus’; on the other side to Lemnos, famous for crime, Chalcis, and Aulis delayer of ships. On this headland Palamedes’ father, that criminal, took up position. Shining a bright light from the summit, he led the fleet onto the crags with that treacherous beacon. Ships stuck fast on the jagged rocks. Some, with insufficient draft, broke up in the shallows; the front half of one carried away, with the other half sitting on the reef; one ship, trying to back away, was struck by another, both wrecked and wrecking. Now the ships feared the land, and preferred the sea. Toward dawn the madness subsided. Now that atonement had been made for Ilium, Phoebus returned, and the gloomy day revealed the havoc of the night.</p>
