I should recover loyalty and chastity, for the path to goodness is never too late. One who repents of wrongdoing is virtually innocent.</p></div><div class="sp"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">aegisthus</span></span><p class="lineGroup noindent">What crazy impulse is this? Do you believe or hope you can have a faithful marriage with Agamemnon? Even if there were no secrets in your mind to cause grave fears, yet his good fortune, haughty and overblown, would give rise to swollen arrogance. He was overbearing to associates while Troy still stood: what do you think Troy’s fall has added to a spirit that is naturally harsh? He was king of Mycenae, he will return as tyrant; success swells men’s minds. Around him spreads a crowd of mistresses, approaching with such pomp! But one stands out from the crowd and clasps the king—the handmaid of the prophetic god. Will you endure being bested and sharing your marriage bed? <span class="italic">She</span> will not! The worst disaster for a wife is to have a mistress openly in control of the marital household. Neither thrones nor marriages can endure a partner.</p></div><div class="sp"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">clytemnestra</span></span><p class="lineGroup noindent">Aegisthus, why drive me toward the abyss once more, and inflame my anger as it dies down? The conqueror has allowed himself some freedom with a captive: one should not take notice of this either as wife or lady of the house. There is one law for a throne, another with regard to a private man’s bed. Then too my spirit does not allow me to judge my husband severely, through awareness of my own dishonor. Forgiveness should be granted readily by one who needs forgiveness.</p></div><notes></notes></section>
