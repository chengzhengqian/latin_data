solely on the basis of bodily beauty. Meanwhile, dressed in the garb of an attendant at the sacrifice, he slaughtered the sacrificial victims. He fought in the arena with foils, but sometimes, with his chamberlains acting as gladiators, with sharpened swords. By this time Perennis had secured all the power for himself. He slew whomsoever he wished to slay, plundered a great number, violated every law, and put all the booty into his own pocket.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_277_1" id="target_note_LCL139_277_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Commodus, for his part, killed his sister Lucilla, after banishing her to Capri. After debauching his other sisters, as it is said, he formed an amour with a cousin of his father,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_277_2" id="target_note_LCL139_277_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and even gave the name of his mother to one of his concubines. His wife,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_277_3" id="target_note_LCL139_277_3"><sup>3</sup></a> whom he caught in adultery, he drove from his house, then banished her, and later put her to death. By his orders his concubines were debauched before his own eyes, and he was not free from the disgrace of intimacy with young men, defiling every part of his body in dealings with persons of either sex.</p>

And not a few provincials, for the sake of their riches, were charged with crimes by Perennis and then plundered or even slain; and some, against whom there was not even the imputation of a fictitious crime, were accused of having been unwilling to name Commodus as their heir.</p>
