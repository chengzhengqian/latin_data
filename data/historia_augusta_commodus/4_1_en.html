He was alluded to by actors as a man of depraved life, and he thereupon banished them so promptly that they did not again appear upon the stage.

And not only was he wont to drink until dawn and squander the resources of the Roman Empire, but in the evening he would ramble through taverns and brothels.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_271_6" id="target_note_LCL139_271_6"><sup>6</sup></a> He sent out to rule the provinces men who were either his companions in crime or were recommended to him by criminals.
