of January a swift coming mist and darkness arose in the Circus; and before dawn there had already been fire-birds<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_303_1" id="target_note_LCL139_303_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and ill-boding portents. Commodus himself moved his residence from the Palace to the Vectilian Villa<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_303_2" id="target_note_LCL139_303_2"><sup>2</sup></a> on the Caelian hill, saying that he could not sleep in the Palace. The twin gates of the temple of Janus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_303_3" id="target_note_LCL139_303_3"><sup>3</sup></a> opened of their own accord, and a marble image of Anubis<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_303_4" id="target_note_LCL139_303_4"><sup>4</sup></a> was seen to move. In the Minucian Portico<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_303_5" id="target_note_LCL139_303_5"><sup>5</sup></a> a bronze statue of Hercules sweated for several days. An owl, moreover, was caught above his bed-chamber both at Lanuvium and at Rome. He was himself responsible for no inconsiderable an omen relating to himself; for after he had plunged his hand into the wound of a slain gladiator he wiped it on his own head, and again, contrary to custom, he ordered the spectators to attend his gladiatorial shows clad not in togas but in cloaks, a practice usual at funerals,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_303_6" id="target_note_LCL139_303_6"><sup>6</sup></a> while he himself presided in the vestments of a mourner. Twice, moreover, his helmet was borne through the Gate of Libitina.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_303_7" id="target_note_LCL139_303_7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>He gave largess to the people, 725 denarii to each man.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_303_8" id="target_note_LCL139_303_8"><sup>8</sup></a> Toward all others he was close-fisted to a degree, since the expense of his luxurious living had drained the treasury. He held many races in the Circus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_303_9" id="target_note_LCL139_303_9"><sup>9</sup></a> but rather as the result of a whim than as
