Suborners of slaves, cast them out of the senate. You, too, were in terror along with us; you know all, you know both the good and the evil. You know all that we were forced to purchase; all we have feared for your sake. Happy are we, now that you are emperor in truth. Put it to the vote concerning the murderer, put it to the vote, put the question. We ask your presence. The guiltless are yet unburied; let the body of the murderer be dragged in the dust. The murderer dug up the buried; let the body of the murderer be dragged in the dust.”</p>

<p>XX. The body of Commodus was buried during the night, after Livius Laurensis,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_313_1" id="target_note_LCL139_313_1"><sup>1</sup></a> the steward of the imperial estate,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_313_2a" id="target_note_LCL139_313_2a"><sup>2</sup></a> had surrendered it at the bidding of Pertinax<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_313_3" id="target_note_LCL139_313_3"><sup>3</sup></a> to Fabius Cilo,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_313_4" id="target_note_LCL139_313_4"><sup>4</sup></a> the consul elect. At this the senate cried out: “With whose authority have they buried him? The buried murderer, let him be dug up, let him be dragged in the dust.” Cincius Severus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_313_5" id="target_note_LCL139_313_5"><sup>5</sup></a> said: “Wrongfully has he been buried. And as I speak as pontifex, so speaks the college of the pontifices. And now, having recounted what is joyful, I shall proceed to what is needful: I give it as my opinion that the statues should be overthrown which this man, who lived but for the destruction of his fellow-citizens and for his own shame, forced us to decree in his honour; wherever they are, they should be cast down. His name, moreover, should be erased from all public and private records,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_313_6" id="target_note_LCL139_313_6"><sup>6</sup></a> and the months<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_313_7" id="target_note_LCL139_313_7"><sup>7</sup></a> should be once more called by the names whereby they were called when this scourge first fell upon the state.”</p>
