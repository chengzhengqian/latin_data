him be dragged with the hook—a foe, a murderer, verily, verily. He who spared not his own blood, let him be dragged with the hook; he who would have slain you,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_309_1" id="target_note_LCL139_309_1"><sup>1</sup></a> let him be dragged with the hook. You were in terror along with us, you were endangered along with us. That we may be safe, O Jupiter Best and Greatest, save for us Pertinax.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_309_2" id="target_note_LCL139_309_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Long life to the guardian care of the praetorians! Long life to the praetorian cohorts! Long life to the armies of Rome! Long life to the loyalty of the senate!</p>
<p>Let the murderer he dragged in the dust. We beseech you, O Sire, let the murderer be dragged in the dust. This we beseech you, let the murderer be dragged in the dust. Hearken, Caesar: to the lions with the informers! Hearken Caesar: to the lions with Speratus!<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_309_3" id="target_note_LCL139_309_3"><sup>3</sup></a> Long life to the victory of the Roman people! Long life to the soldiers’ guardian care! Long life to the guardian care of the praetorians! Long life to the praetorian cohorts!</p>
<p>On all sides are statues of the foe, on all sides are statues of the murderer, on all sides are statues of the gladiator. The statues of the murderer and gladiator, let them be cast down. The slayer of citizens, let him be dragged in the dust. The murderer of citizens, let him be dragged in the dust. Let the statues of the gladiator be overthrown. While you are safe, we too are safe and untroubled, verily, verily, if in very truth, then with honour, if in very truth, then with freedom.</p>
<p>Now at last we are secure; let informers tremble. That we may be secure, let informers tremble. That we may be safe, cast informers out of the senate, the club for informers! While you are safe, to the lions with informers! While you are ruler, the club for informers!</p>
