Paternus, the prefect of the guard,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_273_1" id="target_note_LCL139_273_1"><sup>1</sup></a> to form a plan for his assassination. The task of slaying him was assigned to Claudius Pompeianus, a kinsman.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_273_2" id="target_note_LCL139_273_2"><sup>2</sup></a> But he, as soon as he had an opportunity to fulfil his mission, strode up to Commodus with a drawn sword, and, bursting out with these words, “This dagger the senate sends thee,” betrayed the plot like a fool, and failed to accomplish the design, in which many others along with himself were implicated. After this fiasco, first Pompeianus and Quadratus were executed, and then Norbana and Norbanus and Paralius; and the latter’s mother and Lucilla were driven into exile.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_273_3" id="target_note_LCL139_273_3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>Thereupon the prefects of the guard, perceiving that the aversion in which Commodus was held was all on account of Saoterus, whose power the Roman people could not endure, courteously escorted this man away from the Palace under pretext of a sacrifice, and then, as he was returning to his villa, had him assassinated by their private agents.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_273_4" id="target_note_LCL139_273_4"><sup>4</sup></a> But this deed enraged Commodus more than the plot against Limself. Paternus, the instigator of this murder, who was believed to have been an accomplice in the plot to assassinate Commodus and had certainly sought to prevent any far-reaching punishment of that conspiracy, was now, at the instigation of Tigidius,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_273_5" id="target_note_LCL139_273_5"><sup>5</sup></a> dismissed from the command of the praetorian guard by the expedient of conferring on him the honour of the broad stripe.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_273_6a" id="target_note_LCL139_273_6a"><sup>6</sup></a> And a few days thereafter, Commodus accused him of plotting, saying that the daughter of Paternus had been betrothed to the son of Julianus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_273_7" id="target_note_LCL139_273_7"><sup>7</sup></a> with the understanding
