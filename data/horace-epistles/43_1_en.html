<span class="label">Epistle XIII</span>
<p>As I instructed you often and at length, when you set out, Vinius, you will deliver these close-sealed rolls to Augustus, <span class="italic">if</span> he’s well, <span class="italic">if</span> he’s in good spirits, <span class="italic">if—</span>in fine—he asks for them; lest you blunder in your eagerness for me, and by officious service and excessive zeal bring resentment on my poor works. If haply my book’s burden gall you with its weight, fling it from you, rather than savagely dash down your pack<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL194_335_a" id="target_note_LCL194_335_a"><sup>a</sup></a> where you are bidden to deliver it, and turn your father’s name of Asina into a jest, and you become the talk of the town.</p>
<p>Put forth your strength over hills, streams, and fens; when once you have achieved your purpose and reached your journey’s end, you are to keep your burden so placed as not, for instance, to carry the little packet of books under your armpit, even as a bumpkin carries a lamb, as tipsy Pyrria a ball of stolen wool,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL194_335_b" id="target_note_LCL194_335_b"><sup>b</sup></a> as a poor tribesman his slippers and felt cap, when asked out to dinner.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL194_335_ca" id="target_note_LCL194_335_ca"><sup>c</sup></a> And mind you don’t tell all the world that you have sweated in carrying verses that may win a hold on the eyes and ears of Caesar. Though besought by many a plea,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL194_335_d" id="target_note_LCL194_335_d"><sup>d</sup></a> press on. Be off; fare well; take care you do not stumble and smash your precious charge.</p>
