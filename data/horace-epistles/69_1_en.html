<h3><span class="ac">To His Book</span></h3>
<p class="noindent"><span class="sc">This</span> is an Epilogue to the collection of Epistles, now ready for publication.</p>
<p>The poet addresses his Book, as if it were a young and handsome slave, who is eager to escape from his masterâ€™s house and to see something of the great world. There are untold perils in the path. After a brief vogue, the book will be neglected or sent to the provinces, and finally its doom will be sealed when it becomes a school-book for lads to learn their letters from!</p>
<p>Yet, when the book finds an audience, the poet would have it impart some information about his own life and characteristics.</p>
