<p>We poets, I know, often behave foolishly. We are tactless, over-sensitive to criticism, and expect too much consideration. But, after all, great merits call for great poets to celebrate them. Alexander was a good judge of painting and sculpture, but in poetry his taste was Boeotian, for he paid the wretched Choerilus for his poor verses. You, on the contrary, have chosen Virgil and Varius to sing your exploits, and you know that no sculptor reproduces the features of heroes more faithfully than the poet does their souls (219-250). If I could do so, I should much prefer to sing your exploits, but you are worthy of a greater poet, and I will not run the risk of bringing discredit upon you as well as upon myself. I should no more like to have a poor waxen portrait of myself offered for sale than to be sung in uncouth verses which sooner or later must come to an ignoble end, and provide wrapping material in a grocerâ€™s shop (250-270)!</p>
