<p><sup>43</sup> Those who in the presence of their patron<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL194_365_a" id="target_note_LCL194_365_a"><sup>a</sup></a> say nothing of their own need will get more than one who begs. It makes a difference whether you take modestly or snatch greedily. And yet this<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL194_365_b" id="target_note_LCL194_365_b"><sup>b</sup></a> was the head and front of all. “My sister has no dower, my poor mother is a beggar, my farm is neither salable nor able to support us.” He who so speaks, cries aloud, “Give us food.” His neighbour chimes in with “me too.” So the gift will be divided and the morsel split.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL194_365_c" id="target_note_LCL194_365_c"><sup>c</sup></a> But if the crow could feed in quiet, he would have more meat, and much less wrangling and envy.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL194_365_d" id="target_note_LCL194_365_d"><sup>d</sup></a></p>

And he who has once been fooled does not care to lift up at the crossings a beggar with a broken leg, though many a tear flow down his cheeks, though he swear by holy Osiris and cry: “Believe me, I’m in earnest; cruel men, lift up the lame!” “Look for a stranger,” the neighbours bawl back till they are hoarse.</p>
