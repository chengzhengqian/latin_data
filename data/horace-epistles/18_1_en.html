<p>You think I am wrong? If you are ill, you take medicine; if you want to “live well,” and know that Virtue alone can give you that boon, follow her at all costs. If, on the contrary, you think Virtue a mere name, then make haste to get rioh. Be not like the Cappadocian king, who was so poor, but rather be like Lucullus, who didn’t know how wealthy he was (28-48).</p>
<p>If you have set your heart on office and honours, stoop to all the tricks of the politicians (49-55). If “living well” means for you good eating (56-64) or love and pleasure (65, 66), then think of nothing else.</p>
