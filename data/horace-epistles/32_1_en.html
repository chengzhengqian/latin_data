<h3><span class="ac">To Aristius Fusgus</span></h3>
<p class="noindent"><span class="sc">According</span> to the scholiasts, Aristius Fuscus, to whom this letter is addressed, was a dramatic writer and a scholar. He appears in the list of Horace’s literary friends given in <span class="italic">Sat</span>. i. 10.83, figures in an amusing rôle in <span class="italic">Sat</span>. i. 9.61 ff., and is best known as the man to whom the famous <span class="italic">Integer vitae</span> ode (<span class="italic">Carm</span>. i. 22) is dedicated.</p>
<p>The Epistle is a rhapsody upon the simplicity and charm of country life addressed to a cultivated man of the town. In the country Horace is perfectly content, save for the fact that his friend is elsewhere.</p>
