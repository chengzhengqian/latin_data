<h3><span class="sc">To Tiberius</span></h3>
<p class="noindent"><span class="sc">This</span> charming letter of introduction is addressed to the young prince Tiberius on behalf of one Septimius, probably the friend of <span class="italic">Carm</span>. ii. 6,</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">Septimi, Gadis aditure mecum et</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Cantabrum indoctum iuga ferre nostra et</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">barbaras Syrtis.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p></blockquote>
<p>The delicate tact of the writer, who would seem selfish if he did not heed his friendâ€™s request, and might be guilty of effrontery if he did, has often been admired. The letter was probably written in 20 <span class="sc">b.c</span>., when Tiberius was preparing to set out for the East.</p>
