lost in darkness the good poet will unearth for the people’s use and bring into the light—picturesque terms which, though once spoken by a Cato and a Cethegus of old.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL194_435_a" id="target_note_LCL194_435_a"><sup>a</sup></a> now lie low through unseemly neglect and dreary age.

This man was cured by his kinsmen’s help and care, but when with strong hellebore he had driven out the malady and its bile, and had come to himself again, he cried: “Egad! you have killed me, my friends, not saved me; for thus you have robbed me of a pleasure and taken away perforce the dearest illusion of my heart.”</p>
