mosaics<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL194_317_a" id="target_note_LCL194_317_a"><sup>a</sup></a>? Is the water purer which in city-streets struggles to burst its leaden pipes than that which dances and purls adown the sloping brook? Why, amid your varied columns<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL194_317_ba" id="target_note_LCL194_317_ba"><sup>b</sup></a> you are nursing trees, and you praise the mansion which looks out on distant fields. You may drive out Nature with a pitchfork, yet she will ever hurry back, and, ere you know it, will burst through your foolish contempt in triumph.</p>
<p><sup>26</sup> The man who has not the skill to match with Sidonian purple the fleeces that drink up Aquinum’s dye,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL194_317_c" id="target_note_LCL194_317_c"><sup>c</sup></a> will not suffer surer loss or one closer to his heart than he who shall fail to distinguish false from true. One whom Fortune’s smiles have delighted overmuch, will reel under the shock of change. If you set your heart on aught, you will be loth to lay it down. Flee grandeur: though humble be your home, yet in life’s race you may outstrip kings and the friends of kings.</p>
<p><sup>34</sup> The stag could best the horse in fighting and used to drive him from their common pasture, until the loser in the long contest begged the help of man and took the bit. But after that, in overweening triumph, he parted from his foe, he did not dislodge the rider from his back or the bit from his mouth. So he who through fear of poverty forfeits liberty, which is better than mines of wealth, will in his avarice carry a master, and be a slave for ever, not knowing how to live on little. When a man’s fortune will not fit him, ’tis as ofttimes with a shoe—if too big for the foot, it will trip him; if too small, will chafe.</p>
