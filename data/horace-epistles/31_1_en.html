<span class="label">Epistle IX</span>
<p>Only Septimius of course understands how much, Claudius, you make of me. For when he begs and by prayer forces me—mark you!—to an endeavour to commend and present him to you, as one worthy of the mind and household of Nero, the lover of virtue—when he deems that I fill the place of a closer friend, he sees and knows what I can do more fully than myself. To be sure I gave him many reasons for letting me go excused; but I feared that I might be thought to have made out my influence too small, falsely hiding my real power and seeking favour for myself alone. So to avoid the reproach of a graver fault, I have stooped to win the reward of town-bred impudence. But if you approve of my thus doffing modesty at the bidding of a friend, enrol him in your circle and believe him brave and good.</p>
