<h3><span class="ac">To Maecenas</span></h3>
<p class="noindent"><span class="sc">Maecenas</span> has apparently reproached Horace for staying in the country longer than he had said he would, when he himself had to remain in Rome, and perhaps he had reminded the poet of his obligations to his patron.</p>
<p>Horace makes a manly and dignified reply. He assures his patron that he is not ungrateful for past benefits, but he must consider his health, and he refuses to surrender his personal independence. If that is demanded, he is willing to give up everything that Maecenas has conferred upon him.</p>
<p>The poet’s attitude is illustrated by several stories, the last of which—the tale of Philippus and his client, Volteius Mena—takes up half of the poem. Of this Swift has made a very humorous use in his “Address to the Earl of Oxford.”</p>
