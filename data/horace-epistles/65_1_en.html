<h3><span class="ac">To Maecenas</span></h3>
<p class="noindent"><span class="sc">Writing</span> shortly before the publication of this book, in 20 <span class="sc">b.c.</span>, Horace replies to the adverse criticism which had been levelled against his <span class="italic">Epodes</span> and <span class="italic">Odes</span> (Books i.-iii.). These, it was claimed, lacked originality and were mere imitations of Greek exemplars. Horace therefore contrasts the rude and servile imitation, to which he has himself been subjected, with his own generous use of noble models, according to rules followed by the great Greek poets themselves (1-34).</p>
<p>But the real reason why Horace has been assailed lies in the fact that the poet has not tried to please the general public or his offended critics. He refuses to resort to the usual methods of winning approval, and is therefore supposed to be arrogant. This is a charge which he declines to face (35-49).</p>
