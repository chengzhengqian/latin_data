slander. A <span class="italic">protégé</span>, you see, must be ever watchful of his conduct. He must fall in with his patron’s moods and at all times show a cheery face (67-95).</p>
<p>Above all, you must study the words of the wise and learn the secret of a tranquil life. That is what <span class="italic">I</span> have found in my peaceful country home, where I pray the gods for the blessings of life, for the means of living, and for a goodly supply of books. The <span class="italic">aequus animus</span> I will see to myself (96-112).</p>
<p>This Epistle is addressed to the Lollius whom we have already met in the second Epistle of this book. Yet the main theme of the letter is the same as that already treated in the seventeenth, viz. the manner in which a person should conduct himself in his intercourse with the great. Lollius, however, is not what Scaeva is conceived to have been, poor and of lowly station. He has an ancestral estate, large enough to be the scene of an historical pageant, and he was probably the son of the Lollius who was Consul in 21 <span class="sc">b.c.</span> (<span class="italic">cf</span>. <span class="italic">Epist</span>. i. 20.28).</p>
<p>It is commonly supposed that the young Lollius is thinking of attaching himself to a man of great prominence in the state, with whom he would be on terms of confidential intimacy (11.37 f.; 68 ff.), and that he has consulted Horace, who has himself been so successful with a patron. But most commentators take the letter too seriously. It is a satire and the poet is in a playful mood (see <span class="italic">e.g</span>. 11.72 ff.). So, under the guise of a Professor of Social Philosophy, he gives his young friend a lecture in Stoic fashion on his favourite theme <span class="italic">bene vivere</span>, which here may be taken to mean “How to get on in the world.”</p>
