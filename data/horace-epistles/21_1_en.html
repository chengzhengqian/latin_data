knaves. So if wealth alone can make you happy and keep you so, be the first to go back to this task, the last to leave it off.</p>
<p><sup>49</sup> If pomp and popularity make the fortunate man, let us buy a slave to call <span class="italic">off</span> names,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL194_291_a" id="target_note_LCL194_291_a"><sup>a</sup></a> to nudge our left side, and make us stretch out the hand across the streets.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL194_291_b" id="target_note_LCL194_291_b"><sup>b</sup></a> “This man has much influence in the Fabian tribe; that in the Veline. This man will give the fasces to whom he will, or, if churlish, will snatch the curule ivory from whom he pleases.” Throw in “Brother!” “Father!”—politely adopt each one according to his age.</p>
<p><sup>56</sup> If he who dines well, lives well, then—’tis daybreak, let’s be off, whither the palate guides us. Let us fish, let us hunt, like Gargilius in the story. At dawn of day he would bid his slaves with huntingnets and spears pass through the throng in the crowded Forum, that in the sight of that same throng one mule of all the train might bring home a boar he had purchased. While gorged with undigested food, let us bathe, forgetful of what is or is not seemly, deserving to have our place in the Caere class,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL194_291_c" id="target_note_LCL194_291_c"><sup>c</sup></a> like the wicked crew of Ulysses of Ithaca, to whom forbidden pleasure was dearer than fatherland. If, as Mimnermus holds, without love and jests there is no joy, live amid love and jests.</p>
<p><sup>67</sup> Live long, farewell. If you know something better than these precepts, pass it on, my good fellow. If not, join me in following these.</p>
