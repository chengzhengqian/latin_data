For not till late did the Roman turn his wit to Greek writings, and in the peaceful days after the Punic wars he began to ask what service Sophocles could render, and Thespis and Aeschylus. He also made essay, whether he could reproduce<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL194_411_b" id="target_note_LCL194_411_b"><sup>b</sup></a> in worthy style, and took pride in his success, being gifted with spirit and vigour; for he has some tragic inspiration, and is happy in his ventures, but in ignorance, deeming it disgraceful, hesitates to blot.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL194_411_c" id="target_note_LCL194_411_c"><sup>c</sup></a></p>
