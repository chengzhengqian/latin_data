lovely, and hates what you believe so beautiful.’Tis the brothel, I see, and greasy cookshop that stir in you a longing for the city, and the fact that that poky spot<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL194_341_a" id="target_note_LCL194_341_a"><sup>a</sup></a> will grow pepper and spice as soon as grapes, and that there is no tavern hard by that can supply you with wine and no flute-playing courtesan, to whose strains you can dance and thump the ground. And yet<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL194_341_b" id="target_note_LCL194_341_b"><sup>b</sup></a> you toil over fields long untouched by the hoe, you care for the ox after he is unyoked, and you fill him up with fodder you have stripped; when you are dead tired, the brook brings fresh work, for if rain has fallen, it must be taught by many a mounded dam to spare the sunny meadow.</p>
<p><sup>31</sup> Now come, hear what makes the discord in our common song. One whom fine-spun clothes became, and shining locks, one who, as you know, though empty-handed, found favour with greedy Cinara, and in midday hours would drink the clear Falernian, now takes pleasure in a simple meal, and a nap on the grass beside the stream: nor is it shameful to have once been foolish, but not to cut folly short. Where you live, no one with eye askance detracts from<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL194_341_c" id="target_note_LCL194_341_c"><sup>c</sup></a> my comforts, or poisons them with the bite of secret hate. As I move sods and stones the neighbours laugh. You would rather be munching rations with the slaves in town; it is their number you fain would join: my sharp-witted groom envies you the use of fuel, flock, and garden. The ox longs for the horse’s trappings: the horse, when lazy, longs to plough. What I shall advise is that each contentedly practise the trade he understands.</p>
