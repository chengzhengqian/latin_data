<h3><span class="ac">To Vinius Asina</span></h3>
<p class="noindent"><span class="sc">Horace</span> is sending Augustus a copy of his poems, probably the <span class="italic">Odes</span>, Books i., ii., iii., which were published in 23 <span class="sc">b.c</span>. The volume is carried to court by a messenger, one Vinius, whose cognomen is presumably Asina (1.8), though the usual form of the name is Asellus.</p>
<p>Instead of writing a formal note to the Emperor to accompany the gift, Horace indulges in the fiction of sending a letter of instructions to the messenger, in which he humorously expresses his anxiety about the reception of the poems.</p>
