<h3>XII</h3>
<h3><span class="ac">To Iccius</span></h3>
<p class="noindent"><span class="sc">Horace</span> introduces Grosphus to Iccius, and in doing so takes occasion to rally his friend on his discontent.</p>
<p>Iccius, whom in one of his <span class="italic">Odes</span> (i. 29) Horace rallies for deserting philosophy to take part in a military expedition to Arabia Felix, has now, some five years later, become the <span class="italic">procurator</span> or “agent,” who had charge of Agrippa’s estates in Sicily. Apparently he had written to Horace, grumbling because he was not an independent landowner, to which Horace replies that the agent of a large estate is able to live on the produce very comfortably, inasmuch as it is all at his disposal, though he is not the actual owner. Then in a somewhat ironical vein (12-20), Horace congratulates his friend on being able, amid all his business cares, to study the physics of Empedocles and the dialectic of the Stoics.</p>
<p>The letter closes with some bits of news, preceded by the request to show some courtesy to Pompeius Grosphus, whom we have also encountered in the <span class="italic">Odes</span> (ii. 16), where he is spoken of as a wealthy proprietor in Sicily.</p>
