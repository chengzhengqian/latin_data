which country rears more hares, which, more boars, which one’s seas give more hiding to fish and seaurchins, so that I may return home from there a fat Phaeacian<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL194_347_a" id="target_note_LCL194_347_a"><sup>a</sup></a>—all this you must write us, and we must credit you in full.</p>
<p><sup>26</sup> Maenius gallantly used up all his mother and father had left him, then came into note as a city wit, a parasite at large, with no fixed fold, a man who when dinnerless knew not friend apart from foe, but would savagely trump up scandal against anybody, the market’s ruin, a cyclone and abyss<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL194_347_b" id="target_note_LCL194_347_b"><sup>b</sup></a>—and so, whatever he gained, he gave to his greedy maw. This fellow, whenever he got little or nothing from those who applauded or feared his wicked wit, would sup on plates of tripe and cheap lamb, enough to satisfy three bears, so as actually to proclaim that prodigals should have their bellies branded with white-hot iron—he, a Bestius reformed!<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL194_347_c" id="target_note_LCL194_347_c"><sup>c</sup></a> Yet the same man, if he ever got hold of some larger booty, would turn it into smoke and ashes, and then, “In faith, I don’t wonder,” he would say, “if some devour their substance, since there is nothing better than a fat thrush, nothing finer than a large sow’s paunch.”</p>
<p><sup>42</sup> Such a man, in truth, am I. When means fail, I cry up a safe and lowly lot, resolute enough where all is paltry: but when something better and richer comes my way I, the same man, say that only men like you are wise and live well<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL194_347_d" id="target_note_LCL194_347_d"><sup>d</sup></a>—whose invested wealth is displayed in handsome villas.</p>
