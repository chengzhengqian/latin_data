indulgence curbed. The fickle public has changed its taste and is fired throughout with a scribbling craze; sons and grave sires sup crowned with leaves and dictate their lines.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL194_407_a" id="target_note_LCL194_407_a"><sup>a</sup></a> I myself, who declare that I write no verses, prove to be more of a liar than the Parthians: before sunrise I wake, and call for pen, paper, and writing-case. A man who knows nothing of a ship fears to handle one; no one dares to give southernwood to the sick unless he has learnt its use; doctors undertake a doctor’s work; carpenters handle carpenters’ tools: but, skilled or unskilled, we scribble poetry, all alike.</p>

Whence, in company with chaste boys, would the unwedded maid learn the suppliant hymn, had the Muse not given them a bard? Their chorus asks for aid and feels the presence of the gods, calls for showers from heaven, winning favour with the prayer he has taught, averts disease, drives away dreaded dangers, gains peace
