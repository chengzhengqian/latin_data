<h3><span class="ac">To Torquatus</span></h3>
<p class="noindent"><span class="sc">Horace</span> here invites to a simple dinner, on the eve of the birthday of Augustus, a member of the wealthy family of the Manlii Torquati, probably the same as the one to whom the seventh ode of the Fourth Book is later addressed. Torquatus is asked to bring some guests.</p>
<p>As to the hour set for the dinner Porphyrio explains <span class="italic">supremo sole</span> (1.3) as meaning <span class="italic">hora sexta</span>, <span class="italic">i</span>.<span class="italic">e</span>. midday, and Professor A. J. Bell favours this interpretation (<span class="italic">Classical Review</span>, xxix. (1915) p. 200. But Horaceâ€™s simple dinner is quite unlike the extravagant one given by Nasidienus, which began <span class="italic">de medio die</span> (<span class="italic">Sat</span>. ii. 8.3), and people who have spent a hot September in Rome will not think it likely that the sensitive poet would have invited his guests to come at high noon in that unpleasant month. As to the last two lines Torquatus is presumably a busy lawyer, and some of his clients might have to wait till late in the day in order to consult him. If so, this would be another reason why Horace would not expect his friend to come before evening. Maecenas, also a busy man, dined <span class="italic">sub lumina prima</span> (<span class="italic">Sat</span>. ii. 7. 33).</p>
