<p><sup>40</sup> Who is the “good man”? “He who observes the Senate’s decrees, the statutes and laws; whose judgement settles many grave suits; whose surety means safety for property; whose testimony wins suits at law.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL194_355_a" id="target_note_LCL194_355_a"><sup>a</sup></a> Yet this very man all his household and all his neighbours see to be foul within, though fair without, under his comely skin. If a slave were to say to me, “I never stole or ran away”: my reply would be, “You have your reward; you are not flogged.” “I never killed anyone.” “You’ll hang on no cross to feed crows.” “I am good and honest.” Our Sabine friend<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL194_355_b" id="target_note_LCL194_355_b"><sup>b</sup></a> shakes his head and says, “No, no!” For the wolf is wary and dreads the pit, the hawk the suspected snare, the pike the covered hook. The good hate vice because they love virtue; <span class="italic">you</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL194_355_c" id="target_note_LCL194_355_c"><sup>c</sup></a> will commit no crime because you dread punishment. Suppose there’s a hope of escaping detection; you will make no difference between sacred and profane. For when from a thousand bushels of beans you steal one, my loss in that case is less, but not your sin. This “good man,” for forum and tribunal the cynosure of every eye, whenever with swine or ox he makes atonement to the gods, cries with loud voice “Father Janus,” with loud voice “Apollo,” then moves his lips, fearing to be heard: “Fair Laverna,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL194_355_d" id="target_note_LCL194_355_d"><sup>d</sup></a> grant me to escape detection; grant me to pass as just and upright, shroud my sins in night, my lies in clouds!”</p>
