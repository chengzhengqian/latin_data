<p>Lest you, my good Quinctius, should have to ask me about my farm, whether it supports its master with plough-land, or makes him rich with olives, whether with apples or with meadows or vine-clad elms,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL194_351_a" id="target_note_LCL194_351_a"><sup>a</sup></a> I will describe for you in rambling style the nature and lie of the land.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup> There are hills, quite unbroken, were they not cleft by one shady valley,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL194_351_ba" id="target_note_LCL194_351_ba"><sup>b</sup></a> yet such that the rising sun looks on its right side, and when departing in his flying car warms the left. The climate would win your praise. What if you knew that the bushes bear a rich crop of ruddy cornels and plums, that oak and ilex gladden the cattle with plenteous fruitage, and their lord with plenteous shade? You would say that Tarentum with its verdure was brought nearer home. A spring, too, fit to give its name to a river, so that not cooler nor purer is Hebrus winding through Thrace, flows with healing for sickly heads and sickly stomachs. This retreat, so sweet—yes, believe me, so bewitching—keeps me, my friend, in sound health in September’s heat.</p>
