<h3>XIV</h3>
<h3><span class="ac">To The Bailiff Of His Farm</span></h3>
<p class="noindent"><span class="sc">This</span> epistle is professedly addressed to the slave, whom the poet had promoted from low rank in his town establishment to the position of bailiff or superintendent of his small country estate. The slave now hankers after city life, while the master, detained in Rome by a friendâ€™s bereavement, longs for the country, which he has always preferred. The difference between the two is due to their tastes. The slave still clings to his follies; the master has learned wisdom with advancing years.</p>
<p>The theme is essentially the same as in Epistles viii. and x. of this book, while the setting of the letter is in marked contrast with <span class="italic">Sat</span>. ii. 7, where it is the slave who lectures the master.</p>
