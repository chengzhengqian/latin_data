<p><sup>17</sup> And you—you live the true life, if you take care to be what people call you. All we in Rome have long talked of you as happy; but I fear, as touching yourself, that you may give more credit to others than to your own judgement, or that you may think someone other than the wise and good man can be happy; or that, if over and over men say you are in sound and good health, you may, toward the dinner-hour, disguise the hidden fever, until a trembling falls upon your greasy hands.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL194_353_a" id="target_note_LCL194_353_a"><sup>a</sup></a> Fools, through false shame, hide the unhealed sore.</p>
<p><sup>25</sup> Suppose a man were to speak of wars fought by you on land and sea, and with words like these flatter your attentive ears:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">May He, to whom both thou and Rome are dear,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Keep secret still, which is the fuller truth,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">The love of Rome for thee, or thine for her!</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">you would see in them the praises of Augustus.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL194_353_b" id="target_note_LCL194_353_b"><sup>b</sup></a> When you suffer yourself to be called wise and flawless, do you answer, pray tell me, in your own name? “To be sure, I like to be called a good man and wise, even as you do.” But they who gave you this title to-day will, if they so please, take it away to-morrow; even as, if they bestow the lictor’s rods on one unworthy, they will likewise wrest them from him. “Put that down, ’tis ours,” they say. I do so, and sadly withdraw. If the same people were to cry after me “Thief!”, call me “Profligate,” insist that I strangled my father, ought I to be stung by such lying charges, and change colour? Whom does false honour delight, whom does lying calumny affright, save the man who is full of flaws and needs the doctor?</p>
