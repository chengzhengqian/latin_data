<h3><span class="ac">To Albius Tibullus</span></h3>
<p class="noindent"><span class="sc">Albius</span> <span class="sc">Tibullus</span>, the elegiac poet, who died the same year as Virgil, 19 <span class="sc">b.c</span>., when still quite young, had returned from a campaign in Aquitania in 27 <span class="sc">b.c.</span>, and then perhaps read for the first time the <span class="italic">Satires</span> of Horace. As the first verse of this Epistle refers only to the <span class="italic">Satires</span> and not to the <span class="italic">Odes</span>, this short letter seems to have been written before 23 <span class="sc">b.c.</span>, when the <span class="italic">Odes</span> (Books i.-iii.) were published.</p>
<p>Tibullus seems to have been of a sensitive and somewhat melancholy disposition, like the English poet, Thomas Gray. Horace here tries to divert him, and concludes with an invitation to visit him, a prosperous Epicurean, at his Sabine farm.</p>
<p>The commonly accepted view that the Albius here addressed by Horace is the poet Tibullus has been rejected by Cruquius, Baehrens and, more recently, by Professor J. P. Postgate (<span class="italic">Selections from Tibullus</span>, 1903, p. 179). The identity of Albius and Tibullus is upheld by Professor B. L. Ullman in an article on “Horace and Tibullus” in the <span class="italic">American Journal of Philology</span>, xxxiii. (1912) pp. 149 ff., to which Professor Postgate replies briefly in the same volume, pp. 450 ff. Ullman also holds that Tibullus is the <span class="italic">Albi filius</span> of <span class="italic">Sat</span>. i. 4.109, written when Tibullus was about sixteen years of age.</p>
