writings which Apollo on the Palatine has admitted<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL194_273_a" id="target_note_LCL194_273_a"><sup>a</sup></a>: lest, if some day perchance the flock of birds come to reclaim their plumage, the poor crow, stripped of his stolen colours, awake laughter. And yourself— what do you venture on? About what beds of thyme are you busily flitting? No small gift is yours: not untilled is the field, or rough-grown and unsightly. Whether you sharpen your tongue for pleading, or essay to give advice on civil law, or build charming verse, you will win the first prize of the victor’s ivy.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL194_273_b" id="target_note_LCL194_273_b"><sup>b</sup></a> But could you but lay aside your cares—those cold compresses<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL194_273_c" id="target_note_LCL194_273_c"><sup>c</sup></a>—you would rise to where heavenly wisdom would lead. This task, this pursuit let us speed, small and great alike, if we would live dear to our country, and dear to ourselves.</p>
<p><sup>30</sup> This, too, when you reply, you must tell me—whether you esteem Munatius as much as you should. Or does your friendship, like a wound ill-stitched, close vainly and tear open once more? Yet, whether hot blood or ignorance of the world drives you both, wild steeds with untamed necks, wherever on earth you are living—you who are too good to break the bond of brotherhood—a votive heifer is fattening against your return.</p>
