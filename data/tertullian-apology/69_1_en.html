In §§ 10, 11 he deals with the argument that the gods bestowed empire. How could they, if they had not empire to bestow? Either they were or were not kings. Those who were kings, who made them kings and gave them such rights? But some were not kings at all, and were reigned over by others who did not worship them, as they were not yet deified. But if there were kings before these gods were gods, the right to bestow empire rests, not with the gods, but elsewhere.
