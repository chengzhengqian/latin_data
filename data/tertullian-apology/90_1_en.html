<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">16</span><span class="br"></span><p>Our dinner shows its idea in its name; it is called by the Greek name for love (<span class="italic">agape</span>).<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL250_181_a" id="target_note_LCL250_181_a"><sup>a</sup></a> Whatever the cost, it is gain to spend in pietyâ€™s name, for with that refreshment we help the needy. No, not, as among you, parasites aspire for the glory of selling their freedom, authorized by their belly to fatten themselves at the cost of any insult; no, because with God there is greater consideration for those of lower degree. If the motive of the banquet is<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">17</span><span class="br"></span> honest, take the motive as the standard of the other proceedings required by our rule of life. Since it turns on the duty of religion, it allows nothing vile, nothing immodest. We do not take our places at table until we have first tasted prayer to God. Only<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">18</span><span class="br"></span> so much is eaten as satisfies hunger; only so much drunk as meets the need of the modest. They satisfy themselves only so far as men will who recall that even during the night they must worship God; they talk as those would who know the Lord listens. After water for the hands come the lights; and then each, from what he knows of the Holy Scriptures, or from his own heart, is called before the rest to sing<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL250_181_b" id="target_note_LCL250_181_b"><sup>b</sup></a> to God; so that is a test of how much he has drunk. Prayer in like manner ends the banquet. Then we break up; but not to form<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">19</span><span class="br"></span> groups for violence nor gangs for disorder, nor outbursts of lust; but to pursue the same care for self-control and chastity, as men who have dined not so much on dinner as on discipline.</p>
<p>This gathering of Christians may properly be called<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">20</span><span class="br"></span> illegal, if it is like illegal gatherings; may properly be condemned, if any complain of it on the score on which complaint is made of factious clubs. To whose<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">21</span><span class="br"></span> hurt have we ever met? We are when assembled
