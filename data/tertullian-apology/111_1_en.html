we wish to suffer; but it is exactly the case of the soldier and war. Nobody is glad to face it with all its inevitable anxiety and danger. Yet he battles with<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> all his might and, victorious in the battle, he rejoices,—though but now he was grumbling about the battle—because he achieves glory and spoil. Our battle consists in being challenged to face the tribunals; that there, in peril of life, we may fight it out for truth. Victory is the achievement of the thing for which you have fought. Our victory means the glory of pleasing God, and the spoils are eternal life.</p>
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span><p>But we are condemned. Yes, when we have achieved our purpose. So we have conquered, when we are killed; we escape when we are condemned. So you may now call us “faggot-fellows” and “half-axle-men,” because we are tied to a half-axle-post, the faggots are piled round us, and we are burnt. This is our garb of victory, the robe embroidered with the palm; this our triumphal chariot.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL250_223_a" id="target_note_LCL250_223_a"><sup>a</sup></a> It is<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span> right and reasonable that we do not please the conquered; that is why we pass for desperate fellows, a forlorn hope. But desperation and recklessness of this sort, when it is on your side, when glory and renown are at stake,—oh! then it is holding high the standard of courage.</p>
