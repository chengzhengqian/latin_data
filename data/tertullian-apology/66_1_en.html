do you not, on the basis of common consent, that there is a god, more sublime and more potent, Emperor as it were of the universe, of absolute power and majesty? For that is how most men apportion divinity; they hold that the control, the supreme sway, rests with one, the various functions of divinity among many. Plato,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL250_133_a" id="target_note_LCL250_133_a"><sup>a</sup></a> for instance, describes the great Jove in heaven accompanied by a host of gods and demons together. So they hold that his procurators<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span> and prefects and presiding officers should be respected equally with him. And yet what crime does he commit, who, to win Caesar’s favour more securely, transfers his attention and his hope elsewhere, and does not confess that the title of God, like that of Emperor, belongs to one supreme over all,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL250_133_b" id="target_note_LCL250_133_b"><sup>b</sup></a> when it is legally a capital offence to speak of another beside Caesar or even to listen to such talk?

Look to it, whether this also may form part of the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">6</span><span class="br"></span> accusation of irreligion—to do away with freedom of religion, to forbid a man choice of deity, so that I may not worship whom I would, but am forced to worship whom I would not. No one, not even a man, will wish to receive reluctant worship.</p>
