And<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span> surely if the object of worship had been represented by any image, nowhere would it have been more likely to be seen than in its own shrine; all the more, because, however trivial the worship, there at least it feared no eyes from outside.

For when a bit of wood is worshipped—what matters the shape, if the nature of the material is the same? what the form if it is itself the body of a god? Yet what distinction can you make between the shaft of a cross and Attic Pallas or Pharian Ceres, each of whom stands there unshaped, a rude pole, a log untrimmed?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL250_83_ca" id="target_note_LCL250_83_ca"><sup>c</sup></a> Every balk of timber, which is set up erect, is a part of<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">7</span><span class="br"></span> a cross; we—perhaps—worship a god complete and whole.
