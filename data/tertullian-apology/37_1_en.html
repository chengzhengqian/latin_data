on his altar. I would rather praise your wisdom in salving something out of the loss!</p>
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span><p>But I turn to your literature, by which you are trained in wisdom and the liberal arts; and what absurdities I find! I read how the gods on account of Trojans and Achaeans fell to it and fought it out themselves like so many pairs of gladiators; how Venus was wounded by a man’s arrow, because she wished to snatch away her son Aeneas, who was all but killed by that same Diomedes; how Mars<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> was almost done to death by thirteen months in fetters; how Jove, to escape similar outrage from the rest of the celestials, was liberated by a certain monster’s aid; how now he wept Sarpedon’s fall, and now he shamefully craved his sister’s embraces, recounting to her all the former doxies he had never loved so much!<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL250_75_a" id="target_note_LCL250_75_a"><sup>a</sup></a> And thereafter which of the poets<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span> is not to be found following the pattern of his great original and dishonouring the gods? This poet binds over Apollo to King Admetus to feed his flocks<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL250_75_b" id="target_note_LCL250_75_b"><sup>b</sup></a>; the other leases Neptune’s services as builder to Laomedon.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL250_75_c" id="target_note_LCL250_75_c"><sup>c</sup></a> And then there is one of the lyric poets (I mean Pindar) who sings how Aesculapius on the score of his avarice, because he made improper use of his healing skill, was punished by a thunderbolt.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL250_75_d" id="target_note_LCL250_75_d"><sup>d</sup></a> Jupiter was evil, if that thunderbolt was his—without proper affection for his grandson, envious of the artist. If these tales were true, they ought not to be published,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span> if false they should not be invented, among people so very religious. Neither tragic nor comic<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">6</span><span class="br"></span> poets spare them, but must needs find their plots in the sorrows or blunders that befal in some god’s house or other.</p>
