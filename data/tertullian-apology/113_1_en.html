dead men a sort of resurrection. But the man who hopes for a real resurrection from God, if he suffers for God—he is a mere fool!</p>
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">12</span><span class="br"></span><p>But go to it! my good magistrates; the populace will count you a deal better, if you sacrifice the Christians to them. Torture us, rack us, condemn us, crush us; your cruelty only proves our innocence. That is why God suffers us to suffer all this. Yes, but lately, when you condemned a Christian girl to the pander rather than the panther, you admitted that we count an injury to our chastity more awful than any penalty, than any death. But nothing whatever<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">13</span><span class="br"></span> is accomplished by your cruelties, each more exquisite than the last. It is the bait that wins men for our school. We multiply whenever we are mown down by you; the blood of Christians is seed. Many<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">14</span><span class="br"></span> among you preach the endurance of pain and of death—such as Cicero in his <span class="italic">Tusculans</span>, Seneca in his <span class="italic">Fortuita</span>, Diogenes, Pyrrho, Callinicus. And yet their words never find so many disciples as the Christians win, who teach by deeds. That very “obstinacy”<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">15</span><span class="br"></span> with which you taunt us, is your teacher. For who that beholds it is not stirred to inquire, what lies indeed within it? Who, on inquiry, does not join us, and joining us, does not wish to suffer, that he may purchase for himself the whole grace of God, that he may win full pardon from God by paying his own blood for it? For all sins are forgiven to a deed like this. That<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">16</span><span class="br"></span> is why, on being sentenced by you, on the instant we render you thanks. There is a rivalry between God’s ways and man’s; we are condemned by you, we are acquitted by God.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL250_227_aa" id="target_note_LCL250_227_aa"><sup>a</sup></a></p>
