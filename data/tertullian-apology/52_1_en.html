Of this those holy voices warned them<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">6</span><span class="br"></span> beforehand, and insisted at the same time (every one of them always, and in unison) that the day should come when in the last courses of time God would from every race, people and place gather Himself worshippers far more faithful, to whom He would transfer his favour, and that in fuller measure, because they would be able to bear an ampler discipline.</p>
