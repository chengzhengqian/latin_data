affirm that after death they became gods, let us discuss the causes that brought this about. First of<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> all, you must allow there is a God more sublime, true owner in his own right (so to say) of deity,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL250_61_a" id="target_note_LCL250_61_a"><sup>a</sup></a> who made the gods out of men. For neither could they have assumed for themselves a deity they did not possess, nor could another give it them when they were without it, unless he really had it himself.
