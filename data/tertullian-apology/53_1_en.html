<p>We have already said<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL250_107_a" id="target_note_LCL250_107_a"><sup>a</sup></a> that God devised the whole universe by Word, by Reason, by Might. Among your own philosophers, too, it is argued that <span class="italic">Logos</span>, that is Word and Reason, would seem to be the Artificer of the universe. This <span class="italic">Logos</span> Zeno defines as the maker who has formed and ordered all; he will have it that this <span class="italic">Logos</span> is also called fate and God, and mind of Jove, and universal law. All this Cleanthes gathers up into Spirit and affirms it to pervade the universe.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL250_107_b" id="target_note_LCL250_107_b"><sup>b</sup></a> We, too, to that Word, Reason and Power<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">11</span><span class="br"></span> (by which we said God devised all things) would ascribe Spirit as its proper nature; and in Spirit, giving utterance, we should find Word; with Spirit, ordering and disposing all things, Reason; and over Spirit, achieving all things, Power. This,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL250_107_c" id="target_note_LCL250_107_c"><sup>c</sup></a> we have been taught, proceeds from God, begotten in this proceeding from God, and therefore called “Son of God” and “God” because of unity of nature. For God too is spirit. When a ray is<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">12</span><span class="br"></span> projected from the sun, it is a portion of the whole;</p>

Qvaest.</span> ii. 45, who gives a good (and eloquent) summary of Stoic doctrine. “These ancient sages . . . recognized the same Jupiter as we do, the guardian and ruler of the universe, its soul and breath, the maker and lord of this earthly frame of things, to whom every name of power is appropriate. If you prefer to call him fate you will not be wrong. He it is on whom depend all things, from whom proceed all causes of causes. If you prefer to call him providence you will still be right; for he it is by whose counsel provision is made for the world that it may pursue its orderly course and unfold the drama of its being. If you prefer to call him nature, you will make no mistake; for it is he from whom all things derive being, and by whose breath we live. If you prefer to call him the world, you will not be in error; for he is everything that you can see, he is totally infused in all his parts, self-sustained through inherent power” (translation by John Clark).

I would remind the reader that the author is pre-Nicene, and that the translator is not a theologian. The general line of Tertullian is that of the second-century apologists, in whom the simile from one light kindling another light is very familiar.
