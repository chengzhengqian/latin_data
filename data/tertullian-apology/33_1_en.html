<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1</span><span class="br"></span><p>XII. I stop on this issue; for I know that on the basis of truth I shall have shown what they are not, when I have made clear what they are. So, as to your gods, I see merely the names of certain dead men of the past; I hear their stories; from their stories I understand their rituals. As to their actual images,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> I find nothing beyond material akin to what is in ordinary pots and tools. Or else the matter of those same pots and tools experiences in consecration a change of destiny, as the free hand of art transforms it—and (let me say) does it with the maximum of insult, yes! and sacrilege, while the work is proceeding. So it really might be a consolation to us in our pains, when we are tortured because of these gods, that they too suffer the same, to become gods.<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> You hang Christians on crosses and stakes; what idol is there but is first moulded in clay, hung on cross and stake? It is on a gibbet that the body of your god is first dedicated. With hooks you tear the flanks<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span> of Christians; but on your gods, over every limb of them, fall axes and planes and rasps. We lay down our necks [to lose our heads]; before the lead, the glue, the nails, your gods have not a head at all. We are driven to the beasts,—those beasts which you attach to Liber, to Ceres, to the Celestial Mother. We are burnt in the flames; so are they in the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span> first state of the ore. We are condemned to the mines; and that is where your gods come from. We are banished to islands; very frequently a god of yours will be born or will die on an island.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL250_67_a" id="target_note_LCL250_67_a"><sup>a</sup></a></p>
