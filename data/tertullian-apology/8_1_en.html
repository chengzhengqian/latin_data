No, nobody desires to acquit him; it<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">16</span><span class="br"></span> is not permissible to wish it; that is why no man is forced to deny [his guilt]. But the Christian, a man guilty of every crime, the enemy of gods, emperors, laws, morals, of all Nature together—so you conceive of him; and then you force him to deny the charge, in order to acquit him—a man you will not be able to acquit unless he has denied.
