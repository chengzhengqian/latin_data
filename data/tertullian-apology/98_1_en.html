innocence, man’s authority that enjoined it. So your rule of life is neither complete nor does it inspire such fear as to lead to true innocence. Man’s skill to make clear what is truly good is no more than his authority to enforce it; the one may as easily be mistaken as the other despised. And to come to the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> point, which is the ampler saying: Thou shalt not kill, or, Do not even be angry? Which is more perfect, to forbid adultery or to prohibit a single lustful look? Which is the deeper law, to restrain from doing evil or from even speaking it? Which is the more thorough, not to permit the doing of an injury or to allow no retaliation? Though at the same time<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span> you must recognize that your own laws, which seem to tend to innocence, drew from the divine law, which is the more ancient pattern. We have spoken already of the date of Moses.</p>
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span><p>But what authority can man’s laws have, when a man may have the luck to evade them, again and again undiscovered in his guilt, sometimes to despise them, as he breaks them of choice or of necessity? Think over all this, remembering how short is any<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">6</span><span class="br"></span> punishment that will not continue after death. That is why Epicurus makes light of all torture and pain; if it is slight, he says, you may despise it, if it is great it will not be long.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL250_197_a" id="target_note_LCL250_197_a"><sup>a</sup></a> Yes! We who are examined<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">7</span><span class="br"></span> in the sight of God who sees all, we who foresee an eternal punishment from His hand, we well may be the only ones to attain innocence; since, at once from fullness of knowledge, from the difficulty of concealment, from the greatness of the torture (not <span class="italic">long</span>, but eternal), we fear Him, whom he, too, must fear who judges us who fear—who fear God, that is, and not the proconsul.</p>
