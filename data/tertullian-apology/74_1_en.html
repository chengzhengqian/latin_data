First, then, let it be established whether those beings, to whom sacrifice is offered, can give safety to the Emperor or to anybody at all; and then impeach us on the charge of treason, if it appears that angels or demons, in their natures the worst of spirits, do any good service; if the lost can save; if the damned can give freedom; if, in a word (and this is in your secret hearts), if the dead can protect the living.
