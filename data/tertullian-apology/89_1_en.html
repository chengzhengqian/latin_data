<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">12</span><span class="br"></span> among us—except our wives. At that point we dissolve our partnership, which is the one place where the rest of men make it effective. Not only do they use the wives of their friends, but also most patiently yield their own to their friends. They follow (I take it) the example of those who went before them, the wisest of men—Greek Socrates and Roman Cato, who shared with their friends the wives they had taken in marriage, to bear children in other families too. And I don’t know whether the wives objected;<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">13</span><span class="br"></span> for why should they care about a chastity, which their husbands gave away so easily? O model of Attic wisdom! O pattern of Roman diginity! The philosopher a pander, and the censor,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL250_179_a" id="target_note_LCL250_179_a"><sup>a</sup></a> too!</p>
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">14</span><span class="br"></span><p>What wonder then, if friends so dear have a common meal? For you attack our small feasts, quite apart from the infamy of the crimes committed at them, as being extravagant. Of course it was of Christians that Diogenes said that the Megarians market as if to die to-morrow, and build as if they were never to die at all. But any man sees a mote in another’s eye more easily than a beam in his own. With all those tribes and senates and<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">15</span><span class="br"></span> decurions belching the air grows sour. When the Salii<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL250_179_b" id="target_note_LCL250_179_b"><sup>b</sup></a> dine, the money-lender will be needed. Actuaries will have to reckon the cost of Hercules’ tithes<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL250_179_c" id="target_note_LCL250_179_c"><sup>c</sup></a> and banquets. At the Attic Apaturia, Dionysia and mysteries, conscription is proclaimed—for cooks. The smoke of a dinner of Serapis will fetch out the firemen. It is only the banquet of Christians that calls for criticism.</p>
