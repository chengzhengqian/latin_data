from actual monuments, I find none more reliable than in Italy itself, where, after his many expeditions and his visit to Attica, Saturn settled down, made welcome by Janus,—or Janes, as the Salii prefer it. The mountain which he inhabited is called<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">8</span><span class="br"></span> Saturnius; the city whose bounds he staked out is Saturnia to this day; the whole of Italy in fact, after being called Oenotria, bore the name Saturnia. From him first came writing<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL250_59_a" id="target_note_LCL250_59_a"><sup>a</sup></a>; and coin stamped with an image; and hence he rules the treasury. Yet, if Saturn was a man, I suppose he was born of<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">9</span><span class="br"></span> man; and, since he was born of man, he was not the child of the sky and the earth. But, where a man’s parents were unknown, it was easy for him to be called the child of sky and earth; we must all pass for being their children. Who would not call sky and earth mother and father, by way of veneration and honour? Or it may be merely human usage, just as we say that unknown persons or people turning up unexpectedly have come from the sky. Then as<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">10</span><span class="br"></span> Saturn was everywhere unexpected, it was his lot to be called a child of the sky. For people, whose family is unknown, are called, in the vulgar phrase, “sons of earth.” I waive the fact that men were in those days so uncivilized that they were moved by the sight of any strange person as if divine,—when to-day civilized people will deify persons whom they have a day or two before by public mourning admitted to be dead. But enough of Saturn, in these few<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">11</span><span class="br"></span> words. We will show that Jove too was a man and born of man, and thereafter that the whole family swarm were mortal,—mortal as the seed they came of.</p>
