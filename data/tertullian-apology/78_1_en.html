We must needs respect him as the chosen of our Lord. So I have a right to say, Caesar is<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> more ours than yours, appointed as he is by our God. He is mine; and so I do more for his safety,—not only because I seek it from Him only who can give it; or because I who ask am one who deserve to receive; but also because I set the majesty of Caesar below God and the more commend him to God to Whom alone I subordinate him. This I do, in that I do not make him equal to God.

If he is a man, it is a man’s interest to yield place to God. Let him be satisfied to be called Emperor. And a great name it is, too, that God gives him!

It is whispered to him from behind: “Look behind thee; remember thou art a man.” That he is in such a blaze of glory that the reminder of his mortal state is necessary for him—makes it the more delightful to him. He would be less, if he were at that moment called a god, because it would not be true. He is greater, who is called to look back, lest he think himself a god.</p>
