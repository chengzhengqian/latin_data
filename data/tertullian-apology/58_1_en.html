<p>savage, to civilization by terrorizing them with such a crowd of gods to worship as Numa did; but as one who should give to men, highly civilized already, and misled by their own urbanity, eyes to recognize the truth. Ask the question, then, whether that deity of Christ be true. If it is in fact such a deity that<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">31</span><span class="br"></span> the recognition of it remakes a man and makes him good, then it follows that false deity must be renounced, not least when the whole scheme of it is laid bare—how, under cover of the names and images of dead men, by means of certain signs, miracles and oracles, it gains credence for its own divinity.</p>

Tertullian is more derisive than accurate here. Plato constantly discusses gods and their nature, notably in <span class="italic">Rep.</span> ii. 378 <span class="sc">d, e</span> (the gods must be spoken of as they <span class="italic">are</span>, whatever defence is made of myth by the use of allegory), and <span class="italic">Timaeus</span>, 41 <span class="sc">a-d</span> (intermediary gods). Plutarch wrote much on the subject and emphasizes Hesiod’s distinction between gods and demons (which is hardly to be found in Homer). See my <span class="italic">Conflict of Religions</span>, ch. 3, pp. 94–103. Tertullian’s contemporary Apuleius in his little treatise “On the God of Socrates” offers the most illuminative commentary on what the Christian apologists say. See <span class="italic">Conflict</span>, pp. 231–232. Plutarch in his <span class="italic">De Iside</span> discusses “the Magian Zoroaster, who lived about 500 years before the Trojan War,” and his doctrine of good and bad spiritual natures; modern scholars give Zoroaster a much later date, and know more of his real teaching; but the literature of the Roman empire is full of references to <span class="italic">magi</span> and magic. Herodotus perhaps first introduced μάγοι to the notice of the West: i. 101, 120, 140. The Manichaean heresy is an offshoot, or indebted at least to Zoroaster.
