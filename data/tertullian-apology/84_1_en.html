Christians, in part obeying your own instincts, in part the laws? How often, too, without regard to you,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL250_169_a" id="target_note_LCL250_169_a"><sup>a</sup></a> does the unfriendly mob on its own account assail us with stones and fire? Mad as Bacchanals, they spare not even the Christian dead; no! from the repose of the grave, from what I may call death’s asylum, changed as the bodies may be, or mere fragments—they will have them out, rip and rend them. Yet I ask, though Christians are so sworn to<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> one purpose, so ready for death itself, what retaliation for injury can you charge against us, though a single night and a few little torches could work a lavish revenge, if among us wrong might be wiped out with wrong? But away with the thought that God’s school should either avenge itself with man’s fire, or resent the suffering that is its probation!</p>

All we have left to you is the temples! [We can count your troops; the Christians of one province will be more in number.] For what war<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span> should we not have been fit and ready even if unequal in forces—we who are so glad to be butchered—were it not, of course, that in our doctrine we are given ampler liberty to be killed than to kill?</p>
