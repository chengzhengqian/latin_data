look you! in that most religious of all cities, the city of the pious race of Aeneas, is a certain Jupiter, whom they drench with human blood at his own games. “Yes, but only the blood of a man condemned already to the beasts,” you say? That, I take it, makes it something less than a man’s blood? Or may it not be so much worse because the blood of a bad man? At all events it is at least the blood of murder. What a Christian Jove, to be sure, his father’s only son so far as cruelty goes!<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL250_49_a" id="target_note_LCL250_49_a"><sup>a</sup></a> But since<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">6</span><span class="br"></span> there is no difference as to baby-killing whether you do it as a sacred rite or just because you choose to do it (though we must grant a difference between murder and killing your own child<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL250_49_b" id="target_note_LCL250_49_b"><sup>b</sup></a>), I will turn to the people.</p>
<p>How many, think you, of these persons standing round and panting for Christian blood,—how many of you, most just magistrates and most severe upon us, how many should I touch in their consciences for killing their own children, born to them? Since<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">7</span><span class="br"></span> there is a difference between one kind of death and another, surely your way is more cruel, to choke out the breath in water, or to expose to cold, starvation and the dogs.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL250_49_ca" id="target_note_LCL250_49_ca"><sup>c</sup></a> Grown-up people would sooner die by iron. For us murder is once for all forbidden; so even<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">8</span><span class="br"></span> the child in the womb, while yet the mother’s blood is still being drawn on to form the human being, it is not lawful for us to destroy. To forbid birth is only quicker murder. It makes no difference whether one take away the life once born or destroy it as it comes to birth. He is a man, who is to be a man; the fruit is always present in the seed.</p>
