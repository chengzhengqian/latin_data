For your gods are later than the catastrophe of the flood, and that is proved by the actual cities in which they were born and died, yes, and which they founded; for otherwise they would not remain till to-day, unless they were later than that catastrophe. Not yet had Palestine received the swarm of Jews<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">7</span><span class="br"></span> from Egypt, the race whence came the Christian school had not yet settled there, when a rain of fire burnt up Sodom and Gomorrha, the regions on its borders.
