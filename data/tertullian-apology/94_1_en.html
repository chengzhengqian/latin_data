they injure their own worshippers too, whom they ought to keep clear of the punishment of the Christians.</p>
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span><p>“But this,” you say, “can be retorted upon your God too, since He Himself because of the profane suffers His own worshippers to be injured.” First admit His disposition of events, and then you will not turn this against Him. For He who has ordained<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> eternal judgement once for all after the end of the world does not hasten to make that separation (which is the essence of the judgement) before the end of the world. Meantime He treats all mankind equally, both in concession and in warning. He has wished the pleasant things of life to be shared by the profane, the unpleasant by His own, that by an equality of lot we might make trial of His gentleness and His severity. Because we have thus learnt of Him, we love His<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span> gentleness, we dread His severity; you, on the other hand, despise both the one and the other. It follows that all the plagues of the world (it may be) come on us for admonition, on you for chastisement, from God.</p>
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span><p>Yet we are none the worse for it; first, because nothing matters to us in this age but to escape from it with all speed; and next, because, if any trouble is inflicted upon us, we set it down to your sins. But, even if things now and then touch us in passing because we live so close to you. we only rejoice the more to recognize the divine predictions, and they (to be sure) confirm our confidence, our faith in our hope. But if, on the other hand, all these evils come on you<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">6</span><span class="br"></span> from the gods you worship, and come because of us, why persevere in worshipping gods so unjust and so ungrateful, who ought rather to be helping and supporting you while the Christians are suffering?</p>
