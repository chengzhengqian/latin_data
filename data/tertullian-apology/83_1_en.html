If it comes to this that men who were called Romans are found to be enemies, why are we, who are thought to be enemies, denied the name of Romans? It is impossible to say that we are not Romans because we are enemies, when enemies are discovered who were counted Romans.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL250_167_a" id="target_note_LCL250_167_a"><sup>a</sup></a> The piety,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> the religious attitude, the loyalty, owed to Emperors does not consist of such observances as hostility may perform to cloak its intentions; but in that type of character which God as truly requires of us to show our right feeling towards the Emperor as He requires it in the case of all men.
