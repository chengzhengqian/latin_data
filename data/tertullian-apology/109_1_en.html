like a curtain before that eternal dispensation, shall pass away, then shall all mankind be restored, for the determination of what good or evil it has done in this age, and for its requital, in strict accord, throughout the boundless continuance of eternity. So it<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">13</span><span class="br"></span> is not death now, and then resurrection after resurrection. We shall be the same persons that now we are, and not others in succession,—the worshippers of God, we shall ever be with God, clothed upon<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL250_219_a" id="target_note_LCL250_219_a"><sup>a</sup></a> with the nature proper to eternity; but the profane, and those who are not right with God, shall be punished with fire as lasting, and from its nature they too, as God ordains, shall derive incorruptibility.</p>
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">14</span><span class="br"></span><p>The philosophers know the distinction between mysterious and common fire. The fire that serves man’s use is one thing; the fire that ministers to the judgement of God is another, whether flashing the thunderbolts from heaven, or rushing up from the earth through the mountain-tops. For it does not consume what it burns, but, even while it spends it, repairs the loss. So the mountains remain, ever<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">15</span><span class="br"></span> burning; and he who is touched by fire from heaven, is safe—no fire shall turn him to ashes.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL250_219_b" id="target_note_LCL250_219_b"><sup>b</sup></a> Take this as evidence for fire eternal, this as a type of endless judgement with punishment ever renewing. The mountains burn and endure. What of the guilty, what of God’s enemies?</p>

<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1</span><span class="br"></span><p>XLIX. All this you call presumption in our case, but only in our case; in the case of philosophers and poets it is supreme knowledge, it is unique genius! They are wise, we are silly; honour is their due; mockery is ours, yes, and punishment into the bargain. But<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> now suppose what protects us to be false, and really presumption; still it is necessary: silly—but useful!
