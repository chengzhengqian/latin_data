story how certain angels corrupted themselves and how from them was produced a brood of demons yet more corrupt, condemned by God with the authors of their race and that prince whom we have named—all this is duly made known in the sacred books.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL250_119_a" id="target_note_LCL250_119_a"><sup>a</sup></a> Here<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span> and now it will be enough to explain how they go to work. Their work is the ruin of man; thus spiritual wickedness from the very beginning designed the destruction of man. So on men’s bodies they inflict sicknesses and other bitter calamities, and on the soul sudden extravagant bursts of violence. To assail both sides of man’s nature their subtle and impalpable substance avails them. Much is possible to the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span> might of these spirits, so that, undetected by sight or sense, they are recognized more in the consequences of their action than in their action itself; as when some obscure blight lays fruit and crop low when still in flower, takes life out of the bud, or wounds them in their full growth, and when the air is tainted in some unseen way and sweeps down with wafts of pestilence.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL250_119_b" id="target_note_LCL250_119_b"><sup>b</sup></a> By a contagion similar in its<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">6</span><span class="br"></span> obscurity the breath of demons and angels achieves the corruption of the mind in foul bursts of fury and insanity, or in savage lusts, along with every kind of delusion; and of all delusions that is the greatest which they use to recommend those gods to the captive and outwitted minds of men—and it also serves to secure for themselves their peculiar diet of smell and blood, offered to their likenesses and images.
