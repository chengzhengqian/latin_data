Recognition of what has come to pass may properly dispose to belief in what is yet to be. The same voices have foretold both alike; the same books have recorded both. Time, which seems to us to be twofold (past and present), in those books is one. So all that remains over unproved, is for us proved, because it was foretold along with what is already proved but then was yet to be.
