squalid jungle of laws with the new axes of imperial rescripts and edicts? Why, those absurd Papian laws<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL250_27_a" id="target_note_LCL250_27_a"><sup>a</sup></a><span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">8</span><span class="br"></span> which require people to have children at an earlier age than the Julian laws require them to be marriedâ€”did not the valiant Emperor Severus clear them out but yesterday for all their old age and authority? Yes, and the laws had it of old that the debtor should<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">9</span><span class="br"></span> on being sentenced be cut up by the creditors; yet by common agreement that cruelty was erased, and for the punishment of death there was substituted a mark of disgrace; the confiscation of his goods that was applied meant a preference for the blush spread rather than the blood shed.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL250_27_b" id="target_note_LCL250_27_b"><sup>b</sup></a></p>
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">10</span><span class="br"></span><p>How many of your laws lie forgotten, still to be reformed? What recommends a law is not the number of its years nor the dignity of its makers, but its equity and nothing else. So when laws are recognized to be unjust, they are deservedly condemned, even if they do condemn. But why do we say unjust<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">11</span><span class="br"></span>? I will go further, and, if they punish a name, I will say silly. If it is deeds they punish, why in our case do they punish deeds on the score of the name alone, while in the case of others they must have them proved not from a name but from an act committed? I am incestuous, say they; why do they not inquire into it? If it be murder of babies, why do they not torture the fact from me? I commit something against a god or a Caesar, why, when I am able to clear my character, am I not heard? No law forbids<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">12</span><span class="br"></span> the investigation of the act, of which it forbids the commission. The judge does not justly avenge, unless he knows that the unlawful act was committed; nor does the citizen faithfully obey the law, if he does not know what sort of act the law avenges. A law<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">13</span><span class="br"></span>
