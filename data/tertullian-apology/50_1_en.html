<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1</span><span class="br"></span><p>XX. More than an equivalent we offer you in return for postponement of proof—the majesty of the scriptures—if we do not prove them divine from their antiquity, if it is still a question whether they are ancient. There will be no delay about <span class="italic">this</span>, or reference to evidence from elsewhere; here, in our presence, are the things that will teach us—I mean, the world, all time, all history. Everything that<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> happens was foretold; everything now seen was of old heard. That the lands swallow up cities; that the seas steal islands; that wars without and wars within lacerate us; that kingdoms clash with kingdoms; that famine and plague, local disasters and wholesale death lay us waste; that the lowly are set on high, the high brought low; that justice grows<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> rare, iniquity lavish and to spare, good manners lack all care; that the seasons are out of gear and the functions of the elements astray; that the order of nature is perverted by monsters and portents—it was all foreseen, it was all written. While we suffer, it is all read in the book; the recognition is the proof of it. I opine that a fair proof of the divinity would be the truth of the divination! Hence, then, we have<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span> a sure belief in what is yet to be—as proved already, in that it was predicted along with what every day is being proved. The same voices name it, the same books proclaim it; the same spirit impels them; time is <span class="italic">one</span> for divination foretelling what shall be.
