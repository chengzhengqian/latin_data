We, however,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> whom all the flames of glory and dignity leave cold, have no need to combine; nothing is more foreign to us than the State.

<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span><p>Your public games, too, we renounce, as heartily as we do their origins; we know these origins lie in superstition; we leave on one side the matters with which they are concerned. We have nothing to do, in speech, sight or hearing, with the madness of the circus, the shamelessness of the theatre, the savagery of the arena, the vanity of the gymnasium. Why should we offend you, if we assume<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span> the existence of other pleasures? If we do not wish to know delight, it is our loss; in any case, not yours. But we reject what pleases you; what pleases us gives you no delight. But the Epicureans were allowed to maintain their theory of what true pleasure is; they found it in calm of mind; † and for Christian . . . . . . there is ample occupation. †</p>
