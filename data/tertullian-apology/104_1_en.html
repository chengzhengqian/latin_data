represent Him as taking care of the world; on the other hand the Epicureans picture Him as idle and unemployed, a nobody (so to say) as regards human affairs. The Stoics set Him outside the world,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">7</span><span class="br"></span> like a potter to whirl this fabric round from outside; the Platonists put Him inside the world, like a pilot, to stay inside of what He guides.
