confederates. In our case nothing of the kind! Yet<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span> it ought just as much to be wrung out of us (whenever that false charge is made) how many murdered babies each of us had tasted, how many acts of incest he had done in the dark, what cooks were there—yes, and what dogs.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL250_11_a" id="target_note_LCL250_11_a"><sup>a</sup></a> Oh! the glory of that magistrate who had brought to light some Christian who had eaten up to date a hundred babies!</p>
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">6</span><span class="br"></span><p>And yet we find it is forbidden even to hunt us down. For when Plinius Secundus was governing his province and had condemned some Christians and driven others from their steadfastness, and still the sheer numbers concerned worried him as to what he ought to do thereafter, he consulted the Emperor Trajan.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL250_11_ba" id="target_note_LCL250_11_ba"><sup>b</sup></a> He asserted that, apart from an obstinacy that refused to sacrifice, he had learnt nothing about the Christian mysteries—nothing beyond meetings before dawn to sing to Christ and to God, and to band themselves together in discipline, forbidding murder, adultery, dishonesty, treachery, and the other crimes. Trajan replied in a<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">7</span><span class="br"></span> rescript that men of this kind were not to be sought out, but if they were brought before Pliny they must be punished. What a decision, how inevitably<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">8</span><span class="br"></span> entangled! He says they must not be sought out, implying they are innocent; and he orders them to be punished, implying they are guilty. He spares them and rages against them, he pretends not to see and punishes. Why cheat yourself with your judgement? If you condemn them, why not hunt them
