For if so vast a mass of people as we had broken away from you and removed to some recess of the world apart, the mere loss of so many citizens of whatever sort would have brought a blush<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL250_171_a" id="target_note_LCL250_171_a"><sup>a</sup></a> to your rule—yes, that it would, and punished you, too, by sheer desertion! Beyond<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">7</span><span class="br"></span> doubt, you would have shuddered at your solitude, at the silence in the world, the stupor as it were of a dead globe.
