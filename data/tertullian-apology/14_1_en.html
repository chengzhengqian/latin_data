There was an ancient decree, that no god should be consecrated by an imperator without the approval of the Senate. M. Aemilius knows about that law in the matter of his god, Alburnus.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL250_29_a" id="target_note_LCL250_29_a"><sup>a</sup></a> It bears also on our case, because among you a god’s divinity depends on man’s decision. Unless a god please man, he shall not be a god at all; in fact, man must be gracious to god!

The Senate had not approved beforehand and so rejected it. Caesar held to his opinion and threatened danger to accusers of the Christians. Consult your<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> histories.

It seems to have been an inference (perhaps from the ways of the Civil Service at the end of the second century) that Pilate must have written to Tiberius; few will suppose that the document was actually seen among archives. The rest of the story would appear to be largely inference from inference, or mere guesswork.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL250_29_ba').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL250_29_c"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL250_29_c" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">c</sup>See Tacitus, <span class="italic">Annals</span>, xv. 44. 3.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL250_29_c').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
