To begin, then: when you harshly cut<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span> the case short by saying, “Your existence is illegal<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL250_25_a" id="target_note_LCL250_25_a"><sup>a</sup></a>”; when you lay it down without any more humane reconsideration, your dictum means mere force, an unjust tyranny from the citadel<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL250_25_b" id="target_note_LCL250_25_b"><sup>b</sup></a>—if you say a thing is not lawful simply because that is your will, and not because it <span class="italic">ought</span> not to be lawful.

If your law has made a mistake, well, I think, it was the creation of man; it did not come down from heaven.</p>
