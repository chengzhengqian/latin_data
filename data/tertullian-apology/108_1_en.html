light is slain and shines once more; darkness in due turn departs and follows on again; and the dead stars come to life; seasons, when they end, begin anew; crops are matured and return; assuredly the seed must be wasted and dissolved to grow more fruitfully; everything is saved by being lost; everything is re-fashioned out of death. You, O man!

The same Reason made a unity of Time also, mapping out and distinguishing the terms of its course, so that this first part of it from the beginning of the world, the part of our habitation, should flow on age by age to an end, but the later part of it, to which we look forward, should stretch out to an endless eternity.</p>
