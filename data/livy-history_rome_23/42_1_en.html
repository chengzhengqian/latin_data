senate charged the aediles with the duty of going about the city and ordering that shops be opened and the appearance of public mourning removed from the city. And then Tiberius Sempronius held a session of the senate;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL355_85_1" id="target_note_LCL355_85_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and he comforted the fathers, and urged that men who had not given way to the catastrophe at Cannae should not lose heart in the face of lesser disasters. So far as concerned the Carthaginian enemy and Hannibal, he said that, if only coming events should prove favourable, as he hoped, a Gallic war could be both safely neglected and postponed, and punishment for that treachery would be in the power of the gods and of the Roman people. It was in regard to the Carthaginian enemy and the armies with which to carry on that war that they must deliberate and debate. He himself first stated what number of infantry and cavalry, of citizens and allies, were in the dictator’s army. Then Marcellus set forth the total of his forces. As to what troops were in Apulia with the consul Gaius Terentius, those who knew were questioned; and no method of making up consular armies strong enough for so great a war was found. And so, although righteous indignation goaded them, it was decided that Gaul should be left out of account that year. The dictator’s army was assigned to the consul. As for the army of Marcus Marcellus, it was voted that those of them who were survivors of the rout at Cannae should be transported to Sicily and serve there so long as there should be war in Italy; also that from the dictator’s legions all the least efficient soldiers should be sent away to the same province, with no definite term of service except that of the campaigns
