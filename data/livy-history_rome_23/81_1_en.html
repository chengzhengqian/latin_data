<p>XLVIII. Thereafter the winter quarters were <span class="marginNote right"><span class="sc">b.c.</span> 215</span>
undisturbed, and the consul moved his camp back again, that the Campanians might do their sowing.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL355_163_1" id="target_note_LCL355_163_1"><sup>1</sup></a> And he did not ravage the Campanian country until the growing grain in the fields was tall enough to furnish fodder. This he transported to the Claudian Camp above Suessula and there built winter barracks. He ordered Marcus Claudius, the proconsul, to keep at Nola only the garrison needed to defend the city, and to send away the rest of the soldiers to Rome, lest they be a burden to the allies and an expense to the state. And Tiberius Gracchus, after leading his legions from Cumae to Luceria in Apulia, sent thence Marcus Valerius, the praetor, to Brundisium with the army which he had had at Luceria, and ordered him to defend the coast of the Sallentine region<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL355_163_2" id="target_note_LCL355_163_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and to take measures concerning Philip and the Macedonian war.</p>
<p>At the end of the summer in which occurred the events I have described, there came a letter from Publius and Gnaeus Scipio, reporting how great and how successful had been their operations in Spain;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL355_163_3" id="target_note_LCL355_163_3"><sup>3</sup></a> but that money for pay, also clothing and grain, were lacking for the army, and for the crews everything. So far as pay was concerned, if the treasury was empty, they would find some method of getting it from the Spaniards. Everything else, they said, must in any case be sent from Rome, and in no other way could either the army or the province be kept. After the reading of the letter, there was no one among them all<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL355_163_4" id="target_note_LCL355_163_4"><sup>4</sup></a> who did not admit that the statements were true and the demands fair. But they reflected what great forces on land and sea they were maintaining, and how large a new fleet must soon be made ready
