moved his own camp to Cumae the day before the Campanians had their regular sacrifice. Hamae is three miles distant. Already the Campanians in large numbers had gathered there according to agreement. And in concealment, not far from there, Marius Alfius, the <span class="italic">medix tuticus,</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL355_125_1" id="target_note_LCL355_125_1"><sup>1</sup></a> that is, the chief magistrate of the Campanians, had his camp, with fourteen thousand armed men, he being decidedly more intent upon preparing the sacrifice and contriving treachery during the same than upon fortifying his camp or upon any task of the soldier. The sacrifice took place at night, but it was to be finished before midnight. Gracchus, thinking he must be in waiting for that moment, placed guards at the gates, that no one might be able to carry away news of his undertaking. And having assembled his soldiers as early as the tenth hour of the day, he ordered them to get themselves in condition and take care to sleep, so that, as soon as it was dark, they might come together at the signal; and at about the first watch he ordered that the standards be taken up. And setting out with a silent column, he reached Hamae at midnight and entered the Campanian camp by all its gates at once; for, as was to be expected in view of the vigil, it was carelessly guarded. Some they slew as they lay asleep, others as they were returning unarmed after the rite had been completed. More than two thousand men were slain in that affray by night, including Marius Alfius, the commander himself. Captured were. . . thousand men<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL355_125_2" id="target_note_LCL355_125_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and thirty-four
military standards.</p>
