rejoiced, not so much over the victory, as that Hasdrubal’s crossing into Italy had been prevented.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL355_101_1" id="target_note_LCL355_101_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>XXX. While these things were going on in Spain, Petelia,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL355_101_2" id="target_note_LCL355_101_2"><sup>2</sup></a> in the land of the Bruttii, was taken by Himilco, Hannibal’s prefect, some months after the siege began. That victory cost the Carthaginians much blood and many wounds, and starvation<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL355_101_3" id="target_note_LCL355_101_3"><sup>3</sup></a> more than any assault overpowered the besieged. For after they had consumed their food-supply in cereals and flesh, the familiar and the unfamiliar, of four-footed beasts of every kind, they finally lived on hides and grasses and roots and tender bark and leaves stripped off. And they were not overpowered until they had no strength left to stand on the walls and bear arms. Having taken Petelia, the Carthaginian led his troops across to Consentia, and as it was less obstinately defended, he received its surrender within a few days. About the same time an army of the Bruttians also besieged Croton,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL355_101_4" id="target_note_LCL355_101_4"><sup>4</sup></a> a Greek city formerly rich in arms and men, but even then so crushed by many great disasters that, including all ages, less than two thousand citizens remained. And so the enemy easily gained possession of the city bereft of its defenders. Only the citadel was still held, and to it some, in the uproar of a captured city, made their escape out of the midst of slaughter. And Locri went over to the Bruttians and Carthaginians, the populace having been betrayed by the leading men. Regium alone in that region remained loyal to the Romans and to the very last independent.
