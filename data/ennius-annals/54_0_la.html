<h2><span class="ac">BOOK VII</span></h2>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">This book is thought to have opened with a proem in which Ennius simultaneously acknowledged his predecessor Naevius’ success in memorializing Rome’s first struggle with Carthage and asserted the artistic superiority of his own achievement as the first creator of a Latin epic in hexameters (F 1–2). The historical narrative that followed this introduction appears to have begun with an ethnography of Carthage (F 3–5) and, in tacit deference to Naevius, made only passing mention of the First Punic War (F 6–9). </span></p>
<span class="label"><span class="italic">F 1–2: A Prooemium</span></span>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">This programmatic introduction has long attracted attention for the light it appears to shed on Ennius’ poetic aspirations and the place he claimed for himself in Latin literary history (e.g., Suerbaum 1968, 249–95; Habinek 2006; Wiseman 2006). Though Varro also quotes it (</span>Ling.<span class="italic"> 7.36), Cicero’s evident fondness for the passage (</span>Brut.<span class="italic"> 71, 76; </span>Orat.<span class="italic"> 157, 171; </span>Div.<span class="italic"> 1.114) probably explains its recollection by so many subsequent authors (e.g., Quint. </span>Inst.<span class="italic"> 9.4.115; Serv. Dan. ad Verg. </span>G.<span class="italic"> 1.11; Orig. 4.4–5; Fest., p. 432.13–20 L.; Mar. Victorin., </span>GL<span class="italic"> VI, pp. 138.32–39.1). </span></p>
