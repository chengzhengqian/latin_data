<p class="noindent">But Pyrrhus bore witness before his gods and before men to the horrific slaughter he sustained in this battle, placing an inscription in the temple of Jupiter at Tarentum, in which he wrote these lines:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL294_207_1" id="target_note_LCL294_207_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line indent8">men who previously</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">had been unvanquished, best father of Olympus,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">those I vanquished by force in battle and was by the same men vanquished</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">and when he was rebuked by his allies, asking why he, who had vanquished, said he had been vanquished, he is said to have replied, “Well, if I were victorious a second time in that way, I would return to Epirus with not a single soldier.”</p>

<p class="noindent">Indeed, the famous words of Pyrrhus concerning the return of prisoners are outstanding:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">I do not ask for gold for myself, nor should you give me a ransom:</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">not hawking war but waging war,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">with iron, not with gold let both sides resolve the vital question.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Whether you or me Dame Fortune wants to rule, or whatever she brings,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
