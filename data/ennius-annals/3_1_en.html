<p class="noindent">“seems to care little”: Ennius is now at ease over the growth of his fame, about which he had previously been anxious: he wrote at the beginning of his <span class="italic">Annals</span> that he was advised in a dream that, according to the doctrine of Pythagoras, Homer’s soul had come into his body. He [Horace] wittily called the dreams Pythagorean, as if he [Ennius] seems actually to see Pythagoras himself on account of his metempsychosis [?].</p>

<p class="noindent">“after he had snored off”:<span class="sc"> </span>. . . [2] So Ennius asserts at the beginning of his <span class="italic">Annals</span>, where he says that he had seen Homer in a dream saying that he had once been a peacock and from that his soul was transferred into him [Ennius] according to the dictates of the philosopher Pythagoras, who says that human souls, through palingenesis, i.e., through repeated births, emerge from their bodies and are able to enter other bodies. [3] And further, he [Persius] said “fifth” because of the belief that says the soul of Pythagoras was transferred into a peacock, from a peacock then to Euphorbus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL294_113_1" id="target_note_LCL294_113_1"><sup>1</sup></a> from Euphorbus to Homer, finally from Homer to Ennius. [4] Or, of course, because Ennius was called by this name [i.e., Quintus, lit. “fifth”].</p>
