<p class="noindent">We also wondered if the ancients used <span class="italic">superesse</span> to mean “to remain and be lacking to complete a thing,” [15] for Sallust uses in that sense not <span class="italic">superesse</span> but <span class="italic">superare </span>[<span class="italic">Iug.</span> 70.2] . . . [16] but we find in this verse in the third book of Ennius’ <span class="italic">Annals</span>:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">then he declares that one task remains for him</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">that is, “is left and remains undone,” but this is because it is divided and should be pronounced not as one part of speech [i.e., the verb <span class="italic">superesse</span>] but as two [i.e., adverb <span class="italic">super</span> + verb <span class="italic">esse</span>], which it is.</p>
