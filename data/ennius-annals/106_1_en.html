<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">178–177 BC, and the capture of Nesactium may be the context of F 8 (cf. Liv. 41.11.4–5), but the military references in this book are largely generic and thus impossible to place. The descriptive flourishes in F 13, 14, 17, and 18 and the touch of tragic history in F 8 and 16 suggest a poet working with what has become a well-established epic idiom.</span></p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">For the proem to Book 16 and its wider ramifications, see Suerbaum 1968, 113–67. The reconstruction by Badian 1972, 185–87, and Martina 1979 of the politics that motivated Ennius’ addition of this book, invoked passim by Skutsch, should be treated with caution.</span></p>
