<p class="noindent">Among them [the Greeks], if nouns ending in <span class="italic">x</span> have verbs with <span class="italic">g</span>, the genitive of the nouns is declined with <span class="italic">g </span>. . . from which <span class="italic">frux</span> [fruit] too makes its genitive <span class="italic">frugis</span>, since it derives from the Greek verb φρύγω [to parch]. Ennius in Book 16 [17?] of the <span class="italic">Annals</span>:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">if by daylight, if at night, if soon, if now there were an advantage</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p>​</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="bold">*22</span> Diomedes</p>
<p class="noindent">For <span class="italic">hortatur</span> [urges], which we commonly say, some ancients said <span class="italic">horitur</span>, as Ennius in Book sixteen of the <span class="italic">Annals</span>:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line indent4">he urges and encourages [them?] to eat</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">so too in ten [F 13] . . .</p>
<p>​</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="bold">*23</span> Servius, <span class="italic">Commentary on Virgil</span></p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">ore fave</span>: approach with reverent silence. Ennius in Book 16:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">here in ambush they keep watch: some at rest,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">equipped with swords, keeping silent behind their shields</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">the same expression is also used for <span class="italic">velle</span> [to wish] by the same Ennius in Book 16 . . . [F 16].</p>
