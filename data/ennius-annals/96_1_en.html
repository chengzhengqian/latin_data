<p class="noindent">Caesellius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL294_299_1" id="target_note_LCL294_299_1"><sup>1</sup></a> wrote that Ennius, in the thirteenth book of his <span class="italic">Annals</span>, used <span class="italic">cor</span> in the masculine gender. [4] Caesellius’ words follow: “Ennius used <span class="italic">cor</span>, like many other words, in the masculine gender; for in <span class="italic">Annals</span> 13 he said <span class="italic">quem cor.</span>” [5] He then cited two verses of Ennius: “Hannibal, of audacious heart, urges me not to make war: what heart did he think was mine?” [6] The speaker is Antiochus, king of Asia. He is surprised and indignant that Hannibal, the Carthaginian, discourages his desire to make war on the Roman people. [7] Now, Caesellius understands these lines as if Antiochus were saying: “Hannibal dissuades me from making war. When doing so, what kind of heart does he think I have, and how foolish does he believe me to be, when he wishes to persuade me of this?” [8] So Caesellius; but Ennius’ meaning was quite different. [9] For there are three verses, not two belonging to this utterance of Ennius, of which Caesellius overlooked the third verse:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">Hannibal of audacious heart urges me</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">not to wage war, whom my heart took to be</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">the greatest advocate and zealous mainstay [?]<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL294_299_2" id="target_note_LCL294_299_2"><sup>2</sup></a> of war</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">[10] The meaning and arrangement of these verses I believe to be this: “Hannibal, that boldest and most valiant man, who I believed (for that is the meaning of <span class="italic">cor meum credidit</span>,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL294_299_3" id="target_note_LCL294_299_3"><sup>3</sup></a> exactly as if he had said ‘who I, foolish man, believed’) would strongly advise war, discourages and dissuades
