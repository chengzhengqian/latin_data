<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Gellius clearly states on Varro’s authority (T 84) that Ennius composed this book in his sixty-seventh year (i.e., 172 BC), a fact difficult to reconcile with the widely held view that Ennius added a sixteenth book to his </span>Annals<span class="italic"> to relate events of the early 170s BC.

<span class="line">so now the man’s glory shines ever brighter with passing time.</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
