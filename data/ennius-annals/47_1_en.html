<p class="noindent">Why should I accept Herodotus as more truthful than Ennius? Surely he was no less able to invent stories about Croesus than Ennius was about Pyrrhus? Who could believe that the response of Apollo’s oracle to Pyrrhus was</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">I say that you, Aeacus’ descendant, the Romans can defeat</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">First, Apollo never spoke in Latin. Second, that prophecy is unknown to the Greeks. Third, in Pyrrhus’ day Apollo had ceased making verses, and finally, although it was always the case, as in Ennius, that “obtuse is the race of the Aeacids . . .” [F 14], he would nevertheless have been able to understand that this ambiguous verse “the Romans you defeat” could as easily apply to himself as to the Romans.</p>
