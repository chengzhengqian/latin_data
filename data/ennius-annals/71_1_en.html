<p class="noindent">In the seventh book of the <span class="italic">Annals</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL294_249_1" id="target_note_LCL294_249_1"><sup>1</sup></a><span class="italic"> </span>Ennius describes and defines very vividly and skillfully in the story of Servilius Geminus, a man of distinction . . . what remedies, forms of relief and solace for abating the annoyances of life the friend of a man superior in social class and fortune ought to have. . . . [4] I therefore thought these [verses] worth quoting, in case anyone desired to see them immediately.</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">Having said these things, he summons the man with whom very often</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">he cared to share his table and conversation and his thoughts</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">on private matters when exhausted from having spent the greater part</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">of the day managing the highest affairs of state,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">giving advice in the forum and the sacred Senate.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">To him he would speak with confidence of matters great and small,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">of jests and of matters bad and good alike to say</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">he would unburden, if he wished, and keep them in safety,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">with whom much pleasure<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL294_249_2" id="target_note_LCL294_249_2"><sup>2</sup></a></span><span class="linebreak"></span>

<span class="line">whose character no frivolous or evil thought induces</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">to do an evil deed; a learned, loyal,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">accommodating man, delightful, content with what he has, happy,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">discerning, with the right word at the right time, obliging, of few</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
