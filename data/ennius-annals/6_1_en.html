<p class="noindent">I shall speak in this book of the words used by poets, first concerning places . . .</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">Muses,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL294_119_1" id="target_note_LCL294_119_1"><sup>1</sup></a> who strike great Olympus with your feet</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">[20] The Greeks call the heaven Olympus. All people call the mountain in Macedonia Olympus, for which reason, I am inclined to think, the Muses were called “daughters of Olympus.”</p>
<span class="label"><span class="italic">F 2–9: Ennius’ Dream Vision</span></span>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">puzzle are placed here by conjecture: F 5 might instead refer to the exposure of Romulus and Remus (Elliott 2013, 149), F 6–7 may belong to the </span>Epicharmus<span class="italic"> (Elliott 2013, 144–48). Compare Lucilius’ evocation of cosmic phenomena in his condemnation of Lupus (784–90 M. = 805–11 W.). Important modern discussions of the episode and its wider implications for Roman literary culture include Suerbaum 1968, 46–113; Hardie 1986, 76–83; Aicher 1989/90; Barchiesi 1995.</span></p>
