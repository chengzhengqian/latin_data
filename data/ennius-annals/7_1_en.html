<p class="noindent">as the poet says, I see you in my dreams, I invariably hug and kiss you fondly. Then, following the course of each dream, I either weep profusely or dance with a kind of happiness and pleasure. This is one proof taken from the annals of my love, poetic and dreamy indeed.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL294_121_1" id="target_note_LCL294_121_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p class="noindent">Do you suppose that Ennius, when he had gone for a walk in the garden with his neighbor Servius Galba, said “I seemed to walk with Galba”? But when he dreamed, he reported thus:</p>

<p class="noindent">and similarly in the <span class="italic">Epicharmus</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL294_121_1-1" id="target_note_LCL294_121_1-1"><sup>1</sup></a> [F 1]: “for I seemed to dream that I was dead.” And so, as soon as we have awakened, we disparage those visions and do not regard them the same way as the things we have done in active life.</p>
