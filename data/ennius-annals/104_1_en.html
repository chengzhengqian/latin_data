<blockquote><p><span class="line">they trimmed the uprights, platforms and towers are made</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">These are also in the circus [i.e., the platforms], which among the ancients were erected of wood for spectators.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="bold">*2</span> Priscian</p>
<p class="noindent">The oldest writers nevertheless also displayed a genitive <span class="italic">praecipis</span>, which from the noun <span class="italic">praeceps</span> followed on analogy from the nominative. . . . Ennius in <span class="italic">Annals</span> 15:</p>

<p class="noindent">About Ajax’ heroic fighting Homer says [<span class="italic">Il.</span> 16.102–11] . . . In Book fifteen Ennius applies this passage to the fighting of the tribune Gaius Aelius, with these lines:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL294_315_1" id="target_note_LCL294_315_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

A tribune named Gaius Aelius figures, together with his brother Titus, in Livy’s story not of Ambracia but of the Istrian War of 178/7 BC (Liv. 41.1.7, 3.6–8, 4.3), leading Warmington to set the fragment in Book 16.
