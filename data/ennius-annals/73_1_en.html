<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">meddix</span> is the name of a magistrate among the Oscans. Ennius:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">there the chief <span class="italic">meddix</span> is captured, the other killed</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>

<p class="noindent"><span class="bold">16</span> Gellius, <span class="italic">Attic Nights</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Marcus Varro’s words in Book 5 of his <span class="italic">Instructions</span> are these: “It is one thing to be elected praetor <span class="italic">quarto</span> [fourth] and another to be praetor <span class="italic">quartum</span> [for the fourth time], because <span class="italic">quarto</span> indicates the order with three elected before, <span class="italic">quartum</span> indicates time and three previous elections. Therefore what Ennius wrote was correct:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">Quintus his father is elected consul for the fourth time</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">and Pompey was timid when, to avoid writing either ‘consul for the third time’ or ‘third’ on his theater, he did not write the final letters.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL294_253_1" id="target_note_LCL294_253_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p class="noindent">Those we call “Oscans” Verrius says were previously called “Opscans,” citing Ennius, since he says:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line indent4">the Opscan conducts his business from the walls</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p>​</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="bold">18</span> (cf. <span class="italic">Inc.</span> F 19) Festus</p>
<p class="noindent">Ennius:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">he began marching his legions toward Rome at night</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
