<p class="noindent">Although <span class="italic">acer</span> and <span class="italic">alacer</span> and <span class="italic">saluber</span> and <span class="italic">celeber</span> for the most part form as a feminine <span class="italic">acris</span> and <span class="italic">alacris</span> and <span class="italic">salubris</span> and <span class="italic">celebris</span>, nevertheless in both terminations they are found inflected the same way . . . Ennius in 16:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">autumn follows on summer, after it comes keen winter</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">the same in 12 [F 2] . . .</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="bold">*19</span> Festus</p>
<p class="noindent">The ancients used to say <span class="italic">speres</span> [hopes] in the plural, as Ennius, Book 2 [F 17] . . . and Book 16:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">I hope, if hopes can do some kind of good at all</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p>​</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="bold">*20</span> Festus</p>
<p class="noindent">Verrius thinks <span class="italic">sas</span> means <span class="italic">eas</span> [them], citing Ennius, who says in Book 1 [F 49] . . . just as in Book 8 it must be admitted that <span class="italic">eam</span> [her] is meant when he says [F 2] . . . Likewise, when he says <span class="italic">sapsam</span>, he uses it instead of <span class="italic">ipsa nec alia</span> [that and nothing else] in Book 16:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">in which place the very situation reveals itself and commands</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
