<p class="noindent"><span class="bold">*6</span> Nonius</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">ansatae</span>: missiles with thongs. Ennius, Book 5:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">they send down thonged missiles from the towers</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>

<p class="noindent"><span class="bold">*7</span> Priscian</p>
<p class="noindent">But it [distinctions among active, deponent, and inceptive forms] is even more the case with <span class="italic">misereo </span>[I take pity], which the oldest writers used, as mentioned above. Ennius in <span class="italic">Annals</span> 5:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">in tears they compelled the enemy to take pity</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>

<p class="noindent"><span class="bold">*8</span> Macrobius, <span class="italic">Saturnalia</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Using <span class="italic">agmen</span> [column] to mean <span class="italic">actus</span> [movement] and a kind of <span class="italic">ductus</span> [directed motion] is not inelegant, as in “the Tiber flows with gentle column” [Verg. <span class="italic">Aen.</span> 2.782]; indeed, it is also ancient. So Ennius says in Book 5:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">the river that flows with gentle column through the pleasant city</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
