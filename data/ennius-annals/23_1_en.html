<span class="line">Aventine seeks and watches for the high-soaring race.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">They were competing whether to call the city Roma or Remora.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">All men were anxious over which would be their ruler.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">They wait, as when the consul prepares to give</span><span class="linebreak"></span>

<span class="line">Then struck by rays the shining light showed itself openly</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">and at once on high from far away a beautifully winged</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">leftward flight advanced. Just as the golden sun arises,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">there comes descending from the sky a dozen blessed bodies</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">of birds, settling themselves on fine and favorable seats.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
