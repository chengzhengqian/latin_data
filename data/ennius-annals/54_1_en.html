<h2><span class="ac">BOOK VII</span></h2>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">References to battles with Celts (F 14–16) and Illyrians (F 17) are discernible, but most fragments are assigned with varying degrees of probability to an account of the second (Hannibalic) war with Carthage. The book probably carried the story down to events of 217 BC in the aftermath of the Roman defeat at Lake Trasimene. For its relation to Virgil’s account of another war in Italy, see Norden 1915, 153–73; Goldschmidt 2013, 127–48.</span></p>
<span class="label"><span class="italic">F 1–2: A Prooemium</span></span>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">If read as a “proem in the middle,” it may itself be evidence for Alexandrian influence on Latin literature at this seminal stage of development (Conte 2007, 226–29; cf. Goldschmidt 2013, 55–61). Its echo of the poet’s dream-vision in Book 1 must have developed the claim to poetic authority made there, but the fragments are so deeply embedded in the specific literary argument of Cicero’s </span>Brutus<span class="italic"> that they are difficult to extract and understand on their own terms (Goldberg 2009, 643–47). The sequence of lines in what follows is likely but not certain.</span></p>
