<p class="noindent">“Winds” are understood here by implication instead of “air.” In support of this interpretation we adduce an example from the third book of Ennius’ <span class="italic">Annals</span>:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">and an eagle came flying, battling with close-packed wings</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">the wind, which the Greek race in its tongue calls <span class="italic">aer</span></span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p>​</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="bold">*4</span> Festus</p>
<p class="noindent">The ancients used to say <span class="italic">sos</span> for <span class="italic">eos</span> [them], as Ennius . . . Book 3:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">around them, who are great peoples and wealthy</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p>​</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="bold">*5</span> Macrobius, <span class="italic">Saturnalia</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Here we should note that he said not only <span class="italic">noctu concubia </span>but also <span class="italic">qua noctu</span>. He did this in the seventh book of the <span class="italic">Annals</span> [F 14], in the third of which he said the same thing more clearly:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">on this night all of Etruria will hang by a thread</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p>​</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="bold">*6</span> Macrobius, <span class="italic">Saturnalia</span> (on Virgil, “from all sides the undaunted farmers charge with their spears”)</p>
<p class="noindent">Ennius in Book 3:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">after growing weary of standing firm and showering each other</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">with javelins sent whirling, from all sides they charge with their spears</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
