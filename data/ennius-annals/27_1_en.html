<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">fortunatim</span>: “prosperously.” Ennius, Book 1 of the <span class="italic">Annals</span>:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">that this may turn out prosperously, happily, and well for me,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">our affairs, treaty, kingdom, and for you, Quirites</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>

<p class="noindent">Artistic composition is an arrangement of words that makes every part of the discourse equally polished. It will be maintained if we avoid the frequent clash of vowels . . . and if we shun excessive repetition of the same letter, for which fault this verse will be an example—for here nothing prevents using examples from the faults of others:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">you, O Titus Tatius, tyrant, took on yourself such great troubles</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p>​</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="bold">55</span> Cicero, <span class="italic">On the Republic</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Indeed, when a people is bereft of a just king,</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">longing . . . occupies their breasts</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">as Ennius says after the death of a most excellent king,</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line indent10">among themselves</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">together they thus speak out: “O Romulus, Romulus divine,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">what a guardian of the fatherland the gods created in you!</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">O father, O sire, O bloodline descended from the gods!”</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
