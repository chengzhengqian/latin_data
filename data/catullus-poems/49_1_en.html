<h2>LXIV</h2>
<p><span class="sc">Pine-trees</span> of old, born on the top of Pelion, are said to have swum through the clear waters of Neptune to the waves of Phasis and the realms of Aeetes, when the chosen youths, the flower of Argive strength, desiring to bear away from the Colchians the golden fleece, dared to course over the salt seas with swift ship, sweeping the blue expanse with fir-wood blades, for whom the goddess who holds the fortresses of city-tips made with her own hands the car flitting with light breeze, and bound the piny structure of the bowed keel. That ship first hanselled with voyage Amphitrite untried before.</p>
<p>So when she ploughed with her beak the windy expanse, and the wave churned by the oars grew white with foam-flakes, forth looked from the foaming surge of the sea the Nereids of the deep wondering at the strange thing. On that day, and on no other, mortals saw with their eyes the sea-Nymphs standing forth from the hoary tide, with bodies naked as far as the paps. Then is Peleus said to have caught fire with love of Thetis, then did Thetis not disdain mortal espousals, then did the Father himself know in his heart that Peleus must be joined to Thetis. O ye, in happiest time of ages born, hail, heroes, sprung from gods! Hail, noble sons of mothers, hail again! You will I oft toast with wine, you oft with song. And specially thee, greatly blessed with happy nuptial torches, mainstay of Thessaly, Peleus, to whom Jupiter himself, the king of the gods himself granted his own Love. </p></section><notes></notes></section>
