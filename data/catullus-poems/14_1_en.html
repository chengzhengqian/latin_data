<p><span class="sc">Furius</span>, you who have neither a slave, nor a money-box, nor a bug, nor a spider, nor a fire, but who have a father and a stepmother too, whose teeth can chew even a flintstone, you lead a merry life with your father and that dry stick, your father’s wife. No wonder: you all enjoy the best health, your digestions are excellent, you have nothing to be afraid of; fires, dilapidations, wanton acts, plots to poison you, other chances of danger. And beside this, your bodies are as dry as horn, or drier still if drier thing there be, what with sun and cold and fasting. How can you, Furius, be otherwise than well and prosperous? You are free from sweat and slobber, from catarrh and an annoying runny nose. Add to this cleanliness one still cleaner, since your backside is shinier than a saltcellar, for you shit less than ten times a year and then something harder than beans or stones, which if you were to rub and crumble in your hands, you’d never be able to dirty a finger. Since you have such blessings as these, Furius, do not despise them or think lightly of them; and cease to pray, as you do, for the hundred sestertia; for you are quite well off enough as it is.</p>
