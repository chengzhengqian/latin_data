<p>Hither then, come hither, haste to leave the Aonian caves of the Thespian rock, which the nymph Aganippe besprinkles with cooling shower from above;</p>
<p>call to her home the lady of the house, full of desire for her bridegroom; bind her heart with love, as here and there the clinging ivy straying clasps the tree.</p>
<p>Ye too with me, unwedded virgins, for whom a like day is coming, come, in measure say, “O Hymenaeus Hymen, O Hymen Hymenaeus!”</p>
<p>that hearing himself summoned to his own office, the god may come more readily hither, the herald of genial Venus, the coupler of honest love.</p>
<p>What god is more worthy to be invoked by heart-sick lovers? whom of the heavenly ones shall men worship more than thee? O Hymenaeus Hymen, O Hymen Hymenaeus!</p>
<p>Thee for his children the aged father invokes, for thee the maidens loose their garments from the girdle: for thee the bridegroom listens fearfully with eager ear.</p>
