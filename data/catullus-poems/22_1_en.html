<p><span class="sc">You</span> regulars of the whore-house tavern, nine doors along from the temple of the Capped Brothers,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL006_45_1" id="target_note_LCL006_45_1"><sup>1</sup></a> do you think that you alone have cocks, that you alone may screw all the girls, and that the rest of us stink like goats? Or because you creeps sit in a line, a hundred or two hundred strong, do you think I wouldn’t dare to stuff the lot of you together as you sit? Think so if you like: for I’m going to scribble obscenities against you all over the tavern front. For the girl who has left my embrace, whom I loved as none shall ever be loved again, has taken up her pitch there. She is dear to all you men of rank and fortune—indeed, to her shame, all the petty lechers that haunt the byways, to you above all, paragon of long-haired dandies, Egnatius, son of rabbity Celtiberia, made a gentleman by a bushy beard and teeth brushed with Spanish piss.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Your</span> Catullus is unwell, Cornificius, unwell, dammit, terribly unwell, and getting worse every day and hour. And what would be the lightest and easiest task, have you said a word to console him? I’m wild with you. Is this how you treat my love?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL006_45_2" id="target_note_LCL006_45_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Give me only some little word of comfort, pathetic as the tears of Simonides!</p>
