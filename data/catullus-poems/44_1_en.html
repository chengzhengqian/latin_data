girls love to chide thee with feigned complaint. What then, if they chide him whom they desire in their secret heart? Hymen, O Hymenaeus, Hymen, hither, O Hymenaeus!</p>
<p><span class="italic">Maidens.</span> As a flower springs up secretly in a fenced garden, unknown to the cattle, torn up by no plough, which the winds caress, the sun strengthens, the shower draws forth, <span class="italic">and even now it unfolds and exhales sweet fragrance</span>,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL006_89_1" id="target_note_LCL006_89_1"><sup>1</sup></a> many boys, many girls, desire it; when the same flower fades, nipped by a sharp nail, no boys, no girls desire it: so a maiden, while she remains untouched, the while<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL006_89_2" id="target_note_LCL006_89_2"><sup>2</sup></a> is she dear to her own; when she has lost her chaste flower with sullied body, she remains neither lovely to boys nor dear to girls.
