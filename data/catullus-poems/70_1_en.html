<p><span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">15</span><span class="br"></span> At the time when first a white dress was given to me, when my youth in its flower was keeping jocund spring-time, I wrote merry poems enough; not unknown am I to the goddess who mingles with her cares a sweet bitterness.</p>
<p><span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">19</span><span class="br"></span> But all care for this is gone from me by my brother’s death. Ah me unhappy, who have lost you, my brother! You, brother, you by your death have destroyed my happiness; with you all my house is buried. With you all my joys have died, which your sweet love cherished, while yet you lived. By reason of your death, I have banished from all my mind these thoughts and all the pleasures of my heart.</p>
<p><span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">27</span><span class="br"></span> And so, when you write that it is a shame for Catullus to be in Verona, where all the young men of the upper class must warm their limbs in an empty bed, that is, Manlius, not so much a shame as a sorrow. Pardon me then if I do not, because I cannot, present you with those gifts which grief has snatched away.</p>
<p><span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">33</span><span class="br"></span> For as for my not having plenty of authors at hand, that is because I live at Rome: that is my home, that is my abode, there my life is spent; when I come here only one small box out of many attends me. And since this is so, I would not have you judge that it is due to niggardly mind or ungenerous temper, that you have not received a full supply of what you ask of each kind<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL006_141_1" id="target_note_LCL006_141_1"><sup>1</sup></a>: I would have offered it unasked, if I had any such resources.</p>
