<h2>LXI</h2>
<p><span class="sc">O H aunter</span> of the Heliconian mount, Uraniaâ€™s son, thou who bearest away the tender maid to her bridegroom, O Hymenaeus Hymen, O Hymen Hymenaeus!</p>
<p>Bind thy brows with the flowers of fragrant marjoram, put on the marriage veil, hither, hither merrily come, wearing on thy snow-white foot the yellow shoe,</p>
<p>and wakening on this joyful day, singing with resonant voice the nuptial songs, beat the ground with thy feet, shake with thy hand the pine torch.</p>
<p>For now shall Junia wed with Manlius, Junia as fair as Venus who dwells in Idalium, when she came to the Phrygian judge; a good maiden with a good omen,</p>
<p>like the Asian myrtle shining with flowering sprays, which the Hamadryad goddesses with dewy moisture nourish as a plaything for themselves.</p>
