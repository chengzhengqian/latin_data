<p>What joys are coming for your lord, O what joys for him to know in the fleeting night, joys in the full day!â€”but the day is passing; come forth, O bride.</p>
<p>Raise aloft the torches, boys: I see the wedding veil coming. Go on, sing in measure, Io Hymen Hymenaeus io, io Hymen Hymenaeus!</p>
<p>Let not the merry Fescennine jesting be silent long, let the favourite boy give away nuts to the slaves, when he hears how his lord has left his love.</p>
<p>Give nuts to the slaves, favourite: your time is past: you have played with nuts long enough: you must now be the servant of Talassius. Give nuts, beloved slave.</p>
<p>To-day and yesterday you disdained the country wives: now the barbers haves your cheeks. Wretched, ah! wretched lover, throw the nuts!</p>
<p>They will say that you, perfumed bridegroom, are unwilling to give up your old pleasures; but abstain. Io Hymen Hymenaeus io, io Hymen Hymenaeus!</p>
