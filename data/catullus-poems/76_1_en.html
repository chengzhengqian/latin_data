<p><span class="sc">If</span> ever a good fellow was justly affected with the vile stench of the armpits, or anyone was scourged for his sins with the gout, that rival who makes love in your bed has caught both maladies from you to a marvel; for every time he gets on the job, he punishes them both: he tortures her with the odour, dying himself of the gout.</p>

<h2>LXXII</h2>
<p>You used once to say that Catullus was your only friend, Lesbia, and that you would not prefer Jupiter himself to me. I loved you then, not only as the common sort love a mistress, but as a father loves his sons and sons-in-law. Now I know you; and therefore, though I burn more ardently, yet you are in my sight much less worthy and lighter. How can that be? you say. Because such an injury as this drives a lover to be more of a lover, but less of a friend.</p>

<h2>LXXIII</h2>
<p><span class="sc">Leave</span> off wishing to deserve any thanks from any one, or thinking that any one can ever become grateful. All this wins no thanks; to have acted kindly is nothing, rather it is wearisome, wearisome and harmful; so it is now with me, who am vexed and troubled by no one so bitterly as by him who but now held me for his one and only friend.</p>
