<p>We know that you are acquainted with no unlawful joys; but a husband has not the same liberty. Io Hymen Hymenaeus io, io Hymen Hymenaeus!</p>
<p>You too, O bride, be sure you refuse not what your husband claims, lest he go elsewhere to find it. Io Hymen Hymenaeus io, io Hymen Hymenaeus!</p>
<p>See how mighty and rich for you is the house of your husband; be content to be mistress here. Io Hymen Hymenaeus io, io Hymen Hymenaeus!</p>
<p>even till hoary old age, shaking a trembling head, nods assent to all for all. Io Hymen Hymenaeus io, io Hymen Hymenaeus!</p>
<p>Lift across the threshold with a good omen your golden feet, and enter within the polished door. Io Hymen Hymenaeus io, io Hymen Hymenaeus!</p>
<p>See how your husband within, reclining on a purple couch, is all eagerness for you. Io Hymen Hymenaeus io, io Hymen Hymenaeus!</p>
