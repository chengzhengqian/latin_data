<p><span class="sc">Cock</span> has something like thirty acres of grazing land, forty of plough-land: the rest is salt water. How can he fail to surpass Croesus in wealth, who occupies so many good things in one estate, pasture, arable, enormous woods and vast lakes as far as the Hyperboreans and the Great Sea? All this is wonderful: but he himself is the greatest wonder of all, not a man like the rest of us, but a monstrous menacing cock.</p>

<p><span class="sc">I have</span> often cast about with busy questing mind how I could send to you some poems of Callimachus with which I might make you placable to me, and that you might not try to send a shower of missiles to reach my head; but now I see that this labour has been taken by me in vain, Gellius, and that my prayers have here availed nothing. Those missiles of yours launched against me I shall evade; but you shall be pierced by mine and pay the penalty.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL006_181_1" id="target_note_LCL006_181_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
