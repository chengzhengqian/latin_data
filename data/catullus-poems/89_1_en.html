<h2>CXI</h2>
<p><span class="sc">Aufillena</span>, to live content with one’s husband alone is the greatest of compliments a wife can receive: but ‘tis better for a woman to sleep with anyone at all than conceive by her father and become the mother of brothers.</p>

<p><span class="sc">You</span> are many men’s man, Naso, but not many men go down town with you: Naso, you are many men’s man and minion.</p>

<h2>CXIII</h2>
<p><span class="sc">When</span> Pompey first was consul, Cinna, there were two that had Maecilia’s favours: now he is consul again, there are still two, but three noughts have grown up beside each one. A fruitful seed has adultery.</p>

<h2>CXIV</h2>
<p><span class="sc">Cock</span> is truly said to be rich in the possession of the grant of land at Firmum, which has so many fine things in it, fowling of all sorts, fish, pasture, cornland, and game. All to no purpose; he outruns the produce of it by his expenses. So I grant that he is rich, if you will allow that he lacks everything. Let us admire the advantages of his estate, so long as he himself hasn’t a bean.</p>
