<h2>XCVIII</h2>
<p><span class="sc">You</span> if any man, disgusting Victius, deserve what is said about chatterboxes and idiots. With a tongue like that, if need arose, you could lick arses and rustics’ clogs. If you wish to destroy us all utterly, Victius, just open your mouth: you’ll utterly do what you wish.</p>

<h2>XCIX</h2>
<p><span class="sc">I stole</span> a kiss from you, honey-sweet Juventius, while you were playing, a kiss sweater than sweet ambrosia. But not unpunished; for I remember how for more than an hour I hung impaled on the top of the gallows tree, while I was excusing myself to you, yet could not with all my tears take away ever so little from your anger; for no sooner was it done, than you washed your lips clean with plenty of water, and wiped them with your dainty fingers, that no contagion from my mouth might remain, as though it were the foul spit of some filthy whore. Besides that, you made haste to deliver your unhappy lover to angry love, and to torture him in every manner, so that that kiss, changed from ambrosia, was now more bitter than bitter hellebore. Since then you impose this penalty on my unlucky love, henceforth I will never steal any kisses.</p>
