There are many other stories—especially about Scipio’s latter days, his summons, death, funeral, and tomb—that are so conflicting that I cannot decide which anecdotal or which written account to accept. There is no agreement on his accuser—some authors say that Marcus Naevius arraigned him, others the Petillii—and no agreement again on the date of his arraignment, the year of his death, or the location of his death and funeral: some say he died and was buried at Rome, others at Liternum.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL313_189_245" id="target_note_LCL313_189_245"><sup>245</sup></a> Cenotaphs and statues are to be seen in both places. There was at Liternum a tomb with a statue set upon it, and this statue, which has been shattered by a storm, I recently saw for myself.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL313_189_246" id="target_note_LCL313_189_246"><sup>246</sup></a> There are also at Rome three statues on the tomb of the Scipios outside the Porta Capena,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL313_189_247" id="target_note_LCL313_189_247"><sup>247</sup></a> and two of these are said to be those of Publius and Lucius Scipio, the third that of the poet Quintus Ennius.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL313_189_248" id="target_note_LCL313_189_248"><sup>248</sup></a></p>
