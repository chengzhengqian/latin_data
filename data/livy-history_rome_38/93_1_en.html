On the other hand, Culleo is also said to have been on such bad terms with the family that, because of his well-known animosity, he was the one especially chosen by the anti-Scipio faction to conduct the inquiry. At all events, it was before this praetor—too favorably or too unfavorably disposed to him—that Lucius Scipio was immediately arraigned. At the same time the names of Scipio’s legates, Aulus and Lucius Hostilius Cato,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL313_187_242" id="target_note_LCL313_187_242"><sup>242</sup></a> were brought forward and accepted for indictment, as was that of his quaestor Gaius Furius Aculeo; and so that it would seem that everything was tainted with complicity in the corruption even two secretaries and an attendant were indicted.
