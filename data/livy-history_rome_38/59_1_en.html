<p>37. During the winter that this took place in Rome, Gnaeus Manlius was wintering in Asia when deputations came to him from all over, first in his capacity as consul and then as proconsul, from all the states and peoples living west of the Taurus range. And while victory over King Antiochus was more prestigious and glorious in Roman eyes than that over the Gauls, victory over the Gauls was for the allies a greater source of joy than that over Antiochus. Submission to the king had been more tolerable than the savagery of the ruthless barbarians and the daily incertitude and fear of where their pillaging would descend like a tempest.</p>
<p>These people, then, having been granted freedom by the defeat of Antiochus and peace by the defeat of the Gauls, had not only come to congratulate Manlius but had also brought him crowns of gold<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL313_119_155" id="target_note_LCL313_119_155"><sup>155</sup></a> varying in expense according to their resources. Envoys also arrived from Antiochus and even from the Gauls to have peace terms dictated to them; and some came from Ariarathes, king of Cappadocia, to ask for pardon and pay compensation for the wrong the king had done in assisting Antiochus with reinforcements. Ariarathes was ordered to pay 600 talents of silver, and the reply to the Gauls was that Manlius would give them his terms when King Eumenes arrived. Given courteous replies, the deputations from the city-states were sent off even happier than when they arrived. The envoys of Antiochus were instructed to convey money and grain to Pamphylia as stipulated in the pact made with Lucius Scipio,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL313_119_156" id="target_note_LCL313_119_156"><sup>156</sup></a> and Manlius added that he would come there with his army.</p>
<p>Then, at the beginning of spring, Manlius set out after the ritual purification of his army,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL313_119_157" id="target_note_LCL313_119_157"><sup>157</sup></a> and came to Apamea
