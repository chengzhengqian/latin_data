talents of silver and 10,000 medimni<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL313_43_51" id="target_note_LCL313_43_51"><sup>51</sup></a> of wheat, and their surrender was accepted on these terms.</p>
<p>14. On the third day out from Tabae they reached the River Casanes.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL313_43_52" id="target_note_LCL313_43_52"><sup>52</sup></a> After leaving there, they took the city of Eriza with their initial assault. They then came to the fortress of Tabusion overlooking the River Indus, which was named after an Indian<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL313_43_53" id="target_note_LCL313_43_53"><sup>53</sup></a> who was flung into it from his elephant. They were not far distant from Cibyra,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL313_43_54" id="target_note_LCL313_43_54"><sup>54</sup></a> but there was no delegation forthcoming from that city’s tyrant, Moagates, a man deceitful and demanding in all his dealings. To sound out Moagates’ feelings, the consul sent Gaius Helvius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL313_43_55" id="target_note_LCL313_43_55"><sup>55</sup></a> ahead with 4,000 infantry and 500 cavalry. When this column was already entering Moagates’ territory it was met by envoys with the news that the tyrant was ready to meet the Romans’ demands. They begged Helvius to enter their territory in peace and keep his men from plundering their farmlands, and they brought fifteen talents in the form of a golden crown.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL313_43_56" id="target_note_LCL313_43_56"><sup>56</sup></a> Helvius undertook to safeguard their lands from pillage and told the envoys to proceed to see the consul.</p>
<p>When they gave the consul the same message, he replied: “We Romans have no indication from your tyrant of goodwill toward us and, moreover, it is generally agreed that his character is such that we should be thinking about punishing him rather than making an alliance with him.” Taken aback by this remark the envoys asked for nothing more than that he accept the crown, grant the tyrant permission to come to him, and give him the opportunity of speaking to him and exonerating himself.</p>
