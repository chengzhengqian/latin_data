Romans plundered a town that was deserted and full of all manner of provisions. From there they advanced to the headwaters of the River Lysis, and the next day to the River Cobulatus.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL313_47_60" id="target_note_LCL313_47_60"><sup>60</sup></a></p>
<p>The people of Termessus were at that time blockading the citadel of the Isiondenses,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL313_47_61" id="target_note_LCL313_47_61"><sup>61</sup></a> having captured the city.
