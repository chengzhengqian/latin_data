The consul also wrote to Quintus Fabius Labeo, commander of the fleet, ordering him to leave for Patara immediately and demolish and burn any of the king’s ships that were docked there.

After spending a few days in Athens to allow the ships to reach Piraeus from Ephesus, he brought the whole fleet back from there to Italy.</p>
