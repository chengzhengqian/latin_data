Here the Trausi, also a Thracian people, gathered with similar hopes of plunder; but since the treeless valleys rendered them visible in the distance as they were blocking the pass, there was less panic and consternation among the Romans because, despite the unfavorable terrain, it was still a regular engagement that had to be fought, with lines in the open and troops deployed.
