It is true that the consuls recently wanted Greece and Asia, but when you insisted on assigning them Liguria as their province they accepted your decision. They will thus be justified in seeking a triumph from you if the war is successful, since it is by your authorization that they will have fought it.”</p>
<p>47. Such was the address presented by Furius and Aemilius. Manlius, I have gathered, replied much as follows:</p>
<p>“Members of the senate: It was the tribunes of the plebs who would in the past oppose applications for a triumph. To them I give my thanks: they have granted, either to me personally or to the greatness of my achievements, the distinction of not only approving by their silence the honor I seek but even of appearing ready to propose it should the need arise. It is among the ten commissioners, for heaven’s sake, that I find my opponents—a board your ancestors assigned to commanders to regulate and distribute the honors of victory. Lucius Furius and Lucius Aemilius are preventing me from mounting the triumphal chariot and are snatching the crown of honor from my head—and these are men whom I would have called as witnesses of my achievements if the tribunes now stood in the way of my triumph.</p>
