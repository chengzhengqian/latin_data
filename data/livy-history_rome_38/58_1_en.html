<p>Following a senatorial decree that had been passed the previous year the censors had obliged the Campanians to be registered for the census at Rome, as it had not been clear earlier where they should be registered. The Campanians now requested that they be allowed to take Roman citizens as wives, that any who had already taken them should be permitted to keep them, and that any children born to them before that date be considered as legitimate and able to inherit.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL313_117_151" id="target_note_LCL313_117_151"><sup>151</sup></a> Both requests were granted.</p>
<p>A tribune of the plebs, Gaius Valerius Tappo, promulgated a bill relating to the townspeople of Formiae, Fundi and Arpinum, that these peoples be granted the right to vote (for up to that time they had held citizenship without voting rights<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL313_117_152" id="target_note_LCL313_117_152"><sup>152</sup></a>). Four tribunes of the plebs vetoed the proposal on the grounds that it was made without the approval of the senate, but when informed it was the people’s prerogative, and not the senate’s, to bestow the right of suffrage as they wished, they abandoned their attempt. A law permitting the people of Formiae and of Fundi to vote in the Aemilian tribe, and the people of Arpinum in the Cornelian tribe, was then passed;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL313_117_153" id="target_note_LCL313_117_153"><sup>153</sup></a> and this was the first occasion on which these peoples were registered in these tribes in accordance with Valerius’ resolution. After besting Titus Quinctius in the sortition, the censor Marcus Claudius Marcellus closed the <span class="italic">lustrum</span>.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL313_117_154" id="target_note_LCL313_117_154"><sup>154</sup></a> The citizens registered in the census numbered 258,318.

Every citizen had to belong to one, and the tribes were used as voting units in voting assemblies (and also as the basis for the census, taxation, and army recruitment). The Aemilian and Cornelian tribes were among the earliest of them. Cf. Introduction to vol.
