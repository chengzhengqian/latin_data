the tunnel could possibly be, they remained silent, placed their ears to the soil at several points and tried to catch the sound of the enemy digging. When they heard it, they proceeded to open a path straight into the tunnel, which did not take much effort, for in no time they came through to an open space where the wall had been shored up with pitchforks by the enemy. The two works meeting at that point, with a path now open from the ditch into the tunnel, the diggers at first clashed with the very tools that they had used for the work, but then armed men also swiftly appeared, and they commenced a hidden subterranean battle. The fighting then became less intense since the defenders would block the tunnel wherever they wished, quickly stretching rough blankets across it at one time and doors at another.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL313_23_25" id="target_note_LCL313_23_25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p>The townspeople also devised a novel countermeasure, one requiring little effort, against the men in the tunnel. They made a hole in the bottom of a barrel into which a small tube could be inserted and they also fashioned an iron tube and an iron lid for the barrel, the lid itself pierced with several holes. The barrel they filled with down, and placed it with its mouth facing the tunnel. Through the holes in the lid projected some of the long spears they call <span class="italic">sarisae</span> to keep the enemy at bay. They then set a small spark in the down and fanned it with a smith’s bellows inserted into the end of the tube, until the down caught fire. As a result thick smoke—made all the more acrid by the foul odor from the burned feathers—filled the whole tunnel and scarcely anyone could bear to remain inside.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL313_23_26" id="target_note_LCL313_23_26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
