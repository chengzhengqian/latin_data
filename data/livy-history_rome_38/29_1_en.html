cutting down the conquered—just as you cut them down in the battle line of Antiochus.</p>
<p>“My fear is rather that there may be too little glory coming of it, not that there will be too much of a fight. King Attalus has often scattered them and put them to flight. Do not imagine that it is only animals freshly captured that at first retain that savage woodland nature of theirs but then become tame after prolonged feeding from human hands. Do not think that nature does not do the same in softening the fierceness of men. Do you believe these Gauls are the same as their fathers and grandfathers were? Those were exiles through a lack of land, who, leaving home, traveled along the rugged coastline of Illyricum, then through Paeonia and Thrace, fighting with the wildest tribes, before taking over these lands. Toughened and brutalized by all their hardships, they were received by a land that could sate them with all manner of commodities. Fertile soil, a mild climate, natives of gentle disposition—by these all that fierceness with which they had arrived was softened. And, by Hercules, you men of the war god, you must see that from the very start you shun and avoid the delights of Asia—such power do these foreign pleasures have to wipe out vitality of character, and so strong is the effect of exposure to the manners and culture of the natives. But there is one fortunate outcome of this. While the strength they have to wield against you is useless, they still possess among the Greeks a reputation as great as they had earlier when they arrived; and as victors you will enjoy the same glory among your allies as if you had defeated Gauls still possessing the sort of courage they had in days of old.”</p>
