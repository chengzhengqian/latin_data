cruel stroke of fate the booty fell to men who had taken no part in the fighting. The cavalry long remained at a standstill, unaware of the engagement and their comrades’ victory, and then they, too—as far as they could climb with their horses—chased the Gauls, now dispersed in flight, around the foot of the mountain, killing or capturing them.</p>
<p>The number killed could not easily be determined because the chase and the massacre went on throughout the winding valleys in the mountains and many fell from impassable cliffs into deep canyons, while others were dispatched in woods and undergrowth. Claudius, who records that there were two battles on Mt. Olympus, puts the number of dead at 40,000, but Valerius Antias, who is usually more prone to gross exaggeration of numbers, puts it at no more than 10,000.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL313_79_110" id="target_note_LCL313_79_110"><sup>110</sup></a> The number of prisoners undoubtedly reached 40,000 because the Gauls had dragged along with them a multitude of people of all kinds and all ages, more like men moving home than going to war.</p>

He then sold the part that was to be converted to cash for payment into the public treasury and carefully divided the rest among his soldiers so that shares should be as equable as possible. In addition, the men were all given public commendations at an assembly and rewarded according to their individual merits—and to universal approval Attalus was rewarded more than anyone. The young man’s courage and energy in the face of all hardship and danger had been remarkable, as also had been his modest conduct.</p>
