<p>Nor is the discrepancy in accounts confined to historians; the speeches of Publius Scipio and Tiberius Gracchus—provided that those in circulation are theirs—are also at variance with each other. The title tag of Publius Scipio’s oration contains the name of Marcus Naevius, the plebeian tribune, but the oration itself lacks the name of Scipio’s accuser and refers to him only as “the reprobate” in some places or “the dilettante” in others. Even the speech of Gracchus makes no mention of the Petillii as prosecutors of Africanus or of his arraignment.</p>
<p>A completely new scenario needs to be established that accords with Gracchus’ speech, and we must follow those authors who report that Africanus was member of a diplomatic mission in Etruria at the time that Lucius Scipio was accused and found guilty of taking money from the king.

Because it was said that his brother was being clapped in irons he went straight from the city gate to the Forum, pushed the attending officer from his brother and, when the tribunes tried to hold him back, assaulted them, displaying more family loyalty than civic responsibility.</p>
<p>This behavior is precisely what Tiberius Gracchus complains about—the power of the tribunes being violated by a private citizen—and eventually, when he promises his assistance to Lucius Scipio, Gracchus adds that for the tribunician power and the whole state to appear to have been undermined by a tribune of the people rather than by a private individual was a more acceptable precedent.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL313_191_249" id="target_note_LCL313_191_249"><sup>249</sup></a> But Gracchus so handles his vituperation of Scipio’s single instance of uncontrolled violence that, in
