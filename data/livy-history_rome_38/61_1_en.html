<p>Antiochus shall not have the right to make war on the people who inhabit the islands or to cross into Europe.</p>
<p>He shall withdraw from cities, territories, villages and strongholds this side of the Taurus mountain as far as the River Tanais,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL313_123_161" id="target_note_LCL313_123_161"><sup>161</sup></a> and from the valley of the Taurus to the heights where the range slopes toward Lycaonia.</p>
<p>From the towns, territories and strongholds from which he withdraws, Antiochus shall take nothing except his weaponry; anything he has removed he is to return scrupulously to where it belongs.</p>
<p>Antiochus shall not accept any soldier or other person from the kingdom of Eumenes. With regard to citizens of those cities separating from Antiochus’ empire who are with King Antiochus and within the bounds of his realm, they shall all return to Apamea by a fixed date. Any people from Antiochus’ realm who are now with the Romans or their allies shall have the right to leave or to stay. The king shall return slaves, whether runaways or prisoners of war, and any free man, whether captive or deserter, to the Romans and their allies.</p>
<p>Antiochus shall surrender all his elephants and not acquire others. He shall also surrender his warships with their equipment and retain in his possession no more than ten passenger vessels,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL313_123_162" id="target_note_LCL313_123_162"><sup>162</sup></a> none of them propelled by more than thirty oars, nor any ship smaller than that for warfare
