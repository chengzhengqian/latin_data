<p>At the conclusion of the elections, the consul brought before the senate the question of the provinces that they wanted assigned to the praetors. The senators decided that two should be at Rome for legal administration; two, Sicily and Sardinia, should be outside Italy; and two, Tarentum and Gaul, within Italy.

<p>There was talk of a major war in Liguria that was escalating every day. Accordingly, on the day on which the new consuls raised the matter of the provinces and the state of the republic, the senators formally assigned Liguria to both as their province. The consul Lepidus tried to block this decision of the senate, claiming that it was outrageous for the two consuls to be confined to the valleys of Liguria when Marcus Fulvius and Gnaeus Manlius had spent two years in Europe and Asia respectively, virtually replacing Philip and Antiochus as kings.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL313_141_188a" id="target_note_LCL313_141_188a"><sup>188</sup></a> If the senate wanted armies stationed in those lands, it should be consuls who commanded them, he said, not civilians.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL313_141_189" id="target_note_LCL313_141_189"><sup>189</sup></a> Those men had
