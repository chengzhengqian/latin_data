</span> I’m sorry for the poor youth you aimed it at, just for being
a bit careless and not holding his tongue.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">

</span> (<span class="italic">aside</span>) May the gods destroy you!</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">

</span> What did he say, if I may ask?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">thr</span>
</span> He was finished. Everyone there died of laughter.
They’ve all been afraid of me ever since.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">gna</span>
</span> And rightly so.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">thr</span>
</span> But listen, about this girl, do I rid Thais of her suspicion
that I’m in love with her?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">gna</span>
</span> Absolutely not. On the contrary, make her more suspicious.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">thr</span>
</span> Why?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">gna</span>
</span> Need you ask? You know how, if ever she mentions Phaedria
or praises him, it pains you terribly?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">thr</span>
</span> And I feel it.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">gna</span>
</span> There’s only one way to prevent this happening. When
she names Phaedria, you must immediately name Pamphila.
If she ever says: “Let’s invite Phaedria to join the
party,” you say: “Let’s summon Pamphila to sing.” If she
praises his good looks, you praise hers. In short pay her
back tit for tat with something that will annoy her.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">thr</span>
</span> (<span class="italic">with a sigh</span>) If she loved me, then that might work,
Gnatho.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">gna</span>
</span> Since she looks forward to your presents and loves them,
she’s loved you all this time, and all this time there’s been
an easy way of hurting her. She’s always been afraid that
you might one day in anger transfer elsewhere the income
that she now derives from you.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">thr</span>
</span> Quite right. That hadn’t occurred to me.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">gna</span>
</span> Ridiculous! You just hadn’t thought about it. Otherwise
you’d have come up with the same idea yourself far more
easily, Thraso!</p></div>
