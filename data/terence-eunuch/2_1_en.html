an opportunity to examine the play, and, when the official
arrived, the performance began.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL022_319_7" id="target_note_LCL022_319_7">

</a> He shouted that the play was
the work of a thief, not a playwright, but that the attempt to deceive
had not worked. There was, he claimed, a “Flatterer” by
Naevius and an old play by Plautus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL022_319_8a" id="target_note_LCL022_319_8a">

</a> and the character of the
parasite and the soldier had been stolen from these.</p>
<p>If that was an offence, the offence was due to the inadvertence
of the playwright; he had no intention of committing plagiarism.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL022_319_9" id="target_note_LCL022_319_9">

You can judge the truth of this for yourselves. There is
a “Flatterer” of Menander, in which there is a flattering parasite
and a swaggering soldier. The playwright does not deny that
he has imported these characters into his “Eunuch” from the
Greek play. But he does most definitely deny any knowledge of
the prior existence of the Latin versions.</p>
<p>But in any case, if he is not permitted to use the same characters
again, how is it any more permissible to present a running
slave or good matrons or wicked courtesans or a greedy parasite
or a boastful soldier or babies being substituted or an old man
being deceived by his slave or love or hate or suspicions? In the
end nothing is said now which has not been said before. So it’s
only fair that you should examine the facts and pardon the new
playwrights if they do what the old have always done. Pay attention
and listen carefully in silence, so that you may understand
what “The Eunuch” has to say.</p>

preserve quotations both from a “Flatterer” of Naevius and from a

plays. Line 33 below, as it stands, refers to two Latin plays; the emendations
