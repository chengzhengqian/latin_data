</span> God knows I’m only too keen for you to hear. You know
this woman my brother’s in love with? (<span class="italic">indicating Thais’
house</span>)</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">ant</span>
</span> I do indeed. You mean Thais, I presume.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">chae</span>
</span> The very one.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">ant</span>
</span> I thought I remembered.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">chae</span>
</span> A girl was given to her today as a present. I don’t need to
describe her beauty to you or praise it, Antipho. You
know what a connoisseur I am of the female form. I was
swept off my feet.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">ant</span>
</span> You don’t say!</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">chae</span>
</span> You’ll give her top marks, if you see her, I’m sure. To put
it briefly, I fell in love. By a lucky chance there was a eunuch
at home whom my brother had bought for Thais,
and he hadn’t yet been delivered to her house. At this
point our slave Parmeno dropped me a suggestion which
I snatched up.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">ant</span>
</span> What was that?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">chae</span>
</span> You’ll hear all the quicker if you keep quiet. To exchange
clothes with him and have myself taken there in his place.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">ant</span>
</span> In place of the eunuch?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">chae</span>
</span> That’s right.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">ant</span>
</span> And what would you achieve by that, if I may ask?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">chae</span>
</span> What a question! I would look at, listen to, and live together
with the girl I wanted, Antipho. Was that a minor
objective or a miscalculation? I was handed over to the
woman, and, as soon as she received me, she took me into
her house with great delight, and entrusted the girl to my
care.</p></div><notes></notes></section>
