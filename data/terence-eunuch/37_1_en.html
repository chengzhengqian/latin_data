</span> I’d be very surprised if the useless creature has got too
far, unless perhaps he’s gone back to our place.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">pyth</span>
</span> Be a darling and go and see if he’s there.</p></div>

</span> I’ll let you know in a moment. (<span class="italic">he exits into his house</span>)</p></div>

</span> Damn it! For goodness’ sake! I’ve never even heard of
such an unspeakable act, my dear.</p></div>

<span class="sc">pyth</span>
</span> I’d heard that they were great lovers of women, for
heaven’s sake, but couldn’t do it. Oh dear, the thought
never even occurred to me. Otherwise I would have shut
him in somewhere and never put him in charge of the
girl.</p></div>

Come out, you waste of money! (<span class="italic">he kicks him</span>)</p></div>

</span> Oh! Look at that! What a face he’s pulled, the gallowsbird!
What do you mean by returning here? Why this
change of clothes? What’s your explanation? (<span class="italic">to Pythias</span>)
If I’d left it any longer, Pythias, I wouldn’t have caught
him at home. He was all prepared to run away.</p></div>
