<p class="noindent">If there’re any who are eager to please as many worthy citizens
as possible and to offend as few as possible, the playwright
wishes to enrol in their number.</p>

</a> who believes that he has been attacked
with undue harshness, let him also believe that this is a
response not an attack: he struck the first blow. By translating

“Apparition,” and in his “Treasure”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL022_317_5" id="target_note_LCL022_317_5">

</a> represented the defendant
as putting his case for the possession of the gold <span class="italic">before</span> the
plaintiff explained how the treasure belonged to <span class="italic">him</span> and how it

<p>From now on, in case he deludes himself and imagines that
he is done with this and I have nothing more to say, I warn him
not to misjudge the situation or continue to provoke me. I have
many other charges which he shall be spared for the moment,
but they will be brought up later if he persists in attacking me as
he has set out to do.</p>
<p>The play which we are about to perform is Menander’s</p>
