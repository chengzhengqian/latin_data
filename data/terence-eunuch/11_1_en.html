coming back meanwhile?</p></div>

</span> You? No, I don’t, for god’s sake. Either you’ll return at
once, or presently when night comes insomnia will drive
you back.</p></div>

</span> I’ll work on the farm until I’m so utterly exhausted that I
sleep in spite of myself.</p></div>

</span> You’ll lie awake weary; that’s all you’ll achieve.</p></div>

</span> Come on, Parmeno, you’re talking nonsense. (<span class="italic">to himself</span>)
By god, I must banish this softness of heart; I’m being too
easy on myself. Couldn’t I in the end do without her for a
whole three days if I had to?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">

</span> Wow! A whole three days? Be careful!</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">

</span> My mind’s made up. (<span class="italic">he exits left in the direction of the
farm, leaving Parmeno onstage alone</span>)</p></div>

</span> (<span class="italic">to himself</span>) Good gods, what kind of a disease is this? To
think that people can be so changed by love that you
wouldn’t recognise them as the same person! Nobody
was less irresponsible than Phaedria or more serious or
more sober-minded. (<span class="italic">looking down the street</span>) But who’s
this coming this way? Oh no! It’s the soldier’s parasite
Gnatho. He’s bringing the girl with him to present to her
(<span class="italic">pointing to Thais’ house</span>). Gosh, what a beauty! It looks
like I’m going to cut a sorry figure today with this decrepit
eunuch of mine. This girl surpasses Thais herself.</p></div>

What a difference there is between an intelligent
man and a fool! I’ll tell you how this thought occurred to</p></div><notes></notes></section>
