and station, a decent enough fellow, who had, like me,
guzzled away his inheritance. He looked unkempt, dirty,
sick, shabbily dressed, and senile. “Oh!” I said, “What
sort of a get-up is that?” “I’ve lost what I had, unfortunately,
and look what I’m reduced to. I’m abandoned by
all my friends and acquaintances.” I was full of contempt
for him compared with myself. “What!” I said, “you
spineless fellow! Have you managed your life in such a
way as to leave yourself without hope? Have you lost your
wits along with your wealth? I’ve come from the same
background: look at me, my complexion, my style, my
clothes, my physical condition. I have everything and
I have nothing; no possessions but nothing lacking.” “But
in my unhappy state I can’t play the buffoon or take
a beating.” “What? Is that how you suppose it’s done?
You’re on quite the wrong track. Once upon a time, long
ago, in a previous generation, that was the way our type
earned a living. Now there’s a new way to catch our prey,
and I am the original inventor. There is a type of men
who want to be the first in everything but aren’t. I track
these down. I don’t set out to make them laugh at me; I
laugh at them instead while at the same time expressing
admiration for their wit. Whatever they say, I praise it; if
they then say the opposite, I praise that too. They deny, I
deny; they affirm, I affirm. In short it’s my self-imposed
rule to agree to everything. It’s by far the most profitable
way to earn a living these days.”</p></div><notes></notes></section>
