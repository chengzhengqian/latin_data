</span> Do you persist in talking in riddles, you wretch? “I know
. . . I don’t know . . . he’s gone . . . I heard . . . I wasn’t
there.”Won’t you tell me in plain words what is going on?
The girl’s dress is torn, she’s weeping, and she won’t say
a word. The eunuch’s gone. Why? What’s happened?
Answer me.</p></div>

</span> Oh dear, what can I say? They say it wasn’t the eunuch.</p></div>

<span class="sc">tha</span>
</span> Who was it then?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">

</span> That Chaerea.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">

</span> Which Chaerea?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">pyth</span>
</span> That brother of Phaedria’s, the ephebe.</p></div>

<span class="sc">tha</span>
</span> What are you saying, you poisonous wretch?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">pyth</span>
</span> Well, it’s true. I’ve checked.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">tha</span>
</span> What’s he got to do with us, for goodness sake? What
brought him here?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">pyth</span>
</span> I’ve no idea. I suppose he’d fallen in love with Pamphila.</p></div>

<span class="sc">tha</span>
</span> (<span class="italic">guessing the sequel</span>) Oh dear, I’m ruined! It’s a disaster
for me if what you say is true. Is that why the girl’s weeping?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">pyth</span>
</span> I think so.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">tha</span>
</span> Answer me this, you barbarian! Didn’t I expressly warn
you against this when I left?</p></div>

<span class="sc">pyth</span>
</span> What was I to do? I did what you told me and put him in
sole charge of her.</p></div><notes></notes></section>
