</span> Now I’m coming out to find Parmeno. But where is he,
for goodness’ sake?</p></div>

</span> (<span class="italic">aside</span>) She’s looking for me.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">pyth</span>
</span> There he is. (<span class="italic">still laughing</span>) I’ll go up to him.</p></div>

</span> What is it, you silly girl? What are you up to? Why are you
laughing? Can’t you stop?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">pyth</span>
</span> This is killing me! Oh dear me, I’ve worn myself out
laughing at you.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">par</span>
</span> How so?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">

</span> You ask? Heaven knows I’ve never seen a more stupid
fellow, and never shall. Oh! I can’t begin to tell you what
amusement you gave us in there. Yet once I even believed
you a clever capable sort of a fellow. Well then,
should you have believed what I told you on the spot?
Weren’t you satisfied with persuading the young man to
commit an outrage, unless on top of that you also gave
him away to his father? What do you think his feelings
were when his father saw him dressed in those clothes?
(<span class="italic">Parmeno makes a gesture of despair</span>) What’s the matter?
(<span class="italic">still laughing</span>) Do you now realise you’re done for?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">par</span>
</span> Hey! What did you tell me, you wretch? Did you make it
all up? Are you still laughing? Did you think it was clever
to make fun of me, you villain?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">pyth</span>
</span> Very much so.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">par</span>
</span> If you get away with this, I’ll—</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">pyth</span>
</span> Will you really?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">par</span>
</span> I’ll pay you back, by god.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">pyth</span>
</span> No doubt. But this is a threat, perhaps, Parmeno, for
some day in the future. More immediately you are going</p></div><notes></notes></section>
