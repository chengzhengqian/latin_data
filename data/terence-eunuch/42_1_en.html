</span> Well, I didn’t know what she meant, but the soldier set
me straight by throwing me out. (<span class="italic">looking down the street</span>)
But here she is. I wonder where I got ahead of her.</p></div>

</span> (<span class="italic">to herself</span>) I suppose he’ll be here in a minute to steal the
girl from me. Let him come! If he lays a finger on her, I’ll
gouge out his eyes on the spot. I can put up with his stupidity
and boastful words so long as they <span class="italic">are</span> just words.
But if they turn into actions, he’ll get a thrashing.</p></div>

</span> Oh, my dear Chremes, I was looking out for you. You
realise that this dispute is on your account? And indeed
that this whole business is your business?</p></div>

</span> Mine? How so, if I may ask?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">tha</span>
</span> Because it’s through my eagerness to restore your sister
to your keeping that I’ve suffered this treatment and
much more like it.</p></div>

</span> What’s the matter? She’s been brought up in a manner
appropriate both to you and to herself.</p></div>

</span> What are you saying?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">

</span> It’s the truth. I’m giving her to you as a present and I’m
not asking any reward from you in return.</p></div><notes></notes></section>
