her up for sale on the spot, hoping for a good price, and
sold her. By a lucky chance this friend of mind was there,
and he bought her as a gift for me, in complete and utter
ignorance of all the circumstances. He then came back
here. Once he realised that I was having an affair with
you as well, he constantly invented reasons for not giving
me the girl. He said that, if he was convinced he would be
preferred to you in my eyes and if he wasn’t afraid I
would abandon him once I’d got the girl, he was willing to
give her to me; but, he said, he was afraid of this. Anyway,
I’ve a suspicion he’s taken a fancy to the girl.</p></div>

to restore her to her family. I’m alone. I have no friend
here or relative, and so, Phaedria, I’m keen to gain some
friends by doing a good turn of my own. Be a darling
and help me with this. To make things easier for me, let
him have the first place with me for the next few days.
