</span> In the course of this conversation we arrived at the
market. Everybody ran up delighted to see me, the
snack sellers, the fishmongers, the butchers, the cooks,
the poulterers, the spratsellers, men who had profited by
me in good times and in bad and often still do. They
greeted me, invited me to dinner, congratulated me on
my safe return. When the starving wretch saw me held in
such respect and earning my living so easily, he began to
implore me to let him learn the technique from me. I told
him to enrol as my pupil, in the hope that, just as philosophical
schools take their names from their founders, so
parasites may be called Gnathonists.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">par</span>
</span> (<span class="italic">aside</span>) Do you see what a life of idleness, and other
people’s food, does for a person?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">

</span> But I must hurry up and deliver this girl to Thais and ask
her to come to dinner. (<span class="italic">turning towards Thais’ house</span>)
But I see our rival’s slave Parmeno standing by the door
looking gloomy. All’s well. Unless I’m mistaken, they’re
getting a cool reception. I’ve a mind to to make fun of this
good-for-nothing.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">par</span>
</span> (<span class="italic">aside</span>) These people think that with this gift Thais is
theirs.</p></div>

</span> Gnatho offers his warmest greetings to his most esteemed
friend Parmeno. How are you doing?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">par</span>
</span> I’m standing.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">gna</span>
</span> So I see. Is there anything here (<span class="italic">indicating the girl</span>)
which you would rather not see?</p></div><notes></notes></section>
