to take her bath. She went, bathed, returned.
Then the maids laid her down on the bed. I stood waiting
to see if they had any orders for me. One of them came up
and said, “Hey you, Dorus, take this fan and make a nice
little breeze for her, like this (<span class="italic">making fanning motions</span>),
while we take a bath. When we’ve done so, if you like, you
can take one.” I accepted the fan with a scowl.</p></div>

</span> How I wish I had seen your impudent expression, and
your posturing, and you holding your little fan, you great
ass.</p></div>

</span> She had scarcely uttered these words and they all rushed
out of the room to take their baths, chattering away, as
happens when the master is absent. Meanwhile the girl
fell asleep. I looked at her sideways through the fan, like
this (<span class="italic">posturing</span>), and at the same time had a good look
round to make sure that the coast was clear. I saw it was,
and bolted the door.</p></div>

</span> What then?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">

</span> How do you mean “What then,” you idiot?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">ant</span>
</span> Sorry.</p></div>

</span> Was I going to let slip the opportunity when it was
offered to me, so great, so fleeting, so desired, so unexpected?
If I had, I would actually have been what I pretended
to be, (<span class="italic">putting on a female voice</span>) for heaven’s
sake.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL022_381_32" id="target_note_LCL022_381_32">

</span> Quite. As you say. But meanwhile what’s happened about
the dinner?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
