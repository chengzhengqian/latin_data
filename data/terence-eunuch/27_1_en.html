</span> I’ll take these inside first and give instructions for what I
want to be done. I’ll come straight out afterwards. (<span class="italic">she

</span> (<span class="italic">sneering</span>) It’s not proper for a commander-in-chief to be

</span> What you just said—and the one about the Rhodian,
when I think of it. But here comes Thais.</p></div>

by any chance arrives here, first beg him to stay; if that’s
not convenient, ask him to return later; and if he can’t do
that, bring him to me.</p></div>
