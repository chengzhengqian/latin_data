</span> We’re committing an outrage.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">chae</span>
</span> Is it an outrage if I’m taken into a courtesan’s house and
pay back those tormentors, who hold us young men in
contempt and torture us in every possible way? If I cheat
them in the same way that they cheat us? Is it a more
proper thing to play tricks on my father? Anyone who
caught me doing that would blame me, but everybody
can see that this is perfectly justified.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">par</span>
</span> (<span class="italic">reluctantly</span>) All right. If your mind’s made up, do it. But
don’t you put the blame on me afterwards.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">chae</span>
</span> I won’t.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">par</span>
</span> Are you telling me to do it?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">chae</span>
</span> Telling you? I’m insisting, it’s an order. I’ll accept the responsibility,
I promise. Come along. (<span class="italic">he turns towards
the house</span>)</p></div>

<span class="sc">thr</span>
</span> What do you say? Is she delighted?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">gna</span>
</span> Not so much with the gift itself but with the fact it comes
from you. That really and truly is a triumph for her.</p></div>

<span class="italic">(entering from the house, to himself</span>) I’m coming out to
see if the time’s right to deliver the gifts. (<span class="italic">seeing Thraso</span>)
But there’s the soldier.</p></div><notes></notes></section>
