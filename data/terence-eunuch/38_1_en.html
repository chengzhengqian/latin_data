delivered to us?</p></div>

</span> (<span class="italic">wrily</span>) Well, I didn’t have another one.</p></div>

</span> Oh! There’s no comparison between them. The other
one was good-looking, a handsome fellow.</p></div>

<span class="sc">phae</span>
</span> He seemed to be then, because he was wearing colorful
clothes. Now he looks ugly, because he hasn’t got them.</p></div>

<span class="sc">pyth</span>
</span> Come on, for goodness’ sake! There’s a huge difference
between them. The one delivered to us today was a
young lad who you yourself, Phaedria, might well want to
look at. This one is a shrivelled, lethargic, senile old man
with the colour of a weasel.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL022_391_35" id="target_note_LCL022_391_35">

</span> Hey! What’s this nonsense? Are you trying to tell me I
don’t know what I did myself? (<span class="italic">to Dorus</span>) Here you, did
I buy you?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">doru</span>
</span> You did.</p></div>

<span class="sc">pyth</span>
</span> (<span class="italic">to Dorus</span>) Did you come over to us today? (<span class="italic">to Phaedria,
as Dorus shakes his head</span>) He denies it. But that other
one did, the sixteen-year-old, who Parmeno brought with
him.</p></div>

<span class="sc">phae</span>

you are wearing—where did you get them? No answer?
You monstrosity of a man, aren’t you going to say?</p></div>
