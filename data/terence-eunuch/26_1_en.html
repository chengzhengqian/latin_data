</span> (<span class="italic">calling into the house</span>) Where are you, Dorus? Come
over here. (<span class="italic">as Chaerea emerges in the eunuch costume</span>)
Here’s the eunuch for you. With the looks of a gentleman
and in the bloom of youth!</p></div>

</span> What do you say, Gnatho? Can you see anything to
disparage? What about you, Thraso? (<span class="italic">there is no reply</span>)
Their silence is praise enough. (<span class="italic">to Thais</span>) Test him on
literature, athletics, music. I’ll prove him an expert in everything
a well educated young gentleman should know.</p></div>

</span> And moreover, the man who sent these presents doesn’t
demand that you live for him alone and shut out all others
for his sake. He doesn’t narrate his battles or parade his
scars, or get in your way, as a certain person does. He’s
content to be invited in when it’s convenient, when it
suits you, when you have the time.</p></div>

</span> This is obviously the slave of a wretched poverty-stricken
master.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">

</span> Yes. I’m quite sure nobody would put up with such a slave
if he had the means to get himself another one.</p></div>

</span> You shut up! I judge you to be the lowest of the low. If you
can bring yourself to flatter someone like him, I reckon
you could steal food from a funeral pyre.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL022_367_24" id="target_note_LCL022_367_24">
