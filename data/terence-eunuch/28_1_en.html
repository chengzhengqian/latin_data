</span> (<span class="italic">to himself</span>)Without a doubt, the more and more I think
about it, unless I’m very much mistaken, this Thais is going
to cause me a lot of trouble. I can see how cleverly
she’s been working on me ever since she first sent for me.
If anyone wonders what my relationship is with her, I
hadn’t even met her before. When I arrived, she invented
an excuse for keeping me there. She said she had
been carrying out a sacrifice<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL022_371_25" id="target_note_LCL022_371_25">

</a> and had some serious business
to discuss with me. Even at that stage I had a suspicion
that there was some ulterior motive behind all this.
She sat next to me on the couch, put herself at my disposal,
and started to make conversation. When this dried
up, she came to the point. “How long ago had my father
and mother died?” “Long since,” I said. “Did I have a
farm at Sunium? How far was it from the sea?” I think
she’s set her heart on it and is hoping to get it off me.
Finally, “Had I lost a little sister from there? Was there
anyone with her? What did she have on her when she disappeared?
Was there anyone who could recognise her?”
Why should she keep asking these questions? Unless
perhaps she wants to claim that <span class="italic">she</span> is the little sister who
disappeared long ago; she’s brazen enough. But if the
girl’s alive, she’s sixteen years old, no more; and Thais is a
bit older than I am. On top of all this she’s now sent an
urgent request for me to come. She must say what she
wants or stop pestering me. I’m not coming a third time,
by god. (<span class="italic">knocking on the door</span>) Hello! Hello! Anyone
here? It’s Chremes.</p></div>
