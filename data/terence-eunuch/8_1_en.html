down to this: I’m shut out, he’s let in. Why? Unless you
love him more than me and you’re afraid now that this
girl who has been brought here will snatch your splendid
soldier from you.</p></div>

</span> Well, what else worries you? Tell me, is he the only one
who gives you gifts? Is there any respect in which you
have seen my generosity falter? When you told me that

</span> All right, then, Phaedria. Although I’m keen to get possession
of her and I judge this is the best way to do it,
even so, rather than lose your friendship, I’ll do as you

</span> “Rather than lose your friendship”? If only you spoke
that sentence truthfully and from the bottom of your
heart! If I believed you spoke it sincerely, I could endure
anything.</p></div>
