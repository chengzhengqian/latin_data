</span> (<span class="italic">seeing Parmeno</span>) Parmeno, my dear fellow, the deviser,
the initiator, the perfector of all my delights, do you know
how happy I am? Do you know my Pamphila has been
found to be a citizen?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">par</span>
</span> (<span class="italic">without enthusiasm</span>) I’ve heard so.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">chae</span>
</span> Do you know she’s engaged to me?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">par</span>
</span> (<span class="italic">realising the significance of this for himself</span>) Heaven
help me, splendid news!</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">gna</span>
</span> (<span class="italic">aside to Thraso</span>) Do you hear what he says?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">chae</span>
</span> And then I’m delighted for my brother Phaedria, whose
whole affair is in calm waters. We’re one family. Thais
has entrusted herself to my father’s care and protection.
She’s thrown in her lot with us.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">par</span>
</span> So Thais is wholly your brother’s?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">chae</span>
</span> Of course.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">par</span>
</span> Then there’s another cause for rejoicing: the soldier will
be thrown out.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">chae</span>
</span> Make sure my brother hears the news as soon as possible,
wherever he is.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">par</span>
</span> I’ll see if he’s at home. (<span class="italic">he exits into his house</span>)</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">thr</span>
</span> (<span class="italic">aside to Gnatho</span>) Can you have any doubt that this is the
end of me for ever?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">gna</span>
</span> (<span class="italic">aside to Thraso</span>) None at all, if you ask me.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">chae</span>
</span> (<span class="italic">to himself</span>) Who deserves to be named first or praised
the most? The one who suggested the plan of action, or
myself who dared to carry it out? Or should I praise Fortune
the helmswoman who has packed so many favours
into a single day? Or my father for his good humour and
generosity? Oh Jupiter, I beseech you, preserve these
blessings for us.</p></div>
