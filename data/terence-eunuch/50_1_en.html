<span class="sc">chae</span>
</span> (<span class="italic">wheedling</span>) Forgive this one offence. If I ever commit
another, you can put me to death.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">tha</span>
</span> Were you afraid that I would be a cruel mistress?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">chae</span>
</span> No.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">tha</span>
</span> What, then?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">chae</span>
</span> I was afraid that she (<span class="italic">indicating Pythias</span>) would tell tales
on me.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">tha</span>
</span> What had you done?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">chae</span>
</span> Nothing very much.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">pyth</span>
</span> Hey, nothing very much, you shameless creature? Does
it seem to you nothing very much to rape a citizen girl?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">chae</span>
</span> I thought she was a fellow slave.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">pyth</span>
</span> A fellow slave! I can scarcely restrain myself from flying
at your hair, you monster! (<span class="italic">to Thais</span>) On top of it all he
comes here to mock us.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">tha</span>
</span> (<span class="italic">to Pythias</span>) Come off it! You’re crazy!</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">pyth</span>
</span> What do you mean? I’m scarcely going to be held liable
if I do anything to this rascal, especially as he’s claiming
to be your slave.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">tha</span>
</span> (<span class="italic">changing her tone</span>) Let’s stop this nonsense. (<span class="italic">to Chaerea</span>)
Your conduct was not worthy of you, Chaerea. Even
if I thoroughly deserve this outrage, it wasn’t right for you
to inflict it. Now I’ve no idea what to do about the girl.
You’ve upset my calculations: I can’t hand her over to
her family, which would have been the proper thing and
which I’d set my heart on doing in order to gain myself
some lasting benefit, Chaerea.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">chae</span>
</span> But I hope that from now on there will be an eternal
bond of gratitude between us, Thais. Often a great
friendship has been forged from an incident of this sort
and a bad beginning. What if some god has willed it?</p></div><notes></notes></section>
