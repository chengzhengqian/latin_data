<span class="sc">tha</span>
</span> Well, heaven knows I’m ready and willing to look at it
that way.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">chae</span>
</span> That’s good of you. Let me assure you of one thing: I
didn’t do this to insult you but for love.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">tha</span>
</span> I know, and for that reason, by heaven, I’m the more
ready to forgive you. I’m not so lacking in humanity,
Chaerea, or so inexperienced in the ways of the world,
that I don’t know the power of love.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">chae</span>
</span> I love you too, Thais, as heaven is my witness.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">pyth</span>
</span> (<span class="italic">to Thais</span>) In that case I can see you need to be on your
guard against him, madam.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">chae</span>
</span> I wouldn’t dare.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">pyth</span>
</span> I don’t trust you one little bit.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">tha</span>
</span> (<span class="italic">to Pythias</span>) That’s enough!</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">chae</span>
</span> (<span class="italic">to Thais</span>) I now beg you to give me your support in this
matter; I entrust myself to your care and protection; I
take you as my patron, Thais; I implore you. I shall die if I
don’t marry her.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">tha</span>
</span> But if your father—</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">chae</span>
</span> Does what? Oh, he’ll consent, I’m sure, provided she’s a
citizen.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">tha</span>
</span> If you’re willing to wait a moment, the girl’s brother will
soon be here himself. He’s gone to fetch the nurse who
took care of her when she was tiny. You shall be present at
the recognition, Chaerea.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">chae</span>
</span> Of course I’ll stay.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">tha</span>
</span> Would you rather we waited inside the house for him to
come instead of here in front of the door?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">chae</span>
</span> Very much so.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">pyth</span>
</span> (<span class="italic">to Thais</span>) What are you doing, for goodness’ sake?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">tha</span>
</span> What’s the matter?</p></div><notes></notes></section>
