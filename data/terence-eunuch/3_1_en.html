</span> So what am I to do? Should I not go, not even now, when
she invites me of her own accord? Should I rather take
myself in hand and refuse to endure the insults of courtesans?
She shut me out, she calls me back: shall I go? No,
not if she implores me. (<span class="italic">arguing with himself</span>)<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL022_321_10a" id="target_note_LCL022_321_10a">

</a> If only
you could, by god, this would be the best course, and the
bravest. But if you start on it and haven’t the strength to
carry it through, and, when you can’t endure it, when nobody
wants you, you go to her of your own accord with no
terms negotiated, making it quite clear that you love her

about going insane by reason. And as for your present
angry thoughts—”I—her? when she—him? when she—me? when she won’t—? Just let it be, I’d prefer to die,
she shall realise what sort of man I am”—god knows
she’ll quell that sort of talk with one tiny little false tear,
which she’s just managed to squeeze out by rubbing her</p></div><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL022_321_10a"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL022_321_10a" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">10</sup>Lines 50–55 are given to Parmeno by a number of the MSS, influ- enced no doubt by the change to second person in line 50.
