</span> You wretch, entrusting a lamb to the proverbial wolf! I’m
ashamed to have been deceived like this. What sort of a
man is this?</p></div>

</span> (<span class="italic">looking down the street</span>)My dear mistress, say no more,
I implore you. We’re saved. We’ve got him.</p></div>

</span> Where is he?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">pyth</span>
</span> Over there, to the left. Do you see?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">tha</span>
</span> Yes, I do.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">pyth</span>
</span> Have him arrested at once.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">tha</span>
</span> What could we do with him, you fool?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">pyth</span>
</span> What could we do? You ask? Do me a favour, take a look
and see if there isn’t impudence written all over his face.
Well, isn’t there? And what self-assurance!</p></div>

</span> (<span class="italic">to himself</span>) Antipho’s father and mother were both at
home, as if they’d stayed in on purpose, so there was no
way I could get inside without being seen. While I was
standing outside the door, an acquaintance of mine came
up. When I saw him, I took to my heels as fast as I could
into a deserted alley, and from there to another one, and
then to another. I was desperate in case someone recognised
me as I fled. (<span class="italic">seeing Thais</span>) But is that Thais I see?
It is. I’m stuck what to do. What’s it matter, though? What
can she do to me?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">tha</span>
</span> (<span class="italic">to Pythias</span>) Let’s go up to him. (<span class="italic">to Chaerea</span>) Good day,
Dorus, my good man. Tell me, did you run away?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">chae</span>
</span> Yes, madam, I did.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">tha</span>
</span> Are you happy with your conduct?</p></div>

</span> No.</p></div>

<span class="sc">tha</span>
</span> Do you suppose you’ll get away with this?</p></div><notes></notes></section>
