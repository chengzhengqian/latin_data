</span> Oh dear, do I not speak from the bottom of my heart? Tell
me, what have you asked from me even in jest, which you
haven’t obtained? Yet I can’t prevail upon you to do me
the favour of going away for a mere two days.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">phae</span>
</span> If it is two days. But make sure they don’t become twenty.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">tha</span>
</span> I assure you, not more than two days, or—</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">phae</span>
</span> “Or”? I don’t like the sound of that.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">tha</span>
</span> It won’t happen. Just grant me this one thing.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">phae</span>
</span> (<span class="italic">reluctantly</span>) Evidently I have to do what you want.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">tha</span>
</span> No wonder I love you. You’re very kind.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">phae</span>
</span> (<span class="italic">to himself</span>) I’ll go to the farm and stew in misery there
for two days. I’ve made up my mind: I must let Thais
have her way. (<span class="italic">to Parmeno, nodding towards his house</span>)
Parmeno, have those two brought across.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">par</span>
</span> Certainly. (<span class="italic">he exits into the house</span>)</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">phae</span>
</span> For these two days, Thais, farewell.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">tha</span>
</span> You too, my dear Phaedria. Is there anything else I can do
for you?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">phae</span>
</span> Do for me? When you’re with that soldier, be absent
from him. Day and night love me, miss me, dream of me,
look for me, think of me, hope for me, delight in me, be
entirely with me. In short, be my heart as I am yours. (<span class="italic">he
exits into his house, leaving Thais alone on stage</span>)</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">tha</span>
</span> (<span class="italic">to herself</span>) Oh dear! It looks as if he has little trust in me
and is judging me by the character of other women. As
for me, knowing myself as I do, I’m quite sure I’ve not
invented any falsehood and nobody is dearer to me than
Phaedria. Whatever I’ve done in this matter, I’ve done</p></div><notes></notes></section>
