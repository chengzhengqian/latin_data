</span> I’m grateful to you, Thais, and I’ll repay you as you deserve.</p></div>

</span> But mind you don’t lose her before you even get her from
me, Chremes. She’s the one the soldier’s now coming to
steal from me by force. (<span class="italic">to Pythias</span>) Pythias, you run indoors
and fetch the box with the tokens. (<span class="italic">Pythias exits
into the house</span>)</p></div>

</span> (<span class="italic">looking down the street</span>)Do you see the soldier, Thais—?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">pyth</span>
</span> (<span class="italic">appearing at the door, to Thais</span>) Where is it?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">tha</span>
</span> (<span class="italic">to Pythias</span>) In the chest. You’re a nuisance to be so slow.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">chr</span>
</span> —and what a large army he’s bringing with him? Help!</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">tha</span>
</span> You’re not frightened, for goodness’ sake, my dear fellow?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">chr</span>
</span> Get away with you! Me frightened? There’s not a man
living who’s less so.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">tha</span>
</span> Well, we need some courage.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">chr</span>
</span> Oh! I’m afraid you don’t think much of me.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">tha</span>
</span> Never mind that; look at it this way. The man you have to
deal with is a foreigner, less influential than you, less well
known, and with fewer friends here.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">chr</span>
</span> I’m aware of that. But it’s stupid to let something happen
when you could prevent it. I’d prefer us to take action beforehand
rather than seek redress when the injury’s been
done. You go and bolt the door from inside, while I run
off to the forum. I’d like to have some people to support
me in this dispute. (<span class="italic">he makes to leave right</span>)</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">tha</span>
</span> (<span class="italic">restraining him</span>) Wait.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">chr</span>
</span> It’s better.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">tha</span>
</span> Forget it.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">chr</span>
</span> I’ll soon be back.</p></div><notes></notes></section>
