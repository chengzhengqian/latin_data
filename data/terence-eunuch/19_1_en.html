</span> Yes indeed, and, if you knew what gift he is offering in
competition, you’d say so all the more.</p></div>

</span> Tell me, what gift?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">par</span>
</span> A eunuch.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">chae</span>
</span> Not that repulsive fellow he bought yesterday, for goodness’
sake, that woman of a man?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">par</span>
</span> The very one.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">chae</span>
</span> He’ll be thrown out for sure, gift and all. But I didn’t

<span class="sc">chae</span>
</span> Where are you off to?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">par</span>
</span> Home, to take those goods to Thais, as your brother told

<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">chae</span>
</span> Oh the lucky eunuch, to be taken into that house as a gift!</p></div>
