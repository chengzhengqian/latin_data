</span> (<span class="italic">to himself</span>) Yesterday several of the lads got together at
the Piraeus and arranged to club together for dinner today.
We put Chaerea in charge of arrangements, handed
over our rings,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL022_373_26" id="target_note_LCL022_373_26">

</a> and settled a place and time. The time
has passed, and there is no sign of any preparations at the
place we said. Chaerea himself is nowhere to be seen,
and I don’t know what to say or how to explain it. Now the
others have given me the job of finding him, and that’s
why I’m coming to see if he’s at home. (<span class="italic">as Thais’ door

isn’t it? It is, the very man. (<span class="italic">looking again at Chaerea’s
costume</span>) But what kind of a man is this? What’s this getup?</p></div><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL022_373_26"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL022_373_26" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">26</sup>Clubbing together for dinner was a common Greek practice.
