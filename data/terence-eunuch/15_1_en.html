</span> (<span class="italic">emerging from Thais’ house</span>) Are you still standing here,
Parmeno? Hey, were you left here on guard in case some
messenger from the soldier called on her secretly? (<span class="italic">he
exits right in the direction of the forum, leaving Parmeno
on stage alone</span>)</p></div>

</span> (<span class="italic">to himself</span>) Very witty! Quite surprising for a soldier’s
hanger-on! (<span class="italic">looking down the street</span>) But I see the master’s
younger son approaching. I wonder why he’s left the
Piraeus;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL022_345_17" id="target_note_LCL022_345_17">

reason. And he’s in a hurry: he’s looking around for something.</p></div>

<span class="sc">chae</span>
</span> (<span class="italic">to himself</span>) Damnation! The girl’s lost; and so am I, now
I’ve lost sight of her. I just don’t know where to look,
where to search, whom to question, which way to take.
There’s only one hope: wherever she is, she can’t be hidden
for long. What gorgeous looks! From now on I banish
all other women from my mind. I’ve had enough of these
everyday beauties.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">par</span>
</span> (<span class="italic">aside</span>) Now look, here’s the other one, muttering something
about love! The poor old master! If this one gets
going, you’ll say the other was only fun and games, compared
with the effects of this one’s passions.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">chae</span>
</span> (<span class="italic">to himself</span>) May all the gods and goddesses destroy the
old fool who delayed me today, and me too for stopping
and taking any notice of him! (<span class="italic">catching sight of Parmeno</span>)
But there’s Parmeno. Good day.</p></div><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL022_345_17"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL022_345_17" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">17</sup>The port of Athens, about four miles southwest of the city.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL022_345_17').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL022_345_18"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL022_345_18" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">18</sup>See <span class="italic">The Woman of Andros</span> note 9.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL022_345_18').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
