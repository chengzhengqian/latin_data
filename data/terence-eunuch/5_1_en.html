</span> (<span class="italic">with bitter irony</span>) It must be because in fact these doors
are always open to me and because I come first in your

</span> How do you mean “forget”? Oh Thais, Thais, if only our
love were evenly matched and we both felt the same, so
that either this hurt you as much as it does me or I didn’t
care a damn about what you’ve done!</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">tha</span>
</span> Don’t torment yourself, I implore you, my darling, my
Phaedria. Heaven knows, I didn’t do it because I love or
care for anyone more than you; but the situation was
such, I had to do it.</p></div>

</span> Must you, Parmeno? Come on! (<span class="italic">to Phaedria</span>) But let me

<span class="sc">par</span>
</span> Me? Very well. But mark my words, I make you this
promise on one condition. The truths I hear I keep secret;
I contain them very well. But if anything’s false or
fanciful or fictional, it’s out at once: I’m full of cracks, I
leak all over. So, if you want your secrets kept, tell the
truth.</p></div>

</span> I had a Samian mother; she lived in Rhodes.</p></div>

gave my mother a little girl as a present. She had
been kidnapped from here, from Attica.</p></div>
