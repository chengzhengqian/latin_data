</span> In what way? (<span class="italic">eagerly</span>) Answer me.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">

</span> You could put on his clothes.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">chae</span>
</span> Clothes? And then what?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">par</span>
</span> I could take you instead of him.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">chae</span>
</span> I’m listening.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">par</span>
</span> I could say you were him.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">chae</span>
</span> I begin to see.</p></div>

</span> You could enjoy the benefits which you were just saying
would be his—eat with her, live with her, touch her, play
with her, sleep next to her. None of the women recognises
you or knows who you are. Besides, you’re so young
and good-looking, you could easily pass as a eunuch.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">chae</span>
</span> It’s a brilliant idea. I’ve never known better advice. (<span class="italic">eagerly</span>)
Come on then, let’s go in now. Dress me up and
take me across as quick as you can.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">

</span> What are you thinking of? I was only joking.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">chae</span>
</span> Nonsense!</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">par</span>
</span> Damn it! Oh, what have I done? (<span class="italic">Chaerea pushes him
towards the house</span>) Stop shoving me. You’ll knock me
down. I’m warning you, stop it!</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">chae</span>
</span> Let’s go.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">par</span>
</span> Are you going through with this?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">chae</span>
</span> My mind’s made up.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">par</span>
</span> Be careful. This may turn out too hot to hold.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">chae</span>
</span> It won’t, I’m sure. Let me.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">par</span>
</span> But I’m the one who’ll pay for it.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL022_355_19" id="target_note_LCL022_355_19">
