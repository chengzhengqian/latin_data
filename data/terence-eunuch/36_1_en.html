<span class="sc">phae</span>
</span> (<span class="italic">aside</span>) Damn it! I’m afraid to think what this is about.</p></div>

<span class="sc">pyth</span>
</span> Why, on top of it all, after he’d had his fun and games with
the poor girl, the villain ripped her whole dress and tore
her hair.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">phae</span>
</span> (<span class="italic">aside</span>) What!</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">pyth</span>
</span> If I get my hands on him, I can’t wait to fly at his face with
my nails, the poisonous wretch!</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">phae</span>
</span> (<span class="italic">aside</span>) There’s obviously been some sort of trouble at
home in my absence. I’ll go up to her. (<span class="italic">to Pythias</span>) What’s
the matter? What’s the panic? Who are you looking for,
Pythias?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">pyth</span>
</span> (<span class="italic">coldly</span>) Oh it’s you, Phaedria! Who am I looking for? You
go where you deserve and take your charming gifts with
you.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">phae</span>
</span> What are you talking about?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">pyth</span>
</span> A fine question! That eunuch you gave us, what trouble
he’s caused! He’s raped the girl the soldier gave to my
mistress as a present.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">phae</span>
</span> What are you saying?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">pyth</span>
</span> I’m ruined.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">phae</span>
</span> You’re drunk.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">pyth</span>
</span> If only my enemies were in the same state!</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">dori</span>
</span> (<span class="italic">coming forward</span>) Oh for goodness’ sake, my dear Pythias,
what sort of an unnatural deed is this?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">phae</span>
</span> (<span class="italic">to Pythias</span>) You’re crazy. How could a eunuch do it?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">pyth</span>
</span> I don’t know who he was, but what he did is clear from
the facts. The girl is crying and doesn’t dare say what happened
when you ask her. And that fine fellow is nowhere
to be seen. Oh dear, I suspect that he also took something
from the house when he left.</p></div><notes></notes></section>
