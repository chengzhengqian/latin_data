<p class="noindent">He stood firm without concern for himself, and refused to waste breath on futile prayers. The brute buried his sword in the wound he made, the hand meeting the throat as it thrust deep. When the steel was pulled out the corpse stayed upright; after long hesitation whether to fall this way or that, it fell on its uncle.</p>
<p>Then that savage drags Plisthenes to the altar, and adds him to his brother. With a mortal stroke he chops off the head; with the neck severed the trunk falls forward, while the head rolls away, mumbling some unintelligible protest.</p>

He falls, and dies from both wounds as his blood douses the altar fire.</p></div><notes></notes></section>
