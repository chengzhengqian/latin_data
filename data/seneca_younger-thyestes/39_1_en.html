death of his sons. Lest shame should present any obstacle, daylight has withdrawn: go on while heaven is empty! Indeed I wish I could stop the gods fleeing, round them up and drag them all to see this feast of vengeance. But it is enough that the father see it. Even though the daylight is unwilling, I shall dispel for you the darkness that conceals your sorrows. Too long you have lain there feasting with a carefree, cheerful expression. Enough devotion now to the board, enough to wine: for suffering so great, we need Thyestes sober.</p>
<p>You throng of slaves, unbar the temple doors, let the revels of the house be revealed.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL078_309_43" id="target_note_LCL078_309_43"><sup>43</sup></a> (<span class="italic">aside</span>) I long to see what color he turns as he looks on his sonsâ€™ heads, what words his first torment pours forth, how his body stiffens, breathless with shock. This is the fruit of my work: I do not want to see him broken, but <span class="italic">being</span> broken.</p>

There still remains the blood of so many victims; the color of vintage wine will disguise it. Yes, let this be the cup to close the feast! Let the father drink the blended blood of his sons: he would have drunk mine. See, now he is raising his voice in festive songs, with little control over his wits.</p>
