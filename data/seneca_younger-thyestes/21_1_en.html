humble table; poison is drunk in gold.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL078_273_27a" id="target_note_LCL078_273_27a"><sup>27</sup></a> I speak from experience: one may legitimately prefer “bad” fortune to “good.”</p>
<p>No house of mine is set lowering on a high hilltop, making the lowly citizenry tremble; there is no bright ivory gleaming on high ceilings of mine, no bodyguard protecting my sleep. I do not take whole fleets fishing, or drive back the sea by dumping rock,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL078_273_28" id="target_note_LCL078_273_28"><sup>28</sup></a> or feed a gluttonous belly with the tribute of nations; no fields are surveyed for me beyond the Getae or Parthians. I am not worshipped with incense, no altars of mine are adorned to the exclusion of Jove. I have no woodland planted on my rooftop and swaying in the breeze, no steaming pools stoked by many hands; my day is not given over to sleep, nor my night forthwith to sleepless drinking. But I am not feared, my house is safe without weapons, and my small domain is supplied with great peace. It is a vast kingdom, to be able to cope without a kingdom.</p>
