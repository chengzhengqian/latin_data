<span class="line indent2">the sea sinks down calmer than a pond;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">the deeps that ships were afraid to cleave</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">are smooth and open to pleasure craft,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">arrayed with sails spread far and wide;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">there is freedom to count the fish below water</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">where just now, under the mighty storm,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">the shaken Cyclades feared the sea.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent3">No state is lasting; pain and pleasure</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">give way in turn: pleasure is briefer.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">A short hour switches high and low.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">Even he who crowns the heads of princes,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">before whom nations kneel and tremble,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">at whose nod wars are set aside</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">by Medes and Indians close to Phoebus</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">and Dahae whose horsemen threaten the Parthiansâ€”</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2"><span class="italic">he</span> grips the scepter tensely, and tries</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">in his fear to divine the changes of chance</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">that changes all, and the hazards of time.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">You, whom the ruler of earth and sea</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">has granted great power over life and death:</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">drop your puffed-up, arrogant airs.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">Whatever a lesser man fears from you</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">threatens you from a greater master;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">all power is under a weightier power.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">Rising day sees a man in pride:</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">retreating day sees him brought low.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent3">No one should trust too much in success,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">no one despair of misfortune improving.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">Clotho mixes the two, forbidding Fortune</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">to rest, and spins each destiny around.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
