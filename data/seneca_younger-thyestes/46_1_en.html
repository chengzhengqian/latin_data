<p>You exalted ruler of the skies, mighty master of heaven’s court: enfold all the world in fearsome clouds, bring winds from every direction together in warfare, thunder ferociously in every quarter.

But if nothing moves the gods, if no divinity strikes with his weapons at the wicked, let night remain
