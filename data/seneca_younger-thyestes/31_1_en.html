The grove begins to tremble; as the earth shakes the whole palace sways, uncertain which way to topple and seeming to waver. From the sky’s left quarter races a comet, leaving a black trail. Wine poured in libation on the fires changes as it flows to blood; the royal emblem slips repeatedly from his head; ivory statues weep in the temples. All are affected by these prodigies, but Atreus alone remains unaffected and constant; he counterthreatens the menacing gods.</p>

As in the woods by the Ganges a hungry tigress wavers between two young bulls, craving each prey and uncertain where to sink her teeth first; she turns her gaping jaws here, turns them back there and keeps her hunger in suspense: so dread Atreus surveys the victims consecrated to his godless anger. He hesitates: which shall he sacrifice first to himself, then which shall he offer up as the second killing? It makes no difference, yet he hesitates and takes pleasure in ordering the savage crime.</p>
