The father is mangling his sons, gnawing his own limbs with entombing teeth. He is glistening, with hair soaked in flowing unguent, and he is heavy with wine. Often his blocked throat holds the food. In your troubles there is this one boon, Thyestes, that you are ignorant of your troubles! But this too will perish.
