 what laments? What speech will suffice me? I see the lopped-off heads, the wrenched-off hands, the feet torn from broken legs. This is what the greedy father could not take in!<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL078_321_46" id="target_note_LCL078_321_46"><sup>46</sup></a> The flesh churns within me, the imprisoned horror struggles with no way out, seeking to escape. Give me your sword, brother—it already has much of my blood: the blade must give my children a path. You refuse the sword? Let me batter my breast, smash resounding blows against it—no, hold your hand, poor wretch, we must spare the dead. Who has ever seen such horror? What Henioch, dwelling on the rough crags of inhospitable Caucasus, or what Procrustes, terror of Cecropian lands? See, a father burdening his sons, and burdened by his sons.

I dealt wounds, pressing the blade home, I slaughtered at the altar, I propitiated the hearth with votive killing, I chopped up the lifeless bodies, pulled the flesh into small pieces and plunged some into boiling cauldrons, bade others drip over slow fires; I cut away limbs and sinews from the living bodies, pierced the organs with thin spits and watched them moan, piled up fires with my own hands: all this the father could have done better. My anger was to no avail.
