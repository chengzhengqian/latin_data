Atreus in anger? By now the whole world should be resounding to your weapons, fleets on each coast should be stirring up the twin seas; by now fields and cities should be alight with flames, and the drawn sword glinting everywhere. Let the whole Argive land ring beneath my horsemen; let forests not hide the enemy, nor strongholds built on high hilltops. Let the whole populace leave Mycenae and trumpet war. Let all who shield and shelter that hated creature perish in a bloodbath. This mighty house of famous Pelops itself—let it fall even on me, so long as it falls on my brother.</p>
<p>Come, my spirit, do what no future age will endorse, but none fail to talk about. I must dare some fierce, bloody outrage, such as my brother would have wished his own.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL078_247_11" id="target_note_LCL078_247_11"><sup>11</sup></a> You do not avenge crimes unless you surpass them. And what could be cruel enough to vanquish him? Does he lie downcast? Can he abide moderation in success, or inaction in failure?

He will either destroy or be destroyed. Crime is set between us, for the one who seizes it first.</p>
