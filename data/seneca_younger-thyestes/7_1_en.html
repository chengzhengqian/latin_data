<span class="line indent3">Tantalus stands spent and empty-throated.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">Over his guilty head in abundance</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">hangs prey more fleeting than Phineus’ birds.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">Leaning around him with gravid branches,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">curved and trembling with what it bears,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">the tree mocks at his gaping jaws.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">Though impatient and avid, he makes no effort</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">(deceived so often) to touch the fruit,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">but averts his eyes and seals his lips</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">and fetters his hunger behind clenched teeth.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">But then the whole orchard lowers its riches</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">closer still, and the fruits from above</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">taunt him, so mellow, with drooping leaves,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">and inflame his hunger, which bids him busy</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">his hands in vain. As he stretches them out,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">consents to be cheated, the entire harvest</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">is whisked on high with the nimble trees.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">Next thirst attacks, no weaker than hunger.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">Once it heats his blood and fires it with torches</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">of flame, the wretch stands chasing the offered</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">waters with his mouth; but the fleeing stream</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">turns away, and dwindles to a barren channel</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">and leaves him trying to follow. He drinks</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">the deeps left from the whirling flood: deep dust.</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></div><span class="label"><span class="ac">ACT TWO</span></span>
