When anger senses blood, it knows no concealment. But concealed it must be. See how his hair is heavy with grime and shrouds his dismal face, how foul and limp his beard. —But good faith must be demonstrated.</p>

As hostages of my good faith take these innocents, brother.</p></div><notes></notes></section>
