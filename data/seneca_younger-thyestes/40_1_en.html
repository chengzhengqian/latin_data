<span class="line indent2">now set aside your fretful cares.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">Away with grief, away with fear,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">away with the comrade of anxious exile,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">gloomy poverty,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">and shame that weighs upon misfortune.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">Where you fall <span class="italic">from</span> matters more than where you fall <span class="italic">to</span>.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">It’s great, when you slip from a lofty peak,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">to plant your feet firmly on the ground;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">great, when a huge havoc of troubles</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">engulfs you, to keep your neck unbowed</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">while enduring the burden of broken kingship</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">—not to be conquered ignobly by troubles</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">but to stand and bear the infliction of ruin.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">But now dispel the clouds of cruel</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">destiny, and put aside every token</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">of unhappy days;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">smile once more at happiness,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">cast from your heart the old Thyestes.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent3">Yet the wretched are dogged by this special fault</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">of never trusting in happy times.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">Although good fortune comes round again,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">yet rejoicing grates on those who have suffered.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">Why hold me back</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">and forbid my celebrating this festive day,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">why bid me weep,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">pain arising without a cause?</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">Who prevents me</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">from binding my hair with comely flowers,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">prevents me, prevents me?</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
