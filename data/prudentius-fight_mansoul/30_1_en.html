But the nation’s peace depends on good will between its citizens in field and town. Division at home upsets the common weal and difference within means faltering abroad. Therefore be on the watch, my soldiers, that there be no discordant thought among our Sentiments, that no foreign faction arise in us from the occasion of hidden quarrels; for a divided will creates disorder in our inmost nature, making two parties in a heart at variance. Let our understanding be united by love, our life be in accord in a single aim; where there is separation there is no strength. And just as Jesus mediates between man and God, uniting mortality with the Father so that the fleshly shall not be separated from the eternal Spirit and that one God shall be both, so let one spirit shape in single structure all that we do by action of soul and body. Peace is the fulfilment of a Virtue’s work, peace the sum and substance of her toils, peace the reward for war now ended and for peril faced. It is by peace that the stars live and move, by peace that earthly things stand firm. Without peace nothing is pleasing to God. When thou desirest to offer a gift at the altar, it is not acceptable to Him if thy soul is angry and hates thy brother in the depths of a heart unreconciled; and if in martyrdom for the name of Christ thou shouldst leap into the fire with its tresses of flame, while from spiteful wrath thou dost still keep some uncharitable desire, it will not profit thee to have sacrificed thy precious life to Jesus, for it is peace that is the perfection of merit. It is not puffed up with pride, it feels no jealous envy of a brother; it endures all things with long-suffering, believes all things. It bears wrong without resentment, it forgives all
