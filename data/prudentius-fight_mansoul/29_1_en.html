<p>So now that a fair and happy state of circumstance and life has been established over all, now<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL387_331_a" id="target_note_LCL387_331_a"><sup>a</sup></a> that the peaceable Sentiments can dwell in security under the protection of guard-post and rampart, and find relief in relaxation of their cares,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL387_331_a" id="target_note_LCL387_331_a"><sup>a</sup></a> a platform is set up at the midmost point of the camp on an elevated ground, a peak-topped hillock rising to make a look-out whence the eye can freely range afar on every side without obstruction. To this projection mounts honest Faith and, with her, Concord, sisters sworn in holy alliance in the love of Christ. Then the sacred pair, dear to each other, take their stand together towering above the lofty platform, for their authority is equal; and from their prominent place on the summit of the rising ground they bid the people attend them in their numbers. All assemble briskly from the whole camp. No member of Soul lurks in idleness, shut off in a pocket of the body and lying close in some retreat in ignoble sloth. All tents stand exposed, their curtains drawn back, the canvas open, so that no dweller therein shall lie lazily asleep in undiscovered secrecy. With ears alert the assemblage waits to hear for what cause its leader Concord summons the victors now that war is over, or what new rule Faith will lay on the Virtues. Concord first breaks into speech with these words: “Abundant glory has come to you, ye faithful children of the Father and of Christ our Lord. With a great struggle have you wiped out the cruel savages that had beset the dwellers in the holy city round about with hard pressure of fire and sword.
