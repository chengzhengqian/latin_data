<p>XXIV. Very many provinces which had previously been governed by legates were transferred by him to the class which was ruled by equestrian governors,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL140_223_2a" id="target_note_LCL140_223_2a"><sup>2</sup></a> and the provinces which were under proconsuls were governed according to the wish of the senate.

He ordered that the taxes imposed on procurers, harlots, and catamites should not be deposited in the public treasury, but utilized them to meet the state’s expenditures for the restoration of the theatre, the Circus, the Amphitheatre, and the Stadium.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL140_223_4" id="target_note_LCL140_223_4"><sup>4</sup></a> In fact, he had it in mind to prohibit catamites altogether—which was afterwards done by Philip<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL140_223_5" id="target_note_LCL140_223_5"><sup>5</sup></a>—but he feared that such a prohibition would merely convert an evil recognized by the state into a vice practised in private—for men when driven on by passion are more apt to demand a vice which is prohibited. He imposed a very profitable tax on makers of trousers, weavers of linen, glass-workers, furriers, locksmiths, silversmiths, goldsmiths, and workers in the other crafts, and gave

In the present passage the word <span class="italic">praesidales</span> presents considerable difficulty. The term <span class="italic">praeses</span> was used loosely to designate any provincial governor (see <span class="italic">Digesta,</span> i. 18, 1) as in, <span class="italic">e.g</span>., c. xxii. 6; xlii. 4; xlvi. 5; <span class="italic">Hadr</span>., xiii. 10; <span class="italic">Pius,</span> v. 3. Again, it was used in the later period, after the separation of the civil and military powers in the provinces, to designate the <span class="italic">civil</span> governor as opposed to the military commander, and this has been thought to be its application here. There is, however, no other evidence that this separation was carried out until the latter part of the third century, and it is very doubtful if this change can be attributed to Alexander. A third use of <span class="italic">praeses</span> was its application to a <span class="italic">procurator</span> of equestrian rank charged with the governorship of a minor imperial province as opposed to a senatorial <span class="italic">legatus</span> (see Hirschfeld, <span class="italic">Verwaltungsbeamten,</span> p. 385 f.) and it seems most reasonable to interpret it in this sense here.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL140_223_2a').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL140_223_3"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL140_223_3" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">3</sup>See <span class="italic">Hadr</span>., xviii. 10; <span class="italic">Marc</span>., xxiii. 8.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL140_223_3').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL140_223_4"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL140_223_4" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">4</sup>The Theatre of Marcellus (see c. xliv. 7), the Circus Maximum, the Colosseum, struck by lightning under Macrinus (see <span class="italic">Heliog</span>., xvii. 8 and note), and the stadium built by Domitian in the Campus Martius—the site of the modern Piazza Navona.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL140_223_4').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL140_223_5"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL140_223_5" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">5</sup>See c. xxxix. 2; <span class="italic">Heliog</span>., xxxii. 6.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL140_223_5').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
