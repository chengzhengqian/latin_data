<p>LXIII. His death was greatly lamented by the soldiers, even by those whom he had discharged, and they slew the men who had committed the murder.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL140_305_1" id="target_note_LCL140_305_1"><sup>1</sup></a> But the Roman people and all the senate and all the inhabitants of the provinces never mourned anything with greater sorrow and bitterness of spirit; and at the same time the cruel necessity of fate seemed to be shown in the harshness and roughness of his successor Maximinus (natural enough in a soldier), on whom, together with his son, the imperial power was conferred after Alexander.
