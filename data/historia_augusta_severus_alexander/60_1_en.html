The captives taken from the various nations, if their childhood or youth permitted it, were given to the Emperor’s friends, but those who were of royal blood or noble rank were enrolled for warfare, though not for any of great importance.

An account of the German expedition is given by Herodian, vi. 7. The Germans, taking advantage of the fact that the armies on the Danube and the Rhine had been depleted in order to supply troops for the campaign against Ardashir, crossed the rivers and invaded Roman territory. Alexander, marching northward hastily, crossed the Rhine on a bridge of boats (portrayed on a coin of 235, Cohen, iv<sup>2</sup>, p. 483, no. 16) and attempted to make peace, promising to fulfil their conditions and offering them large sums of money. The anger of the troops at these negotiations led to a revolt under the leadership of Maximinus (§ 7-8) and the murder of Alexander and Mamaea; see <span class="italic">Maxim</span>., vii. 4; Herodian, vi., 8-9.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL140_297_4a').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
