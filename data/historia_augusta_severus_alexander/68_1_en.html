<p>LXVIII. And that you may know what men were in his council, he had Fabius Sabinus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL140_313_1a" id="target_note_LCL140_313_1a"><sup>1</sup></a> the son of the famous Sabinus and the Cato of his time; Domitius Ulpianus, the learned jurist; Aelius Gordianus, a relative of Gordian the Emperor and a famous man; Julius Paulus, the learned jurist; Claudius Venacus, a most distinguished orator; Catilius Severus, his own kinsman, the most learned of them all; Aelius Serenianus, the most highly revered of them all; Quintilius Marcellus, a more righteous man than whom is not found in history. What wicked thing could be planned or executed by all these men and others like them, when they were leagued together for good? In his early days, indeed, a band of evil men, which surrounded Alexander, had thrust these men aside, but when this company were slain or driven away by the young man’s good sense, these upright friends held sway. These are the men who made the Syrian a good emperor, as likewise evil friends caused native Romans to seem evil, even to posterity, for they burdened them with the weight of their own iniquities.</p>
