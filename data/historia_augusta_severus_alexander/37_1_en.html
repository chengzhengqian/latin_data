He had a hare every day and often game, but this he would share with his friends, chiefly those whom he knew to have none of their own. For he never gave any of these gifts to the rich, though he was always ready to receive presents from them. Every day he had four pints of mead without pepper and two with pepper. In short, lest it be too tedious to give an account of all that he ate, which has been done in great detail by Gargilius,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL140_251_5" id="target_note_LCL140_251_5"><sup>5</sup></a> a contemporary writer, everything was served to him in due measure and according to reason. But he was inordinately fond of fruit and usually had it served to him as dessert; hence arose the witticism that Alexander had, not a second course, but a second meal. He himself would consume the greatest amount of food and he would drink wine neither too sparingly nor yet in large quantities, but nevertheless in fair amounts. He always drank pure cold water as well, but in summer he would add wine flavoured with essence of roses—the only one of Elagabalus’s various kinds of flavourings<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL140_251_6" id="target_note_LCL140_251_6"><sup>6</sup></a> that he retained.</p>
