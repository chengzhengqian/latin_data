<p>XXXIX. When he had with him friends of the military class he would observe a custom which Trajan had introduced,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL140_255_1" id="target_note_LCL140_255_1"><sup>1</sup></a> namely, that of drinking after the dessert as many as five goblets; he, however, would serve his friends one goblet only, to be drunk in honour of Alexander the Great, and it was a rather small one too, though it was always permissible to ask openly for a larger one. In the enjoyment of love he was temperate, and he would have nothing to do with catamites, in fact, he even wished to have a law passed, as I have said before,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL140_255_2" id="target_note_LCL140_255_2"><sup>2</sup></a> doing away with them altogether.</p>
