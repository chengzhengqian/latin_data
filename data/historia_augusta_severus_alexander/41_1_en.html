He would give away all his gold and silver, and very frequently too. He would also give away equipment for the troops, such as leggings, trousers, and boots. He would always insist most rigorously on having purple of the brightest hue, not for his own use but for that of matrons, in case they were able or eager to have it, and in any case with a view to having it put on sale; and even today that purple is still called Alexandrian, which is commonly spoken of as Probian merely because Aurelius Probus, the superintendent of the dye-works,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL140_259_1" id="target_note_LCL140_259_1"><sup>1</sup></a> invented this kind of dye.

He was always eager to get good linen, without any purple in it, for he used to say, “If these garments are made of linen in order to prevent their being rough, what is the use of having purple in the linen?” And as for inserting gold threads, he deemed it madness, since in addition to being rough they also made the garment stiff.
