of hares—his custom of having a hare every day gave rise to a witticism in verse; for many say that those who have eaten a hare are beautiful for the next seven days, and this belief is also indicated in an epigram of Martial’s directed at a woman named Gellia as follows<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL140_253_1" id="target_note_LCL140_253_1"><sup>1</sup></a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">“When you send me a hare, dear Gellia, you send</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent3">me a message plain:</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">‘For the next seven days, dear Marcus, a beautiful</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent3">man you’ll remain.’</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">If you tell me the truth, dear Gellia, if you send me</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent3">a promise fair,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">You have never yourself, dear Gellia, <span class="italic">you</span> have never</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent3">eaten a hare.”</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">These verses, however, Martial wrote to a woman who was ugly, but a poet of Alexander’s time wrote to him the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">“If you see our king is fair,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent6">Fair the child of Syrian race,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">’Tis the hunt and meals of hare</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent6">Give him everlasting grace.”</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">And when one of his friends brought him these lines, he replied, it is said, in Greek verses to the following effect:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">“Since you think your king is fair,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Fool, by vulgar stories taught,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">I’m not angry—if you’re right.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">But I wish <span class="italic">you</span>’d eat a hare</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">And remove your ugly thought;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Cease to hate the fair with spite.”</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p></blockquote>
