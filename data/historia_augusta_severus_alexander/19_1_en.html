He would grant an audience to any except those whom persistent rumours charged with dishonesty, and he would always make inquiries concerning the absent. Finally, when his mother Mamaea and his wife Memmia,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL140_215_2a" id="target_note_LCL140_215_2a"><sup>2</sup></a> the daughter of Sulpicius, a man of consular rank, and the granddaughter of Catulus, would often upbraid him for excessive informality, saying, “You have made your rule too gentle and the authority of the empire less respected,” he would reply, “Yes, but I have made it more secure and more lasting.” In short, he never allowed a day to pass without doing some kind, some generous, or some righteous deed, and yet he never ruined the public treasury.</p>
