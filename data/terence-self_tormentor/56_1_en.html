</span> It’s done. Don’t you get mixed up in this. Nobody is accusing
you, Syrus. You don’t need to find an altar<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL022_291_66" id="target_note_LCL022_291_66">

</span> I’m not furious with you, nor (<span class="italic">turning to Clitipho</span>) with
you; and you shouldn’t be furious with me for what I’m
doing. (<span class="italic">he goes into his house</span>)</p></div>

</span> Has he gone? Blast! I wanted to ask him—</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">clit</span>
</span> What?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">

</span> Where I should find some food, seeing that he’s disowned
us. I gather there’s some for you at your sister’s.</p></div>

</span> To think that it should get to the stage where I’m even in

<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">clit</span>
</span> What hope?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">syr</span>
</span> Of enjoying a fair amount of hunger.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">clit</span>
</span> Can you joke at a time like this? Can’t you give me some
helpful advice?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">syr</span>
</span> I can indeed. I’m working on it now and have been all the
time that your father was talking. And as far as I can
see—</p></div>

<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">syr</span>
</span> It’s this. I don’t think you’re their son.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">clit</span>
</span> What are you saying, Syrus? Are you in your right mind?</p></div>

<span class="sc">syr</span>
</span> I’ll tell you what’s occurred to me; you can decide for
