</span> In heaven’s name, my dear Antiphila, I congratulate you
and I judge you fortunate, in that you have made it your
concern to see that your character matches your beauty.
And, as heaven is my witness, I’m not at all surprised, if
everyone wants you for himself. For me your conversation
has been an indication of your true nature. And now,
when I ponder your life and the lives of all of you who
shun common lovers, I don’t wonder you’re the way you
are and we aren’t. It’s in your interest to be good, but our
clients don’t allow us to. Lovers cultivate us because they
are attracted by our beauty; once that’s faded, they take
their affections elsewhere; and, unless we have meanwhile
made some provision for the future, we’re left to
live on our own. With you, on the other hand, once you
have decided to live your life with the one man whose
character is most compatible with yours, they devote
themselves to you. In this happy relationship each is truly
bound to the other, so that no disaster can ever befall
your love.</p></div>
