</span> Don’t ask. See that they take everything they brought
here with them. (<span class="italic">Dromo goes into Chremes’ house</span>) The
old man will expect his expenses to be reduced by their
departure. Little does he know, believe me, how much
loss that little gain will bring. (<span class="italic">Dromo reappears with

Menedemus’ sake that so much trouble has come his
way. Fancy feeding that woman with all her household!
Still, I’m sure he won’t notice it for some days, he’s been
missing his son so much. But when he sees the expense
mounting up in his house day after day and no end to it,
he’ll be wishing his son would go away again. (<span class="italic">seeing

Clinia must also enter Menedemus’ house at this point, after which he plays no further part in the play; it is surprising that Terence does not make more of his return home and his reconciliation with his father.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL022_263_52').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
