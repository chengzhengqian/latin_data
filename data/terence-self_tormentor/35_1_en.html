First of all, if you’d really intended to carry out my
orders, the girl should have been done away with; you
shouldn’t have pretended she was dead while in fact
giving her the hope of life. But I pass that by. It was pity,
maternal feeling: I accept that. But consider how little
thought you took for the consequences of your plan. The
fact is, you put your daughter totally at the mercy of the
old woman, so that, as far as you were concerned, she
could earn her living on the streets or be sold on the open
market. I suppose you thought “Anything will do, so long
as she lives.” What can you do with people who have no
sense of justice or of what is right and proper? Better or
worse, helpful or harmful, they can see nothing but what
they want to see.</p></div>

</span> My dear Chremes, I’ve done wrong, I admit it, I submit.
But now I beseech you, my dear husband, as you are inclined
to be forgiving by nature, let my folly find some
refuge in your sense of justice.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">

</span> I suppose I’ll forgive you what you have done, Sostrata,
though my generosity in many ways sends you the wrong
message. But, whatever it is, tell me the reason why you
brought up the subject.</p></div>

</span> Foolish and desperately superstitious as we mothers all
are, when I gave the woman the girl to expose, I took a
ring from my finger and told her to expose it with her, so
that, if she died, she would at least have some share in our
possessions.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">chr</span>
</span> Fair enough. That was a safeguard both for yourself and
for her.</p></div>
