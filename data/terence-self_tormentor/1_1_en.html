<p class="noindent">Some of you may be wondering why the playwright has given to
an old man<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL022_181_6" id="target_note_LCL022_181_6">

</a> a role usually reserved for the young. I will explain
that first, and then deliver the speech I have come to deliver.
Today I am about to perform a fresh comedy from a fresh Greek
play, “The Self-Tormentor,” a double play based on a single
plot.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL022_181_7" id="target_note_LCL022_181_7">

</a> I have revealed that it is a new play and given you its
name; I would tell you who wrote it and the author of the Greek
original, but I judge that most of you know this already.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL022_181_8" id="target_note_LCL022_181_8">

</p>
<p>Now I will explain briefly why I have taken on this role. The
playwright wanted me as an advocate, not as a prologue
speaker. He has turned this into a court, with me to act on his
behalf. I only hope that the eloquence of the actor can do justice
to the aptness of the arguments which the writer of this
speech has contrived to put together.</p>
<p>Malicious people have spread rumours to the effect that the
 playwright has contaminated<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL022_181_9" id="target_note_LCL022_181_9">

</a> many Greek plays while creating
few Latin ones. He does not deny that this is so; he does not regret</p>
