out so early in the morning or return home so late in the
evening that I don’t see you on your farm digging or
ploughing or carrying something. In short you never
slacken off or take any thought for yourself. I’m pretty
sure you’re not enjoying this way of life. “Well,” you may
say, “I’m not satisfied with the amount of work that’s
getting done here.” But if you spent the effort which you
spend on doing the work on putting <span class="italic">them</span> to work, you’d
be better off.</p></div>

</span> Chremes, do you have so much free time from your own
business that you concern yourself with other people’s
affairs when they have nothing to do with you?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">chr</span>
</span> I’m human, and I regard no human business as other
people’s. Take it as advice or, if you like, as a question. If
your behaviour’s right, I’ll follow your example; if not, I’ll
try to dissuade you.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">men</span>
</span> I need to behave this way; you do what you want to do.</p></div>

</span> Does anyone need to torment himself?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">men</span>
</span> Yes, I do.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">chr</span>
</span> If you’ve a problem, I’m sorry. But what’s wrong? Tell
me, how do you deserve such treatment?</p></div>

</span> Don’t weep. Whatever your trouble is, tell me all about it;
don’t keep it to yourself. Don’t be afraid; trust me, I say.
I’ll help you whether you need consolation or counsel or
money.</p></div>

</span> Do you really want to know?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">

</span> Yes, and I’ve explained why.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">men</span>
</span> I’ll tell you.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
