whom I would venture to reveal all my secrets, Clitipho.
In one case it’s my social standing which prevents it, in
another it’s shame at the deed: I don’t want to seem
vulgar or brash. You should realise that your friend feels
the same. It’s up to us to perceive when and where we
should leave him alone.</p></div>

Damn it!</p></div>

</span> Clitipho, were these my instructions? Is this how a respectable
well-behaved person should act?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">clit</span>
</span> Stop it, please!</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">

</span> (<span class="italic">ironically</span>) A fine thing to suggest!</p></div>

</span> Syrus, I’m ashamed.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">syr</span>
</span> I’m sure you are, and so you should be. I find it quite
annoying.</p></div>

<span class="sc">clit</span>
</span> For god’s sake, you’re destroying me.</p></div>

<span class="sc">syr</span>
</span> (<span class="italic">aside</span>) It’s all over. He’ll have given himself away before
I get the money. (<span class="italic">to Chremes</span>) Chremes, will you take
some advice from a foolish man like me?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">chr</span>
</span> What advice?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">syr</span>
</span> Tell him to go away somewhere.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">

</span> Go where?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">

a stroll.</p></div><notes></notes></section>
