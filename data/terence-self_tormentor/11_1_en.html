</span> (<span class="italic">to himself</span>) How unfair all fathers are in their judgment
of the young! They expect us to be born into old age right
from boyhood and to have no liking for what youth offers.
They control us on the basis of their own desires, their
present ones, not those they once had. If I ever have
a son, he’ll find me an easygoing father, believe me.
There’ll be times when misdeeds are looked into and
times when they’re overlooked. I won’t be like my own
father, who reveals what he thinks through the example
of somebody else. Damn it all! The escapades of his own
he recounts to me when he’s had a bit too much to drink!
But now he says, “Test in others what is going to be good
for yourself,” the cunning old blighter! He doesn’t realise
that with me he’s telling tales to the deaf,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL022_201_26" id="target_note_LCL022_201_26">

</a> believe me. At
the moment I’m more troubled by what my mistress says:
“give me this” and “bring me that.” I’ve no way of responding,
and no one’s more miserable than me. Clinia
here, although he too has his hands full with his affair,
at least has a girl brought up in purity and innocence,
ignorant of the wiles of courtesans. Mine is a strong-willed,
demanding, arrogant, expensive, high and mighty
creature. As for giving her gifts, it’s a case of “yes, of
course”; I haven’t the nerve to to tell her that I haven’t a
thing. I’ve only got myself into this situation recently, and
my father still doesn’t know about it.</p></div>
