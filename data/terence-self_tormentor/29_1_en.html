</span> I’ve never heard the master say anything so welcome,
and there’s never been a time when I believed I could
misbehave with less fear of punishment. (<span class="italic">there is a noise

this, Clitipho? Is this the proper way to act?</p></div>

</span> With my own eyes, so don’t deny it. You’re doing Clinia a
terrible injustice in not keeping your hands to yourself. It
really is outrageous to invite a friend to your house and
then fondle his mistress. For instance, yesterday when
you were drunk how shameless you were—</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">syr</span>
</span> (<span class="italic">aside</span>) It’s true.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">chr</span>
</span> —and how disagreeable. Heaven knows how afraid I
was of what would happen in the end! I understand how
lovers feel. They get very upset at things you wouldn’t
imagine.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">clit</span>

<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">

</span> All right. But at least take yourself off somewhere out of
their sight for a while. Lovers have their desires, but they
can’t indulge themselves with you around. I’m talking</p></div><notes></notes></section>
