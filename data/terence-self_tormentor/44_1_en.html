</span> But I’m not giving him my daughter. I’m not agreeing to
an engagement.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">syr</span>
</span> No? Why not?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">chr</span>
</span> Why not? Need you ask? To a man who—?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">syr</span>
</span> (<span class="italic">unperturbed</span>) As you like. I wasn’t suggesting that you
should give her to him permanently, but just pretend.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">chr</span>
</span> Pretence is not my way. You do your stirring but keep me
out of the pot. Engage her to a man I don’t intend to
marry her to?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">syr</span>
</span> I thought you might.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">chr</span>
</span> Certainly not.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">syr</span>
</span> It could have been managed quite cleverly. I only suggested
it because you urged it so strongly just now.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">chr</span>
</span> (<span class="italic">ironically</span>). I’m sure.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">syr</span>
</span> However, I do see, Chremes, that your attitude is right
and proper.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">chr</span>
</span> Admittedly, I am very keen that you should bring it off,
but in some other way.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">syr</span>
</span> All right. I’ll have to find something else. But about the
money which I said the woman owes to Bacchis: it does
need to be repaid now. You’re not of course going to
resort to arguments like “What’s it to do with me? Was
it given to me? Did I authorise it? Could she give my
daughter as a security without my permission?” It’s true
what they say, Chremes: “More law, less justice.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL022_267_53" id="target_note_LCL022_267_53">
