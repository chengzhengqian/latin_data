</span> Go for a stroll? Where?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">syr</span>
</span> Huh! As if there was a shortage of places! Go this way,
that way, any way.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">chr</span>
</span> He’s right. It’s a good idea.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">clit</span>
</span> May the gods utterly destroy you, Syrus, for pushing me
out of here. (<span class="italic">he goes off unwillingly to the left</span>)</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">syr</span>
</span> (<span class="italic">shouting after him</span>) You keep your hands to yourself in
future, for heaven’s sake. (<span class="italic">to Chremes</span>) Do you really
think it’s a good idea? What do you suppose will become
of him, Chremes, if you don’t watch him, rebuke him, admonish
him with all the power the gods give you?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">chr</span>
</span> I’ll see to it.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">syr</span>
</span> But you need to watch him now, master.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">chr</span>
</span> It will be done.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">syr</span>
</span> It will, if you’re wise. He takes less and less notice of me
these days.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">chr</span>
</span> But what about you? Have you done anything about that
business I was discussing with you just now, Syrus? Have
you found one that appeals to you or not?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">syr</span>
</span> You’re talking about a trick? I do have one. I’ve just
thought of it.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">chr</span>
</span> Good for you! Tell me, what is it?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">syr</span>
</span> I’ll tell you, but first things first.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">chr</span>
</span> What do you mean, Syrus?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">syr</span>
</span> That courtesan is a wicked woman.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">chr</span>
</span> So it seems.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">syr</span>
</span> If only you knew! Huh! Just look what she’s up to now!
There was an old woman here from Corinth, to whom
she’d given a thousand silver drachmas as a loan.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">chr</span>
</span> What of it?</p></div><notes></notes></section>
