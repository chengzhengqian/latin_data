</span> It sounds plausible.</p></div>

</span> Do you reckon it’s this misbehaviour of yours that has
made him angry?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">clit</span>
</span> I don’t think so.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">syr</span>
</span> Here’s another point to consider. All mothers tend to
stand by their sons when they misbehave and defend
them against their fathers’ ill-treatment. That’s not happening.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">clit</span>
</span> You’re right. So what shall I do now, Syrus?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">syr</span>
</span> Ask them about your suspicion, bring the thing out into
the open. If it’s not true, you’ll get instant sympathy from
both of them; or else you’ll find out whose son you are.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">

</span> Good advice. I’ll follow it. (<span class="italic">he goes into Chremes’ house </span>)</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">syr</span>
</span> (<span class="italic">to himself</span>f)That was a pretty good idea that occurred to
me. The more genuine his suspicion is, the more easily
he’ll make peace with his father on his own terms. And,
for all I know, he’ll get himself a wife. But there’ll be no
thanks for Syrus! (<span class="italic">as Chremes’ door opens</span>) But what’s
this? The old man’s coming out. I’m off. After what’s happened
so far, I’m amazed he hasn’t had me arrested on
the spot. I’ll go to Menedemus here, and get him to plead
for me. I don’t trust our old man a bit. (<span class="italic">he exits into
Menedemus’ house, leaving the stage empty</span>)</p></div>
