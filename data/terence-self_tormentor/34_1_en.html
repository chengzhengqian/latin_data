Female babies were particularly at risk for the economic reason that they would need to be provided. with a dowry when they married. If the father was unwilling to raise the
child, the mother might, as here and often elsewhere in drama, give the
baby to someone else to expose, in the hope that it might in fact be
spared and one day be recognised through a ring or other token which
was given with it.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL022_247_45a').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
