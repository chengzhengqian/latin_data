</span> Inside? I’ll say she is! I’ve provided one dinner for her
and her retinue; if I had to do it again, I’d be bankrupt. To
say nothing of the rest, how much wine she wasted just by
spitting it out! “This is so-so, this is rough, father,” she
says. “See if you’ve a smoother one, if you don’t mind.” I
opened all my casks and jars;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL022_227_32" id="target_note_LCL022_227_32">

</a> I had all my slaves running
around. And this was just one night! What do you think
will become of you when they’re eating you out of house
and home on a regular basis? As heaven is my witness,
Menedemus, I pity your plight.</p></div>

</span> Anything rather than what you are proposing. Contrive
to give it through somebody else; let yourself be deceived
by your slave’s wiles. I’ve an inkling, though, that they’re
already at it, that they’re plotting secretly among themselves.
Syrus is whispering with that slave of yours, and
they’re reporting their plans to the young men. It’s better
for you to lose a talent this way than a mina the other.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL022_227_33" id="target_note_LCL022_227_33">
