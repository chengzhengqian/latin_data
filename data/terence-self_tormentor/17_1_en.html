So choose which of the two alternatives you prefer. I’m
sure though that the plan I’ve conceived is the right
one—and it’s safe. It gives you the means to enjoy your
mistress’s company in your father’s house without any
worry. And I’ll find the money you promised her in this
same way—something you’ve deafened me with your
pleas to achieve. What else do you want?</p></div>
