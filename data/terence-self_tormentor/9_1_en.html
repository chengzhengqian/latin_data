</span> Well.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">clit</span>
</span> You know he has a son?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">chr</span>
</span> I’ve heard he’s in Asia.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">clit</span>
</span> He’s not, father; he’s at our house.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">chr</span>
</span> What are you saying?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">clit</span>
</span> When he arrived, as soon as he disembarked from the
ship, I brought him here to dinner. We’ve always been
good friends right from boyhood.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">chr</span>
</span> This is splendid news. If only I’d pressed my invitation to
Menedemus to join us a bit harder! I could have been the
first to present him with this unexpected joyful news in
my own home. And there’s still time.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">clit</span>
</span> Don’t do it, father. It’s not a good idea.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">chr</span>
</span> How so?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">clit</span>
</span> Because it’s still unclear what he’s going to do with
himself. He’s only just arrived, he’s apprehensive about
everything—his father’s anger and how his girl friend
feels towards him. He’s desperately in love with her. It
was because of her that this trouble arose and he left
home.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">chr</span>
</span> I know.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">clit</span>
</span> Now he’s sent his slave into town<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL022_197_25" id="target_note_LCL022_197_25">

</a> to fetch her, and I’ve
sent our Syrus along with him.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">chr</span>
</span> What does he have to say himself?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">clit</span>
</span> Him? That he’s miserable.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">chr</span>
</span> Miserable? Can you imagine anyone less miserable?
What does he lack of the so-called blessings of human</p></div><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL022_197_25"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL022_197_25" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">25</sup>Namely, Athens.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL022_197_25').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
