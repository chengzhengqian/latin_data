to give it to the lad at the least risk. If once he realises
your feelings—that you would rather sacrifice your life
and all your money than lose your son—wow, what a window
you’ll have opened up for debauchery, and you won’t
get much pleasure from life in the future! We’re all worse
when there are no restraints. Everyone wants whatever
comes into his head; he doesn’t weigh whether it is good
or bad, he goes after it. You won’t be able to endure the
loss of your money <span class="italic">and</span> your son. But if you refuse to give
him it, he’ll immediately go where he knows he has you at
his mercy: he’ll threaten to leave home on the spot.</p></div>

</span> I’ll see to it. I’ve a little business to do first. Our neighbours
Simus and Crito here are in dispute over their
boundaries, and they’ve named me as their arbitrator.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL022_229_34a" id="target_note_LCL022_229_34a">

I’ll go and tell them that I can’t attend to their affairs
today as I promised. I’ll be back straightaway.</p></div><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL022_229_34a"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL022_229_34a" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">34</sup>It was normal practice in Athenian law for disputes between citi- zens to be settled by an arbitrator.
