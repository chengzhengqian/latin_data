</span> (<span class="italic">to himself</span>) Ah! My dear Antiphila, it was you and you
alone who brought me back to my homeland. While I was
away from you, all the hardships I endured were light
compared with the fact that I had to do without you.</p></div>

</span> (<span class="italic">to Syrus</span>) Syrus, I can hardly bear it. Poor me, to think
that I’m not permitted to enjoy her lovely nature in my
own way!</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">syr</span>
</span> No. And, as I understand your father’s attitude, he’ll be
giving you a hard part to play for some time.</p></div>

</span> My darling, what’s the matter?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">

</span> What’s come over you, Antiphila?</p></div>

</span> (<span class="italic">stepping forward and embracing her</span>) Am I really holding
you, Antiphila? I’ve longed for you with all my heart.</p></div>

some time. (<span class="italic">they all exit into Chremes’ house, leaving the
