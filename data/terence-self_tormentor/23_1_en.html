<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">

</span> My son Clinia has come back?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">chr</span>
</span> That’s what I said.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">

</span> Let’s go. Take me to him, I beseech you.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">chr</span>
</span> He doesn’t want you to know yet that he’s back. He’s
keeping out of your sight. He’s afraid that your old severity
towards him because of his misbehaviour may now
have increased.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">men</span>
</span> Didn’t you tell him how I feel?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">chr</span>
</span> No.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">men</span>
</span> Why not, Chremes?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">chr</span>
</span> Because you are acting very much against your own interests
and his, if you let him see that you’ve given in and are
taking a lenient view.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">men</span>
</span> I can’t do it. I’ve had enough of being a severe father,
quite enough.</p></div>

</span> Ah! You go to extremes in one direction or the other,
Menedemus, either too much generosity or too much
meanness. You’ll fall into the same pitfall one way or the
other. Previously, instead of allowing your son to visit a
girl who was then content with very little and took everything
as a favour, you frightened him away from home.
After that she was compelled against her will to make a
living on the streets. Now, when she can’t be had without
a great deal of expense, you’re willing to give him whatever
he wants. If you want to know quite how well
equipped she is to ruin you, she’s brought more than ten</p></div><notes></notes></section>
