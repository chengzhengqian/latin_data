wealth? And yet what these things are depends on
the attitude of the man who possesses them; they’re good
for those who know how to enjoy them, bad for those who
don’t enjoy them properly.</p></div>

</span> There’s more to it than that. The old man was always
bullying him, and what I most fear now is that he’ll lose
his temper and overreact, father.</p></div>

</span> Him? (<span class="italic">aside</span>) But I must restrain myself. It’s in his interest
for his son to be afraid of him.</p></div>

</span> What are you saying to yourself?</p></div>

</span> I’ll tell you. Whatever the situation, the boy should have
stayed at home. Perhaps his father was a bit too harsh for
his liking. He should have put up with it. Who was he going
to bear with if he couldn’t bear with his own father?
Should we expect the son to live by the father’s rules or
the father by the son’s? He accuses his father of being
strict, but it’s not so. The restrictions parents impose are
nearly all of the same kind, if they’re at all reasonable
people. They don’t like continuous chasing after girls,
they don’t like continuous drinking parties, and they
keep their sons short of money. But, after all, the intention
of all this is to preserve their morals; once a character’s
in the grip of base desires, Clitipho, it’s inevitable
that it will continue down the same path. The smart thing
is to test on others what is going to be good for yourself.</p></div>

</span> (<span class="italic">totally unconvinced</span>) I suppose so.</p></div>

</span> I’ll go inside and see what’s for dinner. As for you, seeing
what time of day it is, please make sure you don’t go too
far away. (<span class="italic">he goes into his house, leaving Clitipho onstage alone</span>)</p></div><notes></notes></section>
