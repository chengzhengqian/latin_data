</span> You can be sure I will. Things have reached the point
where there’s no choice.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">

</span> You’re a true friend, Clinia.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">clin</span>
</span> But make sure <span class="italic">she</span> doesn’t give the game away.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">syr</span>
</span> She’s been well schooled.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">clit</span>
</span> I can’t imagine how you were able to persuade her so
easily, when you consider what lovers she scorns.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">syr</span>
</span> I caught her at just the right time, which is the most
important thing. I found a soldier with her begging her
desperately for a night. She was treating him with all her
skill, inflaming his desires by denying them and at the
same time looking to maximise your gratitude. But listen,
please make sure you don’t spoil everything by being
careless. You know how keen-scented your father is for
this sort of thing; and I know how headstrong you can
be. None of your double meanings, side glances, sighs,
throat clearing, coughs, laughs.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">clit</span>
</span> You’ll congratulate me.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">syr</span>
</span> Please make sure.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">clit</span>
</span> Even you will be amazed.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">syr</span>
</span> (<span class="italic">looking down the street</span>) But how quickly the women
have caught up!</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">clit</span>
</span> (<span class="italic">making to go to meet them</span>) Where are they? (<span class="italic">as Syrus
restrains him</span>) Why are you holding me back?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">syr</span>
</span> She’s not your girl any more.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">clit</span>
</span> I know, in my father’s house. But now, in the meantime—</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">syr</span>
</span> It makes no difference.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">clit</span>
</span> Let me.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">syr</span>
</span> I won’t, I say.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">clit</span>
</span> Just for a little, please.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">syr</span>
</span> I forbid you.</p></div><notes></notes></section>
