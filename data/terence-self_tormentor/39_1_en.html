</span> But there’s nothing more likely to ruin my marriage,
Syrus. How am I going to face my father? Can you suggest
what I should say?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">syr</span>
</span> Of course.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">clin</span>
</span> What shall I say, then? What explanation shall I give?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">syr</span>
</span> I don’t want you to tell a lie. Tell him the plain facts of the
situation.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">clin</span>
</span> What are you saying?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">syr</span>
</span> I’m suggesting that you say that you are in love with
Antiphila and want to marry her, and that the other
woman belongs to Clitipho.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">clin</span>
</span> (<span class="italic">sarcastically</span>) That’s an absolutely fine and reasonable
suggestion—and easy enough to carry out. I suppose
you’ll also want me to persuade my father to keep this a
secret from your old man.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">syr</span>
</span> On the contrary, get him to tell the whole story straight
through from beginning to end.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">clin</span>
</span> What! Are you mad or drunk? You’ll utterly ruin Clitipho.
How will this put him on a safe footing, tell me?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">syr</span>
</span> I award my plan the first prize. I congratulate myself with
great pride on possessing so much power and being capable
of so much cunning that I can deceive both of them
by telling the truth. When your old man tells ours that
Bacchis is his son’s mistress, he still won’t believe it.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">clin</span>
</span> But that way you’re again taking from me all my hope of
marriage. So long as Chremes believes she’s <span class="italic">my</span> mistress,
he won’t trust me with his daughter. Perhaps you don’t
care much what happens to me so long as you look after
Clitipho’s interests.</p></div><notes></notes></section>
