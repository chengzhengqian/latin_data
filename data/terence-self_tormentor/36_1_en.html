</span> The young lass whom Bacchis brought with her—</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">syr</span>
</span> (<span class="italic">aside</span>) What!</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">chr</span>
</span> (<span class="italic">aside</span>) What is she saying?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">sos</span>
</span> She gave it to me to look after while she went for her
bath. I didn’t take any notice at first, but when I looked at
it I recognised it instantly and rushed out to find you.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">chr</span>
</span> So now what do you make of it? What have you discovered
about the girl?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">sos</span>
</span> I don’t know, though you could ask her where she got it, if
that can be established.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">syr</span>
</span> (<span class="italic">aside</span>) That’s me ruined! This is too hopeful for my
liking.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL022_251_46a" id="target_note_LCL022_251_46a">

</a> She’s one of the family, if this is true.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">chr</span>
</span> Is the woman you gave her to still alive?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">sos</span>
</span> I don’t know.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">chr</span>
</span> What did she report to you at the time?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">sos</span>
</span> That she’d done what I told her.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">chr</span>
</span> Tell me the woman’s name, so that we can make enquiries.</p></div>

</span> Philtera.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">syr</span>
</span> (<span class="italic">aside</span>) It’s her. It looks as if the girl’s saved and I’m lost.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">chr</span>
</span> Sostrata, follow me inside.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">sos</span>
</span> Things have turned out far better than I could have
hoped. How terribly afraid I was, Chremes, that you
would be as hardhearted now as you were then over
bringing up the girl!</p></div>

</span> Often a man can’t be how he would like to be, if his circumstances
don’t allow it. Now my situation is such that
I’m eager for a daughter; then I wanted nothing less. (<span class="italic">he</span>
