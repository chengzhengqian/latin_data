<span class="sc">syr</span>
</span> You’re joking.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">chr</span>
</span> This is what he should have done, Syrus.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">syr</span>
</span> Hey, tell me, do you approve of slaves who deceive their
masters?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">chr</span>
</span> In the right circumstances, yes, I do.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">syr</span>
</span> And rightly so.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">chr</span>
</span> Because this is often the remedy for serious problems. In
his case (<span class="italic">pointing to Menedemus’ house</span>) his only son
would have stayed at home.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">syr</span>
</span> (<span class="italic">aside</span>) I don’t know whether he’s saying this seriously or
in jest, but I’ll take it as an invitation to enjoy myself.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">chr</span>
</span> And now what’s he waiting for, Syrus? For the son to go
away a second time because he can’t support the expense?
Isn’t he inventing some plot to use against the old
man?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">syr</span>
</span> He’s too slow-witted.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">chr</span>
</span> You should help him out, for the young lad’s sake.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">syr</span>
</span> I can do that easily if you give me the word. I’m pretty experienced
and I know how these things are done.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">chr</span>
</span> (<span class="italic">ironically</span>) So much the better, by god.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">syr</span>
</span> (<span class="italic">feigning hurt</span>) I’m not used to telling lies.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">chr</span>
</span> Get on with it then.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">syr</span>
</span> But listen, make sure you remember this conversation, if
by chance, human nature being what it is, it should so
happen some day that your son is in a similar situation.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">chr</span>
</span> The need won’t arise, I hope.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">syr</span>
</span> I hope so too, god knows, and I don’t raise the matter now
because I’ve noticed him up to anything. But if he does,
don’t. You see how old he is; and, believe me, Chremes, I
could handle you splendidly if the need arose.</p></div><notes></notes></section>
