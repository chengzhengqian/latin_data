clothes (I presume for the sake of the old lady who had
died), with no jewellery, dressed in fact like those who
dress to please themselves, her cheeks untouched by
women’s arts, her hair loose and flowing and tossed back
carelessly behind her head. Enough said!</p></div>

</span> The old woman was spinning the yarn. Apart from her
there was one young maid. She was weaving alongside,
dressed in rags, unkempt, filthy.</p></div>

</span> If this is true, Clinia, as I believe it is, who is luckier than
you? You heard the maid described as shabby and dirty?
It is a sure sign that the mistress is beyond reproach when
her go-betweens are so neglected. It’s standard practice
for those who seek access to the mistress to give presents
to the maid first.</p></div>

</span> (<span class="italic">to Syrus</span>) Go on, I beg you, and mind you don’t try to
earn my gratitude by falsifying the truth. What did she
say when you mentioned my name?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">syr</span>
</span> When we said that you had returned and were asking her
to come to you, she stopped her weaving at once and
covered her whole face with tears; anyone could see that
she had been longing for you.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">

</span> Heaven help me, I don’t know where I am for joy. I was so
afraid.</p></div><notes></notes></section>
