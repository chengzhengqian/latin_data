</span> (<span class="italic">going up to Clitipho</span>) Why are you blaming me, Clitipho?
Whatever I have done in this matter, I have done
out of consideration for you and your stupidity. When I
saw that you were being irresponsible, putting the pleasures
of the present first and taking no thought for the
future, I conceived a plan whereby you should neither be
in want nor be able to squander our assets. They should
have been yours in the first place, but, when you made it
impossible for me to give them to you, I had recourse
to your closest relative<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL022_289_65" id="target_note_LCL022_289_65">
<sup>65</sup>
</a> and entrusted them to him
for safekeeping. In him you will always find protection
against your own stupidity, Clitipho, and food and clothing,
and a roof over your head.</p></div>
