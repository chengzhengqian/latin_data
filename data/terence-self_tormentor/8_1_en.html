him. But, seeing what time of day it is, it’s time to remind
my neighbour Phania here to come over for dinner. I’ll go
and see if he’s at home. (<span class="italic">he disappears into Phania’s

need reminding. They say he’s been over at my place for
some time. I’m the one who’s keeping the guests waiting.

It is likely that in the Greek original there was a divine prologue (omitted by Terence) between Chremes’ disappearance and reappearance. It is also likely that Phania’s house was conceived of as situated somewhere offstage in the Greek version; this passage is the only reason for placing
it onstage in Terence.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL022_195_23a').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL022_195_24"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL022_195_24" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">24</sup>See <span class="italic">The Woman of Andros</span> note 40.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL022_195_24').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
