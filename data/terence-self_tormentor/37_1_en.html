</a> As for my hope about the money and my
thoughts of being able to deceive him, that’s come to
nothing. It will be a triumph if I can effect a withdrawal
with my flanks intact. It’s heartbreaking to have such a
tasty morsel snatched away so suddenly from my lips.
What shall I do? What plan can I devise? I need to think

this? Won’t achieve any more. Well this way, perhaps.
Can’t be done. No, it’s excellent. Hooray! I’ve got an
excellent plan. By god, I think I’ll get my hands on that
elusive money after all.</p></div>
