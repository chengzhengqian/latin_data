</span> It’s getting light. Why don’t I knock at my neighbour’s
door, so as to be the first to tell him that his son has returned?
I realise that this is not what the young man
wants. But when I see the poor father so tortured by his
son’s absence, how can I keep from him this unexpected
joy, when there is no danger to the son from the disclosure?
I can’t do it. I’ll help the old man as best I can. I see
my son standing by a friend and comrade and helping
him in his affairs; it’s only right that we old men too
should stick together.</p></div>

long for him and want him back.</p></div>
