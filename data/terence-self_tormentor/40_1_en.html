</span> Damn it all, do you suppose I intend to keep up this pretence
for ever? It’ll take me one day to get my hands on
the money. That’s it! No more!</p></div>

</span> Do you think that’s enough? Tell me, what happens if my

</span> Heaven knows it was pretty brash of Syrus to entice me

minas. But if he lets me down now, he can beg me to
come as often as he likes in the future, and he’ll be wasting
his time. Or else I’ll say I’ll come and fix a time, and
he’s bound to report back, and Clitipho will be on tenterhooks
of anticipation; and then I’ll let him down and not
come, Syrus will get a thrashing, and I’ll get my revenge.</p></div>
