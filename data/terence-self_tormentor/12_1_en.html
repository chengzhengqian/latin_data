</span> (<span class="italic">to himself</span>) If fortune looked kindly on my love affair, the
women would have been here long ago, I know. But I’m
afraid that she has been corrupted here in my absence.
There are lots of factors which combine to increase my
anxiety: the opportunity, the situation, her age, and that
wicked mother who has her under her thumb, who cares
for nothing but money.</p></div>

</span> Clinia!</p></div>

</span> Be careful. Somebody may come out of my father’s house
and see you here.</p></div>

<span class="sc">clin</span>
</span> I will. But I foresee trouble ahead, I promise you.</p></div>

<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">

</span> Don’t you realise that it’s some distance from here? And
you know how women are. While they’re making their
preparations and getting themselves going, a year goes
by.</p></div>
