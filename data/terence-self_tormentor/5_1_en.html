</span> I have a one and only son, a young lad. But why did I say,
have? Had, rather, Chremes; it’s not clear whether I have
one now or not.</p></div>

</span> I’ll tell you. There’s a penniless old woman here, an immigrant
from Corinth. My son fell desperately in love
with her daughter, and practically treated her as his wife.
All this unknown to me. When I found out, I didn’t handle
him humanely and with due regard to the feelings of a
lovesick lad, but harshly, as is the common way of fathers.
Day after day I would find fault with him: “What! Do you
expect to be allowed to carry on like this any longer while
your father’s alive? Treating a mistress practically as a
wife? If you believe that, you’re making a mistake. You
don’t know me, Clinia. I am willing for you to be called
my son only as long as your behaviour is worthy of you. If
it isn’t, I will devise some action against you which is worthy
of me. In fact, this is only happening because you
have time on your hands. When I was your age, I didn’t
spend my time on love affairs. I had no money, so I went
off to Asia and gained both wealth and glory on the
battlefield.” Finally matters came to a head. The poor lad
was worn down by hearing the same things emphasised</p></div><notes></notes></section>
