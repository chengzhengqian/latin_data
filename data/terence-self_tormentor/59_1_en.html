yours any time you like.</p></div>

</span> No. Something which will make it more credible: because
he’s similar in character. You’ll easily be able to
prove that he’s your son; he’s exactly similar to you. He
has every single one of your vices. And besides, no
woman could bear such a son but you. (<span class="italic">as Chremes’ door
opens</span>) But he’s coming out. What a solemn look! You can
make up your mind when you’ve seen how things are.</p></div>

</span> (<span class="italic">to Sostrata, solemnly</span>) If there was ever any time,
mother, when I was a source of pleasure to you, when you
both willingly called me your son, I implore you to remember
that time, have pity on me now in my plight, and
grant me what I ask and want: show me my true parents.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">sos</span>
</span> I implore you, my dear son, not to entertain the idea that
you are someone else’s son.</p></div>

</span> (<span class="italic">to Chremes</span>) Misery me, is that what you wanted, for
heaven’s sake? (<span class="italic">to Clitipho</span>) As I pray you’ll outlive him
and me, you are my son and his. And, if you love me, make
sure that I don’t ever again hear such a thing from you.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">chr</span>

<span class="sc">clit</span>
</span> What behaviour?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">chr</span>
</span> If you want to know, I’ll tell you. You’re a useless, good-for-
nothing, two-faced, profligate, debauched reprobate.
Believe that, and believe that you’re our son.</p></div>
