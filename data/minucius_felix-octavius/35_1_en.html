<p>gods. Isis, with her Cynocephalus and shaven priests, mourning, bewailing and searching for her lost son; her miserable votaries beating their breasts and mimicking the sorrows of the unhappy mother; then, when the stripling is found, Isis rejoices, her priests jump for joy, the Cynocephalus glories in his discovery; and, year by year, they cease not to lose what they find or to find what they lose. Is it not absurd either to mourn your object of worship, or to worship your object of mourning? Yet these old Egyptian rites have now found their way to Rome, so that you may play the fool to the swallow and sistrum of Isis, the scattered limbs, and the empty tomb of your Serapis or Osiris.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL250_383_a" id="target_note_LCL250_383_a"><sup>a</sup></a></p>

The cult of Isis, introduced after the Third Punic War, was officially recognized in 43 <span class="sc">b.c</span>. Isis was sister and wife of Osiris, who here seems confused with the infant Horus. Cynocephalus is the jackal-headed Anubis, who accompanied Isis in her quest for the remains of the murdered and dismembered Osiris. According to one version of the legend Isis, transformed to a twittering swallow, flew round and round the pillar that marked the grave of Osiris. Ostia was the first cradle and headquarters of the Italian worship of Isis: but at Rome Domitian built a temple to Isis, and also to Serapis; and Commodus participated in person in the Isis rites, wearing the linen vestment of votaries, with shaven head and carrying the effigy of Anubis. Dill, <span class="italic">Roman Soc.</span> pp. 560–584, gives a full description of the cult and ritual.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL250_383_a').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL250_383_b"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL250_383_b" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">b</sup>The myth of Persephone, daughter of Eleusinian Demeter (Ceres), was transferred to the primitive Libera of Italian worship.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL250_383_b').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL250_383_c"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL250_383_c" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">c</sup>According to the Cretan legend Jupiter, when rescued from his father Saturn, was suckled by the goat Amalthea.
