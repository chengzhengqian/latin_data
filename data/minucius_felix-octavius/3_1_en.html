<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span><p>The conversation brought us half-way from the town to the open beach. A gentle ripple, playing over<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> the verge of the sands, levelled them into a sort of promenade<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL250_319_aa" id="target_note_LCL250_319_aa"><sup>a</sup></a>: the sea, even where there is no breeze, is in constant movement, and drove shorewards not in white crested waves, but in curling ripples. Its vagaries were quite delightful, as we let it wet our soles at the water’s edge, as the advancing wave now played around our feet, and anon receded and withdrew, sucking back into itself. So we went on<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span> our quiet leisurely way, skirting the edge of the gently curving shore and beguiling the way with stories. Our stories were an account of Octavius’s adventures at sea. But when, engaged in talk, we had<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span> gone some distance, we turned back and retraversed our steps; and when we had reached the place where some boats, supported on oak planking, to save them from ground rot, were lying idle, we saw a party of boys competing eagerly in their game of throwing sherds into the sea. The game is to choose<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">6</span><span class="br"></span> from the shore a flat sherd, one smoothed by the friction of the waves, to catch hold of the sherd by the flat side, and then bending forward and stooping, to send it spinning as far as one can on the top of the waves, so that the missile either skims the surface of the sea and swims on its way, gliding forward with a gentle impulse; or else shaves the tops of the waves, glancing and jumping as it takes its successive leaps. The boy won, whose sherd went furthest, and made most hops.</p>
