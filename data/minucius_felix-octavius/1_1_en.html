As in thought I pondered and reflected over memories of my good and trusty comrade, Octavius, such an impression of sweetness and charm remained with me that I seemed somehow reliving in the past, rather than recalling to memory things over and done; so vividly did his image, though withdrawn from the eyes, remain imprinted on my heart and inmost sense. No wonder that on his departure so<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> excellent and saintly a man has left behind him a measureless sense of loss; the fact is that he cherished such warm affection for me that, both in our amusements and serious occupations, our wills were tuned to perfect concert, whether of likes or dislikes; you might have thought a single mind had been parted into two. Thus he was at once sole confidant<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span> of my affections, and my partner in wanderings from truth; and when, after the gloom had been dispelled, I was emerging from the depth of darkness into the light of wisdom and truth, he did not reject me as a companion, but—all honour to him—led the way. So, as my thoughts ranged over the whole period of<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span> our association and familiarity, my attention fastened above all else on that discourse of his, in which, by sheer weight of argument, he converted Caecilius, who was still immersed in superstitious vanities, to true religion.</p>
