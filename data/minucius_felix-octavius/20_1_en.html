break the force of my pleading by interpolating this weighty subject for debate; it is for Octavius to deal with my several points, whole and undiluted as they stand, and to refute them if he can.”</p>
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span><p>“Believe me,” said I, “what you object to was only meant as my contribution to the common stock, that in careful weighing of the scales our judgement might turn not upon frothy eloquence, but upon actual solid facts. But you shall have no reason to complain of further distraction; let us listen in complete silence to the reply our friend Januarius is burning to make.”</p>

<p>“To begin with, I must honestly say that our good Natalis’views have been so wavering and erratic, so vague and slipshod, as to raise a doubt whether his learning has led to confusion, or his vacillations been due to misunderstanding. For he wavered, from belief<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> in the gods, at one moment, to keeping the question open at another, so that the ambiguity of statement might make my own line of reply more ambiguous. But to friend Natalis, I will not, and do not, impute trickery. Disingenuity is alien to his simplicity. Rather he is like a man who does not know the right<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> way, when the road happens to fork off in several directions; and not knowing the way, he doubts and hesitates, and dare not choose one in particular, or approve all alike; so, with a man who has not any firm grasp on truth, any untrustworthy suspicion flung out is enough to shatter his own fluctuating ideas. It is<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span> no wonder that Caecilius finds himself tossed to and fro amid the waves and eddies of conflicting contra­dictions.
