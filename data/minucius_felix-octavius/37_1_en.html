<p>upon by our own studies and training, especially in the works of poets, who have had such fatal influence in injuring the cause of truth. Plato did quite right<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> in excluding Homer, however crowned with praise and honour, from his ideal Republic. For he above<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> all others in his <span class="italic">Iliad</span>, though half in jest, gave gods a place in the affairs and doings of men; he matched them as combatants; drew blood from Venus; chained up Mars, wounded him and put him to flight.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL250_387_a" id="target_note_LCL250_387_a"><sup>a</sup></a> He tells us how Briareus set Jupiter free to save him<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span> from being bound by the rest of the gods; and how, when he could not rescue his son Sarpedon from death, he wept showers of blood; and that under the spell of Venus’s girdle he mated with Juno his wife with more than usual ardour. In another poet<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span> Hercules clears out the cow dung, and Apollo tends the flocks for Admetus. Neptune built walls for Laomedon, and the luckless builder got no pay for his job. In another poet Jupiter’s thunderbolt is<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">6</span><span class="br"></span> forged on the anvil along with the arms of Aeneas, though heaven and thunderbolts and lightning existed long before Jupiter was born in Crete, and no Cyclops could have imitated the flames of genuine thunderbolts nor Jupiter have failed to fear them. Why should I mention Mars and Venus caught in<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">7</span><span class="br"></span> adultery, or Jupiter’s passion for Ganymedes, hallowed in Heaven? Such stories are but precedents and sanctions for men’s vices.</p>
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">8</span><span class="br"></span><p>“Choice figments and falsehoods of this kind corrupt the minds of boys; they grow up to full manhood with these fables sticking in their memory, and unhappily grow old in the same beliefs, though the truth is before their eyes if only they would look for it.</p>
