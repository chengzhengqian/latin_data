And<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> by that token King Jupiter himself makes solemn oath by the burning shores and the black ooze of Styx, with shuddering prescience dreading the punishment for him and his worshippers. And to these torments<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> there is neither bound nor end. The fire has skill to burn and to remake, to riddle and yet nourish, the limbs committed to it. As lightnings strike without consuming, and as the fires of Etna and Vesuvius, and volcanoes in other lands, burn on without exhaustion, so the penal fire does not undo those whom it burns, but feeds on the mangled fuel of bodies unconsumed.</p>
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span><p>“That those who know not God deserve their tortures, as impious and unrighteous, none but an atheist doubts; it is as culpable to ignore as to wrong the parent of all, and Lord of all. And although<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span> unacquaintance with God is sufficient reason for punishment, in the same way that knowledge avails for pardon, yet, if we Christians are compared with you, although in some cases our training falls short of yours, yet we shall be found on a much higher level than you. You forbid adultery, yet practise it;<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">6</span><span class="br"></span> we are born husbands for our wives alone; you punish crimes committed, with us the thought of crime is sin; you fear the voice of witnesses, we the sole voice of conscience which is ever at our side; and finally, the prisons are crowded to overflowing with your following and not a single Christian is there, except on charge of his religion, or as a renegade.</p>
