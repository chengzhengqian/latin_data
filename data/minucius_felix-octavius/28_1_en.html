Aristotle, in<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">9</span><span class="br"></span> varying terms, assigns a single power; one while speaking of mind, at another of the universe as God; and at another setting God above the universe. Theophrastus similarly varies, assigning the primacy now to the universe, now to a divine intelligence. Heraclides of Pontus, though in varying terms, ascribes to the universe divine intelligence.

Cleanthes discourses of the mind and soul of nature, or again of aether, or more often of reason, as God.
