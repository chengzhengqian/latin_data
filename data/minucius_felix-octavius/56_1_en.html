What does ‘Fate ’mean,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL250_425_a" id="target_note_LCL250_425_a"><sup>a</sup></a> but God’s ‘pronouncement’upon each one of us? With full foreknowledge of the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> factors contained, God determines his pronouncements in accordance with individual deserts and qualities. The rod is not laid upon the condition of birth, but the nature of disposition entails the chastisement. But enough of Fate for the moment; we reserve it for fuller and more complete discussion elsewhere.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL250_425_b" id="target_note_LCL250_425_b"><sup>b</sup></a></p>

Yet who can be poor, who is<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span> free from wants, who does not covet what is another’s, who is rich towards God? The poor man is he who, having much, craves for more. I will tell you how I<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span> look at it: no man can be so poor as he is at birth. Birds have no settled income, the cattle feed from day to day; these things are provided for us, and all these we possess, if we do not covet more. As on<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">6</span><span class="br"></span> the highroad he who walks lightest walks with most ease, so on the journey of life more happiness comes from lightening needs by poverty than from panting under a burden of wealth. Yet for a competence,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">7</span><span class="br"></span> put to good use, we may well ask God, and He who owns the whole may indulge us with a portion. We would rather despise wealth than hoard it; innocence comes first in our desires, patience in our intreaties; we would rather be good than prodigal.</p>
