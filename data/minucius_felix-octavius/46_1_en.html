abominations upon us. Indecencies of that kind may be countenanced, where modesty in any kind of sexual relation or exposure is unknown.

Pitiable indeed the man whose<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> hope is stayed upon a mortal man, with whose death all that he builds on comes to an end! True indeed<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span> that Egyptians choose a man for their worship; that they propitiate him and him alone; that they consult him on all matters and kill victims in his honour.
