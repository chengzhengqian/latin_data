to Rome. His children were put to death, his wife was murdered, his estates were confiscated, and his entire household utterly blotted out. All this, however, was done after news of the revolt of Albinus was received,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_443_1" id="target_note_LCL139_443_1"><sup>1</sup></a> for before that Niger’s children and their mother had merely been sent into exile. But Severus was exasperated by the second civil war, or rather the third,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_443_2" id="target_note_LCL139_443_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and became implacable; and it was then that he put countless senators to death<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_443_3" id="target_note_LCL139_443_3"><sup>3</sup></a> and got himself called by some the Punic Sulla, by others the Punic Marius.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_443_4" id="target_note_LCL139_443_4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>In stature Niger was tall, in appearance attractive; and his hair grew back in a graceful way toward the crown of his head. His voice was so penetrating that when he spoke in the open he could be heard a thousand paces away, if the wind were not against him. His countenance was dignified and always somewhat ruddy; his neck was so black that many men say that he was called Niger on this account. The rest of his body, however, was very white and he was inclined to be fat. He was fond of wine, sparing in his use of food, and as for intercourse with women, he abstained from it wholly save for the purpose of begetting children.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_443_5" id="target_note_LCL139_443_5"><sup>5</sup></a> Indeed, certain religious rites in Gaul, which they always by common consent vote to the most chaste to celebrate, Niger himself performed. On the rounded colonnade in the garden of Commodus he is to be seen pictured in the mosaic among Commodus’ most intimate friends and performing the rites of Isis.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_443_6" id="target_note_LCL139_443_6"><sup>6</sup></a> To these rites Commodus was so devoted as even to shave his head, carry the image of Anubis, and make every one of the ritualistic pauses in the procession.</p>
