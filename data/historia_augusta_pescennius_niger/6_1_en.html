reason Severus inveighs against his ambition, just as if he himself came to the throne young! For though he understated the number of his years, after ruling eighteen years he died at the age of eighty-nine.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_441_1" id="target_note_LCL139_441_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Now Severus dispatched Heraclitus to secure Bithynia and Fulvius to seize Niger’s adult children.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_441_2" id="target_note_LCL139_441_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Nevertheless, although he had already heard that Niger had seized the empire, and although he himself was on the point of setting out to remedy the situation in the East, he made no mention of Niger in the senate. In fact, on setting out, he did only<span class="marginNote right">July, 193.</span>
this—namely, send troops to Africa, fearing that Niger would seize it and thereby distress the Roman people with a famine.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_441_3" id="target_note_LCL139_441_3"><sup>3</sup></a> For such a plan was possible of accomplishment, it seemed, by way of Libya and Egypt, the provinces adjacent to Africa, for all that it was no easy journey either by land or sea. As for Pescennius,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_441_4" id="target_note_LCL139_441_4"><sup>4</sup></a> he slew a multitude of distinguished men and got control of Greece, Thrace, and Macedonia, while Severus was still on his way to the East. He then proposed to Severus that they two share the throne between them; whereupon Severus, because of the men whom Niger had slain, declared him and Aemilianus enemies to the state. Soon after, Niger gave battle under the leadership of Aemilianus and suffered defeat from Severus’ generals. Even then, Severus promised him safety in exile if he would lay down his arms. Niger, however, persisted and gave battle a second time, but was defeated<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_441_5" id="target_note_LCL139_441_5"><sup>5</sup></a>; and in his flight while near the lake at Cyzicus he was wounded and was thus brought before Severus, and presently he was dead.</p>
