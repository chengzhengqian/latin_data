<p class="noindent">And in this response it was clearly understood that Niger was meant by the Dark One, Severus by the African, and Albinus by the White One. Thereupon the curiosity of the questioners was aroused, and they asked who would really win the empire. To this the priest replied with further verses somewhat as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">“Both of the Black and the White shall the life-blood be shed all untimely;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Empire over the world shall be held by the native of</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent3">Carthage.”</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">And then when the priest was asked who should succeed this man, he gave answer, it is said, with another Greek verse:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">“He whom the dwellers above have called by the</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent3">surname of Pius.”</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">But this was altogether unintelligible until Bassianus took the name Antoninus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_449_1" id="target_note_LCL139_449_1"><sup>1</sup></a> which was Pius’ true surname. And when finally they asked how long he should rule, the priest is said to have replied in Greek as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">“Surely with twice ten ships he will cleave the</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent3">Italian waters,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_449_2" id="target_note_LCL139_449_2"><sup>2</sup></a></span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Only let one of his barques bound o’er the plain of</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent3">the sea.”</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">From this they perceived that Severus would round out twenty years.</p>
