<p>Prosperity awaits our empire; thy name is earnest for the fulfilment of our hopes. The past guarantees the future; each time that thy sire made thee chief magistrate of the year the laurels of victory crowned his arms. Once the Gruthungi, hewing down a forest to make them boats, dared to pass beyond the Danube. Three thousand vessels, each crowded with a barbarous crew, made a dash across the river. Odothaeus was their leader. Thy youth, nay, the first year of thy life, crushed the attempt of that formidable fleet. Its boats filled and sank; never did the fish of that northern river feed more lavishly on the bodies of men. The island of Peuce was heaped high with corpses. Scarce even through five mouths could the river rid itself of barbarian blood, and thy sire, owning thine influence, gave thanks to thee for the spoils won in person from King Odothaeus. Consul a second time thou didst end civil war by thine auspices. Let the world thank thee for the overthrow of the Gruthungi and the defeat of their king; thou wast consul when the Danube ran red with their blood, thou wast consul, too, when thy sire crossed the Alps to victory.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL135_333_2" id="target_note_LCL135_333_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>But thou, once author of thy father’s successes, shalt now be author of thine own. Triumph has ever attended thy consulship and victory thy fasces. </p><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL135_333_1"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL135_333_1" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">1</sup>A reference to the Roman method of manumitting a slave <span class="italic">alapa et festuca, i.e.</span> by giving him a slight blow (<span class="italic">alapa</span>) with a rod (<span class="italic">festuca</span>).
