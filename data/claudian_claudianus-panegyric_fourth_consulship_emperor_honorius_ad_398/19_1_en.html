<p>What wonder that the nations barring thy path should fall before thee, since the barbarian of his own choice now seeks to serve thee? The Sarmatae, ever a prey to internal strife, beg to swear allegiance to thee; the Geloni cast off their cloaks of hide and fight for thee; you, O Alans, have adopted the customs of Latium. As thou choosest for war men that are brave and eager for the fray, so thou choosest for the offices of peace men that are just, and once chosen keepest them long in their charge, not ousting them by ever new successors. We know the magistrates who govern us, and we enjoy the blessings of peace while we reap the advantages of war, as though we lived at one and the same time in the reign of warlike Romulus and peace-loving Numa. A sword is no longer hung over our heads; there are no massacres of the great; gone is the mob of false accusers; no melancholy exiles are driven from their fatherland. Unholy increase of perpetual taxes is at an end; there are no accursed lists,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL135_323_1" id="target_note_LCL135_323_1"><sup>1</sup></a> no auctions of plundered wealth; the voice of greed summons not the salesman, nor is thy treasury increased by private losses. Thou art liberal with thy money, yet not wasteful of it. The loyalty of thy soldiers is a lasting loyalty, for it is not bought, nor is it gifts that win their love; the army is anxious for the success of its own child and loves thee who wast its nursling.</p>
<p>And how deep is thy devotion to Rome herself! </p><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL135_323_1"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL135_323_1" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">1</sup><span class="italic">i.e</span>. lists of the proscribed and of their properties put up for sale.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL135_323_1').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
