<span class="sc">Through</span> the fields there went a river; down the</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">airy glen it wound,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Smiling mid its radiant pebbles, decked with flowery</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">plants around.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Dark-hued laurels waved above it close by myrtle</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">greeneries,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Gently swaying to the whispers and caresses of the</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">breeze.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Underneath grew velvet greensward with a wealth</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">of bloom for dower,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">And the ground, agleam with lilies, coloured ’neath</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">the saffron-flower,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">While the grove was full of fragrance and of breath</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">from violets.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Mid such guerdons of the spring-time, mid its</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">jewelled coronets,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Shone the queen of all the perfumes, Star that loveliest</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2"> colours shows,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Golden flame of fair Dione, passing every flower—the</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">rose.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Dewsprent trees rose firmly upright with the lush</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">grass at their feet:</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Here, as yonder, streamlets murmured tumbling from</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">each well-spring fleet.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Grottoes had an inner binding made of moss and</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">ivy green,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Where soft-flowing runlets glided with their drops of</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">crystal sheen.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
