<p>O Gold, whirled onward by dark hell and muddy rivers, wrested by the convict from cruel mines: gold, the bribe unbarring Pluto’s doors, and the delight of Proserpine, queen of the Stygian world! gold which invades the marriage-bower and shatters chastity, and at whose enticement the unholy sword often flashes from scabbard drawn! Was it not in golden stream that to Danaë’s lap there came the adulterer<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL434_561_a" id="target_note_LCL434_561_a">
<sup>a</sup>
</a> who masked his appearance in his bribe of yellow poison? Was not barbarous gold the motive when Polydorus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL434_561_b" id="target_note_LCL434_561_b">
<sup>b</sup>
</a> was slain by his host? Unhappy nurse, under what guardian against danger dost thou entrust a son? To whom dost thou commit children of royal line? Gold becomes protector of the boy, gold the guardian of the blood! Sooner will ruthless serpent guard nestlings, and lionesses be ready to save the whelps of a newly delivered dam. So too for Troy’s destruction by the young manhood of Greece the reason lay in gold . . . a bribe the worthiest recompense. At the price of infamous scandal the paramour sold his award.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL434_561_c" id="target_note_LCL434_561_c">
