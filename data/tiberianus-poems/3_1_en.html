<p>Let us then see for what uses gold doth serve. It is the buying-price of crime, it is the sale-price of kind modesty, of fatherland and parent, of laws and piety and faith: all guilt is hidden by gold, by gold all righteousness betrayed.

</a> O gold, thou murderous thing, thou frenzied madness and passionate greed, let muddy shallows and a stream’s dark silt conceal thee evermore; let earth below whelm and bury thee, let Tartarean Phlegethon and the Stygian pools covet thy birth for themselves!
