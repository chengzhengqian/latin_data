is of extremely great moment is often deemed to be <span class="innerMarginNote left">85</span>virtually necessary. Consequently as this class of cases consists in advising or dissuading, one who advises a certain course has available only a single line of advice—if the thing is both advantageous and feasible, do it; whereas the dissuader has available a double line—one, if the thing is not advantageous, do not do it, the other, if it is impossible, do not attempt it. Thus the adviser of a course has to prove both the conditions, whereas it is enough for the dissuader <span class="innerMarginNote left">86</span>to refute either one of them. Consequently inasmuch as all deliberation is occupied with these two considerations, let us first discuss that of advantage, which is concerned with distinguishing between good things and bad things. Good things are some of them necessary, for instance life, self-respect, freedom, and some not necessary, for instance children, wives, relations, parents.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL349_375_a" id="target_note_LCL349_375_a"><sup>a</sup></a> The latter fall into two classes: one, things desirable for their own sake, as the objects in the sphere of the duties and the virtues, the other, things such as wealth and resources, <span class="innerMarginNote left">87</span>that are means to something of value. But of things desired for their own sake some are desired on account of their intrinsic moral value and others on account of some advantage they confer: desired on account of their moral value are the objects discussed a little time before, which are praiseworthy for themselves; desired on account of some advantage are such among bodily goods and goods of fortune as are desirable. Of these some are in a manner combined with a certain moral value, for example honour, glory; while others are in a different class, for instance strength, beauty, health, fame, wealth, dependents.</p>
