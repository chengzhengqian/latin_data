The defendant for his part will put forward a protest against a trumped-up charge and a parade of suspicions and against the prosecutor’s plotting, and also will bring forward the danger to the community, and will try to arouse feelings of compassion and up to a point to attract the goodwill of the court. As to the narrative passage the prosecutor will make it a suspicious exposition of the business as transacted stage by stage, spreading out all his proofs and minimizing the lines of defence; whereas the defendant will have to pass over or else minimize the arguments for suspicion, and recount the issues <span class="innerMarginNote left">122</span>and incidents of the actual facts. In corroborating one’s own lines of argument and discounting those of one’s opponents, in the case of the prosecutor it will often be necessary to arouse emotion and in the case of the defendant to allay it. This indeed is specially the line to be taken by both parties in their concluding passage—the one by recapitulating his arguments and bringing them to a general focus, and the other, supposing he has fully dealt with the case by his line of defence, by a repetition of his successive refutations, closing with an appeal for compassion.</p>
