<p>C. <span class="sc">Jun</span>. How then do you explain these?</p>
<p>C.  <span class="sc">Sen</span>. I have a set of instructions adapted both for producing conviction and for exciting emotion. As a conviction is a firmly established opinion, while emotion is the excitement of the mind to either pleasure or annoyance or fear or desire—for there are all these kinds of emotion and each kind has several divisions—, I adapt the whole method of arrangement to the purpose of the inquiry; for the purpose of the statement is to convince, and that of the case is both to convince and to excite emotion. Consequently when I have dealt with the case, which contains the statement, I shall have spoken of them both.</p>

case?</p>
<p>C. <span class="sc">Sen</span>. I say that it varies according to the class of the audience. For a member of the audience is either merely a hearer or an arbitrator, <span class="italic">i.e.</span> an estimater of fact and opinion; consequently it must aim either at giving pleasure to the hearer or at causing him to make some decision. But he makes a decision either about things that are past, as a judge does, or about things in the future, as the senate does; so there are these three divisions, dealing with judgement, with deliberation and with embellishment; the latter has obtained its special name from the fact that it is particularly employed in panegyrics.</p>

<p><span class="innerMarginNote left">11</span>IV. C. <span class="sc">Jun</span>. What objects will the speaker put before him in the three kinds of style you mention?</p>
<p>C. <span class="sc">Sen</span>. In embellishment, he will aim at giving pleasure; in judgement, at arousing either severity or clemency in the judge; in persuasion, at inspiring either hope or alarm in a member of a deliberative body.</p>
