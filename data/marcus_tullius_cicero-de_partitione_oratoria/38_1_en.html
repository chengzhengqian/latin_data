<p>C. <span class="sc">Sen</span>. You are quite right. And the subject at which a speech of this kind aims is equity, which occasionally is envisaged not in simple form but by means of a comparison, as for example when the entire reliability of the prosecutor is enlarged upon, or when possession of an estate is sued for without the support of law or in the absence of a will; in these cases, the question is raised as to what is more, or most, equitable; and for these cases a ready supply of lines of argument is afforded by the topics deal­ing <span class="innerMarginNote left">99</span>with equity that will soon be discussed. And even before the trial begins there is usually a dispute about the institution of the trial itself, when the question is raised whether the party taking proceedings has the right to do so, or has the right to do so yet, or has now ceased to have it, or whether action is open to him under the law cited, or in the terms employed. And even if these questions have not been raised or decided or settled before the case comes into court, nevertheless they often carry very great weight during the actual proceedings, when the statement is advanced, ‘You have sued for an excessive amount,’ or ‘You have taken proceedings too late,’ or ‘The suit was not one for you to institute,’ or ‘I was not the party to be sued,’ or ‘not under this law,’ or ‘not in this form of words,’ <span class="innerMarginNote left">100</span>or ‘not before this court.’ This class of cases comes under the principles of civil law embodied in some enactment or precedent governing private affairs; and a knowledge of these principles although neglected by most pleaders appears to us to be indispensable
