qualities? The first is the question of reality—<span class="italic">e.g.</span> does justice exist in nature or is it merely a convention? The second one of definition—<span class="italic">e.g.</span> is justice the advantage of the majority? The third is a question of quality— <span class="italic">e.g.</span> is it advantageous to live justly or</p>
