<p>C. <span class="sc">Sen</span>. First, the speaker’s personal resources, second the speech, and third the question.</p>
<p>C. <span class="sc">Jun</span>. In what do the speaker’s personal resources consist?</p>
<p>C. <span class="sc">Sen</span>. In matter and in language. But both matter and language have to be found and have to be arranged—although the term ‘invention’ is used specially of the matter and ‘delivery’ of the language, but arrangement, though belonging to both, nevertheless is applied to invention. With delivery go voice, gesture, facial expression and general bearing, and all of these are in the keeping of memory.</p>
<p><span class="innerMarginNote left">4</span>C. <span class="sc">Jun</span>. Next the speech—into how many parts does it fall?</p>
<p>C. <span class="sc">Sen</span>. Four parts. Two of them, the statement of the facts and the proof, serve to establish the case, and two, the exordium and the peroration, to influence the mind of the audience.</p>
