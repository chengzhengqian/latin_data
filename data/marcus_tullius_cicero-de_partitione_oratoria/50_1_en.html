what follows, because the term concerning the prosecutor is customarily applied to the judge<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL349_409_a" id="target_note_LCL349_409_a"><sup>a</sup></a>; and from the word itself, which means a person who appears to be placed all askew in contrary cases. But nevertheless even the defendant himself has to have recourse to points of equity, to the authority of previous judgements, and to the desirability of bringing the issue to some conclusion; and a rule common to both parties should be that after each has done his best to produce a definition in conformity with the usual sense and signification of the term, he should then support his definition and interpretation by means of parallels and instances of persons who have used the term in <span class="innerMarginNote left">127</span>that way. Also the prosecutor in this class of cases must employ the common topic that it is quite unpermissible for the person who admits the fact to defend himself by interpreting the meaning of a word; whereas the defendant must rely on the plea of equity that I have put forward, and must complain that though equity is on his side he is being met not with fact but with the perversion of a word. Under this head he will be able to run through most of the topics of investigation; for parallels and contraries and consequences, though employed by both sides, will be more frequently employed by the defendant, <span class="innerMarginNote left">128</span>if his case is not to fall absolutely flat. The means available for amplification, which they will desire to employ either when making a digression from the case in hand or in .the peroration, will be selected from those that were set out previously, for the purpose of exciting either hatred or pity or any other emotion in the minds of the judges, provided that the importance of the facts or either the unpopularity or the eminence of the persons so demands.</p>
