<p><span class="innerMarginNote left">1</span>I. <span class="sc">Cicero Junior</span>. Father, I should like you to give<span class="marginNote right">Introduction.</span>
me in Latin the information that you have imparted to me in Greek about the theory of rhetoricâ€”that is if you are at leisure, and if you wish to do so.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Cicero</span> <span class="sc">Senior</span>. Is there anything, my boy, that I could wish more than that you should be as accomplished a scholar as possible? And, as for leisure, in the first place I have plenty of that now that I have at last obtained an opportunity of going out of town; and in the second place, I would gladly give your oratorical studies precedence over even the most important engagements of my own.</p>
<p><span class="innerMarginNote left">2</span>C. <span class="sc">Jun</span>. Well then, are you agreeable to my adopting your method, and putting to you a series of questions in Latin about the same subjects as you examine me upon in Greek?</p>
<p>C. <span class="sc">Sen</span>. By all means if you like, as that procedure will enable me to see that you have remembered your previous lesson, and you will be able to obtain information on the points you raise <span class="italic">seriatim.</span></p>
<p><span class="innerMarginNote left">3</span>C. <span class="sc">Jun</span>. Into how many parts ought the theory<span class="marginNote right">Theory of Rhetoric: three divisions, with subdivisions.</span>
of rhetoric as a whole to be divided?</p>
<p>C. <span class="sc">Sen</span>. Three.</p>
<p>C. <span class="sc">Jun</span>. Pray tell me what they are.</p>
