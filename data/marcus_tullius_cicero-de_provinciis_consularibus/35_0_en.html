successors to Caesar. The consul (L. Marcius Philippus) has just interrupted me by saying that I have more reason for animosity against Caesar than against Gabinius, who when consul merely carried out Caesar’s orders in banishing me. But I am now guided by the welfare of the State rather than by private grievances, as was Ti. Gracchus, father of the tribunes, when he came to the help of P. and L. Cornelius Scipio, and as were M. Crassus, M. Scaurus and the Metelli in their support of Marius. Caesar has brought the war in Gaul almost to an end. He who began the war ought to be allowed to finish it. If Caesar is superseded, the smouldering embers of war may burst out into flame. Many precedents from our history urge me to lay aside personal enmity for the sake of the State: the reconciliations of M. Aemilius Lepidus and M. Fulvius Nobilior; of L. Marcius Philippus and the Senate; of the two brothers, M. and L. Lucullus with P. Servilius Vatia: and, most recently, of Q. Metellus Nepos and myself. My own old and unfailing loyalty to the State reinstates me as Caesar’s friend.</p>
<p>§§ 24–28. Although Caesar and I have had differences of opinion, I can never be the enemy of one who has served the State so well. In fact I have followed the example of the Senate in my relations with Caesar: your disapproval of his policy found me also disapproving; your changed attitude towards him, induced by his great deeds, has evoked my own warm approval. In fact I have already been reconciled with him, for I proposed a <span class="italic">supplicatio</span> of fifteen days in honour of his victories in Gaul, and I have recently supported proposals for the appointment of <span class="italic">decem legati</span> and for pay for his troops.</p>
