temple was there in Achaia, what place or holy grove throughout all Greece<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL447_549_a" id="target_note_LCL447_549_a"><sup>a</sup></a> so sacred, that any image of the Gods or a single ornament remains in it? You bought from an infamous tribune of the commons, at a time when our city was made shipwreck,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL447_549_b" id="target_note_LCL447_549_b"><sup>b</sup></a> ruined by you who should have been at the helm—then, I say, you bought from him for a large sum of money the right of administering justice over free states in matters of debt<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL447_549_c" id="target_note_LCL447_549_c"><sup>c</sup></a> contrary to decrees of the Senate and a law of your son-in-law.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL447_549_da" id="target_note_LCL447_549_da"><sup>d</sup></a> The right you had bought you sold, either by denial of justice, or by ejecting Roman citizens from their property. However,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">8</span><span class="br"></span>
when I mention these things, Conscript Fathers, I am not attacking the man himself; I am discussing the province. And so I pass over all those matters, which you have often heard and remember well even if you should not be reminded—I say nothing about his effrontery in the city,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL447_549_e" id="target_note_LCL447_549_e"><sup>e</sup></a> which he imprinted deep in your minds and vision while he lived among you; I make no comment on his pride, his insolence, his cruelty. Close hidden be all those deeds of lust and darkness which he sought to conceal by a stern and lofty look,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL447_549_f" id="target_note_LCL447_549_f"><sup>f</sup></a> not by modesty and self-control; what is being done about the province, that is my subject. Will you not supersede him? Will you allow him to remain there any longer, a man whose fortunes, from the moment he entered his province, were so well matched with his villainies that no one could decide whether his conduct or his misfortune was the worse?</p>
