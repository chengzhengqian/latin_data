<p>§§ 29–35. You bore patiently with me when I spoke for these honours to Caesar, but you interrupt me now when I am seeking not so much to pay compliments to Caesar as to serve the public interest. Caesar is kept in Gaul not from any attachment to life there nor from fear of a return to Rome where, surely, he would be acclaimed, but from a sense of duty: he wishes to complete his great task. Now that Pompey has subdued the East, in Gaul alone within our Empire is war afoot. Whereas once we were content to defend the frontiers only of Transalpine Gaul, and held in it only “a mere path,” the genius of Caesar is bringing the whole of Gaul into our possession. Italy no longer needs the Alps as a rampart. After one or two summers the whole of Gaul will be ours. But if Caesar’s work is left unfinished, Gallic power will revive. Even if Caesar wished to return to Italy, it is our duty to retain him in Gaul.</p>
<p>§§ 36–38. I cannot therefore support the proposal to deprive Caesar of Transalpine Gaul, a province to which he was appointed by decree of the Senate. Moreover, such a proposal is objectionable because it respects the <span class="italic">lex Vatinia</span>, no law at all, which conferred Cisalpine Gaul upon him. The proposal, however, to take away from him Cisalpine Gaul is less objectionable. For, so far from conflicting with the Vatinian Law, it provides that Caesar shall not be superseded till 1 March 54 <span class="sc">b.c.</span>, when his command under that law is due to expire. But it will cause a break in the consular <span class="italic">imperium</span>, for what will be the position during January and February 54 <span class="sc">b.c.</span> of the consul appointed to succeed Caesar in Cisalpine Gaul? Moreover, under either of these proposals Piso will remain proconsul in Macedonia.</p>
