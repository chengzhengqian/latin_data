some who do not love the man, there is no reason why they should recall him from his province; for that means to recall him to glory, to a triumph, to congratulations, to the highest honours the Senate can bestow, to the favour of the Equestrian Order, to the affection of the People. But if he is in no hurry<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">30</span><span class="br"></span> to enjoy such brilliant fortune, simply for the advantage of the State, so that he may finish all the work he has begun, what ought I, a senator, to do, who, even if he wished otherwise, should be bound to consult the interests of the State?</p>
<p>But as for myself, Conscript Fathers, I feel that to-day our assignment of the provinces should aim at the maintenance of a lasting peace. For who does not see that in all other quarters we are free from any danger and even from any suspicion of war? We<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">31</span><span class="br"></span> have long seen how those vast seas, whose unrest<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL447_577_a" id="target_note_LCL447_577_a"><sup>a</sup></a> endangered not only voyages but even cities and military roads, have become, thanks to the valour of Gnaeus Pompeius, from the Ocean to the farthest shores of Pontus, as it were one safe and closed harbour in the control of the Roman People; how, thanks also to Pompeius, of those peoples whose surging multitudes could sweep over our provinces, some have been cut off, others driven back; and how Asia,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL447_577_b" id="target_note_LCL447_577_b"><sup>b</sup></a> once the frontier of our power, is now itself bounded by three new provinces.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL447_577_ca" id="target_note_LCL447_577_ca"><sup>c</sup></a> I can speak of every region of the world, of every kind of enemies. There is no race which has not either been so utterly destroyed that it hardly exists, or so thoroughly subdued that it remains submissive, or so pacified<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL447_577_d" id="target_note_LCL447_577_d"><sup>d</sup></a> that it rejoices in our victory and rule.</p>
