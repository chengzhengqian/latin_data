for the first time doubled in length, for you sided with me, after dispatches from the same Pompeius had been read out, announcing the termination of all wars by land and sea, and awarded to him a thanksgiving for ten days. On this recent occasion, therefore, I admired the strength of mind and magnanimity of Gnaeus Pompeius,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL447_573_a" id="target_note_LCL447_573_a"><sup>a</sup></a> because, while he had been himself preferred to distinctions beyond all other men, he was for granting greater distinction to another than he himself had obtained. So then, about that public thanksgiving for which I voted, the thanksgiving itself was something duly offered to the Immortal Gods, the customs of our ancestors, and the advantage of the State, but the dignified language, the unexampled distinction, and the number of days were concessions to the merit and glory of Caesar himself. We have<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">28</span><span class="br"></span> lately had referred to us the question of pay for his troops.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL447_573_b" id="target_note_LCL447_573_b"><sup>b</sup></a> Not only did I vote for it, but I also did my utmost to make you do the same; I answered at length those who disagreed, I was one of those who were present to draft the resolution of the Senate.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL447_573_c" id="target_note_LCL447_573_c"><sup>c</sup></a> Then also I thought more of the man than of any kind of necessity. For I believed, that even without this help in money, he could maintain his army with the booty which he had previously won, and finish the war; but I certainly did not think that the lustre and glory of his triumph ought to be lessened by meanness on our part. A resolution was passed concerning ten legates.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL447_573_da" id="target_note_LCL447_573_da"><sup>d</sup></a> Some absolutely refused to approve
