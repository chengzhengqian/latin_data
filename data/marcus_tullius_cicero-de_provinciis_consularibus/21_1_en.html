<p>XIII. Under Gaius Caesar’s command, Conscript<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">32</span><span class="br"></span> Fathers, we have fought a war in Gaul; before we merely repelled attacks.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL447_579_a" id="target_note_LCL447_579_a"><sup>a</sup></a> Our commanders always thought that those peoples ought to be beaten back in war rather than attacked. The great Gaius Marius himself, whose divine and outstanding bravery was our stay after grievous disasters and losses suffered by the Roman People,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL447_579_b" id="target_note_LCL447_579_b"><sup>b</sup></a> drove back vast hordes of Gauls that were streaming into Italy, but did not himself penetrate to their cities and dwelling-places.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL447_579_c" id="target_note_LCL447_579_c"><sup>c</sup></a> Just recently that gallant man, who was associated with me in my labours, my dangers, and my counsels, I mean Gaius Pomptinus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL447_579_da" id="target_note_LCL447_579_da"><sup>d</sup></a> broke up by his battles a war that was begun on a sudden by the Allobroges and fomented by this wicked Conspiracy,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL447_579_e" id="target_note_LCL447_579_e"><sup>e</sup></a> subdued those who had attacked us, and content with that victory, after the country had been freed from alarm, rested on his laurels. Gaius Caesar’s plans, I observe, have been far different. For he did not think that he ought to fight only against those whom he saw already in arms against the Roman People, but that the whole of Gaul should be brought under our sway,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL447_579_f" id="target_note_LCL447_579_f"><sup>f</sup></a> And so he has, with brilliant success, crushed in battle<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">33</span><span class="br"></span> the fiercest and greatest tribes of Germania and Helvetia; the rest he has terrified, checked and subdued, and taught them to submit to the rule
