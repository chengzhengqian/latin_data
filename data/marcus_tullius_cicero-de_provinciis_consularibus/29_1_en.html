Caesar, I did not deserve to be; if I was abandoned by him, perhaps he was thinking of himself; if I was even attacked, as some believe, or wish, then our friendship has been violated, then I have suffered a wrong, and I ought to have been his enemy, I do not deny it. But if Caesar indeed wished me to be recalled from exile at a time when you regretted my absence as if I were a beloved son; if you also thought it was important for the good cause that Caesar’s wishes should not be opposed to my recall; and if I have as witness of those wishes his son-in-law, who indeed urged my recall upon Italy throughout her towns,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL447_595_a" id="target_note_LCL447_595_a"><sup>a</sup></a> upon the Roman People in a public meeting,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL447_595_b" id="target_note_LCL447_595_b"><sup>b</sup></a> and upon you yourselves, most eager for my presence, on the Capitol<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL447_595_c" id="target_note_LCL447_595_c"><sup>c</sup></a>; if, lastly, Gnaeus Pompeius is at once my witness for Caesar’s goodwill to me, and guarantor of my own to him,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL447_595_d" id="target_note_LCL447_595_d"><sup>d</sup></a> does it not seem to you that, both recalling those days long past,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL447_595_e" id="target_note_LCL447_595_e"><sup>e</sup></a> and keeping in mind these later ones<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL447_595_f" id="target_note_LCL447_595_f"><sup>f</sup></a> I might, even if I cannot eradicate from existence that most unhappy time that intervened, at least wholly banish it from my heart?</p>
<p>But as for myself, if some would forbid me to boast<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">44</span><span class="br"></span> that I have sacrificed my resentment and my enmities to the public interest, if such conduct is deemed possible only for some great man of outstanding wisdom, I will put forward this plea, which may avail me not so much to win praise as to escape invective, that I am a grateful man, and that I am deeply moved not only by special favours but also by any modest marks of general goodwill.</p>
