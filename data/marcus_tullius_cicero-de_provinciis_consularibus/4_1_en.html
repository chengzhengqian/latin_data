It is truly pitiable how soldiers of the Roman People have been captured, killed, abandoned, scattered; destroyed by neglect, famine, disease, and utter ruin, so that, most disgraceful of all, the crime of a general seems to have been expiated by the sufferings of his army.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL447_545_a" id="target_note_LCL447_545_a"><sup>a</sup></a> And yet this Macedonia, after we had subdued the neighbouring peoples and crushed the barbarians, pacified and tranquil as it was in itself, we formerly secured with a small garrison and a handful of soldiers, through legates too with no supreme military authority, merely by the name of the Roman People; whereas now, in spite of consular authority and an army, it has been so devastated that even a long period of peace can hardly restore its strength.
