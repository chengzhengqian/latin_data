Gaul remain under the guardianship of him to whose honour, valour and good fortune it has been entrusted. For if Caesar, already distinguished with Fortune’s fullest favours, were unwilling to take the risk of tempting that goddess too often, if he were impatient to return to his country, to the gods of his home, to that honour which he sees destined for him in Rome, to his delightful children,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL447_583_a" id="target_note_LCL447_583_a"><sup>a</sup></a> to his illustrious son-in-law, if he were eager to ride up to the Capitol in triumph, graced with that signal mark of honour,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL447_583_b" id="target_note_LCL447_583_b"><sup>b</sup></a> if, lastly, he feared some accident which cannot now add as much to his glory as it can take away, it would nevertheless be our duty to desire that all those tasks should be completed by the same man by whom they have been so far performed. But since Caesar, though he has by now achieved enough to glorify himself, has not yet satisfied the claims of the State, and since he prefers to enjoy the rewards of his labours at a later date rather than fail to complete the public service which he has undertaken, we ought neither to recall a commander who is so fired with devotion to the high service of the State, nor throw into confusion the whole of a policy for war in Gaul now so nearly unfolded.</p>
