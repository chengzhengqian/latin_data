<p><span class="bold">1.</span> Timoleon, the Corinthian. Without doubt this man has shown himself great in the estimation of all. For he alone had the good fortune, which I am inclined to think fell to the lot of no one else, to free the land of his birth from a tyrant’s oppression, to rescue the Syracusans, whom he had been sent to help, from long-continued slavery, and by his mere arrival to restore all Sicily to its former condition, after it had for many years been harassed by wars and subject to barbarians.</p>
<p>But in the course of these events he had to struggle with varied fortune, and he did what is regarded as especially difficult, that is, showed himself far wiser in prosperity than in adversity. For when his brother Timophanes, who had been chosen general by the Corinthians, made himself tyrant with the aid of mercenary troops,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL467_239_2" id="target_note_LCL467_239_2"><sup>2</sup></a> although Timoleon might have shared in his power, so far was he from participating in the crime, that he valued the liberty of his fellow-citizens above his brother’s life and considered obedience to its laws preferable to ruling over his country. Owing to that feeling, through the aid of a soothsayer and of a relative by marriage, the husband of their own sister, he caused the death of the tyrant, his own brother. He himself not only did not lay hands upon him, but he did not wish even to look upon his brother’s blood; for while the deed was being done he was some distance away, keeping guard to prevent any palace guard from coming to the tyrant’s aid.</p>
