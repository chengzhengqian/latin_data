<p>So bitter was this Italian war, and such its vicissitudes, that in two successive years two Roman consuls, first Rutilius and subsequently Cato Porcius, were slain by the enemy, the armies of the Roman people were routed in many places, and the Romans were compelled to resort to military dress<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL152_83_b" id="target_note_LCL152_83_b"><sup>b</sup></a> and to remain long in that garb. The Italians chose Corfinium as their capital, and named it Italica. Then little by little the strength of the Romans was recruited by admitting to the citizenship those who had not taken arms or had not been slow to lay them down again, and Pompeius, Sulla, and Marius restored the tottering power of the Roman people.</p>
<p>XVII. Except for the remnants of hostility which lingered at Nola the Italian war was now in large measure ended, the Romans, themselves exhausted, consenting to grant the citizenship individually to the conquered and humbled states in preference to giving it to them as a body when their own strength was still unimpaired.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL152_83_ca" id="target_note_LCL152_83_ca"><sup>c</sup></a> This was the year in which Quintus Pompeius and Lucius Cornelius Sulla<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL152_83_d" id="target_note_LCL152_83_d"><sup>d</sup></a> entered upon the consulship. Sulla was a man to whom, up to the conclusion of his career of victory, sufficient praise can hardly be given, and for whom, after his victory, no condemnation can be adequate. He was sprung of a noble family, the sixth in descent from the Cornelius Rufinus who had been one of the famous generals in the war with Pyrrhus. As the renown of his family had waned, Sulla acted for a long while as though he had no thought of seeking the consulship.
