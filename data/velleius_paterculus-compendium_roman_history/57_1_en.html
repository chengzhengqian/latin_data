Spain. Pompey, who even at the time of this triumph was still a Roman knight, entered the city in his triumphal car on the day before his entrance upon his consulate. Who is there who does not feel surprise that this man, who owed his elevation to the highest position in the state to so many extraordinary
commands,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL152_115_a" id="target_note_LCL152_115_a"><sup>a</sup></a> should have taken it ill that the senate and the Roman people were willing to consider Gaius Caesar as a candidate for the consulship
a second time, though suing for it <span class="italic">in absentia</span>? So common a failing is it for mankind to overlook every irregularity in their own case, but to make no concessions to others, and to let their discontent with conditions be vented upon suspected motives and upon persons instead of the real cause. In this consulship<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL152_115_b" id="target_note_LCL152_115_b"><sup>b</sup></a> Pompey restored the power of the tribunes, of which Sulla had left the shadow without the substance.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL152_115_c" id="target_note_LCL152_115_c"><sup>c</sup></a></p>
<p>While war was being waged against Sertorius in Spain sixty-four runaway slaves, under the leadership of Spartacus, escaping from a gladiatorial school in Capua, seized swords in that city, and at first took refuge on Mount Vesuvius;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL152_115_d" id="target_note_LCL152_115_d"><sup>d</sup></a> then, as their number increased daily, they afflicted Italy with many serious disasters Their number grew to such an extent that in the last battle which they fought they confronted the Roman army with ninety thousand men. The glory of ending this war belongs to Marcus Crassus, who was soon by unanimous consent to be regarded as the first citizen in the state.</p>
