of Paulus, and had been adopted by the son of Publius Scipio)—endowed with all the qualities essential to a good soldier and a good citizen, the most eminent man of his day both in native ability and acquired knowledge, who in his whole life was guilty of no act, word, or thought that was not praiseworthy. He had already received in Spain the mural crown,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL152_31_a" id="target_note_LCL152_31_a"><sup>a</sup></a> and in Africa the <span class="italic">corona obsidionalis</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL152_31_b" id="target_note_LCL152_31_b"><sup>b</sup></a>
for his bravery, and while in Spain he had challenged and slain an enemy of great stature though himself a man of but ordinary physical strength. The war against Carthage begun by the consuls two years previously he now waged with greater vigour, and destroyed to its foundations the city which was hateful to the Roman name more because of jealousy of its power than because of any offence at that time.
