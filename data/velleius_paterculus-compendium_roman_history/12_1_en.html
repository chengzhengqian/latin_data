<p>X. About this time Antiochus Epiphanes, king of Syria—the Antiochus who began the Olympieum at Athens—was besieging Ptolemaeus, the boy king,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL152_25_a" id="target_note_LCL152_25_a"><sup>a</sup></a> at Alexandria. Marcus Popilius Laenas was dispatched on an embassy to order him to desist. He delivered his message, and when the king replied that he would think the matter over, Popilius drew a circle around the king with his staff and told him that he must give his answer before he stepped out of the circle in the sand. In this way the firmness of the Roman cut short the king’s deliberations, and the order was obeyed.</p>
<p>Now Lucius Paulus, who won the victory in Macedonia, had four sons. The two oldest he had given by adoption, the one to Publius Scipio, the son of Africanus, who resembled his great father in nothing except in name and in his vigorous eloquence; the other to Fabius Maximus. The two younger at the time of his victory had not yet assumed the toga of manhood. On the day before his triumph, when, in accordance with ancient custom, he was rendering an account of his acts before an assembly of the people outside the city walls,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL152_25_b" id="target_note_LCL152_25_b"><sup>b</sup></a> he prayed to the gods that if any of them envied his achievements or his fortune they should vent their wrath upon himself rather than upon the state. This utterance, as though prophetic, deprived him of a great part of his family, for a few days before his triumph he lost one of the two sons whom he had kept in his household, and the other a still shorter time after it.</p>
<p>About this time occurred the censorship<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL152_25_c" id="target_note_LCL152_25_c"><sup>c</sup></a> off Fulvius Flaccus and Postumius Albinus famed for its severity.
