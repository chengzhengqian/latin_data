triumph of Metellus was none the less brilliant, and the cognomen of Numidicus earned by his valour was bestowed upon him. As I commented, a short time ago, on the glory of the family of the Domitii, let me now comment upon that of the Caecilii. Within the compass of about twelve years during this period, the Metelli were distinguished by consulships, censorships, or triumph more than twelve times. Thus it is clear that, as in the case of cities and empires, so the fortunes of families flourish, wane, and pass away.</p>
<p>XII. Gaius Marius, even at this time, had Lucius Sulla associated with him as quaestor, as though the fates were trying to avoid subsequent events.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL152_73_a" id="target_note_LCL152_73_a"><sup>a</sup></a> He sent Sulla to King Bocchus and through him gained possession of Jugurtha, about one hundred and thirty-four
years before the present time. He returned to the city as consul designate for the second time, and on the kalends of January,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL152_73_b" id="target_note_LCL152_73_b"><sup>b</sup></a> at the inauguration of his second consulship, he led Jugurtha in triumph.

His consulships then followed each other in succession. The third was consumed in preparation for this war. In this year<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL152_73_g" id="target_note_LCL152_73_g"><sup>g</sup></a> Gnaeus Domitius, the tribune of the people, passed a law that the priests, who had previously been chosen by their colleagues, should
