But peace could not be to the liking of men whose cause was wicked and whose cupidity was unbounded. In the meantime Sullaâ€™s army was daily growing, for all the better and saner citizens flocked to his side. By a fortunate issue of events he overcame the consuls Scipio and Norbanus near Capua.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL152_103_a" id="target_note_LCL152_103_a"><sup>a</sup></a> Norbanus was defeated in battle, while Scipio, deserted and betrayed by his army, was allowed by Sulla to go unharmed. So different was Sulla the warrior from Sulla the victor that, while his victory was in progress he was mild and more lenient than was reasonable, but after it was won his cruelty was unprecedented.

to the goddess the waters renowned for their salubrity and power to heal, as well as all the lands in the vicinity. The record of this pleasing act of piety is witnessed to this day by an inscription on the door of the temple, and a bronze tablet within the edifice.</p>
