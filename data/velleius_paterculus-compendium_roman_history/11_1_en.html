He was a son of the Paulus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL152_23_a" id="target_note_LCL152_23_a"><sup>a</sup></a> who had met death at Cannae with a fortitude only equalled by his reluctance to begin a battle so disastrous to the republic. Paulus defeated Perses in a great battle at a city in Macedonia named Pydna,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL152_23_b" id="target_note_LCL152_23_b"><sup>b</sup></a> put him to rout, despoiled his camp, destroyed his forces, and compelled him in his desperate plight to flee from Macedonia. Abandoning his country, Perses took refuge in the island of Samothrace, as a suppliant entrusting himself to the inviolability of the temple. There Gnaeus Octavius, the praetor in command of the fleet, reached him and persuaded him by argument rather than force to give himself up to the good faith of the Romans. Thus Paulus led in triumph the greatest and the most illustrious of kings.</p>
<p>In this year two other triumphs were celebrated: that of Octavius, the praetor in charge of the fleet, and that of Anicius, who drove before his triumphal chariot Gentius, King of the Illyrians. How inseparable a companion of great success is jealousy, and how she attaches herself to the most eminent, may be gathered from this fact: although no one raised objections to the triumphs of Octavius and Anicius, there were those who tried to place obstacles in the way of that of Paulus. His triumph so far exceeded all former ones, whether in the greatness of King Perses himself, or in the display of statues and the amount of money borne in the procession, that Paulus contributed to the treasury two hundred million sesterces, and by reason of this vast sum eclipsed all previous triumphs by comparison.</p>
