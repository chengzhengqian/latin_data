<span class="line">12. Do not for dowry’s sake espouse a wife,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Nor wish to keep her, if she causes strife.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">13. From men’s behaviour learn what to pursue</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Or shun. The life of others gives the cue.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">14. Try what you can, lest by hard task foredone</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">You fail and drop what you’ve in vain begun.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">15. Do not conceal ill deeds within your ken,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Lest silence look like aping wicked men.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">16. If sued unfairly, ask the judge for aid:</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">The very laws would fain be justly swayed.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">17. What you deserve to bear, with patience bear:</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">And, when you’re judge of self, you must not</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">spare.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">18. Read much, but, having read, with much dispense;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Bards’ themes are wonders, but revolt the sense.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">19. Upon your talk, at dinners, set a bit,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Lest you’re dubbed “rattle,” when you’d fain</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">be “wit.”</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">20. Fear not the words your angry wife may say:</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">A weeping woman plots but to waylay.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">21. Use your estate, yet shun extravagance:</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Want follows waste and begs for maintenance.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">22. Be this thy motto—“I do not dread death”:</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Death, if no boon, our troubles finisheth.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">23. A thrifty wife may talk and talk: endure:</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Lost patience and loud brawling are no cure.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">24. Love both your parents, one as much as other:</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">To please your father never wound your mother.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
