<p>Any reader who decides to study this poem will reap many advantages, as it offers maxims most acceptable for life; but if he spurn it, he will show disdain not for me, its author, but for himself.</p>
<p class="lineGroup">
<span class="line">1. Fail not to learn: equip your mind with rules;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Count as but death the life that never schools.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">2. Mind not ill tongues, if you live straight of soul:</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">A neighbour’s words are not in our control.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">3. If called to witness, hide as best you can</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">A friend’s misdeeds, but be an honest man.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">4. Beware of softly whispered flatteries:</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Frankness is mark of truth, flattery of lies.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">5. Shun slackness, which means idling all your</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">days:</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">With lazy minds sloth on the body preys.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">6. Sandwich occasional joys amidst your care</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">That you with spirit any task may bear.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">7. Another’s word or act ne’er criticise,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Lest others mock at you in selfsame wise.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">8. A heritage bequeathed to you by will</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Keep and increase: so save your good name</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">still.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">9. If you’ve abundant wealth, as old age ends,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Be generous, not close-fisted, with your friends.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">10. Sound counsel from your slave do not despise:</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Spurn no man’s view at all, if it is wise.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">11. If goods and income are not what they were,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Live satisfied with what the times confer.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
