<span class="line">19. Our life is but a frail uncertain breath:</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Rest not thy hopes, then, on another’s death.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">20. When your poor friend gives of his poverty,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Accept well pleased and thank him handsomely.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">21. A naked babe since nature fashioned thee,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">With patience bear the load of poverty.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">22. Fear not lest life’s concluding lap be nigh:</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">He makes his life no life who dreads to die.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">23. If no friend helps you as your deeds demand,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Tax not the gods but hold yourself in hand.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">24. Save up your gains lest you go short some day:</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">To keep possessions, fancy they’re away.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">25. Utter no promise that you can’t redeem,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Lest you inconstant prove, while kind you seem.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">26. The glib dissembler, faithless friend at heart,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">See that you copy: so art baffles art.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">27. Approve not men who wheedling nothings say:</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Fowlers pipe sweetly to delude their prey.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">28. Since sons you have—not wealth—such training</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">give</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Their minds that they, though poor, unharmed</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">may live.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">29. Hold dear the cheap, and cheaply hold the</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">dear:</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">So none can say you hunt or hoard your gear.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">30. Do not yourself what you are wont to blame:</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">When sin convicts the preacher’s self, ’tis shame.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">31. Ask what is right or fair to human eye:</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Fools ask what others rightly may deny.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">32. Do not the unknown o’er the known advance:</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Known things on judgement hang, unknown on</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">chance.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
