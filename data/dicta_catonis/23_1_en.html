<span class="italic">Epitafium filii Cat</span>(<span class="italic">h</span>)<span class="italic">onis</span>; and E <span class="italic">Epitaphiũ Vitalis mimi.</span> Burman, <span class="italic">Anth. Lat., Lib.</span> IV. No. 20, and Meyer, <span class="italic">Anth. vet. Lat.</span>, 1173, have the poem under the heading <span class="italic">Vitalis mimi.</span> Its late period is shown in the shortening of the final syllable in <span class="italic">nescis</span> 1. 2 and <span class="italic">crederes</span> 1. 16. The German monk Ermenrich of the ninth century, writing to Grimald, cites <span class="italic">nescis</span> as a trochee “in epitaphio Catonis Censorini dicentis” (where <span class="italic">dicentis</span>, it may be guessed, is an attempt to include the lines as among <span class="italic">Dicta Catonis</span>).</p>

<span class="line">How shall I treat thee, Death, who sparest none?</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Thou knowst not mirth, knowst not the love of fun:</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Yet all the world in these my merit knew—Hence</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">came my mansion, hence my revenue.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">I always wore a smile: if smiles be lost,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">What boots a world in wayward trickery tossed?</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">At sight of me wild frenzy met relief:</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">My entrance changed to laughter poignant grief.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">None felt the canker of anxiety</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Nor worried mid this world’s uncertainty.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">O’er every fear my presence won success:</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">An hour with me was ever happiness.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">In tragic rôle my word and act could please,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Cheering in myriad ways hearts ill at ease:</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Through change in look, mien, voice I so could run</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">That many seemed to use the lips of one.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
