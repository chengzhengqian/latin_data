<section class="div1 language" lang="en"><header><hgroup><h1>The Moselle</h1></hgroup></header><section class="div2"><p class="noindent">yet your noble and stately verse has upset my preconceptions and made this stream for me greater than the Nile of Egypt, cooler than the Don of Scythia, and more famous than this Tiber we all know so well. I should certainly not believe all the great things you say of the source of the Moselle and its flow, did I not know that you never tell a lie—even in poetry. How did you discover all those shoals of river-fish, whose names are no less varied than their hues, whose size differs as widely as their flavour—qualities which are painted in your poem in colours more glowing than any Nature gave? And yet, though I have often found myself at your table and there have marvelled at most other articles of food which at the time were highly esteemed, I have never found there fish such as you describe. Tell me: when were these fish spawned which appear in your book, but did not upon your board? You think I am jesting and merely trifling? So may Heaven make me honest, as I rank your poem with the works of Virgil!</p>
<p>But it is time I ceased to dwell upon your praises, forgetting my own vexation; otherwise you may wrest the fact that I admire your work despite my annoyance into an additional tribute. You may spread abroad copies of your poems and always leave me out; but I will enjoy your work all the same, though it be through the kindness of others. Farewell.</p>
