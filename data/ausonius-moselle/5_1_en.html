Thou, with breastplate of scales, in the fore-part smooth, and destined to form a course at some “doubtful dinner,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL096_232_1" id="target_note_LCL096_232_1"><sup>1</sup></a> endurest untainted through seasons of long delay—thou distinguished by the markings of thy head, whose generous paunch sways and whose belly droops with rolls of fat.
