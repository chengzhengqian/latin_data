Thou also must be mentioned amid the battalions of the stream, Gudgeon, no longer than the width of two palms without the thumbs, full-fat, rounded, and yet more bulky when thy belly teems with spawn—Gudgeon, who art bearded like the tufted barbel.</p>
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">135</span><span class="br"></span><p>Now, creature of the surface, shall thy praise be sung, O mighty Sheat-fish, whom, with back glistening as though with olive-oil of Attica,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL096_234_1" id="target_note_LCL096_234_1"><sup>1</sup></a> I look on as a dolphin of the river—so mightily thou glidest through the waters and canst scarce extend thy trailing body to its full length, hampered by shallows or by river-weeds. But when thou urgest thy peaceful course in the stream, at thee the green banks marvel, at thee the azure throng of the finny tribe, at thee the limpid waters: in the channel a tide is rolled abroad on either hand, and the ends of the waves drive onward at the marge. So, when at times on the Atlantic deep a whale by wind or his own motion is driven to the verge of land, the sea displaced o’erflows, great waters rise, and neighbouring mountains fear to lose their height. Yet this—this gentle whale of our Moselle is far from havoc and brings glory to the mighty stream.</p>
