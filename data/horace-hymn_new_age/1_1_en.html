<h1><span class="ac">Hymn for a New Age</span></h1>
<p class="noindent">Phoebus and Diana, Queen of the Woods, radiant glory of the heavens, ever to be worshipped and ever worshipped, grant our prayers on this holy occasion, when the Sibyl’s verses<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL033_263_1" id="target_note_LCL033_263_1"><sup>1</sup></a> have commanded that chosen girls and boys of good character should sing a hymn to the gods who look with favour on the Seven Hills.</p>
<p>Life-giving Sun, who with your shining car bring forth the day and hide it away, who are born anew and yet the same, may you never be able to behold anything greater than the city of Rome!</p>
<p>You whose gentle function it is to open the way for births in due season, protect our mothers, o Ilithyia, or Lucina if you prefer that name, or Genitalis. O goddess, be pleased to rear our young, and to grant success to the Fathers’ edicts on the yoking together of men and women and on the marriage law for raising a new crop of children,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL033_263_2" id="target_note_LCL033_263_2"><sup>2</sup></a> so that the unfailing cycle of ten times eleven years may bring round singing and games that are thronged with people three times by daylight and as often in the pleasant time of night.</p>
