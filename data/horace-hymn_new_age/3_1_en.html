Scythians and the Indians, who were recently so arrogant, ask for our decisions. Now Good Faith, Peace, and Honour, along with old-fashioned Modesty and Virtue, who has been so long neglected, venture to return, and blessed Plenty with her full horn is seen by all.</p>
<p>Phoebus the prophet, arrayed with his shining bow, who is dear to the nine Muses, and by his healing art relieves the body’s weary limbs—he, if he looks with favour, as he does, on the altars of the Palatine, prolongs Rome’s power and Latium’s prosperity for another cycle and another ever improving age.</p>
<p>Diana, who possesses the Aventine and Mount Algidus, listens to the prayers of the Fifteen Men<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL033_267_7" id="target_note_LCL033_267_7"><sup>7</sup></a> and lends a gracious ear to the appeals of the children.</p>
<p>We carry home the good and certain hope that such is the will of Jupiter and the other gods—we, the chorus trained to sing in praise of Phoebus and Diana.</p>
