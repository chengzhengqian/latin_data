<p class="noindent">We need to understand that these metaplasms [i.e., misplaced letters] either occur in the writing itself already set by the poets themselves or left for us to manufacture when the requirements of scansion or pronunciation so demand. Poets create metaplasms when they themselves leave an error in the text, as is “the lleavings of the Danaans” [Verg. <span class="italic">Aen.</span> 1.30] and “hav you found me guilty of so great a crime” [Verg. <span class="italic">Aen.</span> 10.668], for he adds one letter for a metaplasm with <span class="italic">l</span>, and again, the other way, he removed one letter for a metaplasm with <span class="italic">e</span>; as so Lucilius “and with corupt mouth” [1243 M. = 1255–56 W.]: he removed one letter for a metaplasm with <span class="italic">r</span>; and Ennius:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">that to this one of the ancestors a statue is erected [?] at Athens [?]</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
