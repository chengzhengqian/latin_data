<p class="noindent">They say that a four-horse team runs “on wheels” either because this universe of ours runs its course by the swiftness of its orbit or because of the sun, since it “wheels” in a circular rotation, as Ennius says:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">thereupon the bright wheel [i.e., the sun] reveals the sky with its rays</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>

<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">necatus</span> is properly said of one killed by the sword, but <span class="italic">nectus</span> of one taken off by some other violent means. Ennius:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">these a plague killed, that other part fell in wars</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>

<p class="noindent">For my part, what Ennius says:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">all men wish themselves to be praised</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">I think should be partly approved, partly avoided.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="bold">110</span> Seneca, <span class="italic">Epistles</span></p>
<p class="noindent">He praises who judges that one should be praised. When that well-known tragic poet of ours [Naevius] says it is a wonderful thing “to be praised by a praiseworthy man” [Naev. F 14 <span class="italic">TrRF</span>], he says that he is deserving of praise. And when the equally ancient poet says:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL294_415_1" id="target_note_LCL294_415_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line indent5">praise nourishes the arts</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">he is not speaking of panegyric, which corrupts the arts.</p>

The second, almost certainly Ennian, can be scanned as either dactyls or anapests, and so might possibly derive instead from either a tragedy or a satire.
