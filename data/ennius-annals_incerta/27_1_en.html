<p class="noindent">There is doubt . . . whether originally a single female dog was called <span class="italic">canis</span> or <span class="italic">canes</span>, for among old authors the expression in the singular was <span class="italic">canes.</span> So Ennius writes:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">as much as if a pregnant, toothless bitch barks</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">Lucilius: “a worthless, big man, like the butchers’ monstrous dog” [1221 M. = 1175 W.]. Applied to one, it should have been <span class="italic">canis</span>, to many <span class="italic">canes</span>, but Ennius should not be faulted for following the old practice, nor should he who now says “a dog [<span class="italic">canis</span>] does not eat dog meat [<span class="italic">canina</span>]” . . . just as some have said, like feminine <span class="italic">canes</span> in the singular, in the singular “the beaked ship with oars across the deep.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL294_399_1" id="target_note_LCL294_399_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p class="noindent">In Ennius, “around then the shrill signals . . .” [Inc<span class="italic">. Ann.</span> F 8]. <span class="italic">cata</span>,<span class="italic"> “</span>sharp.” The Sabines use the word. That is why “<span class="italic">catus </span>Aelius Sextus” [10 <span class="italic">Ann.</span> F 5] means not, as they say, “wise,” but “shrewd,” and</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">then at the same time he began to recall <span class="italic">cata dicta</span></span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">should be understood as “shrewd sayings.”</p>
