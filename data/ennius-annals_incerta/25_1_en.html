<p class="noindent">“strike violence into your winds”: There is a double sense, for if <span class="italic">incute</span> means <span class="italic">inice</span> [strike], <span class="italic">ventis</span> is dative case . . . if, on the other hand, it means <span class="italic">fac </span>[make], <span class="italic">ventis</span> is instrumental ablative and the sense will be “make violence against the Trojans by means of the winds.” That is, through your winds make violence against the Trojans.

<span class="line">accustomed to bathe in the fine-flowing river,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">exulting: he holds his head high, and about his</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
