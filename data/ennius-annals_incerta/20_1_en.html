<p class="noindent">“and we wage [war] with unconquered men”: and yet above we dealt with “Phrygians captured twice” [9.599]. But he says “unconquered” because of what follows, “not conquered . . . by the sword.” Moreover, he says wonderfully “they are able to abstain” as if he were saying: even if they wanted to, their nature does not permit them to abandon war. Ennius:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">he who conquers is not a conqueror unless the conquered acknowledges it</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">Varro and others say the Trojans were unconquered because they were overcome by ambush. They maintain that those are conquered who surrender themselves to the enemy.</p>

<p class="noindent">The word <span class="italic">imber</span> is used of all types of moisture, as Lucretius [1.715]: . . . For old writers used to say <span class="italic">imber</span> for all water. Ennius uses <span class="italic">imber</span> for sea water:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line indent8">and Neptune’s water</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">rumbled with ships</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
