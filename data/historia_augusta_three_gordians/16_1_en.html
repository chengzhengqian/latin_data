<p>XVII This was the son of the old Gordian, the proconsul of Africa. He too was named Augustus by the Africans and the senate at the same time as his father, and he was illustrious in culture and character as well as in noble rank; the last, according to many writers, he derived from the Antonines, although most say from the Antonii.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL140_411_1" id="target_note_LCL140_411_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Others adduce the following facts as evidence to show the high quality of his familyâ€”that the elder Gordian was called Africanus, the honorary surname of the Scipios<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL140_411_2" id="target_note_LCL140_411_2"><sup>2</sup></a>; that he possessed the House of Pompey in the city<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL140_411_3" id="target_note_LCL140_411_3"><sup>3</sup></a>; that he was always given the surname of the Antonines; and that he himself expressed a desire in the senate that his son should be known as Antonius. Each of these, they believe, represents a family connection. I, however, follow Junius Cordus, who says that the nobility of the Gordians was derived from all these families.

A few days after his birth he was given the name Antoninus; later, in the senate, he was publicly named Antonius; and the people finally began to call him Gordian.</p>
