young Gordian took a wife, the daughter of Timesitheus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL140_425_1a" id="target_note_LCL140_425_1a"><sup>1</sup></a> a most erudite man, whom Gordian considered worthy of being his relation because of his powers of eloquence and immediately made his prefect. After this his rule seemed not in the least that of a child or contemptible, since he was aided by the advice of this excellent father-in-law, while he himself, on his own account, developed considerable sagacity and did not let his favours be sold by the eunuchs and attendants at court through his mother’s ignorance or connivance.</p>

Timesitheus was a member of the equestrian order and had held many important procuratorships previous to his appointment as prefect of the guard. All the evidence points to the belief that he was an able and conscientious official and a skilful general, and the biographer is doubtless correct in attributing to him the successes of the Persian campaign (c. xxvii. 2) as well as in his general statement that he was the mainstay of this reign; see § 7; c. xxiv. 1; c. xxv. 5-7;c. xxviii.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL140_425_1a').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
