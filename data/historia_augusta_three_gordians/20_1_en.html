So I write it down. The elder Gordian resembled the face of Augustus perfectly; he seemed, indeed, to have his very voice and mannerisms and stature; his son, in turn, seemed like to Pompey, although it is true that Pompey was not obese of person; his grandson, finally, whose portraits we can see today, bore the appearance of Scipio Asiaticus. This, because of its very strangeness, I have decided should not be passed over in silence.</p>

<p>XXII. On the death of the two Gordians, the senate, being now thoroughly agitated and in even more violent terror of Maximinus, chose Pupienus (or Maximum) and Clodius Balbinus, both ex-consuls, from the twenty men whom they had elected to protect the state, and declared them emperors.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL140_419_2" id="target_note_LCL140_419_2"><sup>2</sup></a> But on this the populace and soldiers demanded that the child Gordian should be made Caesar,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL140_419_3" id="target_note_LCL140_419_3"><sup>3</sup></a> he being then, so most authorities declare, eleven years old; some, however, say thirteen,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL140_419_4" id="target_note_LCL140_419_4"><sup>4</sup></a> and Junius Cordus says sixteen (for Cordus says that he was in his twenty-second year when he died). At any rate, he was hurried to the senate and thence taken to an assembly, and there they clothed him in the imperial garments and hailed him as Caesar.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL140_419_5" id="target_note_LCL140_419_5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
