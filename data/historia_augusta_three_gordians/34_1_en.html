the Sarmatians, queller of mutinies at Rome, conqueror of the Germans, but no conqueror of Philippi‚Äù.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL140_447_1a" id="target_note_LCL140_447_1a"><sup>1</sup></a> This was added ostensibly because he had been beaten by the Alani in a disorderly battle on the plains of Philippi and forced to retreat; but at the same time it seemed to mean that he had been slain by the two Philips.
