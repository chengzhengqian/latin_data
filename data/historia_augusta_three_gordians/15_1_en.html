And so when Gordian dismissed him, he gathered the Moors together and with an irregular force of them came up to Carthage, the people of which, with typical Punic faith, came over to him. None the less, Gordian desired to hazard the chances of war, and sent against them his son, now well advanced in years (he was then forty-six years old), and at that time his father’s legate; we shall give a resumé of his character in its proper place.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL140_409_1" id="target_note_LCL140_409_1"><sup>1</sup></a> But in military affairs not only was Capelianus the bolder man, but the younger Gordian was less well trained, placed at a disadvantage, as he was, by the luxurious life of the nobility.
