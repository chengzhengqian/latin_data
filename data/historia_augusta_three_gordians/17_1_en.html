And this raised him to the seventh heaven, for being now possessed of a library of such magnitude and excellence, thanks to the power of letters he became famous among men.</p>
<p>He won his quaestorship upon the recommendation of Elagabalus; for the wildness of the young man, which was nevertheless neither extravagant nor depraved, had found him favour with that extravagant emperor. He held the city-praetorship on the recommendation of Alexander, and did so well in this office, chiefly in administering the law, that he was immediately given the consulship,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL140_413_2" id="target_note_LCL140_413_2"><sup>2</sup></a> which his father had won late in life.

He ate sparingly; indeed he finished his luncheon—if he lunched at all—or his dinner in an instant. He was very fond of women; indeed, it is said that he had twenty-two concubines decreed him, from all of whom he left three or four children apiece. He was nicknamed, in fact, the Priam<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL140_413_4" id="target_note_LCL140_413_4"><sup>4</sup></a> of his age, but often the crowd jestingly called him not Priam but Priapus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL140_413_5" id="target_note_LCL140_413_5"><sup>5</sup></a> as being nearer to his character.
