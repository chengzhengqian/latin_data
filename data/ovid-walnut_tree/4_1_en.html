But I may never bring forth ripe progeny, and my wealth is struck off before its prime. My skin is still soft with the young milk that is within, nor are my ills like to be anyone’s good: yet already do I find men pelting me, and with o’er-hasty blows seeking a vain prize. If account were taken of what is stolen, and of what is left, wayfarer, thou hast a greater share than my own lord. Often someone, seeing my summit bare of leaves, deems it the work of furious Boreas; one thinks that the heat, another that the frost, has robbed me; another fancies that hailstorms are to blame. But neither hail, loathed of hardy husbandmen, nor wind nor sun nor frost has injured me: my fruit is my bane, it is harmful to bear, it is harmful to be fertile; gain, which has hurt many, has hurt me too. Gain hurt thee, Polydorus; a wicked consort’s gain sent her Theban husband to war.
