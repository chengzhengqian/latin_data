and briars, born only to hurt, and other thorns are safe in their own defence. But I, because I harm not, nor am protected by hooked nails, am pelted by wanton stones flung by greedy hands. What if I gave not timely shade to those who flee the sun when the Icarian dog cracks the ground?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL232_303_1" id="target_note_LCL232_303_1"><sup>1</sup></a> What were I not a refuge to those who shelter from storms, when comes a downfall of unexpected rain? Though I do all this, though to all I perform untiring service, for all my service I am pelted with stones. And having borne this I must bear the complaining of my master: I am held the cause why his field is stony; and while he clears the ground again, and collects and throws back the stones, the road ever has weapons ready against me. Therefore the cold that others hate is useful to me alone; in that season winter assures my safety. Then indeed am I naked, yet to be naked is an advantage; I have no spoil to tempt an enemy. But as soon as I clothe my branches with their bounty, stones more numerous than hail are aimed at the new fruit. Perchance someone will say here: “What touches public ground it is right to pluck: such right the road can claim.” If this is lawful, strip the olives, cut the harvest; pluck neighbouring cabbages, insatiable wayfarer. Let the same impudence even enter the City’s gates, and suffer your walls, Romulus, to enjoy the same privilege: let anyone take silver from a shop-front, and his friend lay hand upon the jewels: let one steal gold, another foreign pearls, let him take all the riches he can find. Yet are they not so pilfered, nor, while Caesar governs the world, will a robber be safe under so mighty a prince.
