<p>But the toilsome husbandman, I ween, takes great thought for me! let him find aught he has given me save earth alone. Easily and freely do I grow on despised ground, and that part of the place where I stand is almost public road. Lest I harm the crops, for I am even said to harm the crops, the furthest and extremest limit of the estate receives me. Saturn’s sickle prunes not my superfluous shade, no digger renews my hardened soil; though I be sick even to death with sun and parching thirst, I shall be given no rill of refreshing water. But when the new nut in due season shows chinks in its splitting rind thither comes the cruel rod; the rod inflicts ruthless wounds on swelling branches, lest I be able to complain of stones alone: down falls my fruit that is not forbidden to dessert, and the thrifty housewife stores the collected nuts. These, as they stand upright, a boy<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL232_299_1" id="target_note_LCL232_299_1"><sup>1</sup></a> splits with certain aim, or, as they lie on
their side, strikes with his finger once or twice. In four nuts, and no more, is all his hazard, when one is added to the three beneath it. Another bids them roll down a sloping board, and prays that one out of many, whiche’er it be, may touch his own. Then there is he who guesses whether the number be odd or even, that the augur may bear away the wealth he has divined. Then too there is drawn in chalk a shape such as a heavenly constellation or the fourth Greek letter bears.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL232_299_2a" id="target_note_LCL232_299_2a"><sup>2</sup></a> When this has

In 75, 6 the idea seems to be building a castle of three nuts with a fourth on top. In 79, 80 it is guessing “odd or even,” of a number of nuts (cf.

If “qui constitit . . . virga . . . ipse” be read, the game would be for a boy to stand inside the triangle and to try to touch with a stick as many nuts as possible arranged inside it. The references in 11. 81–2 are to the constellation Triangulum and to the Greek letter delta.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL232_299_2a').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
