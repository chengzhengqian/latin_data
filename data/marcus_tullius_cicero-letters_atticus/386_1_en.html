every disreputable character in Italy is with Caesar. I saw the whole crew at Formiae and upon my word I thought them more like beasts than men; and I knew them all, but I had never seen them all in one place.</p>
<p>So let me go the chosen way and leave all that is mine, let me set out to join one who will welcome my arrival more than if I had fled along with him. For then our hopes ran high, whereas now I for one have no hope at all; and nobody but I has left Italy who did not look upon Caesar as his personal enemy. Believe me I am not doing this for the sake of the commonwealth, which in my view has foundered utterly, but so that nobody shall think me ungrateful towards a man who brought me out of the troubles into which he himself had plunged me, and also because I can’t bear to witness what is happening or what is certainly going to happen. I suppose that some senatorial decrees have actually been passed by now, I only hope on Volcacius’ motion. But what matter? They are all of one mind. But Servius will be implacable, after sending his son to crush or at any rate capture Cn. Pompeius along with Pontius Titinianus!<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL097_103_1" id="target_note_LCL097_103_1"><sup>1</sup></a> <span class="italic">He</span> acted out of fear to be sure, but Servius—however, no more spleen. It is time to face the truth, that nothing is left us except the breath in our bodies, and I only wish I had not been left that much.</p>
<p>Since the Adriatic is blocked we shall sail by the Western Sea, and if Puteoli proves difficult we shall make for Croton or Thurii and as loyal, patriotic citizens take to buccaneering. I see no other way of conducting this war. We shall bury ourselves in Egypt. On land we cannot hold our own. There is no genuine prospect of peace. But I have lamented over it all long enough.</p>
