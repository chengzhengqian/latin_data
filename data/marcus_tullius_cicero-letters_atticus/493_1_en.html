meet Silius, you’ll write and tell me anything you think worth while. On the subject<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL097_317_1" id="target_note_LCL097_317_1"><sup>1</sup></a> concerning which you think a message has been sent to me, whether such a message has been sent or not I don’t know; certainly nothing has been <span class="italic">said</span> to me. So please carry on as you have begun, and if you fix up something that meets with her approval (which I don’t think feasible), take Marcus along if you see fit. He has an interest in showing a desire to please her, I have none except what you know,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL097_317_2" id="target_note_LCL097_317_2"><sup>2</sup></a> a point to which I attach great importance.</p>
<p>You tell me to go back to my old ways. For a long time it has been my part to mourn our liberties and I did so, but less intensely because I had a source of comfort. Now I simply cannot follow that way of life, and on this matter I do not feel obliged to pay any attention to other people’s opinions. My own conscience counts for more with me than all the world’s talk. As to my literary consolation of myself, I am not dissatisfied with what it achieved. I reduced the outward show of grief; grief itself I could not reduce, and would not if I could.</p>
<p>With regard to Triarius, you interpret my wishes correctly. Yes, do nothing that is not in accord with their wishes. I feel an affection for the dead, am guardian to his children, and have a regard for the whole family. About the Castrician business,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL097_317_3" id="target_note_LCL097_317_3"><sup>3</sup></a> if Castricius is willing to take money for the slaves and to have it paid to him as it is being paid at present, nothing certainly could be more convenient. But if the object was to take the slaves themselves away, that does not seem equitable to me, since you ask me to tell you my opinion—don’t think I want my brother to have any trouble. I rather gathered that yours was the same.</p>
