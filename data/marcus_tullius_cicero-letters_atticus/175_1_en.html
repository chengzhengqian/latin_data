<h2>95 (V.2)</h2>
<h2><span class="italic">Pompeii, 10 May 51</span></h2>
<h2><span class="ac">Cicero to Atticus</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">I am dispatching this letter on 10 May, just before leaving Pompeii for the Trebula country, where I am to stay the night with Pontius. After that I propose to travel by full normal stages without any delays. While I was at Cumae I was very much pleased to receive a visit from our friend Hortensius. When he asked if I had any commissions, I replied in general terms except on one point: I particularly requested him, so far as in him lay, not to let my term of office be extended. I should be grateful if you would drive this home, and tell him how much I appreciate his coming to see me and promising this and any other service that may be called for. I have confirmed our friend Furnius in the same cause; he is clearly going to be Tribune in a year’s time.</p>
<p>My place at Cumae was a Rome in miniature—so many people about down here. Among them was our little Rufus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_29_1" id="target_note_LCL008_29_1"><sup>1</sup></a> who, finding himself under observation by Vestorius, foiled him by a little ruse—he came nowhere near or by me. Odd, you may think. Hortensius called—a sick man, sucha long way, and Hortensius to boot—and a great multitude besides, but not Rufus? Not Rufus. Didn’t I see him then? How could I help seeing him when I walked through Puteoli bazaar? I said good morning to him there (he had some business on hand no doubt), and on a later occasion good-bye—as he was coming out of his villa he took his leave of me. Who could accuse <span class="italic">him</span> of failing in gratitude?</p>
