if they are defeated. Theirs is the more honourable calamity. These thoughts torment me.

True, there is not so much glory in it as in Cato’s, but at any rate it is free both of risk and of suffering. At the bottom comes that of the people in Achaea. But even they are better off than I in that there are many of them in one place and when they do come back to Italy they will go straight to their own homes. Well, do continue to put a better face on my position, as you are doing, and to get as many people as you can to approve it.</p>
<p>You excuse yourself; but I am fully aware of your reasons and think it is in my own interest that you should be in Rome, if only to say what needs saying to the right people on my behalf, as you have already done. One thing I would ask you to note particularly. I think there are many who have informed Caesar, or will do, that I regret my action or that I do not approve of what goes on. Both are true, but these people say it out of spite against me, not because they have seen it is so. But everything depends on Balbus and Oppius standing up against such insinuations and confirming Caesar’s disposition towards me with frequent letters. Please use your endeavours to get them to do just that. Another reason why I don’t want you to leave Rome is that you say you are being pressed.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL097_207_4" id="target_note_LCL097_207_4"><sup>4</sup></a> Oh dear, what am I to write or wish?

Tears and grief stop me from dwelling on this topic longer. I shall only say this much, that nothing is more grateful to me than your affection for her.</p>
