<p class="noindent">Please see that my excuses are made to Appuleius from day to day, since a once for all excuse does not seem advisable. In this lonely place I do not talk to a soul. Early in the day I hide myself in a thick, thorny wood, and don’t emerge till evening. Next to yourself solitude is my best friend. When I am alone all my conversation is with books, but it is interrupted by fits of weeping, against which I struggle as best I can. But so far it is an unequal fight. I shall answer Brutus as you recommend. You shall have the letter tomorrow. Forward it when you have the opportunity.</p>

<p class="noindent">I wouldn’t have you leave your own affairs to visit me; better for me to come to you if you are going to be held up for some considerable time. I would never have gone out of your sight if it had not been that nothing, <span class="italic">nothing</span> was any use to me. But if any relief were possible it would be in you and you only; and as soon as anyone can give it, that person will be you. And yet at this moment I cannot bear to be away from you. But we agreed that your house was not suitable, and I cannot stay in mine; and even if I were somewhere closer by, I should still not be in your company. The same thing that is holding you up now would still hold you up and prevent you from spending much time with me.
