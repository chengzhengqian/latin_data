<h2><span class="italic">Rome, about 1 July 54</span></h2>
<h2><span class="ac">Cicero to Atticus</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">The very fact that this letter is in a secretary’s hand will show you how busy I am. I have no fault to find with you about the frequency of your letters, but most of them merely tell me your whereabouts in that they carry your address, or give the further information that you are well. I was particularly pleased by two of this sort, dispatched about the same time from your house at Buthrotum, for I wanted to know that you had had a good voyage. But this spate of letters has gratified me more by quantity than quality. Now the one you gave your guest M. Paccius really <span class="italic">was</span> a substantial epistle, full of matter. So I shall reply to that, and begin by saying that I have shown Paccius both in word and deed how heavily a recommendation from you counts. Accordingly he is in my inner circle, though I had never met him previously.</p>
<p>Now to the other points. Varro, of whom you write to me, shall have a place somewhere, provided there <span class="italic">is</span> a place. But you know the form of my dialogues. Just as in my work on Oratory, of which you speak so very handsomely, none of those taking part in the discussion could make mention of persons other than those they had known or heard, in the same way I have put this discussion on the State that I have embarked upon into the mouths of Africanus, Philus, Laelius and Manilius, with the addition of some young men, Q. Tubero, P. Rutilius, and Laelius’ two sons-in-law, Scaevola and Fannius. So I am thinking of making a suitable occasion to address him in one of the prefaces which I am writing to each book, as Aristotle did </p></section><notes></notes></section>
