<p>But I am now getting more laconic in my letters to you, being uncertain whether you are in Rome or already gone. However as long as my ignorance on that point continues I shall write something rather than run the risk of your not getting a letter from me when you might have got one. Not that I have any more commissions to give you or anything to tell you. I gave you all my commissions, and I am sure they will be faithfully discharged, as you promise. I shall tell you news when I have any to tell. One thing I shall persist in as long as I think you are in town, and that is in soliciting you about Caesar’s loan, to leave it settled. I am eagerly expecting a letter from you, more especially to learn the date of your departure.</p>

<h2>100 (V.7)</h2>

<h2><span class="ac">Cicero to Atticus</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">Every day, or rather from day to day, my letters to you grow shorter, for every day I suspect more strongly that you have already left for Epirus. However, to let you know that I have not forgotten your commission about which I wrote the other day, Pompey says that he is going to appoint five new Prefects in either province to get them exemption from jury service.</p>
<p>As for me, after spending three days in Pompey’s company and at Pompey’s house I am setting out for Brundisium on 22 May. I leave him in the most patriotic dispositions, fully prepared to be a bulwark against the dangers threatening. I shall expect a letter to tell me how you are and also where you are.</p>
