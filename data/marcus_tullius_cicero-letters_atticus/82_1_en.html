Oh dear, why are you not here? Nothing, I am sure, would escape you, whereas I perhaps am blind and hold too fast to that which is good.</p>
<p>The truth is that the present regime is the most infamous, disgraceful, and uniformly odious to all sorts and classes and ages of men that ever was, more so upon my word than I could have wished, let alone expected. These ‘popular’ politicians have taught even quiet folk to hiss.

They hold nobody by good will; that they may find it necessary to use terror is what I am afraid of.

At the Games of Apollo Diphilus the actor attacked poor Pompey quite brutally: ‘To our misfortune are you Great’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL007_191_5" id="target_note_LCL007_191_5"><sup>5</sup></a> —there were a dozen <span class="italic">encores.</span></p>
