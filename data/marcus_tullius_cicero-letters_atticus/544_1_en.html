<p>You have given my speech for Ligarius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_71_1" id="target_note_LCL491_71_1"><sup>1</sup></a> a splendid puff. Whatever I write in future, I’ll leave the advertising to you. As to what you say about Varro,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_71_2" id="target_note_LCL491_71_2"><sup>2</sup></a> you know that formerly I was in the habit of writing speeches or other things of a kind which did not allow of my working Varro in. Then, when I began these more erudite compositions, Varro had already announced his intention of making me a really fine, weighty dedication.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_71_3" id="target_note_LCL491_71_3"><sup>3</sup></a> Two years have gone by during which, slow-coach that he is, he has been running hard without advancing a foot. I for my part was making ready to pay him for his offering ‘in measure like, and better too’—that is, if I could, for even Hesiod adds ‘if you can.’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_71_4" id="target_note_LCL491_71_4"><sup>4</sup></a> As things stand, I have pledged my work ‘On the Limits’, of which I have a tolerably good opinion, to Brutus, and you tell me that he is not averse. So let us transfer the Academical treatise, in which aristocratic but by no means learned personages talk above their own heads, to Varro. The standpoint is that of Antiochus, of which he highly approves. I’ll make it up to Catulus and Lucullus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_71_5" id="target_note_LCL491_71_5"><sup>5</sup></a> elsewhere, that is if you approve the idea; and would you kindly write back to me about it?</p>
<p>I have had a letter from Vestorius about the Brinnius auction. He says that the matter was put in my hands without any argument. No doubt they thought I should be in Rome or at Tusculum on 24 June. So please ask my coheir, your friend Suettius, or our friend Labeo to have the auction deferred a little, and say that I shall be at Tusculum around the Nones. Please talk to Piso—you have Eros with you. Let us put our whole minds on the Scapula property. There is not long to go now.</p>
