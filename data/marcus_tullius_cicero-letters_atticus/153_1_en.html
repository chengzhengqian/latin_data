<p class="noindent">Our friend Vestorius has written informing me that he thinks you left Rome on 10 May later than you had told me because you had not been well. If you are now better, I am very glad. I should be grateful if you would write to your house in Rome and tell them to give me free access to your books just as if you were at home yourself, Varro’s among the rest. I need certain things in these books for the work I have in hand,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL007_333_1" id="target_note_LCL007_333_1"><sup>1</sup></a> which I hope you are going to like more than a little.</p>
<p>If you happen to have any news, from my brother Quintus in the first place and from C. Caesar in the second, or anything about the elections and politics (you are generally pretty good at getting wind of such things), I’d be grateful if you would write to me about it. If you haven’t anything, write something or other all the same. Never have I found any letter of yours unseasonable or garrulous. But most of all let me beg you to come back to us as soon as possible, when you have finished your business and your whole trip prosperously and to your satisfaction. Give my regards to Dionysius. Take good care of yourself.</p>
