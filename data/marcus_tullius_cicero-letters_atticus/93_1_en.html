Curio took this to his father, and he to Pompey. The matter was brought before the Senate. When Vettius was brought in, he denied at first having ever passed the time of day with Curio, not however for very long; for he presently asked leave to turn state’s evidence. There was a roar of protest. None the less Vettius explained that a group of young men had been formed under Curio’s leadership, including at the start Paulus, Caepio (Brutus),<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL007_213_1" id="target_note_LCL007_213_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and Lentulus, the Flamen’s son (with his father’s knowledge). Later C. Septimius, Bibulus’ official secretary, had brought Vettius a dagger from his chief. This was completely scouted—the idea that Vettius could not have come by a dagger unless the Consul had given him one. A further reason for rejecting the tale was that the same Bibulus had sent information to Pompey on the 13th, warning him of a plot, for which Pompey had thanked him. Curio junior was brought into the House and made a reply to what Vettius had said. Fault was then found with Vettius’ story on one point in particular. He had stated that the young men’s plan had been to attack Pompey in the Forum during Gabinius’ gladiator show and that Paulus was the ringleader. Paulus, however, was by general knowledge in Macedonia at that time. The Senate passed a decree that Vettius, since he had confessed to carrying a weapon, should be put in chains, and that any person compassing his release would be acting against the interests of the state. The view generally held is that according to the original plan Vettius was to have been arrested in the Forum with a dagger on his person, and his slaves likewise with weapons. He would then have offered to turn informer.</p>
