<p class="noindent">I have no news really, nothing subsequent to the letter I gave to your freedman Philogenes, but as I am sending Philotimus back to Rome I must write you something. I’ll begin with my biggest worry, not that you can be of any help. How should you? The matter is actual and you are far, far away,</p>

<p class="noindent">The day is creeping up, as you see—I must leave the province on 30 July—and my successor is not appointed. Whom am I to leave in charge of the province? In principle and in the general expectation my brother is the man, firstly because it has the appearance of an honour, so nobody has a better claim; second, because he is the only man of praetorian rank available. Pomptinus has already left me according to covenant—he came out on that condition. Nobody thinks the Quaestor fit for the position. He is irresponsible, licentious, and light-fingered. As for my brother, there is this to begin with: I don’t think he could be persuaded. He hates the province, and certainly nothing could be more boring and disagreeable. Second, granted that he might not care to say no to me, where does my duty lie? There is thought to be a major war in Syria which looks as though it will erupt into this province, there is no means of defence here, only one year’s credits have been voted. In such circumstances can I as a good brother leave Quintus in charge? And can I as a good public servant </p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL008_145_1"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL008_145_1" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">1</sup>Greek quotation of unknown provenance.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL008_145_1').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
