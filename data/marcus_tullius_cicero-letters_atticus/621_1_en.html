to me, that we are not likely to live in peace (?). But even supposing I am deceived in that,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_225_4" id="target_note_LCL491_225_4"><sup>4</sup></a> <span class="italic">you</span> shall not be disappointed over Buthrotum. About Octavian’s speech I feel as you do, and I don’t like the look of the preparations for his show<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_225_5" id="target_note_LCL491_225_5"><sup>5</sup></a> or the choice of Matius and Postumus as his agents. Saserna is a worthy colleague. But all these gentry, as you realize, fear peace no less than we fear war. I should be happy if Balbus could be relieved of unpopularity by me, but he himself has no faith in such a possibility. Therefore he has other ideas in mind.</p>

Flamma’s fair words do no harm. What the case of the people of Tyndaris may be which is worrying * I don’t know. You people (?) however will see to it (?). These things seem to disturb the Gastronome,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_225_7" id="target_note_LCL491_225_7"><sup>7</sup></a> especially the disbursement of money. I am grieved about Alexio, but since he had fallen victim to such a terrible disease I think we cannot wish it otherwise. I should however like to know the names of the reversionary heirs and the date of the will.</p>
