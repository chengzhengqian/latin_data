the gods, if any of them is interested, must provide.

<p>Pompey arrived at his Cuman villa on Shepherds’ Day, and at once sent a messenger to me with his compliments. That was yesterday, and I am just going over to him early today as I write this.</p>

<p class="noindent">I should be very glad to know whether the Tribunes are holding up the census by voiding<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL007_327_1" id="target_note_LCL007_327_1"><sup>1</sup></a> the days (there is a rumour here to that effect), and what they are doing and proposing to do about the Censorship generally. I have been with Pompey here. He discussed politics with me a good deal, not without much self-dissatisfaction from what he said (one has to put it that way in his case), scorning Syria, spurning Spain—again, from what he said. Indeed, every time we speak of Pompey I think it should be with this refrain, like ‘This also says Phocylides.’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL007_327_2" id="target_note_LCL007_327_2"><sup>2</sup></a> He further spoke appreciatively of your undertaking to arrange his art collection. Towards myself I must say he was most agreeably effusive. He also paid a visit to my place at Cumae on the 25th. It seemed to me that the last thing he wants is for Messalla to stand for the Consulship. If you know anything on that subject by the way, I should like to know too.</p>
