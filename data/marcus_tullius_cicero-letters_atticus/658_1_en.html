I feel this especially because if the validity of such reviews is weakened Caesar’s measures are likely to be called in question, the confirmation of which is desired in the interest of public tranquillity not only by persons to whose advantage it is but even by those who disapprove of them. But though all that may be true, it is important to us that Plancus should take this course in a ready, cordial spirit, as he certainly will if you bring into play that little streak of determination which I have often observed in you and the charm in which I don’t know your match.

And certainly I have never doubted your friendly feelings or ceased to entertain the like towards you.

May I most earnestly beg of you, my dear Cupiennius, to do this?</p>
