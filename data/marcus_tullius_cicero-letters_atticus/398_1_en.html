<p class="noindent">About my plans in general I have already written to you, I think in sufficient detail. About the day nothing really can be said for certain except that it must not be before the new moon. Curio’s talk the next day was to much the same general effect, except that he intimated still more plainly that he sees no way out of the present situation.</p>
<p>As for what you enjoin upon me about governing a certain person<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL097_127_1" id="target_note_LCL097_127_1"><sup>1</sup></a>—‘Arcady<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL097_127_2" id="target_note_LCL097_127_2"><sup>2</sup></a> . . .’! However, I shall leave no stone unturned. If only <span class="italic">you</span>—but I must not impose. I conveyed your letter to Vestorius at once. He had been wondering a good deal why he had not heard. Vettienus’ language to you was more suitable than his letter to me. But I really can’t sufficiently wonder at his offhandedness. When Philotimus told me that he could buy that lodge from Canuleius for HS 50,000 and that the price would be even less if I approached Vettienus, I did so, asking him to get it reduced if he could. He promised, then wrote to me the other day that he had bought the place for HS 30,000; I must write to say to whom I wanted it assigned; settlement day, Ides of November. I replied with some irritation, but in the way of friendly joking. Now, since he is behaving handsomely, I have nothing against him and have written to tell him that you have given me the facts.</p>
<p>Please let me know about your journey, what you plan and when.</p>
<p>16 April.</p>
