<h2>162A (VIII.12A)</h2>

<p class="noindent">Holding as I do that while we are scattered we can neither be of use to the state nor any protection to one another, I wrote to L. Domitius asking him first to join me himself with his entire force; and if he hesitated for himself I asked him to send me the nineteen cohorts which were on their way to me from Picenum. What I feared has happened. Domitius is in the toils, and has neither the strength to take the field himself, having distributed my nineteen and his own twelve cohorts between three towns (he stationed some at Alba and some at Sulmo), nor the means of extricating himself if he wished.</p>
<p>I must tell you that I am now in the utmost anxiety. On the one hand I am eager to free so many brave men of such quality from the danger of a siege. On the other, I cannot go to their assistance because I do not think I can trust the two legions at my disposal so far as to take them there. Actually I have not been able to assemble more than fourteen cohorts out of their complement because I have sent a garrison to Brundisium and did not think that Canusium should be left empty of a garrison during my absence.</p>
<p>Hoping to have a larger force I sent you word by D. Laelius that, if you saw fit, one or other of you should join me, while his colleague should proceed to Sicily with the force which you raised in Capua and the surrounding area and with the troops recruited by Faustus, that Domitius with his own twelve cohorts should be attached to this force, and that all remaining forces should be concentrated </p></section><notes></notes></section>
