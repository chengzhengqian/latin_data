<p class="noindent">Until I get settled somewhere you must not expect my letters to be long or always in my own hand, but when I have the leisure I shall guarantee both. At present we are en route, and it is a hot and dusty road. I sent off a letter from Ephesus yesterday and I am sending this from Tralles. I expect to be in my province on the Kalends of August. From that day, if you love me, start moving the calendar. Meanwhile certain welcome reports are coming in, first of quiet from the Parthian quarter, second of the conclusion of the tax farmers’ agreements, lastly of a military mutiny pacified by Appius and arrears of pay discharged up to the Ides of July.</p>
<p>Asia has given me a marvellous reception. No one is a penny the poorer for my coming. I think that all my company are jealous for my good name. None the less I am very apprehensive, but hope for the best. All my party has now arrived with the exception of your friend Tullius. I propose to go straight to the army and devote the remaining summer months to campaigning, the winter ones to administering justice.</p>
<p>Knowing my curiosity about politics to be quite as keen as your own, I hope you will tell me everything, what is going on and what is to come. You can’t do me a greater kindness, or rather only one, the greatest of all, and that is to dispatch my commissions, above all that ‘domesticity’ which you know lies nearest my heart.</p>
<p>Here then is a letter fully of hurry and dust. Those to follow will be more detailed.</p>
