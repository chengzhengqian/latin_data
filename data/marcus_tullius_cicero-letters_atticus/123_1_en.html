Your second letter, contrary to your custom, is undated, but you give sufficient indication as to when it was written, for you say you wrote on the very day that the eight Tribunes promulgated their law,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL007_273_1" id="target_note_LCL007_273_1"><sup>1</sup></a> i.e. 29 October, and you explain the good you think the promulgation has done. If by this time all hope of my restoration has gone the same way as the bill, I wish you may care enough for me to find my idle solicitude on the subject pitiable rather than foolish. If however there is still hope, I trust you will use your endeavours so that in future the magistrates who are on my side champion me with more circumspection.</p>
<p>That bill of the old Tribunes had three clauses, the first concerning my return. This was carelessly drafted, for it restores nothing except my citizenship and rank. That is enough for me in my present plight, but you must see what points ought to have been provided for and how. The second clause, on impunity, is common form: ‘should there be any contravention of other laws in consequence of this law.’ As for the third clause—my dear Pomponius, do ask yourself why it was put in and by whom.</p>
<p>Clodius, as you know, attached sanctions to his bill to make it almost or quite impossible for it to be invalidated either by the Senate or by the Assembly. But precedent shows you that such sanctions have never been observed in the case of laws to be repealed. Otherwise it would be virtually impossible to repeal any law, for there is none but protects itself by putting difficulties in the way of repeal. But when a law is repealed, the provision against repeal is repealed at the same time. This being so, not only in fact </p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL007_273_1"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL007_273_1" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">1</sup>For Cicero’s recall.
