<p class="noindent">You suggested in one of your letters that I might start writing to Caesar in a more expansive style. So when Balbus mentioned to me at Lanuvium the other day that he and Oppius had told Caesar that I had read his book against Cato and highly approved of it, I composed a letter to Caesar about this same book with the idea of submitting it to Dolabella. I sent a copy however to Oppius and Balbus, asking them to have my letter sent on to Dolabella if they themselves approved of the copy. They have written back that they never read anything better and they have had my letter forwarded to Dolabella.</p>
<p>Vestorius has written to ask me to convey my share in the Brinnius farm to a slave of his for the benefit of a certain Hetereius, so that he himself can convey it to him at Puteoli in due form.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_127_1" id="target_note_LCL491_127_1"><sup>1</sup></a> If you think fit, send me the slave—for I suppose Vestorius has written to you as well.</p>
