<h2>360 (XIV.6)</h2>
<h2><span class="italic">Fundi, 12 April 44</span></h2>
<h2><span class="ac">Cicero to Atticus</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">I got your letter at Fundi on the 12th while at dinner. In the first place then I learn that you are better, in the second that you have better news. That report about the legions marching was unpleasant—as for Octavius, it’s neither here nor there. I am waiting for what happens about Marius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_151_1" id="target_note_LCL491_151_1"><sup>1</sup></a>—I thought Caesar had got rid of him. Antony’s interview with our heroes is not unsatisfactory in the circumstances. All the same nothing so far gives me pleasure except the Ides of March. Being at Fundi with our friend Ligus it makes me sick to see that rascal Curtilius in possession of Sestullius’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_151_2" id="target_note_LCL491_151_2"><sup>2</sup></a> farm. When I say this I am speaking of the whole <span class="italic">genus.</span> Is it not lamentable that we should be upholding the very things which made us hate Caesar? Are we even to have Consuls and Tribunes of <span class="italic">his</span> choosing for two years to come? I cannot see how I could possibly take part in politics. It is the acme of incongruity that the tyrannicides should be lauded to the skies while the tyrant’s actions are protected. But you see our Consuls and the rest of our magistrates, if these people <span class="italic">are</span> magistrates, and the apathy of the honest men. In the country towns they are jumping for joy. I cannot tell you how delighted they are, how they flock to me, how eager they are to hear what I have to say on the state of the country. And yet with all this no decrees! We have so managed our affairs that we go in fear of the defeated party.</p>
