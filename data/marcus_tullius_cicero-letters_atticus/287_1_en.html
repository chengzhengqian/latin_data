today (the 3rd) to join the Consuls, having been instructed to report there on the Nones.</p>
<p>Pompey’s reply is said to be popular and to have gained the approval of a public meeting. This is what I expected. If Caesar rejects it, he will be generally condemned; if he accepts, he will have won the game. You will ask which I prefer. I should answer that if I knew the state of our preparations. There is a report here that Cassius has been thrown out of Ancona and that the town is in our hands. A useful bit of work, if it is to be war. As for Caesar, they say that notwithstanding L. Caesar’s peace mission he is intensely active in raising troops, occupying positions, and securing them with garrisons. Unscrupulous brigand! Can any peace make up for this national disgrace? But I must curb my temper, accept the necessities of the hour, and go to Spain with Pompey. That is the best to be made of a bad job, seeing that we did not protect the commonwealth from Caesar’s second Consulship even when we were given the chance. But enough of this.</p>
<p>I forgot to write to you before about Dionysius, but what I have decided to do is to wait for Caesar’s reply. If we return to Rome he can wait for us there; if that is postponed, I shall send for him then. To be sure I know what he ought to have done when I fled the capital, what was becoming in a man of his attainments and a friend, especially when he was asked; but I don’t expect too much in this way from Greeks. You will however take care not to trouble him against his will if<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_253_1" id="target_note_LCL008_253_1"><sup>1</sup></a> I have to send for him, which I hope will be unnecessary.</p>
<p>My brother Quintus is much concerned to pay his debt to you through Egnatius,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_253_2" id="target_note_LCL008_253_2"><sup>2</sup></a> nor does Egnatius lack the will and he is sufficiently well off.
