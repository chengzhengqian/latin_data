Caecilius (‘when I went early from the harbour to Piraeus’), for his Latinity is not much to go by, but Terence, whose plays were supposed from the elegance of their diction to be the work of C. Laelius: ‘Yesterday a party of us young fellows went to Piraeus’ and ‘The trader added that she was taken from Sunium’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_201_15" id="target_note_LCL008_201_15"><sup>15</sup></a>—if we are going to say that demes are towns, then Sunium is as much a town as Piraeus.</p>
<p>But since you have turned schoolmaster, perhaps you will once for all solve my problem for me and take a big load off my mind. Caesar sends me smooth letters and Balbus does the same on his behalf. I am determined not to stray an inch from the path of strict honour. But you know how much I still owe him. Don’t you think there is a danger of having it thrown in my teeth by someone or other if I take a weak line or payment demanded if I take a strong one? What do you suggest? ‘Pay up’ perhaps. All right, I’ll borrow from Caelius!<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_201_16" id="target_note_LCL008_201_16"><sup>16</sup></a> But I would like you to give it your consideration. I suppose that if I ever make a fine patriotic speech in the Senate your friend from Tartessus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_201_17" id="target_note_LCL008_201_17"><sup>17</sup></a> will politely ask me for a banker’s draft on my way out!</p>
<p>Now, let me see. Oh yes, my son-in-law. We all find him charming, Tullia, Terentia, myself. He is as clever and agreeable as you please. Other characteristics, of which you are aware, we must put up with. After all you know what the rejected suitors were like (?). Every man of them, except the one<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_201_18" id="target_note_LCL008_201_18"><sup>18</sup></a> in whose case you were intermediary, would have put me into debt—nobody would advance <span class="italic">them</span> a penny. But of all this when we meet; it will take a good deal of talking over.</p>
