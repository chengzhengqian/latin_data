<h2>240 (XII.4)</h2>
<h2><span class="italic">Tusculum, May (?) 46</span></h2>
<h2><span class="ac">Cicero to Atticus</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">Many thanks for your most welcome and agreeable letter. The fact is that you have given me back my holiday—Tiro’s saying that he thought you looked <span class="italic">échauffé</span> had made me acutely uneasy. So I’ll add one more day, as you advise.</p>
<p>Now about the <span class="italic">Cato</span>:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL097_265_1" id="target_note_LCL097_265_1"><sup>1</sup></a> it’s a problem for an Archimedes. I cannot work anything out which your boon companions<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL097_265_2" id="target_note_LCL097_265_2"><sup>2</sup></a> would read with equanimity, let alone enjoyment. Even if I were to keep clear of his speeches in the Senate and his whole political outlook and opinions and choose simply to praise his seriousness of purpose and steadfastness, even this would grate upon their ears. But no genuine eulogy of that remarkable man is possible without paying tribute to the way he foresaw our present situation and strove to avert it and abandoned his life rather than witness it in actuality. Can any of that be made acceptable to Aledius?</p>
<p>Now do, I beg you, take care of your health and apply the sagacity which you bring to all matters first and foremost to regaining your strength.</p>
