July. If they go through without bribery, as it is believed they will, Cato will have done more single-handed than all the laws and all the jurymen.</p>
<p>I am defending Messius, who has been recalled from his Commissionership—Appius had given him one on Caesar’s staff. Servilius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_9_14" id="target_note_LCL008_9_14"><sup>14</sup></a> issued an edict requiring him to attend. He has for tribes the Pomptine, the Veline, and the Maecian.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_9_15" id="target_note_LCL008_9_15"><sup>15</sup></a> We are making a game fight of it, but we have all we can do. Then I get ready for Drusus, from him to Scaurus.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_9_16a" id="target_note_LCL008_9_16a"><sup>16</sup></a> Fine titles for my speeches I’m collecting! Perhaps the Consuls-Designate will come next. If Scaurus is not one of them, he’ll have a difficult passage in this trial.</p>
<p>From a letter of my brother’s I guess that he is already in Britain. I am waiting in suspense to hear how he is getting on. One thing has been achieved anyhow, as I can judge by many substantial tokens—I stand very high in Caesar’s regard and favour.</p>
<p>Remember me to Dionysius, and ask him to persuade you to come back as soon as possible, so that he can instruct my Marcus and myself too.</p>
