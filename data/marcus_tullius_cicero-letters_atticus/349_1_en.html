<p>Ought a man to remain in his country under a despotism? Ought he to strive for the overthrow of a despotism by every means, even if the existence of the state is going to be endangered thereby? Ought he to beware of the overthrower lest <span class="italic">he</span> be set up as a despot? Ought he to try to help his country under a despotism by taking opportunity as it comes and by words rather than by war? Ought a statesman to live quietly in retirement while his country is under a despotism or ought he to take every risk for freedom’s sake? Is it right to make war against one’s land and blockade it when it is under despotic rule? Ought a man to enrol himself on the side of the best citizens even if he does not approve of overthrowing the despotism by war? Ought he in politics to join in the dangers of his friends and benefactors even though he does not approve of their actions in capital matters? Ought a man who has rendered his country great service and has on that account brought himself irreparable suffering and hostility voluntarily to incur danger on his country’s behalf, or may he be allowed to begin to think of himself and his family, giving up political opposition to those in power?</p>
<p>Practising myself upon these questions and setting out the arguments on either side, now in Greek now in Latin, I take my mind for a while off my troubles and at the same time ponder matters of relevance. But I am afraid I come upon you at the wrong moment, for if the bearer of this letter has made decent time it will have reached you just on the day of your attack.</p>
