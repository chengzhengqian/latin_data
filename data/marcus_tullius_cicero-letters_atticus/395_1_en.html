suits your affection for him or my own, you must forgive me if the report is true and correct my error to my own rejoicing if it is false. However it turns out to be, I am sure you will not hold either his uncle or his father to blame.</p>
<p>I had written this much when a message arrived from Curio that he is coming to see me. He arrived at his place at Cumae yesterday evening, i.e. on the Ides. If he says anything worth writing to you I shall add it to this letter.</p>
<p>Curio passed my house and left word for me that he would be here shortly. He then rushed off to Puteoli to address a meeting there. He made his speech, returned, and paid me quite a lengthy visit. Horrible! You know what he is like. He kept nothing back. To begin with he says that nothing is more certain than that all persons condemned under the lex Pompeia are to be rehabilitated; so he himself would be using their services in Sicily. As for the Spanish provinces, he had no doubt they were Caesar’s. From there Caesar and his army would go wherever Pompey was. Pompey’s death would constitute his goal. It had been touch and go. He added that Caesar had been quite carried away with rage against the Tribune Metellus and had wanted to have him killed;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL097_121_4" id="target_note_LCL097_121_4"><sup>4</sup></a> in which case there would have been a great massacre. There were any number of people urging him that way, and as for Caesar himself, it was not by inclination or nature that he was not cruel but because he reckoned that clemency was the popular line. If he lost favour with the public he would be cruel. He was upset because he realized that even the populace had not liked his behaviour over the Treasury. So although he had had every intention of holding a public meeting before he left, he had not dared to do so and had set off in a very agitated state of mind.</p>
