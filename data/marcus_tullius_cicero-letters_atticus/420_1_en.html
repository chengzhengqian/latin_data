<p class="noindent">A wretched life we lead! To be so long prey to fear is surely worse than the actuality we are afraid of. Servius, having arrived on the Nones of May (see my earlier letter), came to my house early next morning. Not to keep you in suspense, we found no future in any plan. Never have I seen a man in such a quaver! Yet I must admit that none of his bogies was imaginary. ‘Pompey was angry with him, Caesar no friend. The victory of either was a dreadful prospect, not only because one was cruel<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL097_171_1" id="target_note_LCL097_171_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and the other unscrupulous, but because of the straits both were in for money, which could only be extracted from private property.’ As he said all this he shed so many tears that I wondered such length of misery had not dried them up! As for me, even this ophthalmia which prevents me writing to you in my own hand doesn’t bring tears, but it annoys me the oftener because I am so much awake. So please collect anything you have to offer in the way of comfort and send it, I don’t mean from philosophy and books (that I have at home, but somehow the medicine is not strong enough for the malady)—no, but scrape up the news about Spain and Massilia, that sort of thing. As brought by Servius it sounds pretty satisfactory, and he says there is respectable authority for the report about the two legions.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL097_171_2" id="target_note_LCL097_171_2"><sup>2</sup></a> That’s what I want then if you have it, and more of the same order. You are bound to hear something in the next few days.</p>
<p>To go back to Servius; we adjourned our talk till tomorrow,
