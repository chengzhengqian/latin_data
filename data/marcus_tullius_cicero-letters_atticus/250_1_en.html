<p>Being who? You yourself of course, the encomiast of my doings and writings.</p>
<p>I escaped this dilemma during the two earlier Marcel-line Consulships<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_179_7" id="target_note_LCL008_179_7"><sup>7</sup></a> when the Senate discussed Caesar’s command; now I am coming in just at the crisis. Accordingly, ‘to let the dunce state his opinion first,’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_179_8" id="target_note_LCL008_179_8"><sup>8</sup></a> I am strongly in favour of my doing something about a Triumph, and so staying outside Rome with the best possible excuse.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_179_9" id="target_note_LCL008_179_9"><sup>9</sup></a> Even so they will try to draw a statement of my views. You may laugh when I say it, but I wish to heaven I was still back there in my province. It would really have been better, if this was hanging over us. Not that anything could have been more wretched. En passant, I want you to know that all those fine things at the start, which you too used to praise sky-high in your letters, were only veneer. How far from easy a thing is virtue, how difficult its simulation for any length of time! I felt it would be a fine and proper thing to leave Quaestor C. Coelius a year’s maintenance and to return a million sesterces to the Treasury out of the year’s expense allowance decreed to me. My staff set up a wail, thinking the whole amount ought to be disbursed among themselves, so that I, if you please, should show myself up as a better friend to the treasuries of Phrygians and Cilicians than to our own! But they left me unmoved. My own good name came first with me, while on the other hand I have left nothing undone that I could do for anyone in the way of marks of consideration. However, let this be, in the words of Thucydides, a not unprofitable digression.</p>
<p>Now you must think about my position: first, what device I can use to act up to Caesar’s friendliness, second, about the Triumph itself, which, as I see it, will be easy enough to come by, unless political developments intervene. </p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL008_179_7"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL008_179_7" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">7</sup>I.e., in 51 and 50.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL008_179_7').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note inline" id="note_LCL008_179_8"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL008_179_8" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">8</sup>Apparently a verse proverb, rather like ‘Fools rush in where angels fear to tread.’</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL008_179_8').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL008_179_9"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL008_179_9" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">9</sup>If Cicero went inside the ancient city boundary he would automatically lose his proconsular status and forfeit the prospect of a Triumph.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL008_179_9').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
