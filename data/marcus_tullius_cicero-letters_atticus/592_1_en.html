Then there is Deiotarus’ case. Isn’t it much the same? No doubt he deserves any kingdom we can give him, but not through Fulvia.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_167_3" id="target_note_LCL491_167_3"><sup>3</sup></a> There are any number of such doings. However it brings me back to this: surely we shall gain our point at least in part in so well-known, well-attested, and just a cause as that of Buthrotum. The greater the number of such operations the more confident we can be.</p>
<p>Octavius is with me here—most respectful and friendly. His followers call him Caesar, but Philippus does not, so neither do I. My judgement is that he cannot be a good citizen. There are too many around him. They threaten death to our friends and call the present state of things intolerable. What do you think they will say when the boy comes to Rome, where our liberators cannot go safe?

But this comes of my too easygoing nature. Time was when that sort of thing was more or less necessary, but now, stand things as they may, it’s not the same.</p>
<p>What a long time it is since I had anything to write to you about! Still I go on writing, not to give you pleasure with my letters but to evoke yours.
