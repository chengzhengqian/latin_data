to obey the letter. I then sent L. Lamia to him to explain that Caesar had told Dolabella to write to me and ask me to come to Italy as soon as possible, and that I had come in consequence of Dolabella’s letter. Antony then published an edict, exempting me and Laelius by name. I must say I wish he had not done that—the <span class="italic">case</span> could have been exempted without mentioning names.</p>
<p>What a multitude of galling vexations! You try to soften them, and I do not say without success. Indeed you lighten my distress by the very fact that you are at such pains to lighten it, and I hope you will not find it too much trouble to do this as often as possible. You will best achieve your aim if you bring me to believe that I have not utterly forfeited the good opinion of the honest men. And yet what can you do there? Obviously, nothing. But if the facts give you opportunity, that will be the best comfort I can have. At present I can see this is not so, but I mean if something turned up, like what has just happened. It used to be said that I ought to have left with Pompey. His death has blunted the edge of the criticism that I neglected my obligations to him.

Perhaps they do not accept my argument, for I hear that many honest men have gone to Africa and I know that many were already there. In this quarter I am hard pressed. Here too I need the help of chance—that there should be some of them or, if possible, all, who put survival first. For if they persevere and prevail, you can see what will become of me. You may ask what will become of <span class="italic">them</span> </p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL097_205_2"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL097_205_2" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">2</sup>The Numidians, whose king, Juba, allied himself with the Republicans.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL097_205_2').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
