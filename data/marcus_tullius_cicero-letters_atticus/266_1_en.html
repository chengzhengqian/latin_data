<h2>130 (VII.7)</h2>

<h2><span class="ac">Cicero to Atticus</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">‘The excellent Dionysius, as I also know him to be, a fine scholar too with a warm affection for you, arrived in Rome on 16 December and gave me a letter from you.’ That, no more and no less, is what you write about Dionysius in your letter. You don’t add, let us say, ‘and he expressed his gratitude to you.’ And yet he certainly ought to have done so, and if he had it would have been unlike your kindly self not to have added it. However I can’t recant about him after the testimonial in my earlier letter. Agreed then that he is a very fine fellow. Indeed I actually feel beholden to him for giving me this insight among others into his character.</p>
<p>Philogenes was correct in what he wrote to you. He paid what he owed. I wanted him to put the money to use for the time allowed. Accordingly he did so for fourteen months.</p>
<p>I hope Pomptinus is getting well. You say he has entered Rome, which makes me uneasy. He would not have done so without a strong reason.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_211_1" id="target_note_LCL008_211_1"><sup>1</sup></a> 2 January being Crossways Day I don’t want to go to Alba that day in case my arrival might be troublesome for the staff. That shall be for the 3rd therefore, and from there to Rome on the 4th. I don’t know what day your fever is due, but I certainly wouldn’t have you think of making a move to the detriment of your health.</p>
<p>With regard to my Triumph, unless Caesar gets up something underhand through his Tribunes, all seems to be calm sailing. Calmest of all is my own mind, which takes the whole business philosophically, all the more so as I hear </p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL008_211_1"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL008_211_1" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">1</sup>Cicero had expected Pomptinus to stay outside the city limits so as to take part as Legate in his own Triumph.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL008_211_1').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
