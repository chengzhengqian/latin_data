<p class="noindent">I didn’t expect you to have any ‘letter day.’ I saw the points you make in your letter, and in any case I suspected, or rather I realized, that there was nothing for you to write about. As for the 8th, I imagined you were away and saw plainly that you had nothing to say. But I shall send to you pretty well every day; I’d rather do so for nothing than that you should not have a bearer if there should by any chance be something you think I ought to know. So I have received a letter from you (on the 10th) which had nothing in it for the good reason that you had nothing to communicate. Still I was not sorry to get what there was—I mean, to know, if nothing else, that you have no news.</p>
<p>You do however say something about Clodia. Where is she then, or when is she coming back? This idea appeals to me so strongly that next to Otho there is nothing I should prefer. But I don’t think she will sell (she likes the place and has plenty of money); and you don’t need me to tell you the difficulties in the other plan. But I beg you, let us rack our brains to find a way to my goal.</p>
<p>I think I shall leave here on the 16th, but I may go either to Tusculum or to my house in town; from there perhaps to Arpinum. When I know definitely I shall send you word.</p>
