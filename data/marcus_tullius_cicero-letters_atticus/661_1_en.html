About Tullius’ trifle of cash, you will take M. Axianus into consultation, as you say. So you have had a word with him of Cosa.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_305_2" id="target_note_LCL491_305_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Excellent! I am glad to note that you are clearing up your own affairs as well as mine. I am delighted to hear that my staff appointment is well regarded. Heaven grant that your promise<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_305_3" id="target_note_LCL491_305_3"><sup>3</sup></a> is fulfilled! My greatest pleasure lies in my own folks.

His father asked me what sort of a reputation she has. I said, not knowing why he asked, that I had heard nothing in particular against her except about her oral habits and her father. ‘But why?’ He answered that his son wanted to marry her.
