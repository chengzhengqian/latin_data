So please get our friend Saufeius to help you. He was always a good friend of mine, all the better now, I imagine, because he has presumably inherited his brother Appius’ affection for me along with the rest of his estate. Appius showed his regard for me on many occasions, notably over Bursa. You will certainly be lifting a big load off my mind.</p>
<p>I don’t like Furnius’ saving clause,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_117_10" id="target_note_LCL008_117_10"><sup>10</sup></a> for the single contingency which he reserves is the only one I am afraid of.

The boys say he has a furious temper; but no one could be more learned or high principled or more attached to you and me.</p>
