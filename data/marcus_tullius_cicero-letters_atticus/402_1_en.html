<p>Shall I be able to keep silence under such humiliation? Shall I be able to bear the sight of Gabinius speaking beside me in the Senate, and even called upon to speak before me? Can I stand the presence of your client<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL097_135_1" id="target_note_LCL097_135_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Cloelius and *’s client Plaguleius and the rest? But I need not enumerate my enemies. What of my friends whom I have defended in the courts? I shall not be able to see them in the Senate House without distress nor to be in their company without discredit. And after all I cannot be certain that this will be open to me. Caesar’s friends write to me that he is by no means satisfied with my conduct in not attending the Senate. Am I really to think of courting when it is dangerous to do so a man whose alliance I refused when it would have brought me profit?</p>
<p>Consider in the second place that the issue of the whole conflict will not be decided in Spain. Or do you think that if Spain goes Pompey will drop his weapons? No, his entire plan is Themistoclean. He reckons that whoever holds the sea is sure to be master. For that reason he was never interested in holding the Spanish provinces for their own sake; his main care was always to fit out a navy. So when the time comes he will put to sea with huge fleets and land in Italy, where I shall be quietly sitting. What will be my position then? Neutrality will no longer be possible. Shall I then take part against him? Could any crime be greater, or as great? What in fine could be more dishonourable?</p>
