However, I have observed moderation in my ‘apotheosis,’ as I told you I should. I shall give myself more rein if <span class="italic">he<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL007_315_2" id="target_note_LCL007_315_2"><sup>2</sup></a></span> receives the offering cordially and if, on the other hand, it wrings the withers of certain gentlemen who object to my owning a villa<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL007_315_3" id="target_note_LCL007_315_3"><sup>3</sup></a> which once belonged to Catulus without recollecting that I bought it from Vettius, and say in the same breath that I ought not to have built my house and that I ought to sell it. But what’s that compared with the fact that when I made speeches in the Senate on lines which even they approved they were delighted none the less that I had spoken against Pompey’s wishes? <span class="italic">Il faut en finir</span>. Since the powerless won’t be my friends, let me try to make myself liked by the powerful. You will say that I might have thought of that sooner. I know you wanted me to do so, and that I have been a prize donkey. But now it’s time for me to love myself since <span class="italic">they</span> won’t love me whatever I do.</p>

<p>Your people have painted my library together with the bookcases and labels. Please commend them.</p>
