<p class="noindent">Sicca was surprised to hear of Silius’ change of mind. For my part it surprises me more that, since he gave his son<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL097_327_1" id="target_note_LCL097_327_1"><sup>1</sup></a> as a reason (not a bad one, as it seems to me, considering what a satisfactory son he has), you say you think he <span class="italic">will</span> sell if we throw in an extra item, one which he turned down after having himself previously agreed to take it. You ask me what limit I fix, and how much higher I rate this property than that of Drusus. I have never visited it. I know that the villa Coponiana<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL097_327_2" id="target_note_LCL097_327_2"><sup>2</sup></a> is old and not large and that there is a fine plantation, but I don’t know what either brings in; though I suppose we ought to know. But both these places are to be valued in terms of my present need rather than by any ordinary reckoning. Whether I can get them or not is for you to consider. If I discounted the Faberius claim I should not hesitate to settle for Silius’ place even on a cash down basis, provided he could be induced to sell. If he refused, I’d turn to Drusus even at the price which Egnatius told you he is asking. Hermogenes<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL097_327_3" id="target_note_LCL097_327_3"><sup>3</sup></a> too can be of great help to us in making cash payment. But do pray allow me to take the attitude of an eager buyer. And yet, yield as I may to my eagerness and my grief, I still want to be guided by you.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL097_327_4" id="target_note_LCL097_327_4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>I have had a letter from Egnatius. If he says anything to you (it is easiest to negotiate through him) please write to me. I think this ought to be followed up, as I don’t see
