<p class="noindent">Caesar has sent us a very short letter of which I append a copy. You will be able to see by its brevity that he is very busy indeed, to write so briefly about a matter of such importance. If there is any further news I shall write to you at once.</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="sc">caesar to oppius and cornelius</span>
On 9 March I reached Brundisium and encamped before the walls. Pompey is in Brundisium. He sent N. Magius to me to treat of peace. I replied as I thought proper. This I wanted you to know at once. As soon as I see any hope of achieving anything in the way of a composition I shall at once inform you.
</p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">You can imagine, my dear Cicero, how I am on tenterhooks for fear anything should obstruct a composition between them, now that I see a hope of peace once more. I do indeed what I can, not being on the spotâ€”pray. If I was with him I might perhaps flatter myself that I could be of some use. As it is I am tortured by suspense.</p>
