at my house. When I asked him in a friendly way what I could do for him he replied that he was looking for Atticus! The arrogance of the Queen herself when she was living on the estate across Tiber makes my blood boil to recall. So I want nothing to do with them. They must think I have no spirit, or rather that I hardly have a spleen.</p>
<p>Eros’ stewardship, it appears, is holding up my departure abroad. From the balances he produced on the Nones of April I ought to be in funds, and yet I am forced to borrow. I thought the proceeds from the sources of income you speak of had been put aside for that shrine. But I have charged Tiro with these matters and sent him to Rome on that account. I did not want to bother you when you have bother enough already. The more modest my boy is in his requests the more concerned I am to meet him. He said nothing in his letter to me about this matter (of course I was the proper person to approach), but wrote to Tiro that nothing had come to him after the Kalends of April, that being the end of his first year. Naturally generous as you are I know that you have always favoured my treating him very liberally, indeed more than liberally—lavishly; and further that you considered I owed it to my position to do so. So please (I should not be troubling you if I could manage it through anyone else) arrange a bill of exchange to Athens for enough to cover his expenses for the year. Eros of course will pay. I have sent Tiro for the purpose. So please see to it and let me know if you have any further views on the subject.</p>
