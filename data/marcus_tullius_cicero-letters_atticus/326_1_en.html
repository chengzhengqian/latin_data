<p>I appreciate your generous and courageous spirit in this matter, but we must be careful to avoid a situation in which we are divided and therefore no match for the enemy, since he has large forces and will soon have larger. It would ill befit your foresight to consider only how many cohorts Caesar has against you at the present moment without regard to the size of the forces, both horse and foot, which he will shortly muster. That is attested by a letter sent to me by Bussenius, in which he says, as do others of my correspondents also, that Curio is mustering the garrisons which were in Umbria and Etruria and marching to join Caesar. If these forces are concentrated at one point, with part of his army sent against Alba and part advancing upon you, Caesar not offering battle but repelling attack from favourable positions, you will find yourself in a trap, unable single-handed with your present force to stand against such numbers for foraging purposes.</p>
<p>Therefore I earnestly urge you to come here as soon as possible with your entire force. The Consuls have decided to do likewise. I sent you word by M. Tuscilius that I must be careful not to let the two legions into sight of Caesar without the cohorts from Picenum. Do not therefore be disturbed if you hear of my retiring should Caesar march against me. I feel I must be on my guard against falling into a trap. I cannot take the field because of the time of year and the disposition of my men, nor would it be wise to collect the garrisons out of all the towns in case I lose my line of retreat. For that reason I have gathered no more than fourteen cohorts at Luceria.</p>
<p>The Consuls will bring off all the garrisons or go to Sicily. We must either have an army strong enough to allow us to feel confident of breaking through or we must hold </p></section><notes></notes></section>
