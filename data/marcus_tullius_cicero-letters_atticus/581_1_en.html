<p>Tusculum today, Lanuvium tomorrow; from there I am thinking of Astura. All is ready for Pilia’s reception, but I could have wished she was bringing Attica. However I forgive you. My love to them both.</p>

<p class="noindent">Your letter anyhow reads like peace. Long may it be so!—Matius said that was not possible. But here come our builders<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_145_1" id="target_note_LCL491_145_1"><sup>1</sup></a> who went to buy corn and have returned empty-handed with a mighty rumour that all the corn in Rome is being carried home to Antony. A canard no doubt, or you would have written. No sign of Balbus’ Corumbus yet. I know the name. He is said to be a pretty good architect.</p>
<p>Your invitation to act as witness<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_145_2" id="target_note_LCL491_145_2"><sup>2</sup></a> is likely to have had a purpose. That is what they want us to think, and for aught I know they may even be sincere. But what is all that to me? Still, do nose out Antony’s state of mind. I think he’s more concerned about the composition of his menus than about planning any mischief.</p>
<p>If you have any news of practical consequence, let me have it in your reply. If not, tell me all about the demonstrations in the theatre and the actors’ jests. Love to Pilia and Attica.</p>
