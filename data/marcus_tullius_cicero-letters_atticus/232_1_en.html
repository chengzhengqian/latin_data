Quite a spendthrift Scaptius is turning out! ‘The notables’ says he ‘so desire.’ I know! They came to me all the way to Ephesus and told me with tears in their eyes of the atrocities of the troopers and their own sufferings. Accordingly I at once sent a letter ordering the departure of the troopers from Cyprus by a certain date, and that among other things is why the people of Salamis have extolled me to the skies in their public resolutions. But what does he want with cavalry <span class="italic">now</span>? The Salaminians are paying up—unless of course we wish to make them pay interest at 4 percent by armed force. Shall I ever dare to read or so much as handle the volumes<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_143_14" id="target_note_LCL008_143_14"><sup>14</sup></a> you praise so warmly if I do anything of the sort? My dearest Atticus, you have really cared too much for Brutus in this matter, and not enough, I fear, for me. However I have written to Brutus telling him what you have written to me.</p>
<p>Now for the rest of my news. I am doing everything possible here on Appius’ behalf, having regard to what is seemly however—but not at all half-heartedly. I have no ill will towards Appius himself, I am fond of Brutus, and Pompey, for whom I must say my regard increases from day to day, makes a very great point of it. Have you heard that C. Coelius is coming here as Quaestor? I don’t know what sort of a fellow he is. I don’t like this about Pammenes. I hope to be in Athens in September. I should much like to know the dates of your journeys. I have learned of Sempronius Rufus’ naïveté from your letter from Corcyra and can only say that I envy Vestorius his power.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_143_15" id="target_note_LCL008_143_15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>I should love to go on gossiping a while longer, but it is light. The crowd presses, Philogenes wants to be off. All good wishes then, and please give the like to Pilia and our dear Caecilia<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_143_16" id="target_note_LCL008_143_16"><sup>16</sup></a> when you write. My Marcus sends his love.</p>
