<p>For myself, what am I to do? How am I to follow, be it by land or sea, a man whose whereabouts I don’t know?—though as to following him by land, that’s impossible. If by sea, to what destination? Shall I then hand myself over to Caesar? Supposing I could do so safely (many urge me that way), can I also do it honourably? Most decidedly not. Well, shall I seek advice from you as usual? The problem is insoluble. None the less if anything occurs to you, please write, and tell me what you yourself are going to do.</p>

<h2>147 (VII.23)</h2>
<h2><span class="italic">Formiae, 10 February 49</span></h2>
<h2><span class="ac">Cicero to Atticus</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">On the evening of 9 February I had a letter from Philotimus to the effect that Domitius has a strong army, that the cohorts from Picenum under Lentulus and Thermus have joined Domitius’ army, that Caesar may be, and is afraid of being, cut off, that the honest men in Rome have taken fresh heart and the villains are pretty well floored. For my part I fear this is all fancy, but M’. Lepidus, L. Torquatus, and C. Cassius the Tribune, who are with me (i.e. in the Formiae district<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_263_1" id="target_note_LCL008_263_1"><sup>1</sup></a>) have been brought back to life by Philotimus’ letter. But I am afraid the other tale has more truth in it, that we are all prisoners outright and Pompey leaving Italy. Caesar (I hate to write it) is said to be in pursuit of him. Caesar pursuing Pompey? For what? To kill him? Oh, God! Why are we not all throwing our bodies in the way? You too must be groaning at the thought. But what can we do? We are beaten, overwhelmed, prisoners pure and simple.</p>
