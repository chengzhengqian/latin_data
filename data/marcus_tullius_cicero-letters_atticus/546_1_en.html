It would be more than the inheritance is worth. And after all there will be ample time for them to get to the auction, which is on the 13th, if they meet me at Tusculum early on the 8th. If, however, they would rather put it off till later, they can do so—two days or three or whatever they like, it’s of no consequence. So keep them back unless they have already set out.</p>

<p class="noindent">I should like you to reflect again and yet again on whether you are in favour of sending Varro what I have written—though you too have a stake in the matter, for let me tell you that you have joined the dialogue as third speaker. I think reflection is called for, though the names are already in; but they can be cancelled or altered.</p>
<p>How, I beg you, is our dear Attica? I have had no word from you for three days, which is not surprising, for no one has come; and perhaps there was no occasion. So on my side I have nothing to say. Today as I dispatch this by Valerius I am expecting one of my own people. If he arrives and brings something from you I dare say I shall not lack matter for a letter.</p>
