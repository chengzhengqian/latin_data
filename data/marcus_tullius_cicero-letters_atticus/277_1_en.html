And yet pity for the boys often makes me waver.</p>
<p>You see my perplexity. You have similar anxieties, but write something, and above all tell me what you think I ought to do if Pompey leaves Italy. M’. Lepidus (we have been together) has fixed that as his limit, L. Torquatus likewise. I am hampered by my lictors among many other embarrassments. It is the most intractable problem I ever met. So I do not ask anything definite from you yet, merely your opinion. Failing that, I want to hear of your puzzlement.</p>
<p>It is pretty well established that Labienus has left Caesar. If it had worked out so that he came to Rome and found the magistrates and Senate there, he would have been of great use to our cause. He would have appeared as having pronounced the guilt of a friend for country’s sake, as indeed he does even now, but he renders less service because he has nobody to render it to. I imagine he regrets his action, unless by any chance the report is untrue and he has not left at all. <span class="italic">We</span> have it for certain.</p>
<p>Although you say you are keeping inside your own gates, I should be grateful if you would make me a sketch of things in Rome. Is Pompey missed? Are there any signs of odium against Caesar? Also tell me what you think about Terentia and Tullia. Should they stay in Rome or with me or in some place of safety? Please let me have a letter about all this or anything else there may be, or rather a series of letters.</p>
