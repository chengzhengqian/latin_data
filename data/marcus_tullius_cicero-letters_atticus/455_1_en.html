he has sent no dispatches since the Ides of December. From that you will see that the tale of the letter dispatched on 9 February, which would have been of no consequence even if it had been true, is in fact untrue. I know that L. Terentius has left Africa and arrived at Paestum. I should like to know what news he brings or how he got out or what is going on in Africa. He is said to have been let go by Nasidius. Tell me about it if you find out. I shall do as you say about the HS 10,000. Good-bye.</p>

<p class="noindent">There is as yet no rumour of the man’s having left Alexandria, on the contrary he is thought to be deeply entangled. So I am not sending Marcus as I had decided, and I must ask <span class="italic">you</span> to get me out of here. Any punishment is lighter than staying on in this place. I have written about this to Antony and Balbus and Oppius. Whether there is going to be fighting in Italy or whether they use naval forces it is highly undesirable that I should be here. Both of these contingencies <span class="italic">may</span> happen, one of them certainly will. I realized of course from Oppius’ talk of which you wrote to me how angry your friends<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL097_241_1" id="target_note_LCL097_241_1"><sup>1</sup></a> were, but you must mollify them. While I now expect only misery, nothing could be more desperate than the predicament I am in at present.</p>
