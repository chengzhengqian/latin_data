but also, as you know (you spoke to me about it), for young Lucullus;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_55_2" id="target_note_LCL491_55_2"><sup>2</sup></a> the money was borrowed by Cato as guardian (a relevant point) in Greece. But he<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_55_3" id="target_note_LCL491_55_3"><sup>3</sup></a> is taking a gentlemanly line in promising to do nothing against our wishes. So as you say, we shall settle when we meet how to arrange the matter. You did very well to meet the other coheirs.</p>
<p>You ask for my letter to Brutus. I don’t have the copy, but it has not been destroyed and Tiro says you ought to have it. According to my recollection, when I sent you his objurgatory letter I sent my own answering letter<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_55_4" id="target_note_LCL491_55_4"><sup>4</sup></a> at the same time.—You’ll see that I am not bothered with jury service.</p>
<p>I had never heard of the Tuditanus you speak of, Hortensius’ great-grandfather, and I had thought that his son was the Commissioner, which at that time he could not have been. I feel sure that Mummius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_55_5" id="target_note_LCL491_55_5"><sup>5</sup></a> was at Corinth. Our contemporary, the late Spurius, used to recite to me letters in verse sent to his friends from Corinth. But I do not doubt that he was Legate to his brother, not one of the Ten. Indeed I have been told that it was not the custom in the old days to appoint relatives of the commanders in the field to such boards, in the way that we in our ignorance, or rather neglect, of the excellent old rules sent M. Lucullus, L. Murena, and other of his closest connexions to L. Lucullus. And it is eminently logical that Spurius in particular should have been one of his brother’s Legates. What a busy life you have of it! You attend to this sort of thing, you arrange my affairs for me, and you are almost as conscientious about your own business as you are about mine!</p>
