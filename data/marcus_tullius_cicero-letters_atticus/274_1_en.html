<p class="noindent">Pray, what’s all this? What is going on? I am in the dark. ‘We hold Cingulum, we’ve lost Ancona, Labienus has deserted Caesar.’ Is it a Roman general or Hannibal we are talking of? Deluded wretch, with never in his life a glimpse of even the shadow of Good!<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_227_1" id="target_note_LCL008_227_1"><sup>1</sup></a> And he says he is doing all this for his honour’s sake!

There is only one thing sorrier still, and that is for a man in such a case to get what he wishes for. But there’s enough. In the midst of these disquietudes I like to make you my lecture class.</p>
<p>To come back to our friend. What <span class="italic">do</span> you think, for heaven’s sake, of Pompey’s line—I mean, why has he abandoned Rome? <span class="italic">I</span> don’t know what to make of it. At the time it looked the most senseless thing. Abandon Rome? I suppose
