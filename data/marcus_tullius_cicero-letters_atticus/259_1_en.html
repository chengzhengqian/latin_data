<p>Bibulus has quitted his province, leaving Veiento in charge. I hear that he will not hurry himself on the return journey. In doing him honour Cato made it plain that he confines his jealousy to those<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_197_8" id="target_note_LCL008_197_8"><sup>8</sup></a> whose prestige admits of little or no enhancement.</p>
<p>Now I come to private matters—I have answered your political letters more or less, both the one you wrote at your place near Rome and the later one. I come to private matters. One thing more, about Caelius:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_197_9" id="target_note_LCL008_197_9"><sup>9</sup></a> so far from letting him influence my views, I think it a great pity for himself that he has changed his. But what is this about Lucceius’ properties being knocked down to him? I am surprised you didn’t mention it.</p>
<p>About Philotimus, I shall certainly do as you advise. But it’s not the accounts he produced to you that I am expecting from him now but the balance which he himself asked me at Tusculum to enter in my memorandum in my own hand and which he also gave me in writing under his own hand in Asia. If he were paying that, <span class="italic">he</span> would owe me as much as and even more than my total debts as he represented them to you. Well, in future I shall not be found wanting in this department, that is if the state of the country allows, nor indeed have I been negligent in the past, but preoccupied by the multitude of affairs, both of state and of my friends. So I shall avail myself of your services and advice, which you kindly promise, though I hope I shan’t put you to too much trouble in that way.</p>
