Only see to the settlement day, and even that with moderation.</p>

<p class="noindent">What’s this that Clodius Hermogenes tells me about Andromenes telling him that he saw Marcus at Corcyra? I should have thought you would have heard of it. Didn’t he give a line even to Andromenes? Or did he not see him? Please enlighten me.</p>
<p>How am I to answer you about Varro? You have four volumes at your disposal. Whatever you do, I shall approve.</p>
