<p>‘Torquatus’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_45_2" id="target_note_LCL491_45_2"><sup>2</sup></a> is in Rome. I have sent word that it should be delivered to you. I think I gave you the ‘Catulus’ and the ‘Lucullus’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_45_3" id="target_note_LCL491_45_3"><sup>3</sup></a> previously. New prefaces have been added to these pieces eulogizing each of the pair. I want you to have these compositions, and there are some other things. You don’t quite understand what I wrote to you about the ten Commissioners, no doubt because I used abbreviations. I was enquiring about C. Tuditanus, who I had heard from Hortensius was one of the Ten. I see in Libo that he was Praetor in the Consulship of P. Popilius and P. Rupilius. How could he have been a Commissioner fourteen years before becoming Praetor?—unless he became Praetor very late, which I do not think likely as he seems to have gained the curule magistracies at the legally permitted years without the least difficulty. As for Postumius, whose statue at the Isthmus you say you remember, I did not know he was Aulus.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_45_4" id="target_note_LCL491_45_4"><sup>4</sup></a> That is the man who was Consul with L. Lucullus. I owe to you a highly appropriate accession to my Conference. So please see about the others if you can, so that my <span class="italic">personae</span> may add to the general <span class="italic">éclat</span>.</p>
