<p>Believe me when I say that Caesar will not only put himself in your hands but will consider himself under the deepest obligation to you if you will bend your mind that way. I only wish that Pompey may do the like; but I rather pray than hope that he may be brought to any sort of accommodation at such a time. But when he settles down and regains a sense of security, <span class="italic">then</span> I shall begin not to despair of your influence counting heavily with him.</p>
<p>Caesar is grateful to you for desiring my friend Consul Lentulus to stay here,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_345_1" id="target_note_LCL008_345_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and I am indeed more than grateful. I have so high a regard for him that Caesar himself is no dearer to me. If he had let me talk to him as I used to do and had not repeatedly and absolutely declined conversation with me, I should be less unhappy than I am. For you must not think that anyone at the present time suffers more keenly than I do when I see a man who is dearer to me than myself become in his Consulship the sorry travesty of a Consul. But if he will listen to you and believe me about Caesar and serve out the rest of his term of office in Rome, I shall begin to hope that by the Senate’s advice, with you to inspire and him to propose, Pompey and Caesar may yet come to be reconciled. If and when that happens I shall feel I have lived long enough.</p>
<p>I know that Caesar’s action over Corfinium will have your entire approval; and in such circumstances a bloodless finish to the business was the best possible outcome.</p>
<p>I was very glad to hear that you were pleased to see my (and your) dear boy.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_345_2" id="target_note_LCL008_345_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Whatever he told you about Caesar and whatever Caesar wrote to you, Caesar will, I am sure, prove to you by his actions, however fortune may go with him, that he wrote it in all sincerity.</p>
