<p>Please give Cephalio a letter about all proceedings, even down to what people are saying, unless they have lost their tongues. I have followed your advice, especially in maintaining a fitting dignity during our interview and in holding out against going Romewards. For the rest, pray write with all care (we have now reached the final stage) what course you favour, what you advise—not that there is now any doubt. Still I should like you to write anything, or rather everything, that occurs to you.</p>

<h2>190 (X.1)</h2>
<h2><span class="italic">Laterium, 3 April 49</span></h2>
<h2><span class="ac">Cicero to Atticus</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">I received your letter on the 3rd after I had arrived at my brother’s place at Laterium and breathed a little more easily after reading it, for the first time since this collapse set in. I attach very great importance to your approval of my resolution and conduct. And when you tell me that our friend Sextus approves too, I am delighted—I feel as though I stood approved in the judgement of his father, for whom I always had the very highest respect. I often remember how long ago on that famous Nones of December I asked him ‘Well, Sextus, what now?’ and he replied</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line indent2">No sluggard’s fate, ingloriously to die,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">But daring that which men to be shall learn.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL097_105_1" id="target_note_LCL097_105_1"><sup>1</sup></a></span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">So his influence lives on for me, and his son, who resembles him so much, carries the same weight with me as he did. Please give him my best regards.</p>
