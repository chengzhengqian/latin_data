So naturally silence reigns. And in these circumstances you take me to task for tormenting myself, when I am tried beyond any mortal that ever was, as you well know. You hold out hope after the elections. What does it amount to, with the same Tribune still in office and my enemy Consul-Designate?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL007_243_1" id="target_note_LCL007_243_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Then you have given me a blow about the circulation of that speech.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL007_243_2" id="target_note_LCL007_243_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Try, as you say, to patch up the damage if you can. I did write it long ago in a fit of annoyance with him because <span class="italic">he</span> had written against me, but I suppressed it and never expected it to leak out. How it did get out I don’t know. However, as I have never exchanged a contentious word with him in my life and as it seems to me more carelessly written than my other compositions, I think it may be passed off on internal evidence as a forgery. Would you please see to that, if you think my case is curable? If I am past praying for, I don’t so much care.</p>
<p>I am still stuck here, with no one to talk to and nothing to think about. I may have suggested to you, as you say, that you should join me; but I give that up, and realize that you are helping me where you are, whereas you could do nothing even verbally to lighten my load here. I can’t write any more, nor have I anything to write about. I am rather waiting for news from your side.</p>
<p>Dispatched 17 July, Thessalonica.</p>
