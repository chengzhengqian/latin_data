<p>As for reputation, I really care nothing about it, though I was silly enough to write to you at the time about a ‘first-rate performance.’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_89_1" id="target_note_LCL491_89_1"><sup>1</sup></a> One should not trouble oneself. ‘No one in any part of his life should stray a hair-breadth from the path of conscience.’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_89_2" id="target_note_LCL491_89_2"><sup>2</sup></a> There’s philosophy for you! Do you suppose I am writing those books of mine to no purpose? I am sorry you have been upset over a mere nothing<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_89_3" id="target_note_LCL491_89_3"><sup>3</sup></a>—for I come back to the same point: do you think I have any concern in the whole affair except not to let him<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_89_4" id="target_note_LCL491_89_4"><sup>4</sup></a> down? Oh of course, I am trying to figure as the Great Barrister! To the deuce with them! I wish I could bear my private troubles as easily as I can despise this sort of thing. And do you think I had any object which was not morally consummate? Of course one can’t speak one’s mind; all the same I can’t but approve of what was done on that occasion,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_89_5" id="target_note_LCL491_89_5"><sup>5</sup></a> though I can preserve a fine indifference, and do. But that’s more than enough about trifles.</p>

<p class="noindent">I have my reasons for soliciting your opinion about Varro with such persistence. Certain objections occur to me; but we will talk about them together. As for yourself, it gives me the greatest pleasure to work you in, and I shall do so often in future. From your last letter I learned for the first time that you are not averse to this.</p>
<p>Cassius had already written to me about Marcellus, and Servius gave me the details. What a tragedy!</p>
