Such restitutions may perhaps be brought about by force of arms, though I don’t know how much of that we have, but not by influence.</p>
<p>The short letter which you wrote after the other about Brutus’ letters to Antony and to yourself gave me much pleasure. It does look as though things may improve. But I must think about where I am to live, and where to go in the immediate future.</p>

<p class="noindent">My wonderful Dolabella!<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_185_1" id="target_note_LCL491_185_1"><sup>1</sup></a> <span class="italic">Now</span> I call him mine—before, I can tell you, I had lurking doubts! This affair really gives people something to think about! Over the Rock<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_185_2" id="target_note_LCL491_185_2"><sup>2</sup></a> with them, on to the cross with them, away with the pillar, contract for paving the site! Why, it’s Homeric! He seems to to me to have quashed that affectation of regret for Caesar which was spreading from day to day. I was afraid it might become a danger to our tyrannicides if it took root. Now I quite agree with your letter and hope for better things. But I can’t abide those people who defend misdoings under cover of wanting peace. However we can’t expect everything at once. The business begins to go better than I had thought. And I shall not go away until you think I can honourably do so. Certainly I shall never fail my dear Brutus.</p>
