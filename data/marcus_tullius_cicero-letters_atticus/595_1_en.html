The truth is that I have no thought of selling unless I find something I like better. As for Quintus, he is not worrying about buying property just now. He has trouble enough over the repayment of the dowry, in which connection he says he is infinitely grateful to Egnatius. As for marriage, he has so little inclination for it that he says a bachelorâ€™s bed is the most agreeable thing in the world. So much for that too.</p>
<p>For I return to our unhappy or rather nonexistent commonwealth. Mark Antony has written to me on the recall of Sex. Cloelius, in how complimentary a style so far as concerns me personally you will see from his own letter, of which I enclose a copy; how unscrupulously, disgracefully, mischievously, so that one is sometimes tempted to wish Caesar back, you will readily appreciate. Things that Caesar neither did nor ever would have done or permitted to be done are now brought out from his forged memoranda. As for me, I have shown myself all compliance to Antony. After all, having once made up his mind that he had a right to do what he pleased, he would have done it just the same if I had opposed. So I enclose a copy of my letter too.</p>
