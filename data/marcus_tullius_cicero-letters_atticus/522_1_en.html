<h2><span class="ac">Cicero to Atticus</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">Your letter to Marcus is exactly right, grave and gentle at the same time—just what I should have wished. Your letters to the Tullii<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_27_1" id="target_note_LCL491_27_1"><sup>1</sup></a> too are most judicious. Well then, either these will work or we shall have to stop worrying.</p>
<p>As for the money, you are clearly making, or rather have already made, every possible effort. If you bring it off, I shall owe my suburban residence to you. There is no sort of property I would sooner have, chiefly of course on account of the project to which I am already committed; as to that you remove all my hurry now that you promise or rather guarantee about the summer. Then too nothing can be found for me more suitable for living out my time and softening my grief. My eagerness in this matter sometimes makes me want to urge you on. But I check myself, for I don’t doubt that in something on which you think I have set my heart your eagerness exceeds my own. So I take it for as good as done.</p>
<p>I am waiting to hear what your friends think about the letter to Caesar. Nicias loves you as he ought, and is delighted by your remembrance of him. Yes, I have the warmest regard for our friend Peducaeus. Not only have I transferred to him all the affection I felt for his father, but I am as fond of him for his own sake as I was of his father, and fondest of you for wishing us both to feel that way. If you will inspect the properties and let me know about the letter, you will give me something to write about; if not, I shall write a line just the same. There will always be something.</p>
