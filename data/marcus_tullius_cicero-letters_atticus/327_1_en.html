Neither advantage is ours at present because on the one hand Caesar has occupied a great part of Italy and on the other we do not have an army as well-disposed and as numerous as his. We must therefore see that we take account of the main interests of the state. Yet again I urge you to join me as soon as possible with your whole force. Even now we can put the country on her feet if we apply ourselves to the task in concert. If we are divided we shall be weak. That is my fixed opinion.</p>
<p>After I had written this letter * brought me your letter and message. I do not think I can comply with your request that I should join you because I have no great confidence in these legions.</p>

<h2><span class="ac">Cn. Magnus Proconsul to L. Domitius Proconsul</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">A letter of yours has been delivered to me on 17 February in which you say that Caesar has encamped at Corfinium. What I thought and predicted is happening. He is unwilling to join battle with you at present and having collected all his forces hems you in, obstructing your road to me and preventing you from joining your own thoroughly loyal forces with the legions here whose disposition is doubtful. I am therefore all the more disturbed by your letter. I do not have enough confidence in the disposition of the men I have with me to fight a battle on which the whole future of the commonwealth would be staked, and the levies raised for the Consuls have not yet mustered.</p>
