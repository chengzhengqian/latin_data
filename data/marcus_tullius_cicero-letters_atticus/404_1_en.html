provinces and the state to be governed by people not one of whom had the capacity to look after his own family property for two months? I need not make a catalogue of points which are already apparent to your perspicacity, but do just call them to mind; you will soon see that this reign can hardly last six months. If I am wrong, I shall take the consequences, as many great men and eminent statesmen have done before me. Or do you think I would rather die in my bed like Sardanapalus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL097_139_4" id="target_note_LCL097_139_4"><sup>4</sup></a> than in exile like Themistocles? He was, Thucydides says, ‘at once the best judge in those sudden crises which admit of little or no deliberation and the best prophet of the future, even to its most distant possibilities.’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL097_139_5" id="target_note_LCL097_139_5"><sup>5</sup></a> Yet he fell into misfortunes which he would have avoided if he had never forecast wrong. Although, to quote Thucydides again, ‘he could excellently divine the good and evil which lay hidden in the unseen future,’ yet he failed to see how to escape the jealousy of the Spartans or that of his own countrymen, or what promises he ought to make Artaxerxes. Africanus was a very wise man, C. Marius a very cunning one; yet if neither had ever forecast awry, there would never have come that cruel night<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL097_139_6" id="target_note_LCL097_139_6"><sup>6</sup></a> for the one or that terrible day of Sulla’s return for the other. But in the present case I confirm my forecast by the augury aforesaid. I am not wrong and it will not turn out otherwise. He is bound to collapse either through his enemies’ agency or his own; indeed he is his own worst enemy. I hope I may live to see it, though it is time for me to be thinking of eternity rather than this brief span. But if anything happens to me earlier, well, it will make little enough difference
