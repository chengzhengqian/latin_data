<h2>375 (XIV.21)</h2>

<h2><span class="ac">Cicero to Atticus</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">On the 11th, a short while after I had dispatched a letter to you by Cassius’ courier, my courier arrived bringing (astonishing phenomenon!) no letter from you. But I soon guessed that you were at Lanuvium. Eros was in a hurry to get a letter of Dolabella’s through to me, not about my affair (he had not had mine when he wrote), but in reply to the one of which I sent you a copy—not by any means a bad reply either.</p>
<p>Just after I had sent Cassius’ courier on his way, Balbus called. Heavens above, how easily one could see his fear of peace!—and you know how cagey he is. Still he told me of Antony’s plans—that he is going the rounds of the veterans to get them to stand by Caesar’s measures and take an oath to that effect, instructing them all to keep their arms ready and have them inspected monthly by the colonial magistrates. Balbus also complained about his own unpopularity, and the whole tenor of his talk argued friendship for Antony. In short I don’t trust him a yard.</p>
<p>There is no doubt in my mind that we are moving towards war. That affair was handled with the courage of men and the policy of children. Anyone could see that the king was removed and an heir to the throne was left behind. The folly of it! ‘Strange <span class="italic">this</span> to fear and <span class="italic">that</span> to set at naught!’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_211_1" id="target_note_LCL491_211_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Why even now there is a good deal that might be called </p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL491_211_1"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL491_211_1" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">1</sup>From an unknown Latin play; cf.
