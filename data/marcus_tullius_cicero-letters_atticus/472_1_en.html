<p class="noindent">How very sorry I am to hear about Athamas!<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL097_275_1" id="target_note_LCL097_275_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Your grief does credit to your heart, but you must try your best to keep it in bounds. There are many ways of consolation, but the most direct is this: allow to reason what you will in any case allow to time. But let us take care of Tiro’s counterpart (Tiro is unwell, and I am sending him back to Rome) Alexis, and if the hill is unhealthy, let us bring him and Tisamenus over to my house. The whole upper storey is empty, as you know. This really seems to me a useful suggestion.</p>

<p class="noindent">Ten days after saying good-bye to you I am scribbling this note as I leave the villa before daybreak. I expect to be at Anagnia this evening, at Tusculum tomorrow, and to stay there one day. On 30 November then I keep my appointment. I wish enough I could hurry straight to my Tullia’s embrace and Attica’s kisses. Do pray write to me about her
