<p class="noindent">I don’t doubt that you will be surprised and even annoyed to find me bringing up the same subject once again. Atticus, my intimate friend, with whom I am closely linked in all things, has a great deal at stake. I have seen how zealous you are to oblige your friends and they to oblige you. You can do much for us with Plancus. I know your good nature and am well aware how much your friends appreciate you. No one can help us more than you in this cause. A judgement of the Consuls, pronounced in concurrence with their assessors at an enquiry held under the authority of both statute and senatorial decree, ought to constitute a strong case. None the less, everything in our view depends on the liberal disposition of your friend Plancus. We imagine indeed that he will approve the Consuls’ decree from a sense of duty and a regard for the public interest, and that he will do it with a good will for our sakes too. So lend your assistance, my dear Capito. I beg this of you most earnestly.</p>
