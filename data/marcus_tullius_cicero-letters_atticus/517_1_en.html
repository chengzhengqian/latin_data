<p class="noindent">Go on publishing Hirtius’ book. About Philotimus I was of just the same opinion. Clearly your house will go up in value with Caesar as a neighbour.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_17_1_1" id="target_note_LCL491_17_1_1"><sup>1</sup></a> I am expecting my courier today. He will bring us news of Pilia and Attica.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_17_2" id="target_note_LCL491_17_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>I can readily believe that you are glad to be at home. But I should like to know what you still have to do or whether you have already finished. I expect you at Tusculum, all the more as you have written to Tiro that you will be coming at once and added that you think it desirable.</p>

<h2>290 (XII.45)</h2>
<h2><span class="italic">Tusculum, 17 May 45</span></h2>
<h2><span class="ac">Cicero to Atticus</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">Excellent news about Attica. I am concerned to hear of your languor, though you say it is nothing. Tusculum will be more convenient for me in that I shall receive your letters more often and see yourself from time to time. Otherwise life was more tolerable at Astura, and the things that chafe the wound do pain me more here; and yet, wherever I am, they are with me.</p>
<p>I put that in about your neighbour Caesar because I had learned of it from your letter. I prefer to have him sharing a temple with Quirinus than with Weal.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_17_1_2" id="target_note_LCL491_17_1_2"><sup>1</sup></a> Yes, do publish
