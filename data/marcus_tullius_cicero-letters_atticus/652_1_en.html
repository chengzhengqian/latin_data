It’s kind of him to follow me to Puteoli, but his complaint is unjustified. It was not for me to wait for him to return from Cosa so much as for him either not to go away before he had seen me or to get back sooner. He knew that I wanted to be off quickly and had written that he would visit me at Tusculum.</p>
<p>It grieves me to hear that you shed tears after you left me. If you had done that in my presence, perhaps I should have changed my whole travel plan. But it is splendid that you took comfort in the hope of an early meeting, the expectation of which is my own greatest support. My letters will not be wanting. I shall tell you all about Brutus. I shall soon be sending you my book ‘On Glory,’ and shall hammer out something <span class="italic">à la Héraclide</span> for you to keep tucked away in your archives.</p>
<p>I don’t forget about Plancus. Attica has a right to complain. I am very grateful for your information about Bacchis and about the garlands on the statues,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_287_1" id="target_note_LCL491_287_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and in future please don’t fail to tell me anything of equal interest or indeed of <span class="italic">any</span> interest, no matter how small. But I shall remember about Herodes and Metius (?) and everything else which I may so much as suspect you to wish. What a rascal you have for a nephew! He is coming here as I write, just as the shadows fall, and we at dinner.</p>
