<section class="div1 language" lang="en"><header><hgroup><h1>Letters to Atticus</h1></hgroup></header><section class="div2"><p class="noindent"> been doing for some time past—I also enclose a letter of Caesar’s to them, a sane letter so far as there can be any sanity in such madness. If however Caesar should refuse me this, I see that you are in favour of my coming forward as an advocate of peace. I do not fear the danger involved (so many hang over me that I might as well settle for the most honourable), but I am afraid of causing Pompey embarrassment and of his turning on me ‘the Gorgon’s head, monster most terrible.’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL097_33_2" id="target_note_LCL097_33_2"><sup>2</sup></a> For our Gnaeus is marvellously covetous of despotism on Sullan lines. <span class="italic">Experto crede</span>; he has been as open about it as he ever was about anything. ‘And is that the man you want to be with?’ Believe me, it is the obligation that moves me not the cause, as in Milo’s case or—but enough. ‘Is the cause not a good one then?’ An excellent one, but remember that it will be abominably conducted. The plan is first to strangle Rome and Italy with hunger, then to carry fire and sword through the countryside and dip into the pockets of the rich. But since I fear the same from <span class="italic">this</span> quarter, if I did not have an obligation to repay in the other, I should think it better to take whatever may come at home. But I feel so much beholden to Pompey that I dare not lay myself open to a charge of ingratitude, though there too you have made out a fair defence.</p>
<p>About the Triumph I agree with you. I shall throw the whole thing aside, lightly and willingly. I particularly like your remark that before we know it ‘the seasonable sailing’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL097_33_3" id="target_note_LCL097_33_3"><sup>3</sup></a> may steal upon us. ‘Provided only that Pompey is strong enough,’ you say. He is even stronger than we thought. On that point you can make your mind easy. I give you my word that if his health holds he won’t leave one stone standing on another in Italy. And shall I be with him, </p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL097_33_2"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL097_33_2" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">2</sup>From <span class="italic">Odyssey</span>, 11.634.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL097_33_2').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL097_33_3"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL097_33_3" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">3</sup>A Greek tag from an epigram by Leonidas of Tarentum (<span class="italic">Anth.
