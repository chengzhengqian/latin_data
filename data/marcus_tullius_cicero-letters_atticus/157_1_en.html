you the rest of my news. A letter from my brother contains some quite extraordinary things about Caesar’s warm feelings towards me, and is corroborated by a very copious letter from Caesar himself. The result of the war against Britain is eagerly awaited, for the approaches to the island are known to be ‘warded with wondrous massy walls.’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL007_341_9" id="target_note_LCL007_341_9"><sup>9</sup></a> It is also now ascertained that there isn’t a grain of silver on the island nor any prospect of booty apart from captives, and I fancy you won’t expect any of <span class="italic">them</span> to be highly qualified in literature or music!</p>
<p>Paulus has now almost roofed his basilica in the middle of the Forum, using the original antique pillars. The other one,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL007_341_10" id="target_note_LCL007_341_10"><sup>10</sup></a> which he gave out on contract, he is constructing in magnificent style. It is indeed a most admired and glorious edifice. So Caesar’s friends (I mean Oppius and myself, choke on that if you must) have thought nothing of spending sixty million sesterces on the work which you used to be so enthusiastic about, to widen the Forum and extend it as far as the Hall of Liberty.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL007_341_11" id="target_note_LCL007_341_11"><sup>11</sup></a> We couldn’t settle with the private owners for a smaller sum. We shall achieve something really glorious. As for the Campus Martius, we are going to build covered marble booths for the Assembly of Tribes and to surround them with a high colonnade, a mile of it in all. At the same time the Villa Publica<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL007_341_12" id="target_note_LCL007_341_12"><sup>12</sup></a> will be attached to our building. You’ll say, ‘What good will such a structure be to me?’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL007_341_13" id="target_note_LCL007_341_13"><sup>13</sup></a> Now why should we worry ourselves about <span class="italic">that</span>?</p>
