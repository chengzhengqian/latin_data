Attic and profoundly impressive. But we shall talk of this together. Here and now I did not want Metrodorus to go to you without a letter or with an empty one.</p>

<h2>379 (XV.2)</h2>
<h2><span class="italic">District of Vescia, 18 May 44</span></h2>
<h2><span class="ac">Cicero to Atticus</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">Having sent a letter off to you as I left my place near Sinuessa on the 18th, I turned in for the night at *’s in the Vescia district, where I received yours from the courier. I found too much in it about Buthrotum. That matter is not and will not be of any greater concern to you than to me. That is how we both should feel about one another’s affairs. So I have taken this business upon myself and shall give it a place second to none.</p>
<p>From your letter and others I learn that L. Antonius has made a vile speech, but I don’t know the details since there is nothing in writing. Good news about Menedemus.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_223_1" id="target_note_LCL491_223_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Quintus is certainly talking in the way you say. I am glad you approve of my intention not to write what you asked of me,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_223_2" id="target_note_LCL491_223_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and your approval will be much fortified if you read the speech about which I wrote to you today. What you say about the legions<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_223_3" id="target_note_LCL491_223_3"><sup>3</sup></a> is true. But you don’t seem altogether convinced of this yourself when you express the hope that the affair of our Buthrotians can be settled through the Senate. I hardly think so—this much is clear
