<p class="noindent">The whole audience vociferated applause as he spoke that, and the rest also. Indeed these lines might seem to have been written for the occasion by an enemy of Pompey. ‘If neither law nor custom can constrain,’ etc., was recited to a loud accompaniment of shouting and clapping. When Caesar entered, applause was nonexistent. He was followed by Curio junior, who received the sort of ovation that Pompey used to get in the days before freedom fell. Caesar took it badly, and a letter is said to be winging its way to Pompey in Capua. They hate the Knights, who stood up to applaud Curio, they are at war with the whole community. They threaten the Roscian law, even the corn law. It’s a pretty kettle of fish. I myself should have preferred their game to run its course in silence, but I am afraid that may not be possible. Public opinion won’t endure it any longer, yet endured apparently it must be. But now there is only one universal cry, though with hatred rather than power behind it.</p>
<p>Dear Publius is threatening me, most hostile. The business is looming, and you will naturally make haste back to meet it. I think I have very firm backing in my old consular army of all honest men, including the moderately honest. Pompey signifies good will towards me out of the ordinary. He also assures me that Clodius will not say a word about me, wherein he does not deceive me but is himself deceived.
