<p>He put off further talk till next day. I shall write if any of it proves worth a letter. I omitted to raise certain points, as whether Caesar is going to wait for an interregnum or do<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL097_125_8" id="target_note_LCL097_125_8"><sup>8</sup></a> as he hinted himself when he said that he was being offered the Consulship but did not want it for next year. And there are other questions I want to ask. To conclude, he took his oath, as he easily might, that Caesar must be very friendly to me. ‘What do you mean?’ I said. ‘I have heard from Dolabella.’ ‘Tell me, what?’ He stated that according to Dolabella’s letter Caesar was profusely grateful to him for wishing me to come to Rome, and expressed not only approval but delight. So! It was a relief. My suspicions about our family trouble and that talk with Hirtius were allayed. How anxious I am to find him worthy of us and how much against my will ∗ ∗ ∗! But what need for that interview with Hirtius? Yes, there must be something, but I hope it will come to as little as may be. And yet I am surprised that he has not yet returned. But we shall see.</p>
<p>You will please give ∗ to Terentia, for there is now no danger in the capital. But help me with your advice, whether to go by land to Regium or to take ship direct from here, and write about other matters seeing that I am staying where I am. I shall have something to write to you about as soon as I have seen Curio. About Tiro, pray continue to make sure that I know how he is getting on.</p>
