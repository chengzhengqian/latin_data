<p class="noindent">Your letter of the 19th has at last reached me, a week later. In it you ask (and you suppose that I myself don’t know) whether I get more pleasure from the hills and the view or from the walk <span class="italic">au bord de la mer</span>. Indeed it is as you say; both places are so agreeable that I hesitate which to prefer.</p>

<p class="noindent">For while your news about D. Brutus joining his troops, in which I see our best hope, is important and welcome, all the same if there is to be civil war (and there is bound to be if Sextus stays under arms as I feel sure he will) I cannot tell what we ought to do. Neutrality, which was possible in Caesar’s war, will not be possible now. Anyone who in the opinion of this party of desperadoes was glad at Caesar’s death (and we all showed our delight without the faintest concealment) will be considered by them as an enemy. This points to large-scale massacre. The alternative is to betake ourselves to Sextus’ camp, or maybe Brutus’; a weary business and unbefitting our age, with no certainty
