<p>I expect to hear from you about affairs in Rome. What does Arrius say and how does he like being thrown over?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL007_149_4" id="target_note_LCL007_149_4"><sup>4</sup></a> What Consuls are in preparation—Pompey and Crassus as the general rumour goes or, as a correspondent writes to me, Gabinius and Ser. Sulpicius? Is there any new legislation? Or any news at all? And who, since Nepos is leaving, is being offered the Augurate?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL007_149_5a" id="target_note_LCL007_149_5a"><sup>5</sup></a> That’s the one bait they might catch me with—you see what an irresponsible fellow I am! But why ask all these questions, when I want to put all such matters aside and concentrate my whole time and energy on study? Yes, that is what I intend. I wish I had done so from the first. Now, having discovered by experience the emptiness of the things I prized most highly, I mean to concern myself with all the Muses.</p>
<p>All the same, tell me definitely in your reply about ∗ and whether they are getting someone in his place and what is happening about P. Clodius. Write me everything, as you promise, in leisurely style. And would you please write to me when you think you will be leaving Rome so that I can let you know where I am going to be? Please send me a letter right away about the points I have mentioned. I am eagerly expecting to hear from you.</p>
