<p class="noindent">How you whet my appetite about your talk with Bibulus, your discussion with Ox Eyes, and that apolaustic dinner party too! So come expecting thirsty ears. But the most serious danger we now have to fear in my opinion is that when our Sampsiceramus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL007_173_1" id="target_note_LCL007_173_1"><sup>1</sup></a> realizes that his name is mud in every man’s mouth and sees that these proceedings are very liable to be upset, he may start plunging.

But never mind the multitude—after 10 o’clock the common run doesn’t bother me. But my closest neighbour is one C. Arrius, or rather roommate, for that is what he has now become. He actually says he won’t go to Rome because he wants to philosophize with me here all day long. Then on the other side there is Catulus’ friend Sebosus. Where is a man to turn?
