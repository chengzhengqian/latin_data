<p>I nearly forgot to add that, as I have often told you, I have done everything in my power for your friend Brutus. The Cypriots were ready to pay cash down, but Scaptius was not satisfied with 1 percent per month annually compounded. Ariobarzanes is as anxious to pay Brutus for my sake as he is to pay Pompey for Pompey’s. However, I can’t answer for him. He is a very impecunious monarch and I am too far away to do anything except by letters, with which I have kept up a steady barrage.
