you have sent me another time. Just now I would rather think of other things.</p>
<p>What can I do about Torquatus unless I hear something from Dolabella? As soon as I do you shall know at once. I am expecting couriers from him today or tomorrow at latest. As soon as they arrive they shall be sent on to you. I am expecting to hear from Quintus.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_133_1" id="target_note_LCL491_133_1"><sup>1</sup></a> When I left Tusculum on the 25th, as you know, I sent him couriers.</p>
<p>To come to business, I now don’t like one bit your word <span class="italic">inhibere</span>,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_133_2" id="target_note_LCL491_133_2"><sup>2</sup></a> which I had thought the very thing. The word is entirely nautical. That much to be sure I knew, but I thought that when oarsmen were given the order <span class="italic">inhibere</span> they rested on their oars. That this is not so, I learned yesterday when a boat put in at my house. They don’t rest on their oars, they row, but in a different way. That is as far as possible from the Greek ἐποχή. So will you please put it back in the book as it was, and tell Varro in case he has made the alteration? One can’t do better than Lucilius, ‘Hold in,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_133_3" id="target_note_LCL491_133_3"><sup>3</sup></a> like a good driver, car and team.’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_133_4" id="target_note_LCL491_133_4"><sup>4</sup></a> And Carneades is always comparing ἐποχή to a boxer’s guard and a driver’s holding in. Now <span class="italic">inhibitio</span> of oarsmen involves motion and quite powerful motion too, rowing the boat astern. You see how much more anxiously concerned I am about this sort of thing than about the rumour, or Pollio, or Pansa either. But if you get any more definite news let me know (I imagine it has been made public); also about Critonius if there is anything definite—not to mention Metellus and Balbinus.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_133_5" id="target_note_LCL491_133_5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
