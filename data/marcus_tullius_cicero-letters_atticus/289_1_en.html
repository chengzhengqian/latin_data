<h2>144 (VII.20)</h2>
<h2><span class="italic">Capua, 5 February 49</span></h2>
<h2><span class="ac">Cicero to Atticus</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">The facts of the situation now make me laconic. I have given up hope of peace, and our people are doing nothing to wage war—don’t imagine these Consuls are worth twopence. To meet them (?), in the hope of getting some news and acquainting myself with our preparations, I arrived at Capua in pouring rain on the 4th, as instructed. They have as yet (i.e. on the Nones) not arrived, but are on their way, empty-handed and unprepared. Gnaeus is said to be at Luceria, visiting cohorts of Appius’ legions, which are none too reliable. As for Caesar, they say he is plunging, will be down on us any minute, not to join battle (who is there for him to fight with?) but to cut off escape.</p>
<p>For my part, in Italy I am ready ‘e’en to die with him,’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_257_1" id="target_note_LCL008_257_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and on that I don’t ask your advice. But out of Italy? What do I do? ‘Stay’ say winter, lictors, improvident and negligent leadership: ‘go’ say my friendship for Gnaeus, the cause of the honest men, the dishonour of alliance with a despot, as to whom it is doubtful whether he will take Phalaris or Pisistratus as his model. Please sort it all out and help me with your advice, though I suppose you yourself have now got plenty to think about in Rome. But do your best. If I hear any news here today you shall know of it—the Consuls will be here presently for their Nones. I shall expect a letter from you every day. Please reply to this when you can. I have left the ladies and the boys at Formiae.</p>
