<p class="noindent">Persuaded as I am that you will do nothing hasty or imprudent, I am none the less troubled by current reports, and I therefore feel I ought to write and appeal to you in the name of our mutual good will not to take a step now that the scales have turned which you did not think fit to take even when they were level. You will be committing a graver offence against friendship and acting less advisedly from your own point of view if it appears that you have not bowed to fortune (since everything seems to have gone excellently for us and disastrously for our adversaries) nor yet followed a cause (since it was the same cause when you decided to keep aloof from their counsels), but that you have disapproved some action of mine, which is the worst blow you could deal me. I appeal to you in the name of our friendship not to do this. Finally, to hold aloof from civil quarrels is surely the most fitting course for a good, peace-loving man and a good citizen. Some who favoured that course were prevented from following it by fear for their safety. But you have the witness of my career and the judgement implied in our friendship.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL097_145_1" id="target_note_LCL097_145_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Weigh them well, and you will find no safer and no more honourable way than to keep aloof from all conflict.</p>
