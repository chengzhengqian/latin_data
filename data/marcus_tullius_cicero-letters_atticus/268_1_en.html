command and the way it was conferred? Then we also approve of my expulsion and the loss of the Campanian land and the adoption of a patrician<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_215_3" id="target_note_LCL008_215_3"><sup>3</sup></a> by a plebeian and of a man from Gades by a man from Mytilene;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_215_4" id="target_note_LCL008_215_4"><sup>4</sup></a> and we approve of the fortunes of Labienus and Mamurra and of Balbus’ estates in the suburbs and at Tusculum. But the root of all these things is one and the same. We should have stood up to him when he was weak, and that would have been easy. Now we have to deal with eleven legions, all the cavalry he may want, the Gauls beyond Po, the city populace, all these Tribunes, our demoralized youth, and a leader strong in prestige and hardihood. We must either fight him or allow his candidature as by law authorized. ‘Better fight than be a slave,’ you say. For what? Proscription if you’re beaten and if you win slavery just the same? What am I going to do then? What stray cattle do when they follow droves of their own species. As an ox follows the herd, so I shall follow the honest men or whoever may be called such, even if they plunge. The <span class="italic">best</span> course in the straits to which we are reduced I see clearly enough. For nobody can be sure what will happen once the fight is on, but everybody can assume that if the honest men are beaten Caesar will be no more merciful than Cinna in the slaughter of leading men and no more temperate than Sulla in plundering the rich. Well, I have been inflicting my political views on you all this while, and I should go on doing so if the lamp were not going out. To sum up: ‘Speak, M. Tullius!’ ‘I agree with Cn. Pompeius,’ i.e. with T. Pom ponius.</p>
<p>Please greet Alexis for me, a most courteous lad, unless he has become a young man while I have been away—he seemed to be heading that way.</p>
