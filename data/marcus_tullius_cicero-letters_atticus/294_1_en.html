Domitius is said not to have 6,000 men. Lucretius also wrote that the Consuls had left Capua. I have no doubt that Gnaeus is a fugitive. I only hope he gets away. Personally, as you advise, I am not thinking of flight.</p>

However I shall know everything any day now and shall write to you at once.</p>
