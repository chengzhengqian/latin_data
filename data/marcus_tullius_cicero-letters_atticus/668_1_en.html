One thing rather bothers me, that Brutus doesn’t seem in much of a hurry. To begin with he is waiting for news of the winding up of the games, and after that, so far as I can gather, he is going to make a slow voyage with a number of stops. Still I suppose a slow voyage is better than no voyage at all, and if when we have made some progress things look reasonably safe I shall take advantage of the Etesian winds.</p>

<p class="noindent">On the 10th I received two letters, one from my own courier, the other from Brutus’. About the Buthrotians the story in this part of the world was very different, but we must lump it like so many other things. I am sending Eros back sooner than I intended so that there may be somebody to deal with Hordeonius and Ovia, with whom he says he has made an appointment on the Ides. Hordeonius’ demand is impudent. I owe him nothing except on the third instalment, which is due on the Kalends of August. He has been paid the greater part even of that instalment some time before it was due. However Eros will see to all this on the Ides. As regards Publilius, since the draft is an obligation I don’t think there ought to be any delay. But seeing how far I have waived my legal rights, in that of the outstanding HS 400,000 I have paid 200,000 down and am repaying the rest by draft, you might have a word with him </p></section><notes></notes></section>
