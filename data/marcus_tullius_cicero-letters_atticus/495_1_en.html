this is possible only if that Faberius matter is cleared up, and ask them whether they will give their support? If furthermore some discount for ready money is unavoidable, get them to agree to the best figure you can—the whole lot is past praying for. At all events you will see whether they are disposed to forward my plan. If anything comes of it, it will be a great help; if not, let us push on any way we can. Call it a retreat <span class="italic">pour ma vieillesse</span>, as you did in your letter, or a <span class="italic">linceul</span>, as you please. We must not think about that place near Ostia. If we don’t get this one (I don’t think there’s anything doing with Lamia), we must try Damasippus’.</p>

<h2>269 (XII.33)</h2>
<h2><span class="italic">Astura, 26 March 45</span></h2>
<h2><span class="ac">Cicero to Atticus</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">As I wrote to you yesterday, if Silius turns out as you expect and Drusus shows himself unaccommodating, I should like you to have a go at Damasippus. I think he has divided his property on the river into parcels of so many acres at fixed prices, but what the prices are I don’t know. So please send me word of whatever you do.</p>
<p>I am extremely concerned about dear Attica’s health, even to the extent of wondering whether there may have been some negligence. But the good character of her tutor, the doctor’s assiduity, and the general conscientiousness of the whole household make me dismiss the suspicion. So take care of her. I can’t say more.</p>
