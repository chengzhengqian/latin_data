<h2>398 (XV.21)</h2>
<h2><span class="italic">Tusculum, 21 June 44</span></h2>
<h2><span class="ac">Cicero to Atticus</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">What do you think? Quintus <span class="italic">père</span> is jumping for joy. His son writes giving as his reason for wanting to take refuge with Brutus that when Antony gave him the job of making him Dictator and seizing a strong point he had refused, the reason for the refusal being that he did not want to vex his father. On that account Antony had become his enemy. ‘Then’ says he ‘I pulled myself up, for fear that in his anger against me he might do you some injury. So I appeased him. What is more, I have got 400,000 for sure, with prospect of more to come.’ Moreover Statius writes that he wants to live with his father (surprise indeed!), and that delights Quintus. Was there ever a more out and out good-for-nothing than that young man?</p>
<p>I approve your joint ‘suspense of judgement’ about Canus’ affair<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_271_1" id="target_note_LCL491_271_1"><sup>1</sup></a>—it needs consideration. I had no idea that a settlement<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_271_2" id="target_note_LCL491_271_2"><sup>2</sup></a> was involved, I thought there had been complete restitution. I shall wait to hear more of the matters which you are holding over for personal discussion. Please keep the couriers as long as you like—you are busy. Glad you have written to Xeno. I’ll send what I am writing when</p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL491_271_5"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL491_271_5" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">5</sup>Antony.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL491_271_5').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note inline" id="note_LCL491_271_6"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL491_271_6" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">6</sup>See Letter 393.1.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL491_271_6').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL491_271_1"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL491_271_1" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">1</sup>This has to do with Quintus junior’s proposed bride Cana; see Letter 344.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL491_271_1').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note inline" id="note_LCL491_271_2"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL491_271_2" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">2</sup>Perhaps a marriage settlement.
