So it looks to me as though in a few days’ time we shall be in arms. But whom are we to follow? Consider his name; consider his age. And now he asks me, in the first instance, for a secret interview in Capua or somewhere in the vicinity—childish, if he thinks it could be done secretly. I wrote pointing out that this was neither needful nor possible. He sent me one Caecina of Volaterrae, a friend of his, with intelligence that Antony is advancing on Rome with the Larks,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_347_1" id="target_note_LCL491_347_1"><sup>1</sup></a> levying money on the towns and marching the legion under colours. He wanted my advice on whether he should proceed to Rome with 3,000 veterans or hold Capua and block Antony’s route or go to join the three Macedonian legions now marching along the Adriatic coast, which he hopes to have on his side. They refused to take a bounty from Antony, so <span class="italic">he</span> says, booed him savagely, and left him standing as he tried to harangue them. In short, he proffers himself as our leader and expects me to back him up. For my part I have recommended him to go to Rome. I imagine he will have the city rabble behind him, and the honest men too if he convinces them of his sincerity. Ah Brutus, where are you? What a golden opportunity you are losing! I could not foretell <span class="italic">this</span>, but I thought something of the kind would happen.</p>
<p>Now I ask your advice. Do I return to Rome or stay here or should I flee to Arpinum, which offers security? I prefer the last, but perhaps Rome is better (?), for fear I may be missed if people come to think that something has been achieved. So solve this problem. I was never in a greater quandary.</p>
