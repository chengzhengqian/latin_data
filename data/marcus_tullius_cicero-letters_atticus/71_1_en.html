<p class="noindent">I invite you to admire my steadiness of purpose. I think I had better <span class="italic">not</span> attend the games at Antium. It would be a bit incongruous, when I want to avoid the suspicion of any kind of pleasure-seeking, to turn up suddenly as a holiday-maker amusing myself, and in so silly a fashion too. So I shall wait for you at Formiae until the Nones of May. Now let me know when we shall see you.</p>
<p>Appii Forum, 10 a.m. I dispatched another letter a little while ago from Tres Tabernae.</p>

<h2>32 (II.11)</h2>
<h2><span class="italic">Formiae, ca. 23 April 59</span></h2>
<h2><span class="ac">Cicero to Atticus</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">I can tell you, I feel quite an exile now that I am at Formiae. When I was at Antium, never a day passed but I was better informed of what went on in Rome than those on the spot. Your letters used to give me not only the news of the town but of the state as well, and not only of the past but the future too. Now, unless I pick up something from a passing wayfarer, I must remain in total darkness. So, though I expect you in person pretty soon, do give this boy (I’ve told him to hurry back to me at once) a massive letter, full of news and also of your own comment, and mind you let me know what day you are leaving Rome.</p>
<p>We want to stay at Formiae until 6 May. If you don’t come before then, perhaps I shall see you in Rome. No use </p></section><notes></notes></section>
