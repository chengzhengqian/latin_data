Afraid that Fufius might veto the law proposed under the senatorial decree, he failed to see how much better it would have been to leave Clodius under the stigma of an impending trial than to commit him to an unreliable tribunal. His hatred made him impatient to bring the case to court. He said that a sword of lead would be sharp enough to cut Clodius’ throat.</p>
<p>But if you want to know what sort of a trial it was, it was a trial with an incredible outcome; so that others beside myself (who did so from the very first) are now criticizing Hortensius’ tactics after the event. The challenging of the jury took place amid uproar, with the prosecutor throwing out the most unsavoury characters like an honest Censor, while the defendant put all the more respectable elements on one side like a soft-hearted trainer.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL007_79_2" id="target_note_LCL007_79_2"><sup>2</sup></a> As soon as the jury took their seats, honest men began to fear the worst. A more raffish assemblage never sat down in a low-grade music hall. Flyblown Senators, beggar Knights, and Paymaster Tribunes who might better have been called ‘Paytakers.’ Even so there were a few honest men whom the accused had not been able to drive off at the challenge. There they sat, gloomy and shamefaced (?) in this incongruous company, sadly uncomfortable to feel themselves exposed to the miasma of disreputability. In these circumstances the strictness and unanimity of the court as various matters were referred to it during the preliminaries was quite astounding. The defendant met with nothing but rebuffs, the prosecutor was repeatedly given more than he asked. In short Hortensius triumphed in his perspicacity, and everybody looked on Clodius, not as a man standing </p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL007_79_2"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL007_79_2" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">2</sup>Of gladiators.
