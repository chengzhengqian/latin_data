War once begun, either (a) Rome would have to be held or (b) Rome would have to be abandoned and Caesar cut off from his supplies and his remaining forces. Of these evils, one of which is inevitable, which do you consider the least?</p>
<p>No doubt you will say that he be persuaded to hand over his army and so become Consul. True, this would be a course against which, if he were to bring himself to it, nothing could be said, and I am surprised that he does not do so if his claim to stand while retaining his army is not allowed. From our standpoint however, as certain persons<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_223_2" id="target_note_LCL008_223_2"><sup>2</sup></a> think, no prospect is more formidable than Caesar as Consul. ‘Better thus’ you will say, ‘than with an army at his back.’ Assuredly, but this very ‘thus’ is considered a disaster by somebody; and yet there is no help for it. If that is what he wants we must let him have it. ‘You have put up with him as Consul before, put up with him again.’ ‘Ah, but he was weak then’ comes the answer, ‘and yet stronger than the entire state. What do you think he will be like now?’ And if he is Consul, Pompey is resolved to stay in Spain. A wretched situation indeed if the worst of all contingencies is something which cannot be refused and which, should he accept it, would make all the honest men immediately and heartily grateful to him!</p>
<p>Well then, let us eliminate this possibility which they say he cannot be brought to accept. Which is the worst of those that remain? Surely to concede what the same person<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_223_3" id="target_note_LCL008_223_3"><sup>3</sup></a> calls his most impudent demands. For could impudence go further? You have kept a province for ten years, years given you not by the Senate but by yourself through factious violence. The time is up, the time set not by law </p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL008_223_2"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL008_223_2" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">2</sup>In what follows Cicero has in mind his recent conversation with Pompey.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL008_223_2').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL008_223_3"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL008_223_3" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">3</sup>Pompey.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL008_223_3').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
