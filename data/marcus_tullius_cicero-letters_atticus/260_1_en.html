<p>As for the knee splints<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_199_10" id="target_note_LCL008_199_10"><sup>10</sup></a> for my staff, you need not distress yourself. They pulled themselves together of their own accord, in admiration of my uprightness. But none of them disturbed me more than the one<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_199_11" id="target_note_LCL008_199_11"><sup>11</sup></a> whom you think ‘the last man.’ And yet he had behaved admirably to begin with and does now. But just as we were leaving he intimated that he had hoped for something, and fell for a little while below the standard he had set himself. But he soon came to himself again. My compliments and attentions won him over, and he valued them more than any amount of money.</p>
<p>I have received the will from Curius and am bringing it with me. I note Hortensius’ legacies. Now I am longing to know what the heir (?) gets and what items he’s putting up to auction. Since Caelius has occupied the Flumentane Gate,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_199_12" id="target_note_LCL008_199_12"><sup>12</sup></a> I don’t see why <span class="italic">I</span> shouldn’t acquire Puteoli.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_199_13" id="target_note_LCL008_199_13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>Now I come to Piraeus, in which matter as a Roman I am more open to criticism for writing <span class="italic">Piraeea</span> instead of <span class="italic">Piraeum</span>,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_199_14" id="target_note_LCL008_199_14"><sup>14</sup></a> the form universally used by our countrymen, than for adding the preposition. I prefixed it not as to a town but as to a locality—and after all our friend Dionysius and Nicias of Cos, who is with us, think Piraeus is <span class="italic">not</span> a town. But the matter of fact I leave for further enquiry. If I <span class="italic">have</span> made a mistake it is in speaking as of a locality instead of a town, and I had for precedent I won’t say

What follows turns on a point in Latin grammar, namely that the preposition which is usual with verbs expressing motion towards or away from an object is normally not used when the object is a town. Cicero claims that Piraeus, the port of Athens, was not properly a town but a district (‘deme’) of Attica.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL008_199_14').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
