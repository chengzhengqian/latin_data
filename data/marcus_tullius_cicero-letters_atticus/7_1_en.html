from your letter how earnestly you wish it. I do want you to realize that he is very seriously offended. But since, so far as I can see, there is no serious reason behind it, I am full of confidence that he will behave as a friend should and as I tell him.</p>
<p>Yes, I should be grateful if you would ship when you most conveniently can my statues and Heracles herms and anything else you may discover that would be <span class="italic">convenable</span> you know where, especially things you think suitable to a palaestra and lecture hall. In fact I am sitting there now as I write, so that the place itself is a reminder. Further please get me some bas-reliefs which I can lay in the stucco of the small entrance hall and two figured puteals.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL007_41_2" id="target_note_LCL007_41_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Mind you donâ€™t engage your library to anyone, no matter how ardent a wooer you may find. I am putting all my little gleanings aside to pay for this standby for my old age.</p>
<p>As to my brother, I feel sure things are as I have always wished and worked for. There are many signs of that, not least the fact that your sister is expecting a baby.</p>
<p>As regards my election,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL007_41_3" id="target_note_LCL007_41_3"><sup>3</sup></a> I do not forget that I left it to you, and I have all along been giving out to common friends who expect you back that, far from summoning you, I have told you <span class="italic">not</span> to come because I realize that it is much more important to you to be doing what you had to do at the present time than to me to have you here for the election. Accordingly I should like you to feel as though you had been sent to Greece on business of mine. My attitude will be just as though you had not only been present but responsible for any success that may come my way. So you will find and so you will hear from others.</p>
<p>Little Tullia is putting you into court, without calling on the surety.</p>
