I only hope I can finish what I have undertaken. It’s a big subject, as you realize, that I am grasping and an important one, requiring a great deal of time of which I am particularly short.</p>
<p>You say you regret Scaevola’s disappearance from the work which you are good enough to praise.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL007_337_2" id="target_note_LCL007_337_2"><sup>2</sup></a> I did not drop him casually, but followed the example of our divine Plato in his ‘Republic.’ Socrates calls on Cephalus, a rich, genial old gentleman, in the Piraeus. During the opening talk the old fellow is present at the discussion, but then, after speaking himself and very nicely too, he says he has to go and attend to a sacrifice, and does not reappear. I imagine that Plato thought it would not be quite <span class="italic">convenable</span> to keep a man of Cephalus’ age too long in so protracted a conversation. I felt this consideration arose for me much more strongly in Scaevola’s case, in view of his age and state of health, which were what you remember, and the eminence of his career, which made it seem hardly proper for him to be spending several days in Crassus’ Tusculan villa. Moreover the conversation in Book I was sufficiently relevant to Scaevola’s interests. The others, as you know, contain technicalities, in which I definitely did not want the old gentleman to participate—you remember how fond he was of his joke.</p>
<p>You write of Pilia’s affair.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL007_337_3" id="target_note_LCL007_337_3"><sup>3</sup></a> I shall attend to it. From Aurelianus’ reports it certainly seems to be of value, as you say. And I shall be making myself popular with my Tullia into the bargain. I am doing my best for Vestorius. I realize that this will please you and am taking care that <span class="italic">he</span> realizes it. But somehow or other, with two such easygoing fellows to deal with he is the most difficult of mortals.</p>
