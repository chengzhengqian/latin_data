<h2>407E (XVI.16E)</h2>
<h2><span class="italic">Pompeii, mid-July 44</span></h2>
<h2><span class="ac">Cicero to Plancus, Praetor-Designate</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">Forgive me for writing yet again about a matter on which I have already written to you in considerable detail, namely the Buthrotian case. I assure you, my dear Plancus, that I am not doing so out of any lack of confidence in your liberal inclinations or your friendship to me. But it is of so much consequence to our friend Atticus financially, and now in reputation as well, that he should show himself able to maintain in actuality what Caesar sanctioned both in decrees and in replies at which I was present as witness and signatory that I feel I must address you once more, especially as the matter lies entirely in your hands, and ask you, I don’t say to approve, but to approve with hearty good will the judgement pronounced by the Consuls in accordance with Caesar’s decrees and replies. Nothing in the world could gratify me more. I trust indeed that by the time this letter reaches you the request I made of you in my earlier letter will already have been granted. But I shall not cease to petition you until I get the news that you have taken the steps for which I am confidently hoping. Then I am sure I shall be writing a different kind of letter, one of thanks for your signal kindness. In that event I would have you believe that Atticus, who has so much at stake, will not be more deeply obliged to you than I, who am no less concerned than he.</p>
