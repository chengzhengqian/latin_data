<h2>237 (XI.22)</h2>
<h2><span class="italic">Brundisium, 1 (?) September 47</span></h2>
<h2><span class="ac">Cicero to Atticus</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">Balbus’ courier duly delivered the packet—I have had a letter from you in which you seem to be afraid that I may not have got those letters. I could wish they never <span class="italic">had</span> been delivered to me. They increased my distress, and if they had fallen into someone else’s hands they would have told him nothing new. Quintus’ hate of me and his style of letter writing is the commonest of knowledge. Caesar himself does not seem to have sent it to your friends as being annoyed by Quintus’ scandalous conduct, but, I imagine, to give greater publicity to my misfortunes. As for the fear you express that the letter may do him injury and your wish that I should counteract such an effect, Caesar did not even wait to be asked on his behalf. That certainly does not vex me; what does rather vex me is that these concessions we get are of no value.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL097_259_1" id="target_note_LCL097_259_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Sulla, I believe, will be here tomorrow with Messalla. They are hurrying off to Caesar, having been sent packing by the troops, who refuse to go anywhere until they get their pay. So, contrary to expectation, Caesar will be coming here; though the way he is travelling, stopping a number of days at every town (?), it won’t be soon. And Pharnaces, whatever he does, will take up time. So how do you advise me? Already my health hardly supports this oppressive climate, which adds physical discomfort to my distress of mind. Or should I ask these people who are on their way to him to make my excuses, and come nearer of my own volition? Do, pray, put your mind to the problem and help me with your advice, as you have not done hitherto
