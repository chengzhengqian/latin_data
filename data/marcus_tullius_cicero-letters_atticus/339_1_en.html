<p class="noindent">Though I am expecting a longer letter from you today (Nones of March), your bad day I believe, I thought I ought first to reply to that short letter which you sent on the 4th, just after the intermission.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL097_9_1" id="target_note_LCL097_9_1"><sup>1</sup></a> You say you are glad I have stayed and write that you hold to your opinion. But in your previous letter I thought you were clear that I should leave, provided that Gnaeus had embarked with a large following and that the Consuls had crossed. Don’t you remember this? Or did I not fully understand? Or have you changed your mind? But I shall see from the letter I am waiting for what you think, or I shall make you write another. No news yet from Brundisium.</p>

<p class="noindent">What a difficult, what an absolutely desperate business! How completely you cover the ground in giving your advice! But how completely you fail to find a solution with which you yourself can be satisfied! You are glad that I am not with Pompey; and you point out how discreditable it would be for me to be present at any proceedings derogatory </p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL097_9_1"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL097_9_1" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">1</sup>Of Atticus’ fever.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL097_9_1').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
