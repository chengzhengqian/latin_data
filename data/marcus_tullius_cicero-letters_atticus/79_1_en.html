Mine, heaven knows, is tranquil enough (?). Nor is it optimism so much that consoles me, as in time past, as indifference, a state of mind I particularly cultivate in these public and political matters. Indeed a certain foolish vanity to which I am somewhat prone (it’s a fine thing to know one’s failings) is actually gratified in a way. I used to be piqued by the thought that a thousand years hence Sampsiceramus’ services to Rome might be rated higher than mine. I can now rest easy on <span class="italic">that</span> score. The flop of his reputation makes Curius’ ‘Woman of Phocis’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL007_185_2" id="target_note_LCL007_185_2"><sup>2</sup></a> look like a popular success. But we will talk over all this when we meet. However, it looks to me as though you will still be in Rome when we get back, and I should really just as soon you were if you can conveniently manage it. But if you do come as you say you will, would you kindly fish out of Theophanes how our Arabian Prince<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL007_185_3" id="target_note_LCL007_185_3"><sup>3</sup></a> is disposed towards me? You will of course make your inquiries as a relative, and bring me a prescription as it were from him on how to conduct myself. We shall be able to get some inkling of the general situation from what he says.</p>

<p class="noindent">I have received several letters of yours from which I could see in what suspense and anxiety you were craving for news. Well, we are held down on all sides. We don’t object any longer to the loss of our freedom, but fear death and expulsion as greater evils, which are really far lesser.
