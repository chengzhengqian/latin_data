<h2>336 (XIII.44)</h2>

<h2><span class="ac">Cicero to Atticus</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">What a delightful letter!—though that procession<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_105_1" id="target_note_LCL491_105_1"><sup>1</sup></a> is distasteful enough. But it’s not distasteful to know all that goes on, including the bit about Cotta.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_105_2" id="target_note_LCL491_105_2"><sup>2</sup></a> The people are behaving splendidly in refusing to applaud Victory because of her undesirable neighbour. Brutus has been with me. He was strongly in favour of my addressing something to Caesar. I had consented, but the procession puts me off.</p>
<p>So you have ventured to give my work to Varro after all! I await his verdict. But when will he read it through? I think you were right about Attica. Even the mental lift to be gained not only from the spectacle but from the popular notion of its religious quality is not to be despised.</p>
<p>Would you please send me Cotta?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_105_3" id="target_note_LCL491_105_3"><sup>3</sup></a> I have Libo by me, and I had Casca before. Brutus has sent me word from T. Ligarius that the mention of L. Corfidius in my defence of Ligarius is an error on my part. It was a mere <span class="italic">lapsus memoriae</span>, as they say. I knew that Corfidius was a close friend of the Ligarii, but I find that he died before the case. So pray commission Pharnaces, Antaeus, and Salvius to delete that name in all the copies.</p>
