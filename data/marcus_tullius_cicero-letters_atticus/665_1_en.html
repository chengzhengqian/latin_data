If I had not been convinced, if I had not formed the opinion that this frame of mind would last, I should not have done what I am about to tell. I took the young man along to Brutus. He so fully accepted what I have just told you that he took Quintus’ word without more ado and declined my offices as guarantor; and in commending him he referred to you in the most affectionate terms, and dismissed him with an embrace and a kiss. I have therefore more reason to congratulate you than to plead. And yet I do also request you, if in the past, through the instability of his age, his conduct has at some points appeared somewhat deficient in settled principle, to conclude that he has put all that aside, and to believe my assurance that your influence will contribute much, or rather more than anything, to confirm his good intentions.</p>
<p>Brutus did not seem to catch as readily as I had expected at my frequent hints about a joint voyage. I thought he was rather <span class="italic">distrait</span>, as indeed he was, particularly over the games. But when I got back to my house Cn. Lucceius, who sees a lot of Brutus, told me that he was taking the journey very slowly, not from irresolution but in case something may turn up. So I wonder whether I should not make my way to Venusia and wait there for news about the legions. If they keep their distance, as some think likely, I can go on to Hydrus. If neither way is safe, I shall return to my starting point.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_313_2" id="target_note_LCL491_313_2"><sup>2</sup></a> *** <a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_313_3" id="target_note_LCL491_313_3"><sup>3</sup></a>Do you think I am joking?
