<h2>33 (II.13)</h2>

<h2><span class="ac">Cicero to Atticus</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">What a shame! My letter, written to you without delay from Tres Tabernae in reply to your most charming ones, never delivered! I must tell you that the bag in which I threw it was brought to my house in town on the day of dispatch and brought back to me at Formiae. So I am having your letter sent back to you to let you know how much at the time I appreciated those you wrote me.</p>
<p>You say that tongues are silent in Rome. I am not surprised. But my goodness, they are not silent in the country! The very fields cannot put up with your tyrannical regime. But if you come to Laestrygonian Telepylus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL007_171_1_2" id="target_note_LCL007_171_1_2"><sup>1</sup></a> here, that is to say to Formiae, you will find the place seething with anger and denunciation. How they hate our Great friend! His surname is as flyblown as that of Crassus Dives.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL007_171_2a" id="target_note_LCL007_171_2a"><sup>2</sup></a> Seriously I have not yet met a soul who takes it all as patiently as I do. So take my advice and let us stick to our studies. I can give you my oath that nothing is so rewarding.</p>
