<p>He dispatched the letter from Narbo on 18 April. You send me the report of Caninius’ shipwreck as though it were doubtful. Let me know if anything more definite comes in. You urge me not to abandon myself to grief; you will bring much relief if you give me a site for the shrine. I have many ideas for deification, but <span class="italic">must</span> have a site. So again, please see Otho.</p>

<p class="noindent">No doubt you have been very busy, since you haven’t sent me a line. But the fellow was a rascal not to wait for your convenience when he had been sent for that sole purpose. Now, unless something has detained you, I fancy you are in your place out of town. As for me here, I write all day long, which brings no comfort but still it gives me something else to think of.</p>
<p>Asinius Pollio has written to me<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL097_337_1" id="target_note_LCL097_337_1"><sup>1</sup></a> about our blackguard of a nephew. He puts in the plainest possible language what Balbus junior recently intimated with sufficient clarity and Dolabella hinted at. I should be upset, if there were any room in my heart for a new vexation. All the same, could anything be more blackguardly? A fellow to beware of! Though to me—but I must not let myself go. Send me a line, but only if you have the time, since there’s no necessity.</p>
