say. For with an army as feeble as mine and so little in the way of allies, loyal ones particularly, my best resource is winter. If that comes without the enemy invading my province first, my only fear is that the Senate will not want to let Pompey go in view of the dangers at home. But if they send someone else by the spring I shall not worry, as long as my own term is not extended.</p>
<p>So much then if you are in Rome. But if you are away—or for that matter if you are there—this is how things stand here. There is nothing amiss with our morale, nor I hope with our military effectiveness, because our plans are, I believe, sound. I have taken up a strong position, with plenty of corn available, almost in sight of Cilicia. I can easily change my ground, and the army, though small, is, I think, unanimously well disposed towards me. When Deiotarus joins us with his full muster I shall double it. I have the loyalty of the provincials in far greater measure than any governor before me; my mildness and abstinence seem to them beyond belief. A levy of Roman citizens is in progress. Corn is being taken from the countryside to safe places. Come the occasion, we shall defend ourselves with our weapons; if not, by the strength of our positions.</p>
<p>So be of good cheer. I can see you and perceive your affectionate concern as though you were here beside me. But I do ask of you, if it can by any means be managed and if nothing happens in the Senate to prejudice my position before the New Year, to be in Rome in January. I am sure I shall take no harm if you are standing by. We have friendly Consuls and a Tribune, Furnius, on our side. But your assiduity and skill and influence are required. It is a crisis. But it would be indecent for me to urge you at greater length.</p>
