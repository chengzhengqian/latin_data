Praetor. But we<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL097_51_6" id="target_note_LCL097_51_6"><sup>6</sup></a> have it in our books that it is illegal not only for Consuls but even Praetors to be elected under a Praetor, and that such a thing is without precedent—illegal for Consuls because it is illegal for a higher authority to be proposed by a lower, and for Praetors because they are proposed as colleagues of the Consuls, who possess higher authority. It won’t be long before he wants me to sanction this, he won’t be content with Galba, Scaevola, Cassius, Antony.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL097_51_7" id="target_note_LCL097_51_7"><sup>7</sup></a> ‘Then may the earth gape wide for me.’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL097_51_8" id="target_note_LCL097_51_8"><sup>8</sup></a> But you see what a storm is brewing.</p>
<p>I shall send you the names of the Senators who have crossed the water when I get them for certain. You are right about the grain supply, it cannot possibly be managed without the revenues.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL097_51_9" id="target_note_LCL097_51_9"><sup>9</sup></a> And you have good cause to fear both the uninhibited demands of his entourage and a wicked war. I should be very glad to see our friend Trebatius, though, so you say, he is most pessimistic. Please ask him to make haste. It will be convenient if his visit takes place before Caesar’s arrival.</p>
<p>About the property at Lanuvium, as soon as I heard of Phamea’s death I hoped—assuming that an ordered society was to continue—that one of my friends would buy it; but of you, my greatest friend, I did not think, being aware that you generally want to know about price-yield ratio and immovables and having seen your mark (?) in Delos<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL097_51_10" id="target_note_LCL097_51_10"><sup>10</sup></a> as well as in Rome. Anyhow, nice as it is, I don’t think it’s worth as much as it was reckoned to be in Marcellinus’ Consulship,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL097_51_11" id="target_note_LCL097_51_11"><sup>11</sup></a> when I thought that this little estate near Rome would be pleasanter for me on account of the house
