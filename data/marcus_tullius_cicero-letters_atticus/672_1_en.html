He is a likeable fellow in himself and I am fond of him, but your recommendation will be a great additional point in his favour.</p>
<p>Your letter is adequately answered. Now let me tell you something which I realize goes without saying but say none the less. Many things trouble me in leaving, and the chief among them you may be sure is that it means a separation from you. There is also the fatigue of the long voyage, which is unsuitable for a man of my age and, I may even add, my position. The timing too of my departure is somewhat incongruous. I am leaving peace behind with the intention of returning to war, and spending abroad the time that might have been spent on my little estates with their handsome houses and agreeable surroundings. My comforts are that I shall either do something for Marcus or at any rate make up my mind how much can be done for him, and next that, as I hope and you promise, you will soon join me. If that happens, my whole horizon will brighten up.</p>
<p>Most of all though it is the business of my balances that worries me. True, they have been put in order, but I am disturbed by the fact that they include Dolabellaâ€™s debt and claims by transfer as to which I have no personal knowledge. Nothing in the whole situation worries me so acutely. So I think I was right to write to Balbus quite plainly, asking him to come to the rescue if for any reason the payments should fail to synchronize, and telling him that I have asked you to get in touch with him in any such contingency. Please do so if you see no objection, especially if you are going to Epirus.</p>
<p>I write this on the point of embarking from my house </p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL491_327_5"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL491_327_5" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">5</sup>At Patrae.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL491_327_5').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
