If I had counted a fellow like that among my Prefects, what would you take me for?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_151_4" id="target_note_LCL008_151_4"><sup>4</sup></a> As you know, I have never put up with rudeness from the most powerful personages; was I to tolerate it from this hanger-on? And this is going beyond mere toleration, actually to confer something in the way of a favour and distinction. Well, this Gavius, seeing me recently at Apamea as he was leaving for Rome, accosted me in a tone I should hardly dare to use to Culleolus:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_151_5" id="target_note_LCL008_151_5"><sup>5</sup></a> ‘Where am I supposed to apply for my maintenance allowance as Prefect?’ I answered more gently than those present thought proper to the occasion, that it was not my practice to give maintenance allowances to persons whose services I had not used. He left in a huff. If Brutus can be affected by what this scum has to say, you can love him all by yourself, I shall not be your competitor. But I expect he will behave as befits him. However I wanted you to know the facts and I have given Brutus a fully detailed account of them. To be sure (I write in confidence) Brutus has never sent me a letter, not even most recently about Appius, that did not contain something arrogant, ungracious. Now one of your favourite sayings is</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line indent16">Granius now</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">Knew his own worth and hated proud grandees.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_151_6" id="target_note_LCL008_151_6"><sup>6</sup></a></span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">But this way of his amuses rather than irritates me. All the same he should really take a little more thought about what he writes and to whom.</p>
