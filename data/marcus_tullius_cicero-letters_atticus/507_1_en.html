am not in Rome, the answer is that it is the vacation. If they ask why I don’t stay in those of my little properties which would be seasonable just now, it is because I would find the crowds disagreeable. So I stay where the owner of a fine property at Baiae<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL097_345_4" id="target_note_LCL097_345_4"><sup>4</sup></a> used regularly to pass this time of year. When I come back to Rome neither my looks nor my words will give any occasion for censure. The gaiety with which I used to season the sadness of these times of ours is gone for ever, but resolution and fortitude in mind and word will not be wanting.</p>
<p>About the Scapula property, it seems possible what with your influence and mine to get it put up for auction. Otherwise I shall be shut out. But if I get into the sale room my eagerness will win against Otho’s purse. As to what you say about Lentulus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL097_345_5" id="target_note_LCL097_345_5"><sup>5</sup></a> it doesn’t lie with him. If only we make sure of the Faberius business and you do your best, as you are doing, we shall get what we want.</p>
<p>You ask how long I shall be here. A few days, but I have nothing definitely fixed. As soon as I have made up my mind I shall write to you, and please write to me how long you are going to be out of town. The day I send you this I have received news both by letter and by word of mouth about Pilia and Attica to the same effect as in your letter.</p>
