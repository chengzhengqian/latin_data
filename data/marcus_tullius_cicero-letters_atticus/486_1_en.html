the courts and the Senate House, with people crossing my path whom I can’t see without discomposure? You say people demand of me that I be present in Rome and are not willing to let me be absent or only allow it up to a certain point. I can assure you that for long enough I have thought more of your single self than of them all. Nor do I despise <span class="italic">my</span>self; I had much rather stand by my own judgement than by that of all the rest of the world. Still I go no farther than the best philosophical authorities allow me. Not content with reading all their writings to that purpose (which in itself was the behaviour of a brave invalid, to take one’s medicine), I have conveyed them into my own, which at any rate was not like a despondent, broken mind. Don’t call me away from these remedies back to your city hurly-burly, or I may relapse.</p>

<p class="noindent">With regard to Terentia, it is not like your usual indulgence towards me to place the whole load on my shoulders. These are just the sore spots I can’t handle without crying aloud for pain. So do pray adjust it as best you can. I don’t ask you to do more than you are able, which is (and only you can do it) to ascertain what is fair.</p>
<p>Since you seem to be in doubt about Rutilia, you will tell me when you find out (but please as soon as possible), and whether Clodia<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL097_303_1" id="target_note_LCL097_303_1"><sup>1</sup></a> survived the death of her son, the Consular D. Brutus. That point can be ascertained from Marcellus, or at all events from Postumia, the other from M. Cotta—or from Syrus or Satyrus.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL097_303_2" id="target_note_LCL097_303_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
