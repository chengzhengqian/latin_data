<p>Well, there you have the news of Rome—I don’t suppose you are interested in the census, which has now been given up as a bad job, or the trials under the lex Clodia.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL007_343_14" id="target_note_LCL007_343_14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>Now submit to a scolding, if you deserve it. You say in the letter given from Buthrotum which C. Decimius brought me that you think you had better go to Asia. I really must say that I don’t see where it makes such a difference whether you act through your agents or in person as to justify your being so long and so far away from us. But I wish I had tackled you about this before you made up your mind. I’m sure I should have made some impression. As it is I’ll call a halt to my scolding. I only hope that what I <span class="italic">have</span> said may have the effect of hastening your return.</p>
<p>I write to you less often than I otherwise should because I am not certain of your present or future whereabouts. But I thought I ought to give a letter to this I don’t know who because he seems likely to be seeing you. As you think you will go to Asia, I should be glad to know approximately when we may expect you back, and what you have done about Eutychides.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL007_343_15" id="target_note_LCL007_343_15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
