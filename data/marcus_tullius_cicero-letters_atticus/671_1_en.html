<p class="noindent">Why certainly you were wise (I am at last replying to the letter you sent me after your interview with Antony at Tibur)—wise, I say, to haul down your flag<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_325_1" id="target_note_LCL491_325_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and say thank you into the bargain.
