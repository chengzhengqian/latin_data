<h2><span class="ac">Cicero to Atticus</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">Egnatius is in Rome, but I took up Halimetus’ (?)<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL007_317_1_1" id="target_note_LCL007_317_1_1"><sup>1</sup></a> affair with him strongly at Antium. He assured me that he would speak seriously to Aquillius. So you will see him if you wish. I hardly think I can oblige Macro. There is the auction, I see, at Larinum on the Ides and for the two days following. As you think such a lot of Macro, I must ask you to forgive me. But don’t fail to dine with me on the 2nd with Pilia. You really must. On the Kalends I propose to dine at Crassipes’ place in the suburbs in lieu of an inn, and thus cheat the decree!<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL007_317_2" id="target_note_LCL007_317_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Then home after dinner so that I can be ready for Milo in the morning. I shall see you there then, and shall warn you beforehand. All my household wish to be remembered to you.</p>

<p class="noindent">Hardly had Apella (?) left when your letter arrived. Are you really saying that you don’t think he’ll bring the bill<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL007_317_1_2" id="target_note_LCL007_317_1_2"><sup>1</sup></a> to a vote? Please speak a little louder, I don’t think I quite caught! But do let me know at once, if you conveniently can that is. As the games are going on for an extra day, I shall be all the happier to be spending that day here with Dionysius.</p>
