<section class="div1 language" lang="en"><header><hgroup><h1>Letters to Atticus</h1></hgroup></header><section class="div2"><p class="noindent noindent">about three hours after sending off a pretty lengthy letter to you, on 26 April I received yours, and a bulky one it was. In reply I need not tell you that your sparkling jests about Vestorius’ ‘interest’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_181_3" id="target_note_LCL491_181_3"><sup>3</sup></a> in philosophy and the fashion of * at Puteoli did not go unappreciated. Let me turn to the more political part.</p>
<p>You defend the Bruti and Cassius as though I were blaming them, whereas I can’t praise them sufficiently. The evils I catalogued arise from the circumstances not the men. It is clear that after the removal of the tyrant the tyranny remains. Things are done which he had no intention of doing, over Cloelius for example. I am quite sure he would not have done this, or even allowed it to be done. Dear little Rufus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_181_4" id="target_note_LCL491_181_4"><sup>4</sup></a> Vestorius’ pet, will come next, and Victor, the man who was never put in a will (?),<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_181_5a" id="target_note_LCL491_181_5a"><sup>5</sup></a> and the others, every man jack of them. We could not bear to own Caesar as our master, but we bow to his notebooks. As for Bacchus’ Day,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_181_6" id="target_note_LCL491_181_6"><sup>6</sup></a> who could help coming to the Senate? Suppose that was somehow possible: when we <span class="italic">had</span> come, could we have spoken freely? Was it not essential at any cost to fend off the veterans who were standing by with arms in their hands while we were defenceless? You are my witness that I disapproved of that sitting still on the Capitol. What then? Was that the fault of the Bruti? Not at all. The culprits are certain other ‘bruti’ who think themselves prudent and wise, content to rejoice, some of them even willing to congratulate, none to stand fast.</p>
