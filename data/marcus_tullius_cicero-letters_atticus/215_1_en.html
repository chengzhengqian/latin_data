Yet he is now being paid at the rate of 33 Attic talents every 30 days, and that out of taxes, which is not enough to cover the monthly interest. However our Gnaeus is being quite reasonable about it—he foregoes his principal and is content with interest, and less than the full interest.

I had accordingly granted him two others as well, but the persons for whom he asked them had left the province.</p>
