<p>Cato, who could have held Sicily without any difficulty (and if he had, all the honest men would have joined him), left Syracuse on 23 April, so Curio has written to me. Let us hope Cotta holds Sardinia, as they say he will<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL097_179_1" id="target_note_LCL097_179_1"><sup>1</sup></a>—there is a rumour.

<p>In order to draw off suspicion as to my departure or intentions I left for Pompeii on the 12th, meaning to stay there while the necessaries for the voyage were got ready. On my arrival at the house I had a visit to inform me that the Centurions of the three cohorts stationed at Pompeii desired to meet me next day. Our friend Ninnius discussed this with me, told me they wanted to put themselves and the town in my hands. As for me, I was off and away from the house next morning before daybreak, so that they should not get so much as a sight of me. For what was the use of three cohorts, or even more, supposing there had been more? What equipment had they? I thought of those same Caelian ideas which I read in the letter of yours that I received as soon as I got back to Cumae later in the day; and besides, it could have been a trap. So I removed all suspicion.</p>
<p>Back again, I found that Hortensius had arrived and turned out of his road in order to call on Terentia and pay his respects. He had spoken of me very politely. I expect I shall be seeing him presently as he has sent a boy to tell me he is coming. That’s an improvement anyway on my colleague<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL097_179_3" id="target_note_LCL097_179_3"><sup>3</sup></a> Antony—who has an actress carried in a litter among his lictors.</p>
