I bore in mind that my situation was exceptional. My important services to the state had earned me a cruel and savage punishment. If I gave offence to a personage who, even when we were already in arms, was being offered a second Consulship and a most glorious Triumph, I should have to fight my battles over again, for further demonstration that bad citizens somehow find me a popular figure to attack. I did not have to guess these consequences, I was openly threatened with them. Nor was I so much afraid of incurring them if duty required as desirous of avoiding them if I honourably could.</p>
<p>There then you have my account of the period when peace might still be hoped for; over what followed circumstances deprived me of any power. To my critics I have a simple answer. I have never loved C. Caesar better than they, nor have they loved the Republic better than I. The difference between us is this: while they are very good patriots and I have some claim to that honourable title, I preferred that differences should be settled by negotiations, which I understood to be your desire also, they by force. Since their policy has triumphed, I need hardly say that I shall give the state no cause to complain of my patriotism nor you of my friendship.</p>
