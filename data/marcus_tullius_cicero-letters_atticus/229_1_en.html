<p>I see that you are pleased with my moderation and disinterestedness. You would be even more so if you were on the spot. At this assize which I have been holding in Laodicea from the Ides of February to the Kalends of May for all my Districts except those of Cilicia I have produced some astonishing results. A great number of communities have been entirely cleared of debt, many others substantially relieved. All have come to life again with the acquisition of home rule under their own laws and courts. I have enabled them to free themselves wholly or partially from debt in two ways. First, no expense whatsoever has been incurred during my term as governor—and when I say ‘no expense’ I am not speaking in hyperbole, I mean literally none, not a penny. You would hardly believe how much that has helped to drag the communities out of the mire. Then there is another thing. The natives themselves were responsible for an astonishing number of peculations in the communities, committed by their own magistrates. I personally investigated those who had held office in the last ten years. They admitted it quite frankly. So without any open disgrace they put back the money with their own hands into the various public purses. The civic bodies for their part, which had paid the tax farmers nothing in this present quinquennium, have now without any moaning paid the arrears of the previous quinquennium as well. So I am a prime favourite with the tax farmers. ‘Grateful gentry’ you may say.
