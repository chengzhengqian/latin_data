<p class="noindent">I am dispatching this letter, as I leave Cales for Capua (25 January), my eyes being slightly out of order.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_241_1" id="target_note_LCL008_241_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>L. Caesar brought Caesar’s message to Pompey on 23 January, when he was with the Consuls at Teanum. The terms offered were approved, but on condition that Caesar withdrew his troops from the towns he had occupied outside his province. If he did that he was told that we should return to Rome and settle matters through the Senate. I hope there is a chance of peace for the time being. Caesar is not quite happy in his madness nor Pompey in the forces at his disposal.</p>
<p>Pompey has expressed a wish for me to go to Capua and help with the levy, in which the response among the Campanian settlers is less than enthusiastic. Caesar’s gladiators at Capua, about whom I earlier sent you a false report based on Torquatus’ letter, have been very sensibly distributed by Pompey among the population, two per household. There were 1,000 shields in the establishment and they were said to be going to break out. Certainly a valuable precaution in the public interest.</p>
<p>About our womenkind, among whom your sister is included, pray consider whether it is quite creditable to us that they should stay in Rome when other ladies of their rank have left. I have written to them to that effect, as previously to yourself. I should like you to urge them to leave, especially as I have properties on the coast which is under my authority where they might stay without inconvenience (relatively speaking).
