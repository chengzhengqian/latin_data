<p>I think, indeed I am sure, that young Quintus has read a letter addressed to his father. He is in the habit of opening them and does so at my suggestion, in case there might be something we ought to know about. This particular letter contained the same item<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_153_7" id="target_note_LCL008_153_7"><sup>7</sup></a> about your sister which you wrote to me. I could see that the boy was dreadfully upset. He cried as he lamented over it to me. In fact I was greatly impressed by the dutiful, affectionate, thoughtful way he spoke. It makes me the more hopeful that nothing untoward will happen. So I wanted you to know.</p>
<p>Another thing I may as well mention is that Hortensius junior was in Laodicea for the gladiators, behaving in a scandalous, disgraceful fashion. For his father’s sake I asked him to dine the day he arrived and equally for his father’s sake did nothing more. He told me he would wait for me in Athens in order to go back with me to Rome. ‘Very good’ I said. What else could I say? To be sure I don’t suppose that what he said meant anything. I hope not, for I shouldn’t like to offend his father, for whom, believe me, I have a great regard. If however he does accompany me, I shall handle it so as not to give offence where I least wish.</p>
<p>That’s all—except this: would you please send me Q. Celer’s speech against M. Servilius?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_153_8" id="target_note_LCL008_153_8"><sup>8</sup></a> Send me a letter as soon as you can. If no news, just say that, that there is nothing doing, even if it means sending a courier of your own. My love to Pilia and your daughter. Take care of your health.</p>
