The object of the people in power, I imagine, is to leave nothing for anybody else to give away. The only one to speak or offer open opposition is young Curio. He gets hearty rounds of applause, a most flattering amount of general salutation in the Forum, and a great many other signs of good will from the honest men. Fufius on the other hand they pursue with catcalls and abuse and hisses. All this doesn’t make one more hopeful, but only sadder to see that the sentiment of the community is free while its courage is in chains.</p>
<p>You need not ask for details about this or that. The whole situation has reached a point at which no hope remains of even magistrates, let alone private individuals, ever becoming free men again. Yet in the midst of this suppression of liberty conversation is less inhibited than it used to be, at social gatherings, that is, and over dinner tables. Indignation is beginning to get the upper hand of fear, not however so as to lift the cloud of blank despair. The Campanian law too has a curse clause, to be pronounced upon themselves at a public meeting by all candidates for office, should they moot any form of land ownership not in accordance with the Julian laws. All are taking the oath without demur except Laterensis, who is thought to have made a fine gesture in giving up his candidature for the Tribunate rather than swear it.</p>
<p>But I have no stomach for more about politics. I’m out of humour with myself and writing is most painful. I keep my end up, not too abjectly in view of the general subjugation, but less boldly than befits my past. Caesar is inviting me very handsomely to accept that Commissionership, the one on his staff, and I am also offered a Free Commission </p></section><notes></notes></section>
