<p class="noindent">You keep on raising our hopes of your return. Recently we thought you were on your way, only to be suddenly put off until July. As things are, I think you should come back by the time you say, if you can do so conveniently. You will then be here for Quintus’ elections,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL007_47_1" id="target_note_LCL007_47_1"><sup>1</sup></a> you will see me after a long break, and you will settle your dispute with Acutilius. Peducaeus too has asked me to say this. We think it would be desirable for you to settle the business at long last. I am and have been at your disposal as intermediary.</p>
<p>Here in Rome my handling of C. Macer’s<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL007_47_2" id="target_note_LCL007_47_2"><sup>2</sup></a> case has won popular approval to a really quite extraordinary degree. Though I was favourably disposed to him, I gained far more from popular sentiment by his conviction than I should have gained from <span class="italic">his</span> gratitude if he had been acquitted.</p>
<p>I am very grateful for what you say about the Hermathena.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL007_47_3" id="target_note_LCL007_47_3"><sup>3</sup></a> </p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL007_47_1"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL007_47_1" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">1</sup>For the Plebeian Aedileship.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL007_47_1').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL007_47_2"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL007_47_2" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">2</sup>C.
