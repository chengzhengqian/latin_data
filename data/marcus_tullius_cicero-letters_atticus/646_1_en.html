<p class="noindent">I am strangely torn—though not in any pain. But a host of conflicting considerations about my trip come to my mind. If you ask how long this will go on, the answer is, as long as the choice is open, and that will be until I am on the quayside.</p>
<p>If Pansa makes any reply I shall send you my letter and his. I am expecting Silius, for whom I have a draft<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_275_1" id="target_note_LCL491_275_1"><sup>1</sup></a> drawn up. Let me know if you have any news. I have sent a letter to Brutus; concerning his journey I should be glad to hear from you too if you get any information.</p>

<p class="noindent">The courier whom I sent to Brutus turned back on the 25th. Servilia told him that Brutus had set out at 6:15 that morning. I was very sorry he did not get my letter. Silius has not yet turned up. I have drawn up a pleading, and am sending you the document. I should like to know what day I am to expect you.</p>
