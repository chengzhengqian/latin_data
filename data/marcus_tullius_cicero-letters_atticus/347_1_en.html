<p>For my part I am trying, as you advise and hope will be practicable, to obtain Caesar’s consent to my absence from any proceedings in the Senate against Gnaeus. But I am afraid I may not succeed. Furnius has come from him—to show you models for our imitation, he reports that Q. Titinius’ son is with Caesar. Anyway, according to Furnius Caesar expresses his gratitude to me, more than I could have wished. As for what he asks of me, briefly but as one having authority, you will learn it from his own letter. If only you had not been ill! We should have been together. Assuredly we should have hit upon a plan. ‘Two heads . . .’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL097_25_5" id="target_note_LCL097_25_5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>However let bygones be bygones and let us plan the future. Two things have misled me hitherto. At first there was the hope of a settlement, in which event I wanted to take a popular line and free my old age from anxiety. Then I saw that Pompey was embarking on a cruel and destructive war. Upon my word I thought that as a man and a citizen it was better to suffer any punishment rather than take a part, let alone a leading part, in such atrocity. But I feel even death would have been preferable to being with these people here. So think of all this, my dear Atticus, or rather think it out. I shall bear any outcome better than this pain.</p>
