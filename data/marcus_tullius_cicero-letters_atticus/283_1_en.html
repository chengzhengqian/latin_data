<p>There is a wide variety of opinion in our debates. Most people say that Caesar will not keep to his terms and that he has only put forward these demands to stop us making the necessary preparations for war. My own opinion is that he will in fact withdraw his garrisons. After all, if he is elected Consul he will have won, and with a lesser measure of criminality than that on which he has embarked. But we must take our medicine. We are scandalously ill prepared both in men and money; indeed we have left Caesar all there is of the latter in Rome, public, in the Treasury, as well as private. Pompey has left to join Appius’ legions,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_245_1" id="target_note_LCL008_245_1"><sup>1</sup></a> taking Labienus with him. I am waiting for your views about all this. I intend to return to Formiae at once.</p>

<p class="noindent">I think all your letters have reached me, but the first in the wrong order, the rest in the order you sent them through Terentia. I wrote to you about Caesar’s message, Labienus’ arrival, and the answer given by the Consuls and Pompey in a letter I dispatched from Capua on the 26th, and I threw a number of other items into the same letter.</p>
