<p class="noindent">You hear of our misfortunes sooner than I, for they flow from your quarter. Of good news you need expect none from here. I went to Capua for the Nones of February as the Consuls had directed. Lentulus arrived late that day. The other Consul had not arrived at all on the 7th, on which day I left Capua and stayed the night at Cales. From there I am dispatching this letter before daybreak on the 8th. While in Capua I learned this much, that the Consuls are worthless and that there is no troop levying anywhere. The recruiting officers dare not show their noses with Caesar in the offing, while our leader by contrast is nowhere and does nothing; and there are no volunteers. It is not loyalty they lack but hope. As for our Gnaeus, it is a lamentable and incredible thing. How utterly down he is! No courage, no plan, no forces, no energy. I won’t dwell on what is past—the disgraceful flight from Rome, the craven speeches in the towns, the ignorance of his own forces, let alone the enemy’s. What do you make of this latest? On 7 February C. Cassius the Tribune arrived in Capua with a message for the Consuls instructing them to go to Rome, remove the money from the Inner Treasury, and leave again at once. So having abandoned the capital they are expected to go back without any military force and then leave with every chance that they may be prevented! The Consul replied asking Pompey to go himself to Picenum first. But Picenum is completely lost—no one knows except me, from a letter of Dolabella’s. I have no doubt that Caesar will be in Apulia any minute and our Gnaeus on board ship.</p>
