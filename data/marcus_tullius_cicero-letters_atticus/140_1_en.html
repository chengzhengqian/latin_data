<p>My <span class="italic">heart</span> is high, higher even than in my palmy days, but my purse is low. None the less, with the help of my friends and against his opposition, I am repaying my brother’s generosity, so far as my resources allow, so as not to be left entirely penniless. With you away I don’t know what line to take as to my position in general. So make haste.</p>

<h2><span class="ac">Cicero to Atticus</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">Cincius was a very welcome arrival (before daybreak, 28 January), for he tells me that you are in Italy and that he is sending you boys. I didn’t want them to go without a letter from me, not that I have anything to write to you about, especially as you are almost here, but just to tell you that I <span class="italic">am</span> more than delighted to hear of your return and have been impatiently looking forward to it. We’ll deal with other matters when we meet. So hurry to join me, confident in my affection as in your own. I write in haste. The day you get here, don’t fail to stay with me and bring your folks.</p>

<p class="noindent">Nothing could have been more <span class="italic">à propos</span> than your letter, which has greatly relieved my anxiety about our nephew, good boy that he is. Chaerippus had arrived two hours previously with the most horrifying reports.</p>
