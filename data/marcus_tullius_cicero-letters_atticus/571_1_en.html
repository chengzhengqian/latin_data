<p class="noindent">First my love to Attica. I suppose she is in the country. Much love then, and to Pilia.</p>
<p>Any news about Tigellius?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_125_1" id="target_note_LCL491_125_1"><sup>1</sup></a> As Fabius Gallus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_125_2" id="target_note_LCL491_125_2"><sup>2</sup></a> has written to me, he is airing a most unreasonable grievance against me, namely that I let Phamea down after undertaking his case. I <span class="italic">had</span> undertaken it, contrary to my inclination, it being against the Octavius boys, Gnaeus’ sons. But I was well disposed to Phamea too, for, if you remember, he had offered me his services through you when I was standing for the Consulship, and the fact that I made no use of them did not lessen my sense of obligation. Well, he came and told me that his judge had appointed for the hearing the very day that our friend Sestius’ case was due to come up under the lex Pompeia—you know the days for those trials were determined in advance. I answered that he was aware of my obligations to Sestius. Let him fix any other day and I should not fail him. So he left in a huff. I think I told you the story. Naturally I did not concern myself or feel any need to trouble about the ill-humour, entirely unwarranted as it was, of a mere acquaintance. When I was last in Rome I told Gallus what I had heard, without mentioning Balbus junior by name. Gallus, as he says in his letter, made it his business. He says that Tigellius is giving out that my suspicions of himself spring from my bad conscience on account of my desertion of Phamea. So all I ask of you is to find out anything you can about that
