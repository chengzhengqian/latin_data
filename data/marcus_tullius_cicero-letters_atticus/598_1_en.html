I clashed with P. Clodius when I was championing the public cause and he his own. The country stood umpire upon our disputes. If he were alive today there would no longer be any strife between us. So since in making this request of me you say that you will not use your power in the matter against my wishes, you may if you think proper present the concession to the boy also as coming from me; not that in view of our respective ages I could reasonably envisage any danger from his quarter, nor that a man of my standing need greatly fear any conflict, but in order that we ourselves may be on closer terms than we have been on hitherto. For in the past, with these feuds standing between us, your heart has been more open to me than your house. But I need say no more.</p>
<p>One thing in conclusion. I shall always, without hesitation and with my whole heart, do anything that I think to accord with your wishes and interests. Of that I hope you will feel fully assured.</p>
