<p class="noindent">I have provided for everything except a safe and secret journey to the Adriatic. I cannot go by this sea at this time of year. But how to go where my heart would be and where duty calls? I must leave quickly, or I may somehow be obstructed and tied down. Nor, appearances notwithstanding, is it Pompey who draws me. I already knew him to be a hopeless failure as a statesman, and I now find him an equally bad general. It is not he therefore who draws me but the things people are saying, which I learn from Philotimus. He says the optimates are tearing me to shreds. What sort of optimates, in heaven’s name? Look at the way they are now going out to meet Caesar and positively currying his favour. As for the towns, they make a god of him, and no pretence about it either, as there was when they were offering their prayers for Pompey’s recovery.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL097_3_1" id="target_note_LCL097_3_1"><sup>1</sup></a> But the truth is that any evil this Pisistratus has not done is earning him as much popularity as if he were to have stopped someone else doing it. In him they hope to find a gracious power, while Pompey they think is an angry one. You can imagine the town deputations and official compliments. You will say they are frightened. I dare say they are, but I’ll be bound they’re more frightened of Pompey than of Caesar. They are delighted with <span class="italic">his</span> artful clemency and fear the other’s wrath. Jurors of the panel of 360,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL097_3_2" id="target_note_LCL097_3_2"><sup>2</sup></a> who were our Gnaeus’ especial admirers (I see one or other of them every day), are shuddering at certain threats of his. So I ask you, what sort of optimates are these that thrust me out
