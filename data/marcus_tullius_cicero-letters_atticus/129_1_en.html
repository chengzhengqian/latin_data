<h2>73 (IV.1)</h2>
<h2><span class="italic">Rome, about 10 September 57</span></h2>
<h2><span class="ac">Cicero to Atticus</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">As soon as I arrived in Rome and came by a suitable person to take a letter to you, I considered it my first duty to congratulate you on my return. I had found you, to be quite frank, neither bolder nor wiser than myself as an adviser, nor, I may add, excessively sedulous in guarding me from harm in default of (?) observances on my part to make you so. But I also found that, having in the early days shared my error, or rather infatuation, and participated in my false alarm, you felt our severance most keenly, and devoted a vast amount of time and zeal and patience and labour to bringing about my return. And so I sincerely assure you that in the plenitude of longed-for joy and congratulation one thing has been wanting to make my cup flow over: to see you, or rather to hold you in my arms. Once I win that happiness, if ever I let it go and if I do not also claim all the arrears of your delightfu1 company that are owing to me, I shall really consider myself hardly worthy of this restitution of my fortunes.</p>
<p>Of my general position it can so far be said that I have attained what I thought would be most difficult to recover, namely my public prestige, my standing in the Senate, and my influence among the honest men, in larger measure than I had dreamed possible. But my private affairs are in a very poor way—you are aware how my property has been crippled and dissipated and pillaged—and I stand in need not so much of your resources, which I count as my own, as of your advice in pulling together what is left and putting it on a sound footing.</p>
