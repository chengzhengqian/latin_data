When it grew brighter I had the earlier of your two letters read to me. It is the most elegant of compositions—what I think I say, hang me if I don’t! I have never read anything in better taste. Yes, I’ll follow where you beckon,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_361_2" id="target_note_LCL491_361_2"><sup>2</sup></a> provided only that you help. But at first sight it all seemed to me quite remarkably <span class="italic">mal à propos</span> as a reply to the letter in which I sought your advice. Then, lo and behold, the second letter, in which you encourage me to proceed ‘by windy Mimas, to Psyria’s isle,’ with the Appian Way ‘on our left hand’ of course.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_361_3" id="target_note_LCL491_361_3"><sup>3</sup></a> So I stayed that night at Aquinum—a longish journey and a bad road. I am giving Tiro (?) this letter the following morning before I leave; actually Eros’ letter is my reason for sending him, very much against my inclination. Tiro will tell you about the matter. You will see what is to be done, and furthermore whether I can come closer—I would rather stay at Tusculum or somewhere else just outside Rome. Or do you think I ought to go even further away? I hope you will write to me frequently. There will be someone to take a letter every day.</p>
<p>You go on to ask what I think you should do. It’s difficult to advise, not being on the spot, but if they are evenly matched I think you should lie low. If on the other hand the thing<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_361_4" id="target_note_LCL491_361_4"><sup>4</sup></a> spreads, and spreads as far as ourselves, we must then make a common decision.</p>
