your mind, its amenity, its dignity. Try, I beg you, to recover all this, as you are doing, and make it possible for me to celebrate the birthday of my return in your delightful house with you and my family. I <span class="italic">did</span> want to hold myself in readiness for this proffered hope and expectation on your property in Epirus for preference, but the letters I get suggest that it will be more convenient for me to stay where I am.</p>
<p>About my house and Curio’s speech, it is just as you say. Everything will be included in the general restoration of my status, if only that comes about. I care as much about the house as anything. But I don’t give you any specific charge, I throw myself entirely on your affection and loyalty. It is very good news that you have freed your hands from business although you have so large an inheritance to think of. I fully appreciate the value of your offer to put all your resources at the service of my restoration and your assurance that in all things you take first place in aiding me. I know that you are taking upon yourself a multiple share of the burden, that you can support it, and that you do not have to be asked to do it.</p>
<p>As you tell me not to imagine that any supposed offence or neglect on my part has made any impression upon your mind, I shall do as you wish and dismiss that worry from my thoughts; but none the less I shall feel all the more indebted to you for showing a more generous spirit towards me than I have shown to you. I hope you will write and tell me what you see and what you gather and what is going on, and encourage all your friends to work for my restoration. Sestius’ bill is not satisfactory either from the standpoint of dignity or from that of security. The law should mention my name and be more carefully drafted </p></section><notes></notes></section>
