of your suggestion about Tusculum. However resourceful you may be (and are), this idea could not have occurred to you so pat unless you had been really anxious for me to attain my heart’s wish. But somehow I want it to be in the public way; so you <span class="italic">must</span> get me a place in the suburbs. Scapula’s is very much in the public way, and furthermore has the advantage of being close to town so that one would not have to spend the whole day in a country house.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL097_335_1" id="target_note_LCL097_335_1"><sup>1</sup></a> So before you leave I should be very grateful if you would have a meeting with Otho if he is in Rome. If nothing comes of it, I shall go to lengths which will make you angry, used though you are to bearing with my folly. Drusus certainly wants to sell. So if no alternative is available it won’t be my fault if I buy. Pray don’t let me make a fool of myself over it. And the only way you can prevent that is if we can manage something as to the Scapula estate. And I should be glad if you would let me know how long you are going to be at your place near Rome.</p>
<p>I need your influence with Terentia as a friend no less than as an adviser. But you will do as you think best. I know that you are wont to care more for anything that concerns me than I do myself.</p>
