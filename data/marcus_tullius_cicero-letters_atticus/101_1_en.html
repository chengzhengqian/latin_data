What is there to hold me, especially if the hope which followed me when I left Rome is no more? I shall not proceed to make a catalogue of all the tribulations on which I have fallen by the signal injury and villainy not so much of those who hated me as of those who were jealous of me. That would only be to stir up my grief and ask you to share my mourning. This I do say flatly, that no one ever suffered so crushing a blow or had greater cause to pray for death. I might have met it with honour, but the moment was let pass. From the time that remains I do not look any longer for a remedy but only for an end to my misery.</p>
<p>I see you are collecting every item in the political news which you think could afford me some hope of a change. They don’t amount to much, but, since you wish, let us wait and see.</p>
<p>If you make haste you will catch me up even now, as I shall either go to Epirus or travel slowly through Candavia. My hesitation about Epirus is not due to fickleness of purpose but to uncertainty about my brother,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL007_229_2" id="target_note_LCL007_229_2"><sup>2</sup></a> i.e. where I am to meet him—though how I am to meet him or to say good-bye to him I know not. That is the greatest and saddest of all my sorrows.</p>
<p>I should write to you more often and more fully, if it were not that my distress has robbed me of all my mental powers and more particularly of this sort of faculty. I long to see you. Take care of your health.</p>
<p>Dispatched 29 April, on departure from Brundisium.</p>
