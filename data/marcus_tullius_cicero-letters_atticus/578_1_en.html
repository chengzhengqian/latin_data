<p class="noindent">He<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_139_1" id="target_note_LCL491_139_1"><sup>1</sup></a> came to see me, ‘right down in the mouth.’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_139_2" id="target_note_LCL491_139_2"><sup>2</sup></a> I greeted him with ‘“You there, why so pensive?”’ ‘Need you ask,’ was the answer, ‘considering that I have a journey in front of me, and a journey to war,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_139_3" id="target_note_LCL491_139_3"><sup>3</sup></a> a dishonourable journey too as well as a dangerous one?’ ‘What’s the compulsion?’ I enquired. ‘Debt,’ he answered, ‘and yet I haven’t so much as my travelling expenses.’ At that I borrowed some of your eloquence—I held my tongue.
