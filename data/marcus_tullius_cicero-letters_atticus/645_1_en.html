<p>Tiro says you are now against Brundisium and that you say something about troops. But I had already made up my mind, for Hydrus. Those five hours<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_273_3" id="target_note_LCL491_273_3"><sup>3</sup></a> of yours weighed with me, and from here it’s a devil of a voyage. However, we’ll see. No letter from you on the 21st, but that is not surprising since you could hardly have any news already. Come over then just as soon as you can. I am in a hurry for fear that Sextus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_273_4" id="target_note_LCL491_273_4"><sup>4</sup></a> may forestall me. They say he is on his way.</p>

<p class="noindent">We can congratulate ourselves on young Quintus’ departure. He won’t be a nuisance. I don’t doubt that Pansa speaks fair. I know that he has always been thick with Hirtius, I think he is very amicably disposed towards Brutus and Cassius—if it suits his book (but when is he going to see them?). As to his being hostile to Antony—when and why? How much longer are we going to be fooled? When I said that Sextus was on his way I did not mean to imply that he was already close but that this was certainly his plan and that there was not the least sign of his laying down his arms. Certainly war is inevitable if he goes on. And this favourite of Cythera and Cytheris<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_273_1" id="target_note_LCL491_273_1"><sup>1</sup></a> tells us that only the victors will survive. What does Pansa say to that? Which side will he join if war comes, as come it apparently will? But of this and other things when we meet, today, as you say in your letter, or tomorrow.</p>
