When we arrived there Quintus said in the kindest way ‘Pomponia, will you ask the women in, and I’ll get the boys?’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_27_4" id="target_note_LCL008_27_4"><sup>4</sup></a> Both what he said and his intention and manner were perfectly pleasant, at least it seemed so to me. Pomponia however answered in our hearing ‘I am a guest myself here.’ That, I imagine, was because Statius had gone ahead of us to see to our luncheon. Quintus said to me ‘There! This is the sort of thing I have to put up with every day.’ You’ll say ‘What was there in that, pray?’ A good deal. I myself was quite shocked. Her words and manner were so gratuitously rude. I concealed my feelings, painful as they were, and we all took our places at table except the lady. Quintus however had some food sent to her, which she refused. In a word, I felt my brother could not have been more forbearing nor your sister ruder. And I have left out a number of things that annoyed me at the time more than they did Quintus. I then left for Aquinum, while Quintus stayed behind at Arcanum and came over to see me at Aquinum early the following day. He told me that Pomponia had refused to spend the night with him and that her attitude when she said good-bye was just as I had seen it. Well, you may tell her to her face that in my judgement her manners that day left something to be desired. I have told you about this, perhaps at greater length than was necessary, to show you that lessons and advice are called for from your side as well as from mine.</p>
<p>For the rest, make sure you execute all my commissions before you leave Rome, and write to me about everything, and get behind Pomptinus, and when you have left let me know, and don’t ever doubt how much I love and like you.</p>
<p>I parted very amicably from A. Torquatus at Minturnae, an excellent person. You might intimate to him in conversation that I have written something to you.</p>
