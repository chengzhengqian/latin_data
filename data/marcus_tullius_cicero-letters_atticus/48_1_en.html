<p>As for Sicyon, as I wrote to you earlier, there is not much to be hoped for from the Senate. Nobody is protesting any longer. So if you wait for that, you will wait a long time. Find some other way to fight, if you can. When the thing was being done, no one noticed whom it affected and the rank and file stampeded to vote for the motion. It would be premature to try to cancel the decree since no one is protesting and many people are pleased, partly from malice, partly from a notion of equity.</p>
<p>Your friend Metellus is an excellent Consul. I have only one criticism, he is not overhappy at the news of peace in Gaul. He wants a triumph, I suppose. I could wish he was not so set on it, but in all other respects he’s excellent. The way Aulus’ son is behaving is making his Consulship not so much a Consulship as a blot in our Great Man’s copybook.</p>
<p>With regard to my writings, I have sent you my ‘Consulship’ in Greek, finished. I gave the book to L. Cossinius. I fancy you like my Latin stuff, but as a Greek yourself may look askance at this Greek performance. If others write, I’ll send you copies, but upon my word, once they’ve read this thing of mine, somehow or other they slow down.</p>
<p>To come now to my own interests, L. Papirius Paetus, an honest man and an admirer of mine, offered me as a present the books left by Ser. Claudius. As your friend Cincius told me that there was nothing in his namesake’s law<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL007_123_3" id="target_note_LCL007_123_3"><sup>3</sup></a> to stop me taking them, I said I would accept with pleasure if he brought them over. Now if you love me and know that I love you, do make every possible effort, through your friends, clients, guests, even your freedmen </p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL007_123_3"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL007_123_3" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">3</sup>This law, of 204 (lex Cincia), forbade advocates to accept fees for their services.
