<h2><span class="italic">Tusculum, 13 July 45</span></h2>
<h2><span class="ac">Cicero to Atticus</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">Monstrous! Your namesake<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_103_1_1" id="target_note_LCL491_103_1_1"><sup>1</sup></a> is enlarging Rome, which two years ago he had never seen, and Caesar thinks it too small though it’s big enough to hold <span class="italic">him</span>! So I expect a letter from you on the subject.</p>
<p>You say you will make the presentation to Varro as soon as he arrives. So it is done and your boats are burned. Ah, if you only knew what a risk you are running! Or perhaps my letter held you back, if you had not read it when you wrote your last. I am dying to know how the matter stands.</p>
<p>As to Brutus’ affection and your walk together, you tell me nothing new, only what you have told me many times before. Yet the oftener I hear it the gladder it makes me, and I find it all the more agreeable because it gives <span class="italic">you</span> pleasure and believe it the more implicitly because it is you who say it.</p>

<p class="noindent">Certainly I shall take advantage of the deferment,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_103_2" id="target_note_LCL491_103_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and it was most kind of you to let me know, writing too from the games so that I received a letter when I did not expect one.</p>
