<h2>402 (XV.14)</h2>
<h2><span class="italic">Tusculum, 28 June 44</span></h2>
<h2><span class="ac">Cicero to Atticus</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">On the 26th I received a letter from Dolabella, of which I sent you a copy, saying that he had met all your wishes. I wrote back immediately, thanking him at length. However, in case he should wonder why I did so twice over, I have made the excuse that I had not previously had the opportunity to learn anything by word of mouth from yourself. But, not to waste words, I have sent him a letter as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="sc">cicero to his friend dolabella, consul</span></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>I have already written to thank you, after hearing by letter from our friend Atticus of your great kindness and the great service you have rendered him and after you yourself also had written to tell me that you had done what we wished, in terms from which I hoped it would be clear that you could have done nothing to please me more. But now that Atticus himself has paid me a visit at Tusculum for the express purpose of declaring to me his gratitude to you, having clearly recognized, as he put it, your signal and extraordinary good will in the Buthrotian case and your singular affection for myself, I felt I had to write once again and more plainly to the same effect. Of all your acts of friendship and service towards me, dear Dolabella, shining as they are, allow me to say that I esteem most highly and accept most gratefully the demonstration you have given to Atticus of my affection for him and of yours for me.</p></blockquote>
