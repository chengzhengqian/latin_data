distress of mine, so far from being lessened by taking yours into partnership, is actually increased. True, you perceive with your usual sagacity the kind of comfort that can best relieve me. You approve my course of action and say that none better was open to me in such circumstances. You add, what weighs lighter with me than your opinion but has some weight none the less, that my action has the approval of others also, that is of those that count. If I thought this was so, my distress would be lighter. ‘Believe me,’ you say. So I do, but I know how much you wish to alleviate my unhappiness. I have never regretted quitting the war. There was so much cruelty involved in it, such association with barbarian races; so that a proscription, not by individuals but by whole classes had been sketched out, and it was already agreed by universal consent that the possessions of all of you should be the plunder of the victors. I mean ‘you’ literally; for with respect to you personally there were never any but the most ferocious intentions. So I shall never regret my attitude, but I do regret the course I adopted. I wish I had stayed quietly in some town or other until I was sent for. I should have incurred less talk, suffered less distress. I should not be on the horns of my present dilemma. On the one hand, to be stuck in Brundisium is in every way disagreeable: on the other, how is it possible for me to draw nearer, as you advise, without the lictors which the people gave me and which cannot be taken away so long as I retain my rights as a citizen? I lately (?) made them mix with the crowd, with staves,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL097_199_1" id="target_note_LCL097_199_1"><sup>1</sup></a> for a short time when I was approaching the town, for fear of an attack by the soldiery. Ever since I have kept indoors.</p>
