The man<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_181_10" id="target_note_LCL008_181_10"><sup>10</sup></a> who spoke against the motion gave me more in his own proposal than if he had voted me all the Triumphs in creation. Two members agreed with him, one, Favonius, a friend of mine, the other, Hirrus, with a grudge against me. Moreover Cato witnessed the decree and wrote to me about his motion in the pleasantest way.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_181_11" id="target_note_LCL008_181_11"><sup>11</sup></a> All the same, in congratulating me on the Supplication Caesar is triumphant about Cato’s motion, not mentioning <span class="italic">what</span> he proposed, only that he was against the grant.</p>
<p>To come back to Hirrus: you had made a start in mollifying him towards me. Finish the job! You have Scrofa and Silius to help. I wrote to them even before, and I have now written to Hirrus himself. He had spoken them fair, said that he could have obstructed but chose not to do so; he had merely registered support for Cato, a very good friend of mine, in a proposal most flattering to me; and yet I had not written to him, though I had sent letters to everyone else. He was right there. He and Crassipes were the only ones I did not write to.</p>

He’s nothing but a cooker of accounts, a real Lartidius.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_181_12" id="target_note_LCL008_181_12"><sup>12</sup></a> ‘But let what’s past be past, though sore our hearts.’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_181_13" id="target_note_LCL008_181_13"><sup>13</sup></a> Let us get things straight in future, and this to start with—it’s brought me worry on top of grief—but this Precius inheritance, whatever it amounts to, I don’t want it mixed up with the business which <span class="italic">he</span> is handling on my account.
