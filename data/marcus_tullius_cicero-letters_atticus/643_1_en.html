It’s all Brutus’ fault.</p>
<p>You say that Pompey has been admitted into Carteia. So he’ll presently be bringing an army against Antony. Which camp then? For Antony is putting middle courses out of the question. Weakness on one side, villainy on the other. So let’s make haste. But assist me with some advice, whether to go<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_269_3" id="target_note_LCL491_269_3"><sup>3</sup></a> from Brundisium or from Puteoli. Brutus’ departure is sudden, but he is wise. I feel a pang. When shall I see him again? But such is life, and we must bear it. You yourself cannot see him. The gods confound that man,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_269_4" id="target_note_LCL491_269_4"><sup>4</sup></a> dead as he is, for ever meddling with Buthrotum!

You say a loan will have to be raised for five months, i.e. to the Kalends of November, of HS 200,000—that being the date on which the money Quintus owes is due. All right, as Tiro says you don’t want me to come to Rome on that account, I should be grateful if you would see where to raise the wind, if that won’t be in any way awkward for you, and debit me accordingly. This seems to cover immediate needs. I shall go into the arrears more thoroughly with Eros himself, including the rents of the dower property. If these are paid to Marcus properly he will have just about all he needs, though I want him to be pretty comfortable. On my side I too shall evidently want something for travelling expenses. But the other will be paid as the rents come in, whereas I must have a lump sum. I certainly shan’t leave until I see my way clear to </p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL491_269_2"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL491_269_2" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">2</sup>If Madvig is right this refers to the forced suicide of the elder Catulus in 87.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL491_269_2').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note inline" id="note_LCL491_269_3"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL491_269_3" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">3</sup>To Greece.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL491_269_3').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note inline" id="note_LCL491_269_4"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL491_269_4" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">4</sup>Caesar.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL491_269_4').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
