Marcellus has irritated our friend<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_53_2" id="target_note_LCL008_53_2"><sup>2</sup></a> as muchas Caesar. But that’s his affair.</p>
<p>I too think Pompey is determined to go to Spain, as you say Varro says. I am not at all in favour of his doing so, and indeed I had no difficulty in persuading Theophanes that the policy of staying put is as good as any. So the Greek will exert his influence, to which Pompey much defers.</p>
<p>I am sending this letter as I leave Athens, on 6 July, after a stay of ten clear days. Pomptinus has arrived and Cn. Volusius with him. My Quaestor<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_53_3" id="target_note_LCL008_53_3"><sup>3</sup></a> is here. Your friend Tullius is the only absentee. I have some Rhodian open vessels, some Mytilenian two-deckers, and a few rowing craft. Of the Parthians there is no whisper. As for the future, heaven be my help!</p>
<p>So far my journey through Greece has been the admiration of the country, and I must say that I have no complaint to make so far of any of my party. I think they know my position and the understanding on which they come. They are really jealous for my good name. As for the future, if there is anything in the old saying ‘like master . . .’ they will certainly keep it up, for they will see nothing in my behaviour to give them any pretext for delinquency. Should that not answer however, I am prepared for sterner measures. So far I am gaining their hearts by gentleness, and I hope that this is not without effect. But it is only for one year that I have steeled myself in this ‘disinterest,’ as they say in Sicily. So do your utmost, for fear that if my term is extended I may turn out a rascal after all.</p>
<p>Now I come back to your commissions. In the matter of the Prefects, let there be no excuses. Promise anyone
