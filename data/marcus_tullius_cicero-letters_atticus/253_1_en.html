<p>I come to your letters, a spate of which reached me simultaneously, each more agreeable than the last—those, that is, which were in your own hand. I liked Alexis’ hand because it so nearly resembles your own, but again I didn’t like it because it showed you were unwell. Apropos of him, I have left Tiro at Patrae sick, an accomplished, conscientious young fellow as you know and, you are at liberty to add, an honest one. I never saw a better.
