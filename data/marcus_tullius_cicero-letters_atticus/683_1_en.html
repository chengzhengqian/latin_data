<p class="noindent">Two letters for me from Octavian in one day! Now wants me to return to Rome at once, says he wants to work through the Senate. I replied that the Senate could not meet before the Kalends of January, which I believe is the case. He adds ‘with your advice.’ In short, he presses and I play for time. I don’t trust his age and I don’t know what he’s after. I don’t want to do anything without your friend Pansa. I’m nervous of Antony’s power and don’t want to leave the coast. But I’m afraid of some star performance during my absence. Varro doesn’t think much of the boy’s plan, I take a different view. He has a strong force at his back and <span class="italic">can</span> have Brutus.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_349_1_1" id="target_note_LCL491_349_1_1"><sup>1</sup></a> And he’s going to work quite openly, forming companies at Capua and paying out bounties. War is evidently coming any minute now. Let me have an answer to all this. I am surprised that my courier left Rome on the Kalends without a letter from you.</p>

<p class="noindent">On the Nones I received two letters from you, the first dispatched on the Kalends, the second on the day preceding. First then my answer to the earlier. I am glad you like my work. You have quoted the very gems, and your good opinion makes them sparkle the brighter in my eyes. I was terrified of those little red wafers of yours!<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_349_1_2" id="target_note_LCL491_349_1_2"><sup>1</sup></a> You are right </p></section><notes></notes></section>
