<h2>385 (XV.8)</h2>
<h2><span class="italic">Tusculum, 31 May 44</span></h2>
<h2><span class="ac">Cicero to Atticus</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">After you left two letters came in from Balbus (no news) and also one from Hirtius, who writes that he is in very bad odour with the veterans. I am waiting to hear what he does about the Kalends, and so am sending Tiro and several others with him so that you can dispatch letters by them one by one after each fresh development as it occurs. I have also written to Antony about my Commission<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_239_1" id="target_note_LCL491_239_1"><sup>1</sup></a> for fear his touchy susceptibilities might be ruffled if I wrote to Dolabella only. Since he is said to have become rather hard of access I have asked Eutrapelus to give him my letter. The gist of it is that I want a Commission. A votive one looks better, but I can do with either.</p>
<p>About yourself, pray do nothing hastily. I hope you may be able to talk with me, but if you can’t manage that, letters will answer the same purpose. Graeceius writes to me that C. Cassius has written to <span class="italic">him</span> that men are being got together to be sent in arms against my house at Tusculum. It seems scarcely likely to me, but I must beware all the same and see about strengthening the guard. But tomorrow ought to give us something to think about.</p>
