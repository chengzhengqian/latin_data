supersession, and a Praetor will simultaneously make a proposal to the Assembly. The case is such that I cannot defend the fellow without loss of credit;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL007_59_3" id="target_note_LCL007_59_3"><sup>3</sup></a> public opinion, better-class and popular alike, would not stand it. Nor should I care to, which is the main thing. And there is something else—I must ask you to look into it for me thoroughly. I have a freedman, a thorough scoundrel—I refer to your accountant and client Hilarus. Valerius the interpreter sends me word of him, and Thyillus too writes that he has heard, as follows: that the fellow is with Antonius; and that Antonius, when levying money, is in the habit of saying that part of it is for me and that I have sent my freedman to keep an eye on our joint profits. I was a good deal disturbed, though I didn’t believe it. But there has certainly been some talk. Investigate the whole thing and find out just what has been going on; and if you can manage it, get that scamp out of the country. Valerius gives Cn. Plancius as his authority for the talk. I leave the whole thing entirely in your hands. See what’s in it.</p>
<p>It’s generally agreed that Pompey is very much my friend. His divorcing Mucia is warmly approved. I imagine you will have heard that P. Clodius, son of Appius, was caught dressed up as a woman in C. Caesar’s house at the national sacrifice,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL007_59_4" id="target_note_LCL007_59_4"><sup>4</sup></a> and that he owed his escape alive to the hands of a servant girl—a spectacular scandal. I am sure it distresses you.</p>
<p>I have nothing else to tell you. As a matter of fact I am writing in some distress of mind. My <span class="italic">lecteur</span> Sositheus, a charming lad, has died, and it has affected me more than the death of a slave perhaps ought to do. I hope you will write to me often. If you lack a topic, just put down whatever comes into your head.</p>
