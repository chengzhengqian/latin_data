noticed any unfriendliness, but I am sure you can judge how little this matters to me.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL097_225_1" id="target_note_LCL097_225_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Unbearably painful as my circumstances are, the worst cross of all is to find myself in a situation where my advantage lies only in what I have always wished would never happen.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL097_225_2" id="target_note_LCL097_225_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>They say that P. Lentulus senior is at Rhodes and his son at Alexandria; and all agree that C. Cassius has left Rhodes for Alexandria.</p>
<p>Quintus excuses himself to me by letter in terms much more offensive than those he used in his bitterest attacks. He says he gathers from your letter that you do not approve of his writing harshly about me to all and sundry; therefore he is sorry to have vexed you, but considers that what he did was justified. Then he enumerates in the most indecent language his reasons for doing it. But he would not have flaunted his hatred of me either now or previously were it not that he sees I am totally ruined.

How it is to be done is for you to judge. And please, as far as you can, consider how to provide me with a sum I can draw upon for necessary expenses. Such funds as I had available I made over to Pompey at a time when this seemed the prudent thing
