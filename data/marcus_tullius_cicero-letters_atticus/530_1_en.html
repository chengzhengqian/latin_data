<p class="noindent">Tomorrow then for Peducaeus’ auction. So come when you can, though perhaps Faberius will hold you up; but still, when you can manage. Our friend Dionysius is complaining vigorously, but not without justice, at so long an absence from his pupils.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_43_1_1" id="target_note_LCL491_43_1_1"><sup>1</sup></a> He has written to me at length, to you too no doubt. It looks to me as though he will be away for some time yet. A pity! I miss him a lot.</p>
<p>I am expecting a letter from you, not yet to be sure—I write this in answer to yours early in the morning.</p>

<p class="noindent">After receiving a second letter from you today, I did not want you to make do with only one from me. Yes, do proceed about Faberius as you say you will. My project is - entirely dependent on it. If that idea had not arisen I assure you I should trouble about this as little as about all else. So, as you are doing (no addition is possible), urge it, press it, finish it.</p>
<p>Please send me Dicaearchus’ two books ‘On the Soul,’ and the volumes of his ‘Descent’ (I can’t find the ‘Tripoliticus’ and his ‘Letter to Aristoxenus’). I should particularly like those three volumes just now, as they would be useful for what I have in mind.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_43_1_2" id="target_note_LCL491_43_1_2"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
