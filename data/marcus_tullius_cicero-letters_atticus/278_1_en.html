<p class="noindent">About Vennonius’ affairs I agree with you. I call Labienus a hero. It is the finest political action we have seen for a long while. If he has achieved nothing else, he has made Caesar smart. But I think there is some general benefit as well. And bravo Piso! I suspect his verdict on his son-in-law will carry weight. But you see what kind of war we are fighting. A civil war if you will, but one that has arisen not from a conflict in the civic body but from the recklessness of one unscrupulous Roman, who, however, is strong in his army, has many folk tied to him by hopes and promises, and covets every man’s all. The capital has been handed over to him undefended and full of wealth. Anything can be apprehended from a man who sees Rome’s temples and homes not as his country but as so much plunder. But what he will do or how he will do it, without Senate or magistrates, I don’t know. He will not be able to put up so much as a façade of constitutional procedure. As for us, where shall we hope to raise our heads or when? You too remark on our leader’s bad generalship, who did not even know what was going on in Picenum.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_235_1" id="target_note_LCL008_235_1"><sup>1</sup></a> To his lack of judgement the facts themselves stand witness. To say nothing of his other errors over ten years, would not any terms have been preferable to this flight? Nor can I say what his plans are now, though I am continually writing to enquire. It is generally agreed that he is in a state of utter panic and confusion. Accordingly I see no sign of the defensive force which he was kept at Rome to prepare nor of any place or rallying point for such a force. The whole hope lies in two legions<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_235_2" id="target_note_LCL008_235_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
