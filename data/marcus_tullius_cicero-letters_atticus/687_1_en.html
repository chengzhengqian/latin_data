<h2>421 (XVI.12)</h2>
<h2><span class="italic">Puteoli, 6 or 7 November 44</span></h2>
<h2><span class="ac">Cicero to Atticus</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">I am sending you a copy of Oppius’ letter because it’s such a kind one. Sad about Ocella. While you go on humming and hawing and don’t answer me a word I have taken my own counsel and accordingly I think I shall be in Rome on the 12th. I felt it better to be there to no purpose, without necessity, than not to be on the spot if need should arise, and at the same time I am afraid of being cut off. Antony may be coming up at this moment; though to be sure there are various rumours afloat, many of them such as I should wish true, nothing certain however. Whatever the truth, better for me to be with you than away from you, anxious both on your account and my own. But I need not tell you—these things are mutual.</p>
<p>A good joke about Varro’s piece <span class="italic">à la Héraclide.</span> I am tickled to death. But of this and greater matters when we meet.</p>
