<p>Asia. I am sure you see from this that my professions of these many years past are now put to the test. Still I trust I shall practise the lessons you have taught me and satisfy everybody, which should be all the easier because the taxation agreements in my province have already been made up. But that will do, especially as Cestius sent me word during dinner that he is leaving before daybreak.</p>
<p>I have attended to your little affairs at Ephesus. Although Thermus had made very handsome promises to all your friends before I arrived, I introduced Philogenes and Seius to him and recommended Xeno of Apollonis. He undertook to do all that was asked of him. I further gave Philogenes particulars of the bill of exchange which I negotiated with you. So that will do for this subject, too.</p>
<p>To come back to the affairs of the town. For mercy’s sake, as you are staying in Rome, do pray first and foremost build up a powerful defensive position to ensure that my term remains annual, without intercalation even. Secondly, mind you discharge all my commissions, in particular with regard to that domestic worry,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_61_2" id="target_note_LCL008_61_2"><sup>2</sup></a> you know what I mean, if anything can be done, and further about Caesar.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_61_3" id="target_note_LCL008_61_3"><sup>3</sup></a> It was at your prompting I became so keen on that, and I don’t regret it. And if you appreciate how much it is in my character to know and care about what is happening in public life (I say ‘is happening,’ but I should add ‘what is going to happen’), give me full and comprehensive reports, really conscientious ones, and first whether the state of the trials, past or future too, is unsatisfactory. Please attend to the matter of the water, and if Philippus does anything keep an eye open.</p>
