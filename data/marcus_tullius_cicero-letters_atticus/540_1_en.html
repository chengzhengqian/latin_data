Manilius or in that of T. Quintius and M’. Acilius—Brutus’ abridgement of Fannius’ book confuses me ∗ ∗ ∗ what stood at the end, following which I wrote that the historian Fannius was Laelius’ son-in-law. But you refuted me mathematically, and now Brutus and Fannius refute <span class="italic">you</span>. I took it however on good authority, namely Hortensius’, as it stands in Brutus. So please sort out the tangle.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_63_1_1" id="target_note_LCL491_63_1_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p class="noindent">You had just left yesterday when Trebatius arrived, and Curtius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_63_1_2" id="target_note_LCL491_63_1_2"><sup>1</sup></a> a little later—the latter only to pay his respects but he stayed on invitation. Trebatius is my guest here. Dolabella came this morning. Much talk till late in the day. I must say he could not have been more forthcoming or more affectionate. However we got on to Quintus. I heard of much that is too bad for utterance or narration, and one thing of such a kind that if the whole army did not know of it I should not dare to put it on paper myself, let alone dictate it to Tiro ∗ ∗ ∗<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_63_2a" id="target_note_LCL491_63_2a"><sup>2</sup></a>. But enough.</p>
<p>While Dolabella was with me Torquatus called, very apropos, and Dolabella told him in the kindest way how I had spoken on his behalf. I had just done so, very particularly. Torquatus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_63_3" id="target_note_LCL491_63_3"><sup>3</sup></a> seemed grateful for my pains.</p>
