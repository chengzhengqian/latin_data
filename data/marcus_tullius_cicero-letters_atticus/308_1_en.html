<p>I have a ship ready, but I am waiting for a letter from you to know your answer to my consultation.</p>
<p>You know that C. Atius Paelignus at Sulmo has opened the gates to Antony, though he had five cohorts, that Q. Lucretius has fled the town, that Gnaeus is en route for Brundisium and Domitius left in the lurch. It’s all over.</p>

<p class="noindent">After I had dispatched a letter to you about Dionysius before daybreak on the 22nd, Dionysius himself arrived at my house that same evening, induced by your promptings as I suspect—what else am I to think? Though to be sure he is apt to be sorry after one of his crazy outbursts; and he has never shown himself more crackbrained than in this affair. I did not tell you, but I heard afterwards that he went from the third milestone on that occasion<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_295_1" id="target_note_LCL008_295_1"><sup>1</sup></a> after ‘full many an idle, angry toss of horn,’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_295_2" id="target_note_LCL008_295_2"><sup>2</sup></a> i.e. after much cursing and swearing, which I hope may come home to roost, as they say. But admire my gentle nature! I put a strongly worded letter to him in the bundle along with yours. I should like that restored to me, and for this and no other purpose I have sent Pollex, one of my personal attendants, to Rome. And I am writing to you so that if by chance it has been delivered to you you may see it is returned to me to make sure it does not get into his hands.</p>
