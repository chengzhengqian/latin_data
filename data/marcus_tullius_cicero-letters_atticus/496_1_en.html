<p class="noindent">I try to think of something to write to you, but there is nothing. The same topics every day. I am very much obliged to you for visiting Lentulus. Give him such servants and as many of them as you think right. As regards Silius’ willingness to sell and the matter of price, you seem to be afraid (<span class="italic">a</span>) that he won’t sell and (<span class="italic">b</span>) that he will want more than our figure. Sicca thinks otherwise, but I agree with you. Accordingly I have written to Egnatius,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL097_323_1" id="target_note_LCL097_323_1"><sup>1</sup></a> as he advised. As Salas (?)<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL097_323_2" id="target_note_LCL097_323_2"><sup>2</sup></a> wants you to have a talk with Clodius, you can do so with my blessing, in fact that is more convenient than what he asks of me, i.e. that I should write to Clodius myself. About Castricius’ slaves I believe the most convenient thing will be for Egnatius to settle it, as you say you think will happen. Pray see that an arrangement is made with Ovia. Since you say you wrote at night I expect more in today’s letter.</p>

<p class="noindent">I write this in my own hand. Pray see what is to be done. Publilia wrote to me that her mother had talked to Publilius and would come over with him for a talk with me, and that she would accompany them if I would allow it. She begs me beseechingly and at some length to permit this and to send her a reply. You see what a tiresome business
