before him, are sitting on the bench. Here there is a general exodus; even my daily companion M’. Lepidus is off tomorrow. I am staying on at Formiae to get the news quicker. Then I want to go to Arpinum and from there by the least frequented route to the Adriatic, putting my lictors out of the way or discharging them outright. For I hear that the honest men, who now and so often in the past have been such a tower of strength to the constitution, disapprove of this dallying of mine and that there is a deal of severe comment at dinner parties, lengthy ones too!</p>
<p>So I had best leave and show myself a good citizen by carrying war into Italy by land and sea, and once again stir up against myself the hatred of the rascals, which had by now died out, and execute the counsels of Lucceius and Theophanes. Scipio goes to Syria as his allotted province, or if you like he is accompanying his son-in-law,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL097_7_1" id="target_note_LCL097_7_1"><sup>1</sup></a> which is a respectable reason, or he is escaping Caesar’s anger. As for the Marcelli, they would have stayed behind if they had not been afraid of Caesar’s sword. Appius has the same reason for fear, and recent enmities besides. And anyhow, apart from him and C. Cassius, the others are all Legates, Faustus is Proquaestor. I am the only one who might take either way. Then there is my brother, who should not in fairness have been associated with me in this plight. Caesar will be even angrier with him than with me; but I cannot induce him to stay. I shall do this for Pompey; it is what I owe him. No one else influences <span class="italic">me</span>, neither the honest men’s talk (there <span class="italic">are</span> no honest men) nor the cause, which has been conducted without courage and will be conducted without scruple. I do it simply and solely for Pompey, who does not even ask it of me and is, so he says, fighting not for himself but for the country.</p>
