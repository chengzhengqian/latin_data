something useful and charming. There it is. If the letter you despatched on 15 April had anything in it worth chronicling, write at once so that I am not left in ignorance. If on the other hand it was all badinage, why, I am entitled to that too.</p>
<p>You may be interested to hear that young Curio has called on me to pay his respects. What he had to say about Publius chimed in very well with your letter. He himself ‘hates proud grandees’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL007_159_1a" id="target_note_LCL007_159_1a"><sup>1</sup></a> quite remarkably. He told me that the younger set generally are no less incensed and impatient of the present regime. A fine predicament we are in if our hopes rest on them! I think we may as well find other things to think about. <span class="italic">I</span> am devoting myself to history—except that, though you are welcome to think me a Saufeius, I am the idlest of mortals.</p>
<p>Now here is our itinerary, so that you can make up your mind where to meet us. I want to get to Formiae on Shepherds’ Day. Then, as you think I had better forgo that Bay of Luxury at the present time, we shall leave Formiae on the Kalends of May so as to be at Antium on the 3rd. There are to be some games at Antium from the 4th to the 6th which Tullia wants to watch. From there I propose to go to Tusculum, then to Arpinum, returning to Rome by the Kalends of June. Be sure to let us see you either at Formiae or at Antium or at Tusculum.</p>
<p>Please restore me your earlier letter and append something new.</p>
