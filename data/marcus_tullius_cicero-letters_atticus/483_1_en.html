the letter I dispatched yesterday. You urge me to disguise the intensity of my grief and say that others think I do not do so sufficiently. Can I do it more effectively than by spending my entire time in literary work? True, I do this not for the sake of disguise but rather to ease and heal my mind; but even if I myself get little good out of it, at least I cannot be accused of failing to disguise my feelings.</p>
<p>This letter is briefer than it would have been because I am expecting your reply to mine of yesterday. I am particularly looking forward to your comments concerning the shrine, also to some extent about Terentia. Would you please inform me when next you write whether Cn. Caepio, father of Claudius’ wife Servilia, died at sea during his father’s lifetime or after his death, and also whether Rutilia died in the lifetime of her son C. Cotta or subsequently? They are relevant to my treatise on the alleviation of mourning.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL097_297_1_1" id="target_note_LCL097_297_1_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p class="noindent">As for the dowry, all the more reason for clearing it up. Balbus’ terms for transferring the debt<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL097_297_1_2" id="target_note_LCL097_297_1_2"><sup>1</sup></a> are despotic. Settle it one way or another. It is unseemly to have the thing lying bogged down in difficulties. The Isle of Arpinum allows of a real deification, but I am afraid that its out of the way situation might seem to detract from the dignity of the tribute. So my mind is fixed on suburban properties, which however I shall inspect when I get back.</p>
