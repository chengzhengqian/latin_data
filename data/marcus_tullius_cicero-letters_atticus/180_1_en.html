too many things on my mind. However I can tell you this much, that the letter you are reading was dispatched on the Ides of May from Venusia early in the morning as I left. I imagine that something will be done in the Senate today, so I hope to be followed by a letter from you to tell me not only all the happenings but the rumours too. I shall receive it at Brundisium, where it is my plan to wait for Pomptinus up to the day you named.</p>
<p>At Tarentum I shall write you a full account of my Dialogues on the Republic with Pompey—though on this very point I am anxious to know up till when it will be all right for me to write to you, i.e. how long you are going to be in Rome, so that I either know where to send letters in future or else don’t send them to no purpose. But before you leave do without fail get that matter of the 20,000 and the 800,000 straightened out. I should be grateful if you would look on it as something really important and urgent, so that what I came to want<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_39_1" id="target_note_LCL008_39_1"><sup>1</sup></a> with your prompting I may achieve with your assistance.</p>

<p class="noindent">I got to Tarentum on 18 May. Having decided to wait for Pomptinus I think it best to spend the days before his arrival with Pompey, especially as I see he would like it. Indeed he has asked me to spend every day with him at his house. I agreed willingly, for I shall have much fine discourse from him on public affairs and at the same time get some useful advice on this business of my own.</p>
