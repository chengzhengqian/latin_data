<p class="noindent">I reached Laodicea on 31 July. From this day you must start your year’s reckoning. My arrival was most eagerly awaited and widely acclaimed. But you cannot conceive how weary of the business I am, for it gives no adequate scope for the intellectual drive and industry which I think you will concede me, and has interrupted the work that is my pride. To think of it—me sitting on the bench in Laodicea while A. Plotius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_65_1" id="target_note_LCL008_65_1"><sup>1</sup></a> sits in Rome! And to think that while our friend<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_65_2" id="target_note_LCL008_65_2"><sup>2</sup></a> has his huge army, I have a nominal force of two skeleton legions! And when all’s said, it isn’t this sort of thing I’m pining for, it’s the world, the Forum, Rome, my house, my friends. But I’ll stick it out as best I can so long as it’s only for a year. If there is a prorogation, I give up. But that can be resisted very easily if only you are in Rome.</p>
<p>You ask how I am doing here. Spending the devil of a lot of money. I quite revel in this system. My strictness according to your precepts is so remarkable that I am afraid I may have to raise a loan to meet the bill I negotiated with you. I don’t scratch Appius’ sores, but they show and can’t be hidden.</p>
<p>As I send off this letter, on 3 August, I am on my way from Laodicea to the army in Lycaonia. From there I mean to move to the Taurus to try for a settlement with Moeragenes<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_65_3" id="target_note_LCL008_65_3"><sup>3</sup></a> (on the battlefield) about your slave. ‘Now the ox is fairly pannier’d! Nay, ’tis not the load for me!’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_65_4" id="target_note_LCL008_65_4"><sup>4</sup></a> But I’ll bear it, only if you love me let it be for one year and you
