Of course he could not say that he did not want peace, but he did say that he was as much afraid of violence on our friends’ side as on Antony’s; not, he added, but that both sides had good reason for keeping a force to protect them, but he for his part was afraid of violence from both quarters. In fact, I don’t trust him a yard.</p>
<p>I agree with you about Quintus junior. Your letter certainly gave much pleasure to his father and was admirably done. I satisfied Caerellia quite easily.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_219_3" id="target_note_LCL491_219_3"><sup>3</sup></a> She did not strike me as over-much concerned, and if <span class="italic">she</span> had been, <span class="italic">I</span> certainly should not. As for the lady you say is pestering you, I am surprised that you should have so much as given her a hearing. If I praised her in front of friends, with her three sons and your daughter listening, what of it? And why should I go about in a mask?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_219_4" id="target_note_LCL491_219_4"><sup>4</sup></a> Isn’t old age itself a sufficiently ugly one?</p>
<p>You say Brutus asks me to meet him before the Kalends. He wrote to me too, and perhaps I shall. But really I don’t know what he wants. What advice can I bring him when I need advice myself and when he has done more for his own eternal fame than for peace in our time? The rumour about the Queen is dying out. About Flamma, do anything you can, I beg.</p>
