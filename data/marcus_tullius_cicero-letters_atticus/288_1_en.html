Titinius, of whom we see a good deal, says he has no money for travel expenses and has informed his debtors that their loans are to be extended at the same rate (a step which L. Ligus is said to have taken too), considering too that at the present time Quintus does not have the ready cash and cannot get it out of Egnatius nor yet borrow it in any quarter, he is surprised that you have not made allowance for this general stringency. As for me, I like to follow the maxim, attributed (wrongly, as is thought) to Hesiod, ‘judge not a cause . . . ,’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_255_3" id="target_note_LCL008_255_3"><sup>3</sup></a> especially in your case, for I have never known you do anything without good reason. But still I have some sympathy with his grievance. I wanted you to know, be it as it may.</p>

<h2>143 (VII.19)</h2>
<h2><span class="italic">Formiae, 3 February 49</span></h2>
<h2><span class="ac">Cicero to Atticus</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">I have nothing to write to you about, indeed I have not dispatched a letter which I had already written to you by lamplight. It was full of optimism because I had heard of the feeling in the public meeting and thought Caesar would take the terms, particularly as they were of his own making. Then, at daybreak on 3 February, comes your letter along with others from Philotimus and Furnius and one from Curio to Furnius, in which he ridicules L. Caesar’s embassy. We seem to be quite crushed, and I don’t know what course to take. It’s really not myself I am worried about but the boys; I don’t know what to do about them. However I am leaving for Capua as I write this, hoping there to come by information about Pompey’s affairs more easily.</p>
