<p class="noindent">I arrived at my place near Sinuessa on the 8th. It was common talk that Antony would be stopping that night at Casilinum. So I changed my plan—I had intended travelling direct to Rome by the Appian Way. He would easily have caught me up, for they say he moves with Caesarian speed. Accordingly I am turning off at Minturnae towards Arpinum, and have decided to stay the night of the 9th either at Aquinum or Arcanum.</p>
<p>And now, my dear fellow, do bring your whole mind to bear on this problem, which is really of great importance. There are three courses open: shall I stay at Arpinum, shall I come closer, or shall I return to Rome? I shall do what you advise. But don’t put it off. I am eagerly awaiting a letter.</p>
<p>The 9th (early morning), near Sinuessa.</p>
