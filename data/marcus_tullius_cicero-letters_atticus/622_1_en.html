<h2>380 (XV.3)</h2>
<h2><span class="italic">Arpinum, 22 May 44</span></h2>
<h2><span class="ac">Cicero to Atticus</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">On the 22nd I received at Arpinum your two letters replying to two of mine, one of the 18th, the other of the 21st. So I take the earlier first. Yes, do run over to join me at Tusculum; I expect to get there on the 27th. You say we must submit to the victors. Not I; for me there are many preferable alternatives. You remind me of my speech in the temple of Apollo when Lentulus and Marcellus were Consuls.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_227_1" id="target_note_LCL491_227_1"><sup>1</sup></a> But the case is different, nor is the general situation similar, especially as you write that Marcellus and others are leaving. So we shall have to investigate together and decide whether we can safely stay in Rome. I am indeed disturbed about the settlers in the new district, for things are very tight just now<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_227_2" id="target_note_LCL491_227_2"><sup>2</sup></a>—though I care little enough for such things, disregarding as I do others of greater importance. I note Calva’s will—a mean, contemptible creature. Thank you for attending to Demonicus’ sale. I wrote some time ago to Dolabella about Manlius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_227_3" id="target_note_LCL491_227_3"><sup>3</sup></a> very fully, provided that my letter was duly delivered. I have both the desire and the duty to help him.</p>
<p>Coming to the more recent letter, I note the information about Alexio for which I asked. You can count on Hirtius. I hope to see Antony in worse trouble than he is
