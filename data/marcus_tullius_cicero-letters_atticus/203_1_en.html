I am handing over the army to my brother Quintus, who will take it into winter quarters in unsettled country. I myself am returning to Laodicea.</p>
<p>So far, so much. But to return to the past. So far as concerns the capital object of your exhortations, most important point of all, in which you are anxious that I should satisfy even that Ligurian Momus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_85_4" id="target_note_LCL008_85_4"><sup>4</sup></a> well, confound me if anything could be more fastidiously correct! But I don’t talk of ‘restraint’ in this connexion, a word which suggests virtuous resistance to pleasurable temptation. Never in all my life have I gained so much pleasure as I do from my integrity here, and it is not so much the <span class="italic">réclame</span>, which is enormous, as the practice itself that gratifies me. In a word, it has been worth it. I did not know myself, I never quite realized my capabilities in this line. I have a right to a swollen head. It is a fine achievement. Meanwhile here is a scintillation: Ariobarzanes owes his life and throne to me.

I have cheered poor Brutus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_85_6" id="target_note_LCL008_85_6"><sup>6</sup></a> up as far as I could—I am as fond of him as yourself, I almost said ‘as of yourself.’ And I hope too that in my entire year of office the province will not be charged a penny.</p>
<p>That is all I have to tell. I am now setting about sending an official letter to Rome. There will be more matter in it than if I had written from the Amanus. But to think that you won’t be in Rome! Everything depends however on what happens on the Kalends of March.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_85_7" id="target_note_LCL008_85_7"><sup>7</sup></a> I am afraid that if Caesar is recalcitrant when the question of his command </p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL008_85_4"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL008_85_4" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">4</sup>The fault-finding god.
