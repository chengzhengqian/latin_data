In fact if this notion of a Triumph, which you too approve, had not been put into my head, you really would not have much cause to desiderate the ideal sketched in my sixth volume.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_193_2" id="target_note_LCL008_193_2"><sup>2</sup></a> What, after all, as an eager reader of that work, would you want me to do? Why even at this stage I shall not hesitate to throw away the great prize, if that turns out to be the right thing. Certainly the two roles of candidate for a Triumph and independent statesman are not to be played simultaneously. But rest assured that honour will come first with me.</p>
<p>As for your view that it is more expedient (either as safer for me personally or perhaps as enabling me to render service to the state) that I retain my military authority, we shall go into that together. It’s quite a question, though I agree with you to a large extent. You do well to have no doubts of my patriotism. You are quite right too in your judgement that Caesar has not behaved by any means as handsomely to me as he ought in view of my services and his own lavishness towards others, and you explain the reason<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_193_3" id="target_note_LCL008_193_3"><sup>3</sup></a> for this correctly. What you write of his dealings with Fabius and Caninius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_193_4" id="target_note_LCL008_193_4"><sup>4</sup></a> chimes very well. But even if this were otherwise and he had showered upon me everything he had to offer, the Protectress of Rome<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_193_5a" id="target_note_LCL008_193_5a"><sup>5</sup></a> to whom you refer would not let me forget her noble inscription or allow me to make Volcacius or Servius my model, whom you think good enough. She would wish me to take and maintain some line worthy of myself. That is what I should do, if I were able, in a way different from what circumstances now prescribe.</p>
