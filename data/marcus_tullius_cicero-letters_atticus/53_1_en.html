How much <span class="italic">I</span> gain by his doing so I hardly know, but there is certainly a gain to the commonwealth. I will go even further. Supposing I manage to make even Caesar, who is riding on the crest of the wave just now,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL007_133_6" id="target_note_LCL007_133_6"><sup>6</sup></a> a better citizen, am I harming the state so very much?
