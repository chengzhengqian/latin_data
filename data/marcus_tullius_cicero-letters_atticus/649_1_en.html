<p class="noindent">Clearly you have done everything possible in Quintus’ affair, but he is unhappy because he doesn’t know whether to do as Lepta asks or to damage his son’s credit.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_281_1_2" id="target_note_LCL491_281_1_2"><sup>1</sup></a> I have heard some sort of rumour that L. Piso wants to go abroad with a commission under a bogus senatorial decree. I should like to know about this. That courier whom I told you I should be sending to Brutus joined me at Anagnia on the night of the 30th and brought me a letter which contained one thing unlike his usual excellent sense, the same old request that I should attend his games. I have replied of course that in the first place I have already left, so that it is no longer open to me, and in the second that it would be highly paradoxical if, not having been near Rome since this parade of armed force began (and that not so much out of regard to my personal risk as to dignity), I were suddenly to appear at the games. To give games at such a time is respectable where it is obligatory; to be a spectator is not obligatory for me and so would not even be respectable. For my own part I am extremely anxious for them to be well attended and to earn all possible popularity, and I am confident this will happen. And let me ask you to send me detailed accounts daily, right from the opening onwards, how these games are received, and then all about those that are to follow. But there’s enough about the games.</p>
