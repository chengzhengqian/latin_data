<p>My brother Quintus writes to me exculpating himself and affirming that he has never said anything amiss about you to anyone. But we must handle this together, very, very carefully. Only do come back to us at long last. The bearer of this, Cossinius, seemed to me a thoroughly good fellow, responsible and fond of you—just what your letter to me had represented him.</p>

<p class="noindent">On my return from Pompeii on 12 May our friend Cincius gave me your letter dated the Ides of February. That is the letter to which I shall now reply.</p>
<p>To begin with, I am glad to know that you are well aware of what I think of you. Next, it gives me the warmest pleasure that you have taken so temperate an attitude over what you felt to be wounding and disagreeable behaviour on our part, or I ought rather to say on the part of those near to me; and I think this says a good deal for your affection and much more for your character and wisdom. Your letter is so charming, considerate, loyal, and kind, that, far from feeling it right to urge you any further, I could never have expected such placability and forbearance from you or any man. So I think the best thing we can do is to say no more on this subject in writing. When we meet we can discuss it together if desirable.</p>
