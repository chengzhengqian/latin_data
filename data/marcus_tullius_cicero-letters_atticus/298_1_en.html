<p class="noindent">On the contrary I thank you for everything: for letting me know what you heard, for not believing reports which made me out less punctilious<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_275_1a" id="target_note_LCL008_275_1a"><sup>1</sup></a> than I am, and for telling me your opinion. I sent Caesar one letter from Capua in reply to the representations he made to me about his gladiators. It was short but friendly, and so far from abusing Pompey praised him highly, as my argument, urging him to a settlement, required. If he has sent the letter to third parties, well, I should be happy to have him post it up in public. I am dispatching another today.

If you do, then show me how I am to escape adverse criticism. ‘Don’t write at all,’ you may say. How would that help me to escape people who will be willing to <span class="italic">fabricate</span>? However, that is what I shall do as far as I can.</p>

He has abandoned Rome, his country, for which and in which it would have been glorious to die. You don’t seem to realize what a disaster
