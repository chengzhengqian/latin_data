Atilius wrote it, a most clumsy versifier. But I only wish Brutus may have the chance of making a speech. If he can be safe in Rome, we have won the battle. For a leader in a new civil war will have no followers or only such as will easily be put down.</p>
<p>I now come to your third. I am glad that Brutus and Cassius were pleased with my letter, and I have written back to tell them so. You say they want me to make a better republican out of Hirtius. Well, I am doing my best and he speaks very fair; but he and Balbus (who also speaks fair) live in one another’s pockets. You will judge for yourself what to believe. I see that you highly approve of Dolabella; so do I, very highly indeed.
