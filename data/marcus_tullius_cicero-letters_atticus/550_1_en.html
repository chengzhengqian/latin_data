In the five books which I composed ‘On the Limits’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_83_2_1" id="target_note_LCL491_83_2_1"><sup>2</sup></a> I gave the Epicurean case to L. Torquatus, the Stoic to M. Cato, and the Peripatetic to M. Piso. I thought that would excite no jealousy, since none of them was still living. This treatise on the Academy I had given, as you know, to Catulus, Lucullus, and Hortensius. It must be confessed that the matter did not fit the persons, who could not be supposed ever to have dreamed of such abstrusities. So when I read your letter about Varro I seized upon it as a godsend. Nothing could have been better suited to that brand of philosophy, in which he seems to me to take particular pleasure; and his role is such that I have not succeeded in making my own case appear the stronger. For Antiochus’ arguments are very persuasive and I have set them out faithfully; they have the acuteness of their originator with my elegance of style, that is if I can claim such a quality. But please consider yet again whether you think this work should be given to Varro. Certain objections occur to me, but we shall discuss them together.</p>
