<p>I perceive that the rest of your letter dealing with my own prospects strikes a less sanguine note than what I hear from other correspondents. However, as we are not far away from the time of decision one way or the other, I shall either move to your place or stay yet awhile around here.</p>
<p>My brother writes that you are in everything his sole support and stay. I won’t encourage you to do what you are already doing or offer thanks which you do not expect. I can only wish that fortune may grant us to enjoy one another’s affection in our native land. I always eagerly await your letters. Don’t have any fear that I may find them tediously detailed or painfully candid.</p>
<p>Dispatched 4 September.</p>
