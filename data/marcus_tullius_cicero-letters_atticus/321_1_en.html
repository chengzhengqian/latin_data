<p class="noindent">My eyes are even more troublesome than formerly, but I prefer to dictate this letter rather than not to give a line to our common and very good friend Fabius Gallus to take to you. Yesterday to be sure I wrote in my own hand as best I could a letter of prophecy which I hope may prove false. My reason for writing now is not merely my reluctance to let a day pass without sending you a letter but a more valid one, namely to induce you to do me the favour of devoting some of your time ∗ ∗ ∗ . I certainly do want to have your advice set out for me so that I thoroughly understand it.</p>
<p>My position is quite uncompromised. For any past omissions on my part I have a rationally just, and not merely plausible, excuse. Assuredly I was not wrong when, avoiding not only the discredit of cowardice but the suspicion of treachery, I refused to take the Capuan command when actually ordered to do so. Neither was I wrong when after L. Caesar and Fabatus had brought Caesar’s peace terms I was chary of offending a man to whom Pompey was offering a Consulship and a Triumph while both had arms in their hands. Nor can anyone fairly blame me in this last phase for not going overseas. That would have needed thinking about in any case, but in fact I could not manage it. Indeed I could not be expected to guess the plan, particularly as from Pompey’s own letter I was firmly under the impression (and I see you thought the same) that he would go to Domitius’ rescue; and frankly I wanted more time to consider what was the right and proper thing to do.</p>
