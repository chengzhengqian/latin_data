That done, we went to Caesar and spoke on the Buthrotians’ behalf. We obtained a most liberal decree, which was countersigned by some gentlemen of the highest station. Notwithstanding these proceedings, I was surprised to note that Caesar permitted those who had cast their eyes on the Buthrotian land to hold meetings, and not merely permitted this but actually placed you in charge of the matter. I therefore spoke to him myself about it on several occasions, so that he actually accused me of doubting his word. He also told M. Messalla and Atticus himself that he was not to worry, and made it quite clear that he did not want to offend people here (he liked to be popular, as you know), but that once they had gone overseas he would see to it that they were settled on some other land.</p>
<p>That was as far as the affair went during Caesar’s lifetime. After his death, as soon as the Consuls commenced their review of cases according to the Senate’s decree, the facts which I have just stated were presented to them. They approved the case without any hesitation and undertook to send a letter to you.</p>
<p>I do not doubt, my dear Plancus, that the Senate’s decree, the law, and the Consuls’ judgement and letter have great weight with you, and I know that you would wish to do your best for Atticus personally. None the less in consideration of the friendship and good will between us I venture to ask of you what so eminently kindly and obliging a disposition as yours would not in any case allow you to withhold; and that is to take for my sake readily, cordially, and expeditiously the action which I am sure you are going to take in any case of your own volition.</p>
<p>I have no greater or better or dearer friend than Atticus. </p></section><notes></notes></section>
