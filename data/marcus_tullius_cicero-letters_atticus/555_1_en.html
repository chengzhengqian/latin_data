after. There are my coheirs; it would be a shame (?) to let them descend on me when you are not there.</p>
<p>Another letter to me without any news of Attica! But that I take for an excellent sign. My complaint, not against you but against her, is that I don’t even get her love. But give plenty of mine to her and to Pilia, and don’t let her know that I am in dudgeon. I send you Caesar’s letter in case you did not read it.</p>

<p class="noindent">We were speaking of Varro. Talk of the devil! He called, and at such an hour that I had to ask him to stay. But I took care not to tear his coat (I remember your phrase ‘they were many and we were unprepared’). No use! Soon after came C. Capito and T. Carrinas.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_93_1" id="target_note_LCL491_93_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Their coats I hardly touched. However they stayed, and it turned out pleasantly enough. But Capito happened to be talking of the enlargement of the city, saying that the Tiber is being diverted at the Mulvian Bridge to run alongside of the Vatican hills, that the Campus Martius is being built over and the other Campus, the Vaticanus, is becoming a new Campus Martius. ‘What’s that?’ said I, ‘I was going to the auction to buy the Scapula estate if I could get it at a reasonable figure.’ ‘Better not,’ said he. ‘This law will go through. Caesar wants it.’ I was not sorry to hear of this, but I am sorry it is happening. But what do <span class="italic">you</span> say?—though I don’t know why I ask. You know Capito’s assiduity in ferreting out news. He rivals Camillus. So you will let me know </p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL491_93_1"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL491_93_1" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">1</sup>See Index.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL491_93_1').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
