Here again it was I principally who stepped into the breach. Through my efforts they found the Senate in full attendance and in generous mood, and on the Kalends of December and the day following I discoursed at length upon the dignity and harmony of the two orders. The matter has not yet been settled, but the Senate’s attitude was made clear, the only opposing voice being Consul-Designate Metellus. Our doughty champion Cato was to have been another, but darkness fell before his turn came.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL007_101_2" id="target_note_LCL007_101_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Thus, in maintenance of my settled policy, I am defending as best I can the alliance I myself cemented. But as this is all so unreliable, I am building another road, a safe one I hope, to protect my position. I can’t very well explain what I mean in a letter, but a small hint will show: I am on the friendliest terms with Pompey. Yes, I know what you will say. I shall watch the dangers; and later on I shall write to you more at length concerning my political plans.</p>
<p>You may be interested to learn that Lucceius has it in mind to stand for the Consulship straight away. Only two prospective candidates are talked of, Caesar (he plans to make a pact with him through Arrius) and Bibulus (he thinks he might join forces with <span class="italic">him</span> through C. Piso). That makes you laugh? These are no laughing matters, believe me. What else can I tell you, I wonder? There are lots of things, but another time. Please see that I get word when to expect you. I now ask of you with all diffidence what I desire very much indeed—come home as soon as you can.</p>
<p>Nones of December.</p>
