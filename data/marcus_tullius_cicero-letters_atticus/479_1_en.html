engaged on the work of which I wrote to you in an earlier letter, I was as it were laying a fomentation on my pains. Now I reject all aids, and find nothing easier to bear than solitude—Philippus did not intrude as I feared he might. After paying me a call yesterday he left immediately for Rome.</p>
<p>I am sending you the letter which I have written to Brutus as you recommended. You will see that it is forwarded along with your own. However I am sending you a copy so that if you don’t quite like it you need not send it on.</p>

Whatever you do I shall think it not only rightly done but done for my sake.</p>
