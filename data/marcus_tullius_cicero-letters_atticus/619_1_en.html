<p class="noindent">I dispatched a letter to you yesterday as I was leaving Puteoli and then turned in at my place near Cumae. There I found Pilia in good health. Indeed I saw her soon afterwards at Cumae, where she had gone to attend a funeral at which I too put in an appearance. Our good friend Cn. Lucceius was burying his mother. So I stayed the night at my place near Sinuessa and am scribbling this letter early the following morning before I leave for Arpinum.</p>
<p>I have no news either to tell or to enquire of you, unless perhaps you think the following of interest. Brutus has sent me his speech delivered to the meeting on the Capitol,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_221_1" id="target_note_LCL491_221_1"><sup>1</sup></a> asking me to correct it candidly before publication. The speech is a most elegant composition, the sentiments and the wording could not be bettered. But if I had been handling the material I should have put more fire into it, considering the nature of the theme and the role of the speaker. Accordingly I felt unable to offer improvements. Given his chosen style<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_221_2" id="target_note_LCL491_221_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and his judgement of what is the best style in oratory, our good Brutus has in this speech attained it with perfect elegance. But I have aimed at something different, whether rightly or wrongly. However I should like you to read the speech, if you have not already done so, and let me know your own opinion. I fear though that you may be led astray by your surname and judge too Attically. But you have only to call to mind Demosthenes’ thunderbolts to realize that a speaker can be both impeccably
