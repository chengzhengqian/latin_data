<h2><span class="ac">Cicero to Atticus</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">After receiving your letter by Cephalio on 5 April, though I had intended to stay the next night at Minturnae and proceed thence directly, I stopped at Arcanum, my brother’s place, so as to be in a more secluded spot pending more definite news, while such preparations as can proceed in my absence go forward none the less. The ‘twitterer’ is nearly here now, and I am all impatience, though destination and route have yet to be decided. But that will be my concern and that of the experts. All the same you must help me with your advice as you have done hitherto, so far as you can. There is no working it all out. Everything has to be committed to fortune. I make the venture quite without hope. Any better turn will surprise me. I am sorry Dionysius has set out to visit me. Tullia wrote to me about it, but the time is inconvenient and I would rather not parade our embarrassments, serious as they are, before other than friendly eyes. I have no wish for you to be his enemy on my account.</p>
