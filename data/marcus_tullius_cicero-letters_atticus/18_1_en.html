letter of mine, but I must not expose such to the risk of getting lost or opened or intercepted. First then you may care to know that I have <span class="italic">not</span> been given first voice in the Senate, the peacemaker<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL007_63_5a" id="target_note_LCL007_63_5a"><sup>5</sup></a> of the Allobroges being put in front of me—at which the House murmured but I myself was not sorry. I am thereby relieved of any obligation to be civil to a cross-grained individual and left free to maintain my political standing in opposition to his wishes. Moreover the second place carries almost as much prestige as the first, while one’s inclinations are not too much fettered by one’s sense of the consular favour. Catulus comes third, Hortensius, if you are still interested, fourth. The Consul<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL007_63_6" id="target_note_LCL007_63_6"><sup>6</sup></a> himself is of petty but perverse mentality, given to the sort of peevish sneer that raises a laugh even in the absence of any wit.

The Allobroges, the principal tribe of Narbonese Gaul, being in revolt, C. Piso, Consul in 67, may be called their ‘pacifier’ in irony, as having oppressed them during his governorship (Cicero had defended him in 63 on a charge of wrongfully executing a provincial). But the word used normally means ‘peacemaker,’ and may possibly refer to otherwise unrecorded diplomatic activity on Piso’s part.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL007_63_5a').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL007_63_6"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL007_63_6" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">6</sup>M.
