that my decision, which seemed by now pretty well settled, is wavering. The examples<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_339_2" id="target_note_LCL008_339_2"><sup>2</sup></a> which you approve are not quite good enough for me. What act of political courage have these people ever performed and who expects anything laudable from them? Not to be sure that I regard as laudable those who have left to prepare war overseas, intolerable as things here were; I see too well what a terrible, baneful war it will be. But the thought of one man weighs with me. On the face of it I ought to be his companion in flight and his fellow worker in restoring the Republic. If you complain of my chopping and changing, I answer that I talk to you as to myself. In so great a matter must not any man argue with himself this way and that? Besides I want to draw <span class="italic">your</span> opinion—if it is still the same I shall be the steadier, if it has changed I shall agree with you. Of course it is relevant to my problem to know what Domitius and our friend Lentulus are going to do. Of Domitius there are different reports *** According to another he is at Tibur or in the neighbourhood of the capital (?). That too is evidently untrue, since Lepidus says he has made his way secretly somewhere to stay in hiding or it may be to gain the coast—that too he does not know. Neither has he any news of the son. He adds that a fairly large sum of money which Domitius had in Corfinium has not been restored to him. Very tiresome!<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_339_3" id="target_note_LCL008_339_3"><sup>3</sup></a> Of Lentulus we hear nothing. I should be grateful if you would go into this and write to me in detail.</p>
