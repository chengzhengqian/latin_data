<p class="noindent">As the nature of the case warns us, as you have pointed out, and as I see for myself, it is time for us to give up writing on topics which would be dangerous if intercepted. But since my Tullia often writes begging me to wait and see what happens in Spain and always adds that you agree with her, and since I have gathered the same from your own letters, I think it may be as well for me to give you my views on the matter.</p>
<p>This advice would be sound, as I see it, if I were going to adapt my course to the fortune of war in Spain. But that ∗ ∗ ∗. For one of three things is bound to happen. Either, as I should most desire, Caesar will be driven from Spain, or the war there will drag on, or he will seize the Spanish provinces as he seems confident of doing. If he is driven out, what sort of welcome shall I get or what sort of figure shall I cut joining Pompey at a time when I imagine Curio himself will go over to him? But if the war drags on, what am I to wait for or how long? There remains the possibility that if we lose in Spain I do nothing. I take just the opposite view. I think there is more reason to leave Caesar in victory than in defeat, and more to leave while he is doubtful of success than when he is sure of it. For I foresee a massacre </p></section><notes></notes></section>
