likewise about Deiotarus, and talks sternly—if you care to believe him. One thing though doesn’t look so well, at least not to me—he strongly disapproves of Dolabella’s action.</p>
<p>As for the wearing of garlands,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_201_3" id="target_note_LCL491_201_3"><sup>3</sup></a> when your nephew was taxed by his father he wrote back that he had worn one in Caesar’s honour and laid it aside in mourning; he finishes up by saying that he is glad to bear censure for loving Caesar even after his death.</p>
<p>I have written to Dolabella<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_201_4" id="target_note_LCL491_201_4"><sup>4</sup></a> at length, in the way you advise in your letter. Also to Sicca, myself. I am not putting this on your shoulders. I don’t want to give him a grudge against you. I recognize Servius’ line of talk—more fright than judgement there in my opinion. However we are all badly frightened and so I agree with Servius. Publilius has been shuffling with you. They sent Caerellia to me here as their envoy. I soon made her see that what she asked<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_201_5" id="target_note_LCL491_201_5"><sup>5</sup></a> was not possible for me, let alone agreeable. If I see Antony I’ll take up Buthrotum with him and spare no pains.</p>
<p>I come to the more recent letter—though I have already replied about Servius. You say I am making a great matter out of Dolabella’s <span class="italic">coup.</span> Well, I do honestly think that in such circumstances and at such a time there could not have been a greater. However that may be, whatever credit I give him I give on the authority of your letters. But I certainly agree with you that it will be a greater <span class="italic">coup</span> if he pays me what he should have paid. I should like Brutus to stay at Astura.</p>
<p>You commend me for postponing decision about my trip abroad until I see how things go; but I am changing my mind. However I shall decide nothing until I see you. I am glad that my Attica thanks me in connection with her </p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL491_201_3"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL491_201_3" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">3</sup>See Letter 368.1.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL491_201_3').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note inline" id="note_LCL491_201_4"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL491_201_4" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">4</sup>About repayment of Tullia’s dowry.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL491_201_4').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL491_201_5"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL491_201_5" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">5</sup>Perhaps to take back Publilia.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL491_201_5').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
