<p>The rest of the letter makes both ways, but still it throws out some sparks of manly spirit here and there.

Also please speak frankly to Cascellius about that capital sum of Tullius’.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_283_2" id="target_note_LCL491_283_2"><sup>2</sup></a> It’s a trifle, but you did well to notice.
