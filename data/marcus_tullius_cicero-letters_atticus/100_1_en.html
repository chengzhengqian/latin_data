<p class="noindent">I arrived at Brundisium on 17 April. Your boys gave me a letter from you that day, and others brought me another letter two days later. I am deeply touched and not at all surprised by the kindness of your pressing invitation to stay at your place in Epirus. The idea would be much to my mind if I could spend all the time there—I hate crowds and shun my fellow creatures, I can hardly bear the light of day. The solitude, especially in such a friendly place, would be no hardship to me. But as a stopping place en route, to begin with it’s off my road, and then it’s only four days’ journey from Autronius and the others, and then you would not be there. A fortified place would have its advantages if I were going to live there, but if I am just passing through it isn’t necessary. If I dared, I should make for Athens. Certainly as things were falling out<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL007_227_1" id="target_note_LCL007_227_1"><sup>1</sup></a> I should have wanted to do so. But as it is, I have enemies there, I don’t have you, and I am afraid they may make out that even Athens is not far enough away from Italy; and you don’t say when I am to expect you.</p>
<p>Your exhortation to me to live is only partially effective. </p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL007_227_1"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL007_227_1" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">1</sup>I.e., before his exile.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL007_227_1').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
