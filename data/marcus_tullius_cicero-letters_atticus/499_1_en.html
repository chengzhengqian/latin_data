<p class="noindent">I could stay here very comfortably (relatively speaking) even without Sicca now that Tiro is better, but since you write that I had better take care not to get caught, leaving me to understand that you cannot put a definite date to that expedition I wrote of, I have thought best to come your way. You too are evidently in favour of my doing so. So I shall spend tomorrow night at Sicca’s place near Rome. After that, I think I shall stay at Ficulea,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL097_329_1" id="target_note_LCL097_329_1"><sup>1</sup></a> as you recommend. The points in your letter can be discussed between us since I am coming in person. I cannot tell you how much I appreciate your kindness, care, and discretion in handling my affairs and in framing and giving me your advice and in the actual letters you send me.</p>
<p>None the less, please inform me, even on the day I shall be arriving at Sicca’s, if you have any contact with Silius, in particular which piece of ground he wants to take out. You say ‘on the perimeter’; are you sure it isn’t the very piece which, as you know, put the whole idea into my mind? I enclose a kindly expressed letter from Hirtius of recent date.</p>
