a rest—reading your letter I have the impression that you have been taking things easily for a while. Always give me all the news of Brutus, his whereabouts and plans. I hope it is now safe for him to wander on his own all over Rome. But the news, anyhow.</p>

<h2><span class="ac">Cicero to Atticus</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">I have learned a variety of political news from your letters, of which I received several in a batch from Vestorius’ freedman. Let me briefly answer your enquiries. First I am quite delighted with the Cluvius property. But you ask me why I have sent for Chrysippus: two of my shops have collapsed and the others are showing cracks, so that even the mice have moved elsewhere, to say nothing of the tenants. Other people call this a disaster, I don’t call it even a nuisance. Ah Socrates, Socratics, I can never repay you! Heavens above, how utterly trivial such things appear to me! However there is a building scheme under way, Vestorius advising and instigating, which should turn this loss into a source of profit.</p>
<p>There’s a great crowd here, and will be, as I hear, a greater, including the two so-called Consul-Designates. Gods above! The tyranny lives on, the tyrant is dead! We rejoice at his slaughter—and defend his acts! So * takes us pretty sternly to task, enough to make one ashamed of being alive, and right he is! It would have been better to die a thousand deaths than put up with such things—and they look to me to be lasting a long, long time.</p>
