What about those that were in Spain? Won’t they make the same demand? And what about those Annius took across—sorry, I mean Asinius(?), a <span class="italic">lapsus memoriae.</span> Quite a mess the bathman<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_149_3a" id="target_note_LCL491_149_3a"><sup>3</sup></a> is making! As for this conspiracy of Caesar’s freedmen, it could easily be put down if Antony had his wits about him.</p>
<p>How silly I was to be so scrupulous in declining a Commissionership before the vacation for fear of looking like a deserter in this general ferment! Certainly if I could do any good it would be wrong to stand aside. But you see the magistrates, if magistrates they are—anyway you see the tyrant’s lieutenants in their commands, you see his armies, you see the veterans on our flank. All this is inflammable material. On the other hand the men who ought to have all mankind for their bodyguard, not only to protect but to exalt them, are belauded and beloved, but that is all—they are prisoners in their houses. And yet <span class="italic">they</span> are happy in any circumstances; not so the community at large.</p>
<p>But I should be glad to know how Octavius’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_149_4" id="target_note_LCL491_149_4"><sup>4</sup></a> arrival went off and whether there is any rallying to him or suspicion of a coup d’etat—I don’t suppose so, but whatever the fact I should like to know.</p>
<p>I write you this as I leave Astura on the 11th.</p>
