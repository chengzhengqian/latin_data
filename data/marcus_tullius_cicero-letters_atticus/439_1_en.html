<p>It is kind of you to see that letters are sent to those whom you think proper. I have seen a person who saw young Quintus at Samos and his father at Sicyon. They will have no trouble in making their peace. I only wish that seeing Caesar first as they will they may be as anxious to help me with him as I should be to help them if I had any power.</p>

Your most zealous endeavours are needed with those who wish me well and have influence with Caesar, especially Balbus and Oppius, to get them to write on my behalf as zealously as may be. I am being attacked, so I hear, both by certain persons on the spot and in letters. These must be counteracted, as the importance of the matter requires. *<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL097_209_1" id="target_note_LCL097_209_1"><sup>1</sup></a> is there, my bitter enemy.
