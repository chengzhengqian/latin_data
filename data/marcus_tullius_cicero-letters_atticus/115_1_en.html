<section class="div1 language" lang="en"><header><hgroup><h1>Letters to Atticus</h1></hgroup></header><section class="div2"><p class="noindent">where I shall see you, so you say, and be closer if anything is done, as I understand you and my brother Quintus both think advisable, or go away to Cyzicus.</p>
<p>Now, Pomponius, I appeal to you. You did not give me of your worldly wisdom to save me from ruin, considering perhaps that I was competent to judge for myself or else that you owed me nothing more than your presence. Betrayed, decoyed, trapped as I was, I neglected all my defences, deserted and abandoned the Italy which stood as one man ready to protect me, and surrendered myself and my family to my enemies, while you, my superior in sangfroid if not in mother wit, looked on and said nothing. Now, if it is in your power, raise me from the dust and help me in that. But if all paths are blocked, then tell me so, and donâ€™t let us have any more either of scolding or of consolatory commonplace. If I were saying anything against your good faith I should not choose your house for a refuge. It is my own folly that I reproach, in imagining that you felt as warmly towards me as I could have wished. Had that been so you would have brought not better faith indeed but greater solicitude to bear, you would certainly have held me back as I rushed upon destruction, and would have saved yourself the labours you are now undertaking in the wreck of my fortunes.</p>
<p>So please go thoroughly into everything and let me have a full and reliable account. Wish me (as you do) to be <span class="italic">somebody</span>, since I can no longer be what I was or what I might have been. And please take me as reproaching <span class="italic">myself</span> in this letter, not you. I should be grateful if you would write letters and arrange for their dispatch to any persons you think ought to be written to in my name.</p>
<p>Dispatched 17 August.</p>
