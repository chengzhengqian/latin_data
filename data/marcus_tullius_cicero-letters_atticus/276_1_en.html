<h2>135 (VII.12)</h2>
<h2><span class="italic">Formiae, 22 January 49</span></h2>
<h2><span class="ac">Cicero to Atticus</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">I have so far received one letter from you dispatched the 19th, in which you indicate that you had sent another earlier which I have not received. But I do beg you to write as often as you can, anything you know or hear or even just suspect; above all what you think I ought to do or not to do.</p>
<p>As for your request that I should let you know what Pompey is about, I don’t think he knows himself; certainly none of us knows. I saw Consul Lentulus at Formiae on the 21st and Libo also. No sign of anything but panic and bewilderment. Pompey is making for Larinum, where there are some cohorts, as also at Luceria and Teanum and in the rest of Apulia. Once there, whether he wants to make a stand at any point or to go overseas is unknown. If he stays, I am afraid it may be impossible for him to have a strong army. If he goes, I don’t know his route or destination or what I am to do. As for the man whose Phalarism<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_231_1" id="target_note_LCL008_231_1"><sup>1</sup></a> you dread, I expect nothing but atrocities from him. Neither the suspension of business nor the departure of Senate and magistrates nor the closure of the Treasury will put a brake on him. But as you say, we shall know shortly.</p>
<p>Meanwhile I hope you will forgive me for writing to you so much and so often. It calms me, and I want to elicit letters from you, above all advice on what to do or how to behave. Shall I fling myself whole-hearted into the cause? I am not deterred by the risk, but I <span class="italic">am</span> bursting with indignation at the utter lack of judgement, or shall I say the flouting of <span class="italic">my</span> judgement, in the whole proceedings.
