<p class="noindent">Good news indeed about Buthrotum!<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_253_1" id="target_note_LCL491_253_1"><sup>1</sup></a> <span class="italic">I</span> had sent Tiro to Dolabella with a letter because you asked me. Well, it won’t do any harm. As for our friends at Antium, I thought my account was clear enough to leave you in no doubt about their intention to keep quiet and take advantage of Antony’s contumelious favour. Cassius scorned the corn job and Servilia said she would get it removed from the decree. Our friend<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_253_2" id="target_note_LCL491_253_2"><sup>2</sup></a> for his part declared with all solemnity that he would go to Asia, once he had agreed with me that Rome was no safe place for him (he prefers to give the games in his absence). He added that he would go at once as soon as he had handed over the wherewithal for the games to those who would look after them. He is collecting vessels, and thinks of nothing but the voyage.
