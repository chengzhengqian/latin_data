So as you see I am in great worry and perplexity. The truth is I ought never to have touched this job. How I envy you <span class="italic">your</span> province! You will leave when you like—perhaps you have left already. You will place whomever you think fit in charge of Thresprotia and Chaonia. However I have not yet met Quintus so as to know whether he could be brought to agree, if I <span class="italic">should</span> decide that way. But if he could, I can’t tell what I want. So that’s about the size of that.</p>
<p>The rest of my administration brings me so far abundance of praise and gratitude, befitting the volumes you eulogize so handsomely: communities saved from bankruptcy, tax farmers more than satisfied, nobody insulted, only a very few offended by the strict justice of a ruling (but none daring to complain), military achievements worthy of a Triumph. In <span class="italic">that</span> matter I shall do nothing savouring of undue eagerness, and certainly nothing without your advice. The close of the chapter presents difficulty, in handing over the province. But some providence will guide me there.</p>
<p>Of home affairs you of course know more than I, you hear more often and more reliably. I am sorry you don’t inform me by letter, for some disagreeable reports are coming here about Curio and Paulus.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_147_2" id="target_note_LCL008_147_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Not that I see any danger so long as Pompey stands—or even sits, provided his health holds. But I am really sorry about Curio and Paulus, both friends of mine. So please send me a sketch of the whole political situation if you are already in Rome or when you get there, so that it meets me on my way and I can adjust myself in the light of it and work out beforehand the attitude of mind in which I ought to approach the capital. It’s something not to arrive as a foreigner and a stranger.</p>
