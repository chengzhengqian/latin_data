<p>Two days later I spoke again. The price of grain had risen very high, and a crowd flocked first to the theatre and then to the Senate, clamouring at Clodius’ instigation that the shortage was my doing.

Our consular law now looks quite modest; Messius’ is felt to be intolerable. According to himself Pompey favours the former, according to his friends the latter.
