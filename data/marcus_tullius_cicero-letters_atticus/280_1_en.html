<h2>137 (VII.13a)</h2>
<h2><span class="italic">Minturnae, 24 January 49</span></h2>
<h2><span class="ac">Cicero to Atticus</span></h2>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Now</span> I understand your enigma. By the ‘juice merchants of Velia’ you must mean the Oppii.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_239_1" id="target_note_LCL008_239_1"><sup>1</sup></a> I cudgelled my brains over it a long while. Once that was solved the rest was plain and tallied with Terentia’s figure.</p>
<p>Early on 23 January I saw L. Caesar at Minturnae bearing a ridiculous message—a loose broom if ever there was one. Indeed it looks to me as though Caesar were deliberately making mock of us in giving <span class="italic">him</span> a message on matters of such moment—unless perhaps he never gave one, and the fellow has caught up some piece of conversation which he has palmed off as a message.</p>
<p>Labienus, a great man <span class="italic">me iudice</span>, arrived at Teanum on the 22nd. There he met Pompey and the Consuls. Of what was said and done I shall write to you when I have definite information. Pompey left Teanum on his way to Larinum on the 23rd, staying overnight at Venafrum. Labienus seems to have put a little fight into us. But I have nothing to write to you yet from this part of the world. I am rather expecting your news—what reports from Caesar, how he is taking it about Labienus, what Domitius is doing in the Marsian country and Thermus at Iguvium and P. Attius at Cingulum, what is the feeling among the city populace, what your forecast of things to come. Please write to me often about all this, also what you recommend anent my womenfolk and what you yourself are going to do.</p>
<p>If I was writing myself this letter would have been longer, but I have dictated it because I am suffering from ophthalmia.</p>
