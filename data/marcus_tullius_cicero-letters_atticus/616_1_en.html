And if you want to know (it’s plain as a pikestaff to me), they are scared of peace. Their theme and slogan is that a great man has been killed, that the whole state has been plunged into chaos by his death, that all he did will be null and void the moment we cease to be afraid, that clemency was his undoing, but for which nothing of the sort could have happened to him.</p>
<p>It occurs to me that if Pompey<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_215_2" id="target_note_LCL491_215_2"><sup>2</sup></a> comes this way with a strong army, as the evidence suggests that he will, there will be war for a certainty. This picture as I think of it disturbs me deeply. What was possible for you <span class="italic">then</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_215_3" id="target_note_LCL491_215_3"><sup>3</sup></a> will not be possible for me now, for I have made no secret of my rejoicing. Also they talk much of my ingratitude. Definitely, what was possible then for you and many others won’t be possible. Am I then to come into the open and go to the wars? Better a thousand deaths, especially at my age. So the Ides of March don’t give me as much consolation as they did. They have one glaring defect, though to be sure the young men ‘wipe off by other doughty deeds this slur.’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_215_4" id="target_note_LCL491_215_4"><sup>4</sup></a> But if you have any better hopes, since you hear more than I and are party to their plans, please write to me, and also consider what I ought to do about a Votive Commission. I receive many warnings hereabouts not to go to the Senate on the Kalends. Soldiers are said to have been collected secretly for the occasion, and collected against your friends. It looks to me as if they will be safer anywhere than in the Senate.</p>
