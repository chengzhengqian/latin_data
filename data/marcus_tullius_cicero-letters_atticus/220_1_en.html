an excellent creature. The rest are strengthening Cato’s policy.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_119_14" id="target_note_LCL008_119_14"><sup>14</sup></a> I am very grateful to you for commending my cause to Hortensius. As to Amianus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_119_15" id="target_note_LCL008_119_15"><sup>15</sup></a> Dionysius thinks there is no hope. I have not found a trace of Terentius. Moeragenes is certainly dead. I marched through his country, and there isn’t a living thing left. I did not know this when I talked about the matter to your man Democritus. I have ordered the Rhosian ware<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_119_16" id="target_note_LCL008_119_16"><sup>16</sup></a>—but see here, what are you up to? You give us bits of cabbage for dinner on fern-pattern dishes and in magnificent baskets. What can I expect you to serve up on earthenware? A <span class="italic">cor</span> has been ordered for Phemius and will be found. His playing had better be worthy of it.</p>
<p>A Parthian war is threatening. Cassius sent a silly dispatch, and none had by then arrived from Bibulus. When his is read out I think the Senate will at last sit up and take notice. For my part I am in great anxiety of mind. If, as I pray, my job is not extended, I have June and July to fear. All right—Bibulus will hold out for a couple of months anyway. But what about the man I leave in charge, especially if he is my brother? And what about me if I don’t leave so soon? It’s a pretty kettle of fish. However I have agreed with Deiotarus that he and his whole forces shall serve in my army. He has 30 cohorts of 400 men armed Roman fashion and 2,000 horse. There will be enough to hold the fort until Pompey comes. He indicates in a letter to me that this is going to be his concern. The Parthians are wintering in our province and Orodes in person is expected. Yes, it’s quite a coil.</p>
