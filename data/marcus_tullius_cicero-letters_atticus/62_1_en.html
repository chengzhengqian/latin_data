I have taken so kindly to idleness that I can’t tear myself away from it. So I either amuse myself with books, of which I have a goodly store at Antium, or I count the waves—the weather is unsuitable for fishing mackerel. To writing I feel a downright repugnance. The Geography which I had purposed is really a big undertaking. Eratosthenes, whom I had meant to follow, is sharply censured by Serapion and Hipparchus. What if Tyrannio joins in? And really the material is hard to set out, monotonous, not so easy to embellish as it looked, and (the main point) I find any excuse good enough for doing nothing. I am even considering whether I might not settle down here at Antium and see this whole period through. I had sooner have been <span class="italic">duovir</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL007_151_1" id="target_note_LCL007_151_1"><sup>1</sup></a> here than Consul in Rome. You were wiser than I in getting a house in Buthrotum. Yet I can assure you there is not much to choose between that town and this community of Antium. One can hardly believe that there could be a place so near Rome where many of the inhabitants have never seen Vatinius, where no member of the Board of Twenty<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL007_151_2" id="target_note_LCL007_151_2"><sup>2</sup></a> has a single well-wisher besides myself, where nobody disturbs me and everybody likes me. Yes, this is surely the place to practise politics. In Rome that is impossible, and what is more I am sick of it. So I shall compose <span class="italic">histoires inédites</span> which I shall read to nobody but you, in the vein of Theopompus or a lot more savage even. And my sole form of political activity now is to hate the rascals, and even that I do without spleen—rather with a certain relish in *.</p>
<p>But to come to business, I have written to the City Quaestors about Quintus’ affair. See what they have to say,
