<p>I am surprised your sister has not gone to Arcanum. I am glad you approve of the course I took about Chrysippus. No, I don’t intend to go to Tusculum at all at the present time (it’s out of the way for people coming to meet me and has other inconveniences), but shall leave Formiae for Tarracina on 29 December, from there go to ∗ in the Pontine marshes, and from there to Pompey’s place at Alba, thus reaching Rome on my birthday, 3 January.</p>
<p>The political situation alarms me more every day. It is not as though the honest men, as they are reckoned, were agreed. You would hardly credit me if I told you of the Roman Knights and Senators too I have heard using the bitterest language about the conduct of affairs in general and this trip of Pompey’s<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_207_2" id="target_note_LCL008_207_2"><sup>2</sup></a> in particular. Peace is what is wanted. Victory will bring many evils in its train, including the certainty of a despot. But we shall talk of this together soon.</p>
<p>Just now I have really nothing to write to you about—not politics because we both have the same information, and domestic matters too are known to both of us. Jokes are all that’s left, with <span class="italic">his</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_207_3" id="target_note_LCL008_207_3"><sup>3</sup></a> kind permission—for I am one of those who hold it more expedient to concede his demands than to join battle. It is late in time for us to resist a man whom we have been building up against ourselves for ten years. ‘What line will you take then?’ you may ask. None of course which you do not advise and none before I have either settled my own affair<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_207_4" id="target_note_LCL008_207_4"><sup>4</sup></a> or given it up. Look after your health therefore, and take pains (no man better) to shake off this quartan of yours at long last.</p>
