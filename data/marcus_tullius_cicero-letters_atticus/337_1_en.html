while they themselves stay at home?

And indeed as I write this on the 4th I am already expecting some news from Brundisium. Why do I say ‘some’? I mean news of his disgraceful flight and the victor’s return—his route and destination. When I hear that, if he is travelling by the Appian Way, I am for Arpinum.</p>

<h2>167 (IX.1)</h2>
<h2><span class="italic">Formiae, 6 March 49</span></h2>
<h2><span class="ac">Cicero to Atticus</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">Although by the time you read this letter I expect I shall already know the outcome at Brundisium (for Gnaeus set out from Canusium on 21 February and I am writing this on the 6th, thirteen days after he marched from Canusium), I am tortured none the less by suspense from hour to hour. It is extraordinary that nothing has come through, not even a rumour. The silence is uncanny. But perhaps all this is worry to no purpose, and after all the truth must soon be out. What <span class="italic">does</span> trouble me is that I still cannot discover the whereabouts of our friend P. Lentulus or of Domitius. I am looking for them in order to learn their plans, whether they are going to join Pompey, and if so, when and by what route.</p>
<p>Rome I hear is now full of optimates, and Sosius and Lupus, who our Gnaeus thought would arrive at Brundisium
