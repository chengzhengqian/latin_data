After the Ides of May I shall go to Cilicia to spend June there, I trust without interruption from the Parthians. July, if all goes well, will be occupied in the return journey through the province. I entered it at Laodicea on 31 July in the Consulship of Sulpicius and Marcellus, so I ought to leave it on 30 July. In the first instance I shall try to get my brother to let himself be left in charge, though that will be very far from the wishes of either one of us. But it is the only seemly course, especially as I cannot keep the excellent Pomptinus even now. Postumius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_97_4" id="target_note_LCL008_97_4"><sup>4</sup></a> is hurrying him to Rome, perhaps Postumia also.</p>
<p>So much for my plans. Now let me tell you about Brutus. Your friend Brutus is on close terms with certain creditors of the people of Salamis in Cyprus, M. Scaptius and P. Matinius. He warmly recommended them to me. Matinius I don’t know. Scaptius came to me in camp. I promised to see to it for Brutus’ sake that the Salaminians paid him his money. He thanked me and requested an appointment as Prefect. I told him that I never gave these appointments to businessmen, just as I had told you (I explained my rule to Cn. Pompeius when he made a similar request and he approved it, not to mention Torquatus in the case of your friend M. Laenius, and many others). But I added that if it was became of his bond that he wanted a Prefecture I would see that he got his money. He thanked me and took his leave. Our friend Appius had given some squadrons of horse to this Scaptius with which to put pressure on the Salaminians, and had also made him a Prefect. He was oppressing the Salaminians, so I ordered the troopers to leave Cyprus. Scaptius was not pleased.</p>
