You raise a historical query in one of them concerning Cn. Flavius, son of Annus. He did <span class="italic">not</span> live before the Decemvirs,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_115_7" id="target_note_LCL008_115_7"><sup>7</sup></a> for he became Curule Aedile, an office created long after their time.

But I think you will now have got two letters after your arrival in Epirus containing all my news, both given to your boys, one after the capture of Pindenissum, the other from Laodicea. I sent an official dispatch about these matters to Rome by two sets of couriers, having regard to the hazard of the voyage.</p>
<p>I agree with what you say about my Tullia, and have written to her and to Terentia to say that I approve—you had already written to me ‘but I wish you had gone back to your old gang.’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_115_9a" id="target_note_LCL008_115_9a"><sup>9</sup></a> Once the Memmius letter was corrected
