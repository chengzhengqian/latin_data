The appointment of your successor is resolved. You obstruct and say ‘admit my right to stand.’ What about <span class="italic">our</span> rights? Who are you to keep an army longer than the people have ordained, against the will of the Senate? ‘You will have to fight if you don’t give me what I want.’ Very well, fight we will, in good hope (as the same person says) of victory or of death as free men. War once decided, the time depends on chance, the plan of campaign on circumstances. So I won’t take up your time on that question. If you have any views on what I have said, let me know them. For my part I have no peace day or night.</p>

<h2>133 (VII.10)</h2>

<h2><span class="ac">Cicero to Atticus</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">I have decided on the spur of the moment to leave before daybreak so as to avoid looks or talk, especially with these laurelled lictors. As for what is to follow, I really don’t know what I am doing or going to do, I am so confounded by the rashness of this crazy proceeding of ours.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_225_1" id="target_note_LCL008_225_1"><sup>1</sup></a> As for yourself, what can I recommend—<span class="italic">I</span> am expecting advice from <span class="italic">you</span>. What our Gnaeus has decided or is deciding I don’t yet know, cooped up there in the country towns in a daze. If he makes a stand in Italy we shall all be with him, but if he leaves, it’s a matter for consideration. So far anyhow, unless I am out of my mind, there has been nothing but folly and recklessness. Pray write to me often, if only just what comes into your head.</p>
