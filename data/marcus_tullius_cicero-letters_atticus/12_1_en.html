17 July, at the tribunician elections in the Campus. As apparently certain rivals I have Galba, Antonius, and Q. Cornificius. When you read this last I fancy you will either laugh or cry. Now get ready to slap your forehead: some folk think Caesonius may stand too! As for Aquillius, I don’t expect he will. He has both said he won’t and entered a plea of ill health and alleged his monarchy over the law courts in excuse.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL007_51_2" id="target_note_LCL007_51_2"><sup>2</sup></a> If Catiline’s jury finds that the sun doesn’t shine at midday,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL007_51_3" id="target_note_LCL007_51_3"><sup>3</sup></a> he will certainly be a candidate. I don’t think you will be waiting for me to write about Aufidius and Palicanus.</p>
<p>Of the present candidates<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL007_51_4" id="target_note_LCL007_51_4"><sup>4</sup></a> Caesar<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL007_51_5" id="target_note_LCL007_51_5"><sup>5</sup></a> is regarded as a certainty. The other place is thought to lie between Thermus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL007_51_6a" id="target_note_LCL007_51_6a"><sup>6</sup></a> and Silanus. They are so poorly off for friends and reputation that it doesn’t seem to me an absolute impossibility to put Turius in their light, but I am alone in thinking so. From my point of view the best result would seem to be for Thermus to get in with Caesar, since he looks like being as strong a candidate as any of the present lot if he is left over to my year; the reason being that he is Curator of the Flaminian Way,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL007_51_7" id="target_note_LCL007_51_7"><sup>7</sup></a> which will easily be finished by then. I should be happy to tack him on to Consul Caesar now. Such in outline is my present idea of the position as to candidatures. For my part I shall spare no pains in faithfully fulfilling the whole duty of a candidate, and perhaps, as Gaul looks like counting heavily in the voting, I shall run
