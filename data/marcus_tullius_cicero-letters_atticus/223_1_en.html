to Sicily.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_125_23" id="target_note_LCL008_125_23"><sup>23</sup></a> Eratosthenes disproved the story by instancing plays which he says were produced by him after that time. We don’t on that account laugh at Duris of Samos, a conscientious historian, because he made the same mistake as many others. Everybody spoke of Zaleucus as the author of the legal code at Locri. Is Theophrastus discredited because your friend Timaeus found fault with that tradition? But it <span class="italic">is</span> disgraceful not to know that one’s great-grandfather was never Censor, especially as no Cornelius became Censor after his Consulship and during his lifetime.</p>
<p>With regard to what you say about Philotimus and the payment of the HS 20,600, I hear that Philotimus arrived in the Chersonese about the Kalends of January, but I have had no word from him as yet. Camillus writes that he (Camillus) has received the sums due to me. What these are I don’t know, and am very anxious to know. But of this later, and better perhaps when we meet.</p>
<p>I was disturbed by a phrase almost at the end of your letter. You write ‘<span class="italic">quoi encore</span>?’ and then beg me affectionately to remember to keep my eyes open and to watch what goes on. Have you heard something about somebody? Not that there is anything of the kind, <span class="italic">il s’en faut beaucoup.</span> It would not have escaped my notice, nor will. But I felt that so deliberate an admonition from you pointed <span class="italic">somewhere.</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_125_24" id="target_note_LCL008_125_24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>As for M. Octavius, I answer you once again, your reply to him was right and proper—I could wish it had been a little more confidently put. Caelius has sent me a freedman and an elaborate letter both about panthers and about raising money from the townships.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_125_25" id="target_note_LCL008_125_25"><sup>25</sup></a> I replied to the latter </p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL008_125_23"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL008_125_23" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">23</sup>In 415.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL008_125_23').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note inline" id="note_LCL008_125_24"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL008_125_24" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">24</sup>The veiled wording and the emphatic assurance that all is well suggest that Cicero had his brother in mind (cf.
