<h2><span class="ac">Cicero to Atticus</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">This is my twelfth day at Brundisium. An indisposition from which I have now recovered (there was no fever) and the expectation of Pomptinus’ arrival, of whom not so much as a rumour has yet reached me, has kept me here. But I am waiting for a passage.</p>
<p>If you are in Rome, which I hardly suppose, but <span class="italic">if</span> you are, I should be very grateful indeed if you would give your attention to the following: I am told in a letter from Rome that poor Milo<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_43_1" id="target_note_LCL008_43_1"><sup>1</sup></a> writes complaining of my ill-usage because Philotimus joined in the purchase of his estate.

I should like you now to go into the whole business, for things often reach me by letter in an exaggerated form. If Milo is complaining and writing to his friends and Fausta feels the same way, then Philotimus must not hold the property against Milo’s wishes, and so I told him verbally and so he promised. I would not have had that for the world. But if it is not so serious after all, then you must use your discretion. Talk to Duronius.
