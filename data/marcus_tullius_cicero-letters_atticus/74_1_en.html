What a marvellous opportunity for anyone who might be interested in buying my place here while these fellows are on my carpet! And yet you say, and very fine too, ‘Let’s attack something big, something that needs plenty of thought and time.’ However, I shan’t disappoint you nor spare my pains.</p>

<h2>35 (II.15)</h2>

<h2><span class="ac">Cicero to Atticus</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">Evidently it is as you say, things are as uncertain in the political field as in your letter; but it is just this diversity of talk and views that I find so entertaining. When I read a letter of yours I feel I am in Rome, hearing one thing one minute another the next, as one does when big events are toward. One point I can’t make out, how a scheme can possibly be devised for providing enough land without exciting opposition. Bibulus’ action in holding up the elections may be very noble, but what does it achieve except a personal protest which offers no solution to the country’s troubles? Depend upon it, Publius is our only hope. Yes, let him become Tribune, if only to bring you back the sooner from Epirus. I don’t see how you can possibly bear to miss him, especially if it turns out that he wants an argument with me. But of course you will hurry back if anything of that sort happens. But even if it doesn’t, I promise myself a magnificent show, whether he runs amok or sets the state on its feet again—if only I can watch it with you in the next seat!</p>
