But Hirtius had left to join Caesar in the middle of the night. This seemed to Pompey proof positive of estrangement. In short, my only comfort is that I don’t believe that Caesar, given a second Consulship even by his enemies and immense power by the grace of fortune, will be mad enough to put all this in jeopardy. But if he does start plunging, then indeed I fear much that I dare not write down. Anyway as matters stand I propose to come to Rome on 3 January.</p>

<p class="noindent">I have received a number of letters from you all at once. Though I am getting more recent news from my visitors here, I was glad to have them, for they showed your warm interest in my welfare. I am much concerned to hear of your illness, and I know how much more anxious you must be now that Pilia has contracted the same sort of complaint.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_205_1" id="target_note_LCL008_205_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Try both of you to get well.</p>
<p>I see you are not forgetting Tiro. He is extraordinarily useful to me when well in all sorts of ways, both in business and in my literary work, but I hope for his recovery more because he is such a nice, modest fellow than for my own convenience.</p>
<p>Philogenes never said a word to me about the HS 100,000 (?). On other matters you can consult Dionysius.</p>
