<p>First therefore I should like your opinion on these points. You have already indicated it, but I should be glad if you would write it out for me in greater detail. Secondly I hope you will also take a look into the future and sketch the figure I ought to present and the capacity in which you think I could best serve the country—is a peacemaking role required or does all rest with the warrior?</p>
<p>Duty is my yardstick in all things, but still I remember advice of yours which, if I had heeded it, would have spared me the sorrow of those old days. I remember what you urged upon me at that<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_323_1" id="target_note_LCL008_323_1"><sup>1</sup></a> time through Theophanes and through Culleo, and I have often recalled it with bitter - remorse. So let me now at all events return to the standards I then rejected and take counsels of safety (in some slight degree) as well as of glory. But I am not telling you what to say. I want you to write out your opinion in detail for me to read. I also want you to make every effort (you have those through whom you can make enquiries) to find out what our friend Lentulus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_323_2" id="target_note_LCL008_323_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and Domitius are doing and what their plans are, how they are behaving now, whether they blame anyone or have a grievance against anybody—I do not know why I say ‘anybody’ when I mean Pompey. To be sure Pompey puts all the blame on Domitius, as can be seen from his own letter of which I am sending you a copy. All right then, you will look into this, and as I wrote to you earlier, please send me the book Demetrius of Magnesia dedicated to you on Concord.</p>
