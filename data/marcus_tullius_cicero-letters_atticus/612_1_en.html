<p>First, thank you for all you have done about my financial affairs both in the matter of the payment and in the Albius business. About <span class="italic">your</span> Buthrotian business, Antony visited Misenum while I was at Pompeii, but he left for Samnium before I had heard of his arrival; from which you may see how much to hope for. So we shall deal with Buthrotum in Rome. L. Antonius’ speech is appalling, Dolabella’s is splendid. Now let him keep the money, as long as he pays up on the Ides. I am sorry to hear of Tertulla’s miscarriage. We need to keep up our stock of Cassii now as much as of Bruti. I hope it’s true about the Queen, and about that Caesar<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_207_2" id="target_note_LCL491_207_2"><sup>2</sup></a> of hers too. I have dealt faithfully with your first letter, now I come to the second.</p>
<p>As to the Quinti and Buthrotum, we will talk when I get back, as you say. Thank you for keeping Marcus in funds. You think I am wrong in my view that the free constitution depends on Brutus. Well, this is the way of it: either there will be no constitution at all or it will be preserved by him, or them. You urge me to write a speech and send it to him. My dear fellow, let me give you a general rule on matters in which I have a fair amount of experience. There was never a poet or orator yet who thought anyone better than himself. This applies even to the bad ones. How much more to one so gifted and erudite as Brutus! I actually made the experiment the other day in connection with the edict. I composed a draft at your request. I liked mine, he preferred his own. Indeed, when, at his own entreaty I might almost say, I addressed to him an essay<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_207_3" id="target_note_LCL491_207_3"><sup>3</sup></a> on the best style of oratory, he wrote not only to me but to you too that he could not agree with my preference. So pray let every man write as best suits himself. ‘Every man his own bride, mine for me. Every man his own love, mine for me.’ Not </p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL491_207_2"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL491_207_2" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">2</sup>Cleopatra’s son, supposedly by Caesar, called Caesarion (‘little Caesar’).</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL491_207_2').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note inline" id="note_LCL491_207_3"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL491_207_3" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">3</sup>The <span class="italic">Orator.</span></a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL491_207_3').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
