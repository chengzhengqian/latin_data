is to choose some town well away from the war while these issues are deciding. It will not be long before they are settled. If you do that I shall judge you to have acted wisely and you will not offend Caesar.</p>

<p class="noindent">Blind that I was not to have foreseen this! I sent you Antony’s letter. I wrote to him to the effect that I had no thought of acting against Caesar’s interests, that I bore my son-in-law in mind and also the claims of friendship, that if I had felt otherwise I might have been with Pompey now, but that finding it irksome to wander to and fro with my lictors I wished to stay at a distance, though even that I had still not definitely decided. This is his wiseacre reply:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Your friends’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL097_153_1" id="target_note_LCL097_153_1"><sup>1</sup></a> advice is very sound (?) For a man who wishes to take neither side stays in his country; to leave it suggests that he is passing judgement on one side or the other. However it is not my responsibility to decide whether any person is entitled to leave or not. My instructions from Caesar are to allow nobody whosoever to go out of Italy. Therefore it matters little that I should approve your intention since even so I cannot grant you any concession. I advise you to send to Caesar and make your request of him. I do not doubt that he will accede to</p></blockquote>
