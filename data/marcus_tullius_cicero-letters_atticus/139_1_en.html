They found their violence outmatched and their fury treated with contempt. However, Metellus asked Milo to declare the auspices to him next day in the Forum. No need, he said, to go at night to the Campus. He himself would be in the Comitium at daybreak. So, on the 20th, in came Milo to the Comitium while it was still dark. As dawn broke, there was Metellus furtively scurrying along the byways to the Campus. Milo caught him up between the Woods<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL007_305_8" id="target_note_LCL007_305_8"><sup>8</sup></a> and made his declaration, on which Metellus turned tail, to the accompaniment of a deal of coarse jeering from Q. Flaccus. The 21st was marketday, and for a couple of days there was no assembly.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 22nd I am writing this between two and three o’clock. Milo is already in position on the Campus. My neighbour Marcellus (the candidate)<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL007_305_9" id="target_note_LCL007_305_9"><sup>9</sup></a> is snoring loud enough for me to hear him. I am told that Clodius’ forecourt is pretty well deserted—a handful of ragamuffins without a lantern. Clodius’ party complain that it’s all been my plan. Little do they know our heroic Milo, what a resourceful as well as gallant fellow he is. His spirit is amazing. I pass over certain recent brilliancies, but the sum and substance is as follows: I don’t believe there will be any elections. I think Publius will be brought to trial by Milo, unless he is killed first. If he now puts himself in Milo’s way in a rough-and-tumble I don’t doubt that Milo will dispatch him with his own hands.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL007_305_10" id="target_note_LCL007_305_10"><sup>10</sup></a> He has no qualms about doing so, and makes no bones about it. He is not scared of what happened to me, for <span class="italic">he</span> is never going to follow anybody’s envious and treacherous advice or put his trust in a sluggish nobility.</p>
