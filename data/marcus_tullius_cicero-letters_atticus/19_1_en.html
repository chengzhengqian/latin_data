senatorial decree to the Vestals and College of Pontiffs, who pronounced that the occurrence constituted a sacrilege. Then by senatorial decree the Consuls promulgated a bill. And Caesar sent his wife<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL007_65_8" id="target_note_LCL007_65_8"><sup>8</sup></a> notice of divorce. Such being the position, Piso out of friendship for P. Clodius is working for the rejection of the bill which he is himself proposing, and proposing moreover under a senatorial decree on a matter of religion. Messalla is so far taking a strong and stringent line. The honest men are yielding to Clodius’ pleas and dropping out. Gangs of roughs are in formation. I myself, though I was quite a Lycurgus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL007_65_9" id="target_note_LCL007_65_9"><sup>9</sup></a> to start with, am softening every day. Cato presses and prods.

Awkward, tortuous, politically paltry, shabby, timid, disingenuous—but I shall go more into detail on another occasion. As yet I am not sufficiently <span class="italic">au fait</span> with the topic, and I dare not entrust a letter on such high matters to this who knows what of a messenger.</p>
<p>The Praetors<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL007_65_11" id="target_note_LCL007_65_11"><sup>11</sup></a> have not yet drawn lots for their provinces. The matter stands where it stood when you left.
