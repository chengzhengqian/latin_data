you make it plain that you are exercised to know what reason I am going to give Caesar for leaving Italy when I did. I don’t need any new reason. I have written to him repeatedly and sent word by others that I was unable to hold out, much as I should have wished, against the general talk, and so on and so forth. The last thing I wanted him to think was that in such a matter I had followed anybody’s judgement but my own. Subsequently Cornelius Balbus junior wrote to me that Caesar thought my brother Quintus had ‘sounded the clarion for my departure’ (that was his phrase). Not yet knowing what Quintus had written about me to all and sundry, though I had had many harsh words and actions from him face to face, I wrote to Caesar as follows notwithstanding:</p>
<p>‘For my brother Quintus I am no less anxious than for myself, but in my present situation I do not venture to intercede for him with you. This much however and no more I shall venture to ask you (and I beg it of you), not to hold him responsible for any shortcomings of mine in respect to yourself or for any want of regard for you, and on the contrary to believe that he was always in favour of our connexion, and that he was the companion of my journey, not the guide. Accordingly in other respects you will doubtless grant him such indulgence as your natural kindness and the friendship between you make appropriate. All I ask, as I do again most earnestly, is that <span class="italic">I</span> may not count against him with you.’</p>
<p>Accordingly, at any interview I may have with Caesar I shall take the line I have always taken, though I don’t doubt that he will be lenient towards Quintus and has already declared this to be his intention. But as I see it, we have much more reason to concern ourselves about Africa,
