<p>I come back to the affairs of the town, of which I had for a long while been in ignorance until I learned of them on 16 December from your most agreeable letter. Your freedman Philogenes took great trouble to ensure its safe delivery over a very long and not too safe route. The one you say you gave to Laenius’ boys I have not received. The Senate’s resolutions on Caesar and your own expectations make pleasant reading. If he yields to them, we are saved. I am the less distressed about Plaetorius’ fire because *<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_87_8" id="target_note_LCL008_87_8"><sup>8</sup></a> has been scorched. I’m longing to know why Lucceius took such a strong line about Q. Cassius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_87_9" id="target_note_LCL008_87_9"><sup>9</sup></a> and what happened.</p>
<p>I am under instructions to give your nephew Quintus his white gown when I get to Laodicea. I shall keep him on a tighter rein. Deiotarus, from whom I have had a large military contingent, has written that he will come to me at Laodicea with the boys. I am looking forward to a letter from Epirus, so that I can keep track of your holidays as well as of your business. Nicanor is doing good work and I am treating him handsomely. I think I shall send him to Rome with my official dispatch; that will ensure careful delivery and at the same time he can bring me back reliable news of you and from you. I am obliged to Alexis for so often adding his salutations, but why does he not do it in a letter of his own, as <span class="italic">my</span> Alexis<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_87_10" id="target_note_LCL008_87_10"><sup>10</sup></a> does to you? We are looking for a <span class="italic">cor</span> for Phemius.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_87_11" id="target_note_LCL008_87_11"><sup>11</sup></a> But enough. Look after your health and see that I am told when you mean to return to Rome.</p>
