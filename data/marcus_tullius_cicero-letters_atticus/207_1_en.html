You had often mentioned having given a letter to Laenius’ boys. This letter, dispatched 21 September, was finally handed to me by Laenius at Laodicea, when I arrived there on 11 February. My words to Laenius at the time and my actions later on will make him appreciate the value of your recommendation.</p>
