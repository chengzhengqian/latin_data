<p class="noindent">Before I left your house a little while ago it never occurred to me that a fine has to be paid on a monument<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL097_331_1" id="target_note_LCL097_331_1"><sup>1</sup></a> equal to the excess of the expenditure over the legal maximum, whatever that is. This would not matter to me much were it not that somehow, perhaps unreasonably, I should not wish what I put up to be called by any other name except a shrine. If that is what we want, I am afraid we cannot get it without changing the locality. Pray think the question over. It is true that the pressure is relaxed and I am almost my own man again, but still I need your advice. So once again I ask you earnestly, more so than you wish or tolerate in a request from me to you, to give your whole mind to this question.</p>

<h2>275 (XII.36)</h2>

<h2><span class="ac">Cicero to Atticus</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">I want it to be a shrine and from that thereâ€™s no budging me. I am anxious to avoid the appearance of a tomb, not so much because of the fine as in order to achieve apotheosis, as far as may be. That I could do if I built within the actual precincts of the house, but, as we have often said, I am afraid of changes of ownership. On open land, wherever I put it up, I think I can make sure that its sanctity is respected by posterity. You must bear with this foolishness
