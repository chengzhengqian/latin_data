<p>Lentulus’ friendly attitude, evinced in actions, promises, and letters, makes me somewhat hopeful of Pompey’s good will, as you have often told me that he is completely under Pompey’s thumb. As to Metellus, my brother has written to me of how much he hopes you have been able to achieve there. Strive, my dear fellow, to win me the right to live with you and my family, and write all to me. I am consumed by grief together with regret for all those things that have always been dearer to me than life itself. Take care of your health.</p>
<p>After writing the above at Thessalonica I proceeded to Dyrrachium, because if I had travelled to Epirus by way of Thessaly I should have heard nothing for a very long time, and because the townspeople are warm friends of mine. When I leave there for your place I shall let you know, and do you please write everything to me, good and bad, in the fullest detail. Results, not hopes, are what I expect now, results or nothing.</p>
<p>Dispatched 25 November, Dyrrachium.</p>
