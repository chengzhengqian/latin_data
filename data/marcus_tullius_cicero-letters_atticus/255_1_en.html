He gave me an unsolicited testimonial for uprightness, justice, clemency, and honourable dealing, while what I asked for he refused. Accordingly Caesar, in a letter of congratulation in which he promises me full support, is fairly cock-a-hoop at Cato’s ‘most ungrateful’ ill-usage. And the same Cato votes twenty days to Bibulus! You must forgive me, I cannot and will not swallow such things.</p>
<p>I should like to answer all your letters, but there is no need as I shall be seeing you in no time. One thing though about Chrysippus—I am less surprised about the other, a mere mechanic, though he too is a thorough-paced scamp. But Chrysippus, whom for the sake of a smattering of letters he had I liked to have about me and made much of, to leave the boy without my knowledge! His other misdeeds, plenty of which are coming to my ears, his pilferings, I leave; but his absconding I won’t stand, it’s the most blackguardly thing I ever met with. So I have followed the precedent of Drusus the Praetor, so they say, in the case of the slave who would not retake the oath<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_189_7" id="target_note_LCL008_189_7"><sup>7</sup></a> after manumission, and have denied giving them their freedom—all the more easily as no competent Claimant was present on the occasion.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_189_8a" id="target_note_LCL008_189_8a"><sup>8</sup></a> You will react to this as you think proper and I shall assent to your judgement.</p>
<p>I have not replied to one very eloquent letter of yours in which the dangers to the commonwealth are discussed.

Here the procedure seems to have been informal and therefore revocable at will. But it is also possible to render ‘as there was no one from whom they could rightly be claimed,’ explaining that Cicero could not properly combine the roles of master and presiding magistrate.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL008_189_8a').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
