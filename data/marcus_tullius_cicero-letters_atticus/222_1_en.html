So the natives pay a tolerable interest and the tax farmers are delighted with the arrangement, since they now get verbal compliments and frequent invitations to their hearts’ content. In a word they are all my friends and each man thinks himself preeminently so. All the same ‘in them let not . . .’—you know<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_123_20" id="target_note_LCL008_123_20"><sup>20</sup></a> how it goes on.</p>
<p>About Africanus’ statue<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_123_21" id="target_note_LCL008_123_21"><sup>21</sup></a> (what a ragbag this is! But that was just what I liked about your letter), you don’t say so! Doesn’t this Scipio Metellus know that his great-grandfather never held the Censorship? While the statue which stands on the high ground behind the Temple of Ops has no caption except ‘cos.,’ the one that stands by the Hercules of Polycles is inscribed ‘cos. cens.’; and the stance, the drapery, the ring, the likeness itself declares it to be of the same man. Upon my word, when I saw Africanus’ likeness over Sarapio’s<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_123_22" id="target_note_LCL008_123_22"><sup>22</sup></a> name in the cavalcade of gilded equestrian statues which this Metellus set up on the Capitol, I thought it was a workman’s blunder. Now I see the blunder was Metellus’. What disgraceful ignorance! That statement of mine about Flavius and the Calendar, if it is wrong, is an error in common currency. You were right to be puzzled, while on my side I followed the more or less received opinion. There are many such things in Greek authors, e.g. everybody spoke of Eupolis (him of the Old Comedy) as having been thrown into the sea by Alcibiades on the voyage
