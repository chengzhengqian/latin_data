As for my unhappy self, plunged in dire woes and afflictions of my own and now with this added fear, I am staying for the present at Thessalonica, in suspense and not daring to make any move.</p>
<p>Now to answer the points in your letter. I have not seen Caecilius Trypho.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL007_233_1" id="target_note_LCL007_233_1"><sup>1</sup></a> I have taken note of your talk with Pompey as recounted in your letter. I perceive no sign of so great a movement in the political situation as you either see coming or profess to see in order to comfort me. If Tigranes<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL007_233_2" id="target_note_LCL007_233_2"><sup>2</sup></a> has been passed over, it all goes by the board. You tell me to thank Varro; so I shall, and Hypsaeus likewise. I think I shall follow your advice not to go further away until the public transactions for May reach me. But where to go, I have not yet made up my mind. Indeed I am so worried about Quintus that I cannot make up my mind about anything. However, I shall let you know at once.</p>
<p>From the way my letters chop and change I expect you perceive the agitation of my mind, which is not so much caused by unhappiness, smitten though I am by a disaster beyond belief or example, as by the recollection of my own fault. Surely you see now whose<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL007_233_3" id="target_note_LCL007_233_3"><sup>3</sup></a> villainy it was that urged me on and betrayed me. If only you had seen it sooner and not surrendered your whole soul to grief as I did myself! When therefore you hear of me as plunged in the lowest depths of misery, you are to suppose that the penalty of my folly weighs upon me more heavily than that of the event itself, in that I trusted a man whom I did not think to be a blackguard. Grief for my own troubles and fear on my brother’s behalf alike make it hard for me to write. Please
