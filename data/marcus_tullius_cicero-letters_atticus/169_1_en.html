<p>You’ll wonder how I take all this. Pretty coolly, I assure you, and I plume myself highly on doing so. My dear friend, not only have we completely lost the vital essence of the free state—even its outward complexion and aspect is gone. There is no Republic any longer to give me joy and solace. Can I take that calmly? Why yes, I can. You see, I have the memory of the proud show she made for the short time that I was at the helm, and the thanks I got in return. My withers are unwrung by the spectacle of one man all-powerful, which chokes the persons who found it distasteful that <span class="italic">I</span> should have any power at all. I have many consolations. All the same, I do not move away from my position, but turn back to the life that is most congenial, to my books and studies. The labour of pleading is compensated by the pleasure that oratory gives me. My house in town and my places in the country are a source of delight. I do not remember the height from which I fell but the depth from which I have risen. If I can have my brother’s company and yours, then so far as I am concerned these people can go to the devil. I can philosophize and you can listen. That place in my mental anatomy which used to contain my spleen grew a toughskin long ago. Providing only that my private and domestic circumstances give me pleasure, you will find my equanimity quite remarkable. It largely depends, believe me, on your return. There is no one in the world with whom I hit it off quite so happily.</p>
<p>Well, let me tell you of other matters.

All the candidates for the Consulship are being prosecuted for corruption. Gabinius now joins them. </p></section><notes></notes></section>
