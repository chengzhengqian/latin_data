<h2>116 (VI.2)</h2>
<h2><span class="italic">Laodicea, latter part of April (?)50</span></h2>
<h2><span class="ac">Cicero to Atticus</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">Your freedman Philogenes has come to pay his respects to me in Laodicea and says he is returning to you at once by sea, so I am giving him this letter in reply to yours delivered by Brutus’ courier. And first I shall reply to your last page, where the account in Cincius’ letter to you of his conversation with Statius vexed me deeply. The most vexatious thing about it was that Statius should say that I too approve this idea.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_133_1" id="target_note_LCL008_133_1"><sup>1</sup></a> On that let me say only one thing: so far from wishing the bond between us to be in any way relaxed, I should welcome as many and as intimate links with you as possible, though those of affection, and of the closest, exist already. As for <span class="italic">him</span>, I have often found that he is apt to speak rather harshly in these matters, and again that his anger is often mollified. I think you know this. During this foreign trip or rather service of ours I have repeatedly seen him flare up and calm down again. What he may have written to Statius I cannot say. Whatever step he proposed to take in such a matter he ought not to have written to a freedman. I shall do my utmost to prevent any action contrary to our wishes and to what is right. But in a matter of this sort it is not enough to answer for oneself, and a large share of this responsibility falls upon the boy, or young man as he now is. This I am in the habit of urging upon him. He does seem to me to be very fond of his mother, as he should be, and extraordinarily fond of you. But the boy’s nature, though gifted, is complex, and I have plenty to do guiding it.</p>
