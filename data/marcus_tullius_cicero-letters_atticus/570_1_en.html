<h2>346 (XIII.37)</h2>
<h2><span class="italic">Tusculum, 21 August 45</span></h2>
<h2><span class="ac">Cicero to Atticus</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">Another letter today! As to Xeno’s debt and the 40,000 in Epirus, nothing could be more convenient and suitable than the procedure suggested in your letter. You had spoken about it to me in the same sense.</p>
<p>Balbus junior is with me. He brings no news really, except that Hirtius has been taking up the cudgels vigorously with Quintus on my behalf. He says Quintus is at it constantly, especially at dinner parties. When he finishes with me he comes back to his father, his most plausible line being that we are thoroughly hostile to Caesar and are not to be trusted. <span class="italic">I</span> am said to be actually dangerous. It would be alarming if I were not well aware that H.M. knows me for a coward. Quintus also alleges that my son is being bullied—but he can say that to his heart’s content.</p>
<p>I’m glad I gave Porcia’s eulogy to Lepta’s courier before I received your letter. I do beg you then to make sure that <span class="italic">if</span> it is sent to Domitius and Brutus it is sent in the form in which you have it.</p>
<p>I hope you will give me daily reports on the gladiator shows and the other ‘trifles light as air’ you write of.</p>
