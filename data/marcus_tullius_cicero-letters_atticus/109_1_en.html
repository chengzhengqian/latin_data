<h2>58 (III.14)</h2>
<h2><span class="italic">Thessalonica, 21 July 58</span></h2>
<h2><span class="ac">Cicero to Atticus</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">After your letter I am all expectation about Pompey, what he means by me or professes to mean. For I suppose that the elections are now over, at the conclusion of which you say he thought my case should be taken up. If you think me a fool to hope, well, I do so at your bidding, and you (?) know that in your letters you have rather been wont to lead me on and keep my hopes alive (?). Now I should be glad if you would let me know the prospects fully and frankly, as you see them. I know that I have fallen into this unhappy plight by my own mistakes, which have been many. If chance in some measure puts them right I shall be less inclined to regret that I was ever born and that I am alive today.</p>
<p>I have not yet moved from Thessalonica because the route is so frequented and because I am waiting from day to day for news of a turn in the situation. But I am now being forced out, not by Plancius,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL007_245_1" id="target_note_LCL007_245_1"><sup>1</sup></a> who for his part would like me to stay on, but by the place itselfâ€”there could be no less suitable spot in which to bear calamity in such a state of grief as I am in. I have not gone to Epirus, as I wrote that I should, because all at once my letters and reports indicated with one accord that there was no occasion for me to be as near as possible to Italy. From here, once I hear something after the elections, I shall betake myself to Asia, where in particular I am not yet sure, but you shall know.</p>
<p>Dispatched 21 July, Thessalonica.</p>
