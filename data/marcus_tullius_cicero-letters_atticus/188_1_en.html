you like. I shall not be so absent-minded as I was about Appuleius. For Xeno I have as much regard as yourself, and I am sure he is aware of it. Thanks to me you are <span class="italic">persona gratissima</span> with Patro and the other dunderheads,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_55_4" id="target_note_LCL008_55_4"><sup>4</sup></a> and upon my word you deserve to be.

<p>Would you please say a word of comfort to Pilia <span class="italic">de ma part</span>? For I’ll tell you, but you must not say anything to her: I received a parcel of letters in which there was one from Pilia to Quintus. I took it, opened it, and read it. It was very sympathetically written. The letters which were brought to you from Brundisium without one from me must have been dispatched when I was not so well—don’t accept the excuse of ∗.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_55_7" id="target_note_LCL008_55_7"><sup>7</sup></a> Take care you send me all the news, but take special care of your health.</p>
