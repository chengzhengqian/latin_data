<p class="noindent">I sent you on the 24th a copy of Balbus’ letter to me and of Caesar’s to him. Then on the same day what should come but a letter from Q. Pedius, from Capua, to say that Caesar had written to him on 14 March? Caesar wrote as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Pompey shuts himself up in the town. We have our camp at the gates. We are attempting a formidable task and one which will take us many days because of the depth of the sea; but there is nothing better we can do. We are sinking moles from both ends of the harbour so as either to oblige him to take his force at Brundisium overseas as soon as may be or to stop his way out.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Where is the peace about which Balbus wrote he was on tenterhooks? Could anything be harsher or more ruthless? And according to one firsthand authority he talks of avenging the deaths of Cn. Carbo and M. Brutus and of all the other victims of Sulla’s cruelty, in which Pompey, as he says, participated. Curio, he says, is doing nothing as his lieutenant which Pompey did not do as Sulla’s. He himself is restoring from exile men convicted on the charge of bribery who under previous laws would not have been liable to that penalty, whereas Sulla restored traitors to their country. He complains of Milo’s extrusion by violence; but promises himself to injure no one who does not bear arms against him.
