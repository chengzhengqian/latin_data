<p class="noindent">I had just sent Demea off to you when Eros arrived. But there was no news in his letter except that the auction is to be in two days’ time. You will come then, as you say, after it’s over—I would hope with the Faberius business settled. Eros says he won’t arrive today, but thinks he will tomorrow morning. You must be polite to him, though these fawnings are little less than criminal. I hope to see you the day after tomorrow.</p>
<p>If you can, please dig out for me somewhere the names of Mummius’ ten Commissioners.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_41_1" id="target_note_LCL491_41_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Polybius does not give them. I remember the Consular Albinus and Sp. Mummius. I fancy I have heard Hortensius mention Tuditanus. But in Libo’s Annals Tuditanus became Praetor fourteen years after Mummius became Consul. It doesn’t fit very well. I want to stage a sort of Political Conference at Olympia or where you will in the manner of your old friend Dicaearchus.</p>
