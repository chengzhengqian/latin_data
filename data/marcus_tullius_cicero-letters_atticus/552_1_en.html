The main point is, I don’t know him personally but what I hear is to his advantage, from Scrofa just recently. Another consideration, if it matters: his birth is even better than his father’s.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_87_4" id="target_note_LCL491_87_4"><sup>4</sup></a> So I’ll talk it over when I see you, and with a disposition to approve. For there is the further point that, as I think you know, I am fond of his father, fonder indeed than you or even himself is aware, and have been for a long time and for good reason.</p>

<h2>328 (XIII.20)</h2>
<h2><span class="italic">Arpinum, ca. 2 July 45</span></h2>
<h2><span class="ac">Cicero to Atticus</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">I have received a letter of consolation from Caesar dispatched on 30 April from Hispalis. I do not understand what has been announced about the enlargement of Rome. I should very much like to know about that. I am pleased to hear that Torquatus is grateful for my good offices, and I shall go on adding to them.</p>
<p>I can’t at this stage add anything about Tubero’s wife and stepdaughter to my speech for Ligarius (it is widely circulated), nor do I want to offend Tubero, who is remarkably touchy. You certainly had a fine audience.</p>
<p>Though I find life more tolerable here than anywhere, I am anxious to see you. So I shall be back as I arranged. I suppose you have seen my brother, so I am very curious about the outcome.</p>
