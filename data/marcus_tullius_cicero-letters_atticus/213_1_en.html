<h2>115 (VI.1)</h2>
<h2><span class="italic">Laodicea, 20 February 50</span></h2>
<h2><span class="ac">Cicero to Atticus</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">I got a letter from you on 19 February at Laodicea, and read it with the greatest enjoyment—so full of affection, kindliness, and friendly attentiveness. So I shall answer it in detail (?), since that is what you ask; nor shall I make my own arrangement of topics but shall keep to your order.</p>
<p>You say that the most recent letter you have had from me was dispatched on 21 September from Cybistra, and you want to know which of yours have reached me. Almost all you mention, the exceptions being the one you say you gave Lentulus’ boys and those dispatched from Equus Tuticus and Brundisium. So your diligence, so far from going for nothing as you are afraid it may, is excellently invested, at any rate if your object was to give me pleasure. Nothing has ever given me more.</p>
<p>I am glad indeed that my self-restraint in the case of Appius and also my readiness to oblige in that of Brutus wins your approval. I had thought it might be somewhat otherwise, for Appius sent me two or three rather querulous letters on his way home, blaming me for rescinding some of his ordinances—as though a doctor whose patient has been handed over to another practitioner were to choose to take umbrage against his successor for changing the treatment. After having kept Cilicia under a lowering regime, cupping and reducing all he could, and handing her over to me in the last stages of exhaustion, he didn’t much relish seeing her fed up again by me. But he takes offence one day and thanks me the next. I do nothing, you see, to cast reflexion upon him; it is simply the difference </p></section><notes></notes></section>
