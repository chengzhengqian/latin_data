the legions can be dodged more easily and safely than the pirates, who are said to be in evidence. Sestius was expected on the 10th but has not arrived, so far as I am aware. Cassius has arrived with his flotilla. After seeing him I propose to go to Pompeii on the 12th and from there to Aeculanum. You know what follows.</p>
<p>About Tutia, I thought as much. I don’t believe the story about Aebutius, though I care as little as you. I have written to Plancus and Oppius since you asked me, but may I suggest that you need not feel bound to forward the letters—as they have done all in their power for you I’m afraid they may think letters from me superfluous—at any rate not to Oppius, whom I know to be most friendly towards you? But as you wish.</p>
<p>Since you write that you are going to winter in Epirus it will be very agreeable for me if you go there before I have on your advice to get back to Italy. Let me have letters as often as you can, by anyone you can find if the topics are relatively unimportant; but if there is anything of consequence, send from home.</p>
<p>Once I get safely to Brundisium I shall set to work on a piece <span class="italic">à la Héraclide.</span> I am sending you ‘On Glory,’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_323_3" id="target_note_LCL491_323_3"><sup>3</sup></a> so you will keep it safe as usual. But make a note of the two excerpts for Salvius to read to a suitable audience at dinner—nothing more. I think them pretty good; I would rather <span class="italic">you</span> thought so. Good-bye, and again good-bye.</p>
