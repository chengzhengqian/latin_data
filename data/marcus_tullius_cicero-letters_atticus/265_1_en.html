<p class="noindent">I have really nothing to write to you about. You know all there is to know, and I on my side have nothing to expect from you. So let me just keep up my old-established habit of not letting anyone go your way without a letter.</p>
<p>The political situation alarms me deeply, and so far I have found scarcely anybody who is not for giving Caesar what he demands rather than fighting it out. The demand is impudent no doubt, but more moderate than was expected (?). And why should we start standing up to him now? ‘Sure, ’tis no worse a thing’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_209_1" id="target_note_LCL008_209_1"><sup>1</sup></a> than when we gave him his five years extension or when we brought in the law authorizing his candidature in absentia. Or did we put these weapons into his hands only to fight him now that he is equipped and ready? You will ask me what line I shall take in the House. Not the same as in my own mind. <span class="italic">There</span> I shall vote for peace at any price, but in the House I shall echo Pompey, and I shall not do it in a spirit of subservience either. But it is yet another major misfortune for the country that for me especially there is in a way something wrong in dissenting from Pompey on such high matters.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_209_2" id="target_note_LCL008_209_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
