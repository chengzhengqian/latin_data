<p class="noindent">Even before I read the bill<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL007_221_1" id="target_note_LCL007_221_1"><sup>1</sup></a> I felt it was very important to me to have you with me, and now that I have done so I see that nothing could be more desirable with a view to the journey on which I have decided than that you should overtake me as soon as possible, so that when I leave Italy I may have the protection of you and your people if I am to travel through Epirus, or if I am to take some different course I may have your advice in fixing upon a plan. So I beg you to try to overtake me directly. You can do so more easily now that the law about the province of Macedonia<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL007_221_2" id="target_note_LCL007_221_2"><sup>2</sup></a> has gone through. I should urge you at greater length, but you have the facts and they will speak for me.</p>

<p class="noindent">I hope I may see the day when I shall thank you for making me go on living. So far I am heartily sorry you did. But I beg you to come to me as soon as possible at Vibo, where I am going. I have changed direction for many reasons. But if you come there, I shall be able to make a plan for my whole journey and exile. If you do not do that, I shall be surprised; but I am confident you will.</p>
