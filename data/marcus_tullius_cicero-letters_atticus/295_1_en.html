In the last couple of days everything has taken on a brighter look. Accordingly the flight which was in preparation has been checked. Caesar’s interdicts (‘If on a second dawn I find you here’)<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_269_1" id="target_note_LCL008_269_1"><sup>1</sup></a> are scornfully rejected. Domitius is in good, Afranius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_269_2" id="target_note_LCL008_269_2"><sup>2</sup></a> in splendid repute.</p>
<p>Thank you for your most friendly advice to keep my hands free as long as possible. You add a warning against seeming partial to the discreditable cause. Certainly it is possible that I may seem so. I refused to take a leading role in a civil war so long as peace negotiations were proceeding, not that it would not have been proper to do so but because an action<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_269_3" id="target_note_LCL008_269_3"><sup>3</sup></a> much more proper had been my undoing.

<p>Terentia has written back to you about the HS 20,000. As for Dionysius, while I thought I should be on the move I did not choose to trouble him, and I did not reply to your frequent mention of his loyal disposition because I was waiting from one day to the next to decide what should be done. Now, as I see it, the boys at any rate are likely to spend the winter at Formiae. And I? I don’t know. If it is to be war I have decided to be with Pompey. I shall let you
