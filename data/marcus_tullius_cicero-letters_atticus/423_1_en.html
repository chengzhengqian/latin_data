<h2><span class="ac">Cicero to Atticus</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">I had just sent off a letter to you on various matters when Dionysius arrived at my place bright and early. I should not only have shown a placable spirit towards him, I should have forgiven the whole episode if he had come in the frame of mind you had led me to expect. You said in the letter which I received at Arpinum that he would come and do what I wanted. Now I wanted or rather earnestly desired him to stay with us; and because when he visited Formiae he categorically refused to do that I used to write to you about him rather harshly. However he had very little to say, and the gist of it was that I must excuse him; he was involved in business of his own and could not go with us. I did not say much in answer, but I was bitterly hurt. Clearly he scorned us in our present plight. Well, there it is. Perhaps you will be surprised when I tell you that among the distresses of this present time I count this as one of the greatest. I hope you may keep his friendship, and in expressing that wish I am wishing you prosperity; the one will last just so long as the other.</p>
<p>I hope my plan won’t involve any risk. I have concealed my intention and I don’t think I shall be very closely
