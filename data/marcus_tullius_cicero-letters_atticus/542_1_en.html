the living. What are we after all, or what can we be, at home or abroad? If it had not occurred to me to write these things of mine, such as they are, I should not know what to do with myself.</p>
<p>For Dolabella<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_67_3" id="target_note_LCL491_67_3"><sup>3</sup></a> I think I must do as you say and find some general subject with a political flavour. I certainly must do something—he wants it badly.</p>
<p>If Brutus takes any step, be sure to let me know. I think he ought not to lose any time, especially if he has made up his mind. He will extinguish or damp down all the tittletattle, some of which has reached even my ears. But he will be the best judge, especially if he talks to you about it.</p>
<p>My intention is to leave on the 21st. There is nothing for me to do here—nor there<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_67_4" id="target_note_LCL491_67_4"><sup>4</sup></a> either for that matter, nor anywhere else; but still there is a little there. I am expecting Spinther today—Brutus has sent me word. He writes exculpating Caesar in the matter of Marcellus’ death. Even if he had been killed by stealth, no suspicion would have fallen upon Caesar. As it is, since the facts about Magius are unquestioned, does not his fit of madness account for the whole tragedy? I really don’t know what he means, so please explain—though the only doubt in my mind is what caused Magius himself to take leave of his senses. I actually went surety for him. And no doubt that was it—he was ruined. I expect he asked Marcellus to do something for him and got a rather firm answer, as was Marcellus’ way.</p>
