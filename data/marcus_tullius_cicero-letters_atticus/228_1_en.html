<p>Having answered your last page with my first, I shall now come back to your first.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_135_2" id="target_note_LCL008_135_2"><sup>2</sup></a> I took the statement that all the Peloponnesian communities adjoin the sea from the accounts<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_135_3" id="target_note_LCL008_135_3"><sup>3</sup></a> of Dicaearchus, no scamp but a man approved by your own judgement. In the course of Chaeron’s story<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_135_4a" id="target_note_LCL008_135_4a"><sup>4</sup></a> about Trophonius he takes the Greeks to task under many heads for clinging to the coast, and makes no exception of any place in the Peloponnese. Though I thought him a good authority (after all he was extremely well informed and had lived in the Peloponnese), I was surprised and almost incredulous, so I consulted Dionysius. He was taken aback at first, but afterwards, having as high an opinion of this Dicaearchian deity<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_135_5" id="target_note_LCL008_135_5"><sup>5</sup></a> as you have of C. Vestorius or I of M. Cluvius,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_135_6" id="target_note_LCL008_135_6"><sup>6</sup></a> he was satisfied that we ought to credit him. He thought that Arcadia included a place on the coast called Lepreon, while Tenea, Aliphera, and Tritia<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_135_7" id="target_note_LCL008_135_7"><sup>7</sup></a> were recent foundations in his opinion, which he supported by the Catalogue of Ships,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_135_8" id="target_note_LCL008_135_8"><sup>8</sup></a> where they are not mentioned. So I took the passage over from Dicaearchus just as it stood. As for ‘Phliasians,’ I know that this is the correct form, and please put it in your copies as I have done in mine. But I was deceived at first by the analogy of Phlius with Opus
