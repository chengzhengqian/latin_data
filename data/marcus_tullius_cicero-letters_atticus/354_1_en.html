<p class="noindent">Greetings. After dispatching Oppius’ and my joint letter I received a letter from Caesar of which I send you a copy. From it you will see how anxious he is to restore good relations with Pompey, and how far removed from any sort of cruelty. I am of course very pleased that these are his views. As regards yourself and your sentiments of loyalty and gratitude, I feel exactly as you do, my dear Cicero, that your reputation and duty do not allow of your bearing arms against one from whom you give out that you have received so great a service. That Caesar, the most considerate of men, will take the same view I am well assured, and I have no doubt that he will be more than satisfied if you take no part in war against him and refrain from joining his adversaries. And not only will this satisfy him in the case of so distinguished a personage as yourself, but to me also he signified entirely of his own good will that I need not serve in any army which would be used against Lentulus or Pompey, to whom I am under the greatest obligations,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL097_39_1" id="target_note_LCL097_39_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and he told me that he would be content if I rendered him as a civilian in Rome the same good offices as I might, if I chose, render them. Accordingly I am now looking after all Lentulus’ affairs in Rome and taking them upon myself, </p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL097_39_1"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL097_39_1" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">1</sup>In particular, for the grant of Roman citizenship.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL097_39_1').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
