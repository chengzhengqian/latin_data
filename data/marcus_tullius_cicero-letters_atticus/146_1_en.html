<p>I quite agree about Trebonius. As for Domitius, ‘No pea, by Jove, was e’er so like to pea’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL007_319_2" id="target_note_LCL007_319_2"><sup>2</sup></a> as this crisis of his to my own. The same people responsible, the same unexpectedness, the same conspicuous absence of the honest men. The only difference is that he asked for it. As for the actual blow, I dare say I came off the better of the two. Could anything be more lamentable than for a man who has been Consul-Designate from his cradle to be debarred from becoming Consul, especially as he has no competitors, or at any rate no more than one?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL007_319_3a" id="target_note_LCL007_319_3a"><sup>3</sup></a> And if it is true, as I dare say it is, that in the lists in their<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL007_319_4" id="target_note_LCL007_319_4"><sup>4</sup></a> little notebooks the future Consuls take up as many pages as the past ones, could any condition be more pitiable than his—except the state’s, in which no improvement is so much as hoped for?</p>
<p>Your letter gave me first news about Natta.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL007_319_5" id="target_note_LCL007_319_5"><sup>5</sup></a> I detested the man. You ask about the poem.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL007_319_6" id="target_note_LCL007_319_6"><sup>6</sup></a> Suppose it were to wish to spread its wings, what then? Should I let it? As for Fabius Luscus, as I had started to say, he was always extremely friendly to me and I never had anything against him—a clever fellow enough, very well-behaved and worthy. Well, as I saw nothing of him, I thought he must be out of town, but I heard from Gavius of Firmum (you know) that he was in Rome and had been all the time. That gave me a jolt. You may think it a small thing to trouble about, but he had brought me a lot of reliable information

Domitius had been foiled in his candidature for the Consulship of 55. Pompey and Crassus, who were finally elected in January of that year after other competitors, Domitius excepted, had withdrawn, had not put in as candidates at the proper time, and so Cicero does not recognize them. The one competitor about whom Cicero is doubtful is an unknown; at this time it must have been uncertain whether he would withdraw or not.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL007_319_3a').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL007_319_4"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL007_319_4" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">4</sup>The ‘Triumvirs’ are meant.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL007_319_4').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL007_319_5"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL007_319_5" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">5</sup>Presumably about his death.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL007_319_5').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL007_319_6"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL007_319_6" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">6</sup>Probably ‘On His Vicissitudes,’ referred to in <span class="italic">Ad Familiares</span> 20(I.9).23.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL007_319_6').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
