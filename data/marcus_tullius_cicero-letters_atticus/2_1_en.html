no one going to Epirus and we don’t yet hear of you in Athens. Then as to the Acutilius business,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL007_31_1" id="target_note_LCL007_31_1"><sup>1</sup></a> I had discharged your commission as soon as I got back to Rome after you left. But, as it turned out, there was no urgency, and reckoning that you were quite capable of making up your own mind I preferred Peducaeus to write and advise you rather than myself. And really, considering I lent my ears day after day to Acutilius, with whose style of conversation I dare say you are well acquainted, I should not have found it too onerous to write to you about his grumbles when I made light of listening to them, which <span class="italic">was</span> just a little tedious. But let me tell you that only one letter has reached me from <span class="italic">you</span>, my accuser, though you have more time for writing and more opportunities to send.</p>
<p>You say that even if a certain person<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL007_31_2" id="target_note_LCL007_31_2"><sup>2</sup></a> were out of humour with you I ought to bring him round. I understand your meaning and have not been remiss, but he is marvellously hipped. I did not fail to say the proper things about you, but I felt I ought to decide how far to press in the light of your wishes. If you will explain them to me you will see that, while I did not want to pay more attention to the matter than you did yourself, I shall pay no less than you desire.</p>
<p>On the Tadius matter, Tadius tells me that he has heard from you to the effect that there is no need to worry any longer as the estate is his by usucapion.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL007_31_3" id="target_note_LCL007_31_3"><sup>3</sup></a> We are surprised you don’t know that nothing can be alienated by usucapion from a legal tutelage, which is said to be the girl’s position.</p>
<p>I am glad you are pleased with your purchase in
