<p class="noindent">About the property, I have received your letter and Chrysippus’ report. In the house, which I well knew to be unattractive, it seems that little or nothing has been changed. He does however speak well of the larger baths; the smaller ones he says could be made into winter apartments. So a covered path needs to be added. Even if I make it the size of the one I made at Tusculum, it will cost hardly more than half as much in that locality. For the model temple that I want the grove, which I remember, seems ideal. But it used to be quite out of the way in the old days, now I hear it is very much the reverse. I should like it above all things. Indulge my folly in this, <span class="italic">je vous en prie</span>. For the rest, if Faberius settles that debt he owes me, don’t ask the price. Just outbid Otho. I think however that he isn’t likely to go beserk. I rather fancy I have his measure. I hear he has taken such a hammering himself that I doubt if he will be in the market. Else why would he be letting it<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_35_1" id="target_note_LCL491_35_1"><sup>1</sup></a> happen? But there is no need for me to make a case. If you clear up Faberius, let us buy even at a high price; otherwise we can’t, even at a low one. Well then, Clodia. I think I may hope to buy from her directly, both because her property is much less valuable and because Dolabella’s debt now seems well on the way to settlement so that I am confident of being able to pay even on a cash down footing. So much </p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL491_35_1"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL491_35_1" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">1</sup>The auction.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL491_35_1').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
