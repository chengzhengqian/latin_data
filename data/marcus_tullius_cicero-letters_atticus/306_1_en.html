<p class="noindent">Only one thing remains to fill up the cup of our friend’s dishonour—not to go to Domitius’ help. ‘But nobody doubts that he will go.’ <span class="italic">I</span> don’t think so. ‘Is he then going to leave such a Roman in the lurch, and those whom he knows are with him, and that too when he himself has twenty cohorts and Domitius thirty?’ Unless I am altogether out, yes. He is shaking in his shoes and aims at nothing but flight, in which you think (for I see what you feel) I ought to keep him company. Well, I know whom to flee but I don’t know whom to follow.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_291_1" id="target_note_LCL008_291_1"><sup>1</sup></a> You praise that ‘memorable’ saying<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_291_2" id="target_note_LCL008_291_2"><sup>2</sup></a> of mine, that I prefer defeat with Pompey to victory with those others. Why, so I do, but with Pompey as he then was or as I thought him to be. But <span class="italic">this</span> Pompey, who takes to his heels before he knows where he is running or whom he is running from, who has surrendered all that is ours, has abandoned Rome, is abandoning Italy—well, if I preferred defeat with him I have my wish, defeated I am. For the rest, I can’t bear the sight of things I never feared to see, nor, I will add, of the man<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_291_3" id="target_note_LCL008_291_3"><sup>3</sup></a> who has robbed me not only of what I had but of what I was.</p>
<p>I have written to Philotimus about travel money, telling him to get it either from the Mint,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_291_4" id="target_note_LCL008_291_4"><sup>4</sup></a> as no one is paying debts, or from your cronies the Oppii. I shall give you other commissions as may be requisite.</p>
