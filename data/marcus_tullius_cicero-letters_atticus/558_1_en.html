<p>I have replied to your meticulous letter about the rebate. So please settle without any hesitancy or reluctance. That is the proper and expedient course.</p>

<p class="noindent">Concerning Andromenes, that is what I thought. You would have known and told me.</p>
<p>But you write to me about Brutus without saying a word about yourself. When do you think he will come? I am for Rome on the 14th. What I meant to write to Brutus (but since you say you read the letter perhaps I did not make myself quite clear) was that I had understood from your letter that he did not wish me to come to Rome at present more or less for the purpose of seeing him off. But since I shall soon be coming now, pray see that the Ides don’t hinder him from staying at Tusculum as suits his own convenience. I should not have wanted him for the auction (in such a matter what need for anyone besides yourself?), but I wished to have him for the will. But now I prefer to do that another day, so as not to seem to have come to Rome on that account. I therefore wrote to Brutus that the business which I had expected on the Ides was now unnecessary. So I should be grateful if you would so handle the whole matter as to avoid even the smallest interference with Brutus’ convenience.</p>
