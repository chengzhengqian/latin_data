<h2>118 (VI.4)</h2>
<h2><span class="italic">En route, mid-(?)June 50</span></h2>
<h2><span class="ac">Cicero to Atticus</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">I arrived at Tarsus on the Nones of June. There I found much to disquiet me: a great war in Syria, a great deal of brigandage in Cilicia, a difficult administrative task because I have only a few days left of my year’s charge; most difficult of all, somebody must be left in charge under the Senate’s decree. No choice could have less to recommend it than Quaestor Mescinius—of Coelius I hear nothing. The most correct course seems to be to leave my brother Quintus with full authority. It involves many disagreeables, our separation, the danger of war, the rascality of the soldiers—there’s no end to them. The whole thing is an unmitigated bore. But I must leave all this to luck since there is little room for calculation.</p>
<p>Now that you are safely back, I hope, in Rome, would you please attend in your usual way to all you may find to concern me, above all with regard to my dear Tullia—I gave my views about a match for her to Terentia in a letter written when you were in Greece; and secondly with regard to my prospective honour,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_155_1" id="target_note_LCL008_155_1"><sup>1</sup></a> for I’m afraid that because of your absence my letter did not get sufficiently careful treatment in the Senate.</p>
