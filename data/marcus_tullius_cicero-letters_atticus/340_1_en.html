Should I oppose then? ‘Heaven forfend!’ say you. Well, what <span class="italic">am</span> I to do then, with crime on the one side and punishment on the other? Caesar, you say, will give me permission to stay away, out of public life. Am I to beg then? Miserable! Supposing the permission is refused? And you point out that the Triumph will remain open. Suppose he presses me with that very thing? Am I to accept? Could anything be uglier? Refuse? He will feel utterly spurned, even more than over the place on the Board of Twenty in the old days.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL097_11_1" id="target_note_LCL097_11_1"><sup>1</sup></a> In his own excuse he always lays the whole blame for what happened then on my shoulders, says that I was so bitterly hostile to him that I would not even accept an honour at his hands.

But if I don’t go when I can, <span class="italic">then</span> he will be angry. I am not afraid of that because of any harm that may come to me—after all, what can he do? ‘What man’s a slave that nothing recks of death?’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL097_11_2" id="target_note_LCL097_11_2"><sup>2</sup></a>—but because I dread the charge of ingratitude.
