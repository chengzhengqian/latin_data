<p>Thank you for saying that you will recommend my glory to Lucceius and for keeping a watchful eye on my building. My brother writes to me that as you have our delightful young Quintus with you he will pay you a visit on the Nones of May. I left Cumae on 26 April and stayed the night at Naples with Paetus. I write this very early on 27 April, just off for Pompeii.</p>

<p class="noindent">Your two letters which I received together on the 26th gave me much pleasure. Carry on with the good work! I am dying to know everything that goes on. For instance would you find out what this means?—you can, from Demetrius. Pompey told me that he was expecting Crassus at Alba on the 27th, and that when he had arrived they would go to Rome at once, to make up accounts with the tax farmers.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL007_329_1" id="target_note_LCL007_329_1"><sup>1</sup></a> ‘During the gladiator show?’ I asked. He replied, ‘Before it starts.’ Could you send me word what this is about, either now, if you happen to know, or when he gets to Rome?</p>
<p>Here I am devouring literature with that amazing man (I’m quite serious) Dionysius, who sends his regards to you and all. ‘Nothing so sweet as everything to know.’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL007_329_2" id="target_note_LCL007_329_2"><sup>2</sup></a> That being so, remember that I am of an inquisitive turn, and tell me in detail about the opening day<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL007_329_3" id="target_note_LCL007_329_3"><sup>3</sup></a> and the second day and the Censors and Appius and the People’s Appuleia.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL007_329_4a" id="target_note_LCL007_329_4a"><sup>4</sup></a>
