consult Vettius. In these times, when life is so uncertain for men of light and leading, I set store on a single summer’s enjoyment of my palaestra on the Palatine, but at the same time the last thing I want is for Pomponia and the boy to live in fear of falling masonry.</p>

<p class="noindent">Yes, I am eager, and have been for long enough, to visit Alexandria<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL007_147_1" id="target_note_LCL007_147_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and the rest of Egypt, and at the same time to get away from this part of the world where people are tired of me and to come back when they have begun to miss me a little. But at the present time, and the authors of the mission being who they are, ‘I fear the Trojans and their long-gowned wives.’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL007_147_2" id="target_note_LCL007_147_2"><sup>2</sup></a> What will our optimates say, if there are any left? Perhaps that I have been somehow bribed to change my news. ‘Polydamas will cry me shame the first’—our friend Cato, who is ‘one worth a hundred thousand’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL007_147_3" id="target_note_LCL007_147_3"><sup>3</sup></a> in my eyes. And what will history say of me a thousand years hence? I am far more in awe of that than of the tittle-tattle of my contemporaries. But I think I had better wait and see. If the offer is made, that will give me some sort of latitude and then will be the time to deliberate. Also, dash it all, there is some glory in not accepting. So if Theophanes happens to say something to you, don’t turn it down out of hand.</p>
