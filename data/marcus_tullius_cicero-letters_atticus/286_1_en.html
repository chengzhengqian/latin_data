I shall hold to that as long as there is hope of peace. But if war is to be waged I shall not fall short of my duty and position, having put the boys out of harm’s way in Greece. It is evident to me that the whole of Italy will be ablaze with warfare. Such is the holocaust kindled by our countrymen, some wicked, some jealous.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_251_1" id="target_note_LCL008_251_1"><sup>1</sup></a> But in a few days’ time we shall see from Caesar’s reply to our reply which way things are going to turn out. I shall write to you further if it’s to be war; if peace, or even an armistice, I shall hope to see you in person.</p>
<p>I am expecting my wife and daughter today (2 February) at Formiae, where I have returned from Capua. I did write to tell them to stay in Rome, prompted by your letter, but I hear that nervousness there has increased for some reason. I want to be in Capua on the Nones of February because the Consuls have so instructed. I shall write to you at once of any news that comes in here from Pompey and shall expect your letters about affairs in town.</p>

<p class="noindent">On 2 February our ladies arrived at Formiae and brought me news of all your characteristically kind and zealous offices towards them. Until we know whether we are to have peace without honour or war with its calamities I have thought it best for them to stay in my house at Formiae and the boys too. My brother and I are leaving for Capua
