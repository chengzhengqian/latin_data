<p class="noindent">You will have heard that Asia<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL007_75_1" id="target_note_LCL007_75_1"><sup>1</sup></a> has fallen to my dearest of brothers—I don’t doubt that rumour brought you the news faster than any of us could do by letter. So now bear in mind that we have always been eager to shine, that we both are and are generally reputed outstanding philhellenes, and that we have incurred unpopularity and enmity in many quarters for our country’s sake. Gird up your loins then! Do your best to make us universally both lauded and loved. I shall write more to you about this in a letter which I shall send by Quintus himself.</p>
<p>Please let me know what you have done about my commission and about your own affair<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL007_75_2" id="target_note_LCL007_75_2"><sup>2</sup></a> too. Since you left Brundisium I have not had a single letter from you. I am very anxious to know how you are getting on.</p>
<p>Ides of March.</p>
