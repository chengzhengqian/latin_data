<h2>174 (IX.7)</h2>

<h2><span class="ac">Cicero to Atticus</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">I wrote a letter to you meaning to dispatch it on the 12th, but the man to whom I had meant to give it did not go. That same day Fleet-foot, as Salvius called him, arrived with a most substantial letter from you, which put back a <span class="italic">soupçon</span> of life into me—it would be too much to say that it set me up again.

So I have no longer any hope of a quiet life for myself and I am ready to swallow every bitter pill. My one fear was of doing, or shall I say of having already done, something dishonourable.</p>

Thank you very much. I know his regard for me and his sound moral judgement. Your longer letter raised not only myself but all of us from our distress of mind.

As for your suggestion that I ask him to allow me to pay as much regard to Pompey as I have paid to himself, you will see from Balbus’ and Oppius’ letters, copies of which I enclose, that this is what I have </p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL097_31_1"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL097_31_1" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">1</sup>Caesar.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL097_31_1').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
