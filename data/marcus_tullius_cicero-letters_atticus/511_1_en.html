<h2>283 (XII.41)</h2>
<h2><span class="italic">Astura, 11 May 45</span></h2>
<h2><span class="ac">Cicero to Atticus</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">I have nothing to say, but I wanted to know where you are and, if you are away or going to be away, when you will be back. So please send me word. And in answer to your question as to when I shall be leaving this place, I have decided to spend the night of the 16th at Lanuvium and the following at Tusculum or in Rome. You shall hear on the day which I am going to do.</p>
<p>You know how quick misery is to find fault, not indeed where you are concerned by any means, but still I am hungry for the shrine. If I don’t—I won’t say get it, but see myself in process of getting it, my grief (yes, I’ll say it, and you will take it in your usual way) will turn upon you, unjustly to be sure; but you will be patient with these words that I write, as you are and ever have been patient with all I say and do. I should like you to direct all your efforts to console me on this single point. If you ask my choice: first Scapula’s, then Clodia’s, after that (if Silius won’t sell and Drusus is exorbitant) Cusinius and Trebonius’. I think there is a third owner—I know Rebilus used to be at any rate. If however you favour Tusculum, as you seemed to in one of your letters, I shall assent to your opinion. You really must put this through if you want to see me comforted. You now actually upbraid me in sterner language than it is like you to use; but you do it out of the warmth of your affection and perhaps driven to it by my fault—but as I say, if you want to see me comforted, this is the best comfort, or, if you want the truth, the one and only.</p>
