Vibullius wrote to me to leave Corfinium with your army on 9 February and join me, you subsequently changed your plans. The reason which Vibullius gives me, that you delayed because you heard Caesar had advanced from Firmum and reached Castrum Truentinum, is of no validity, for the nearer the enemyâ€™s approach the faster you should have acted in order to join me before Caesar was in a position either to interfere with your march or to cut me off from you.</p>
<p>Accordingly I once again beg and urge you, as I have continually asked you in my previous letters, to come to me at Luceria on the earliest possible day before those forces which Caesar has begun to muster are collected at one point so as to cut you off from us. If however you are held back by certain persons anxious to save their farms, I am surely entitled to expect you to release the cohorts which have come in from Picenum and Camerinum, leaving their own possessions behind them, and let them join me.</p>

<p class="noindent">M. Calenius has brought me a letter from you on 16 February. In that letter you write that you propose to watch Caesar, and that if he starts to move in my direction along the coast you will at once march into Samnium to join me, whereas if he stays in your neighbourhood you wish to stand against him should he approach nearer.</p>
