Balbus writes to me that he has copied ‘On the Limits,’ Book V, from your manuscript, a book in which I have made changes, not many to be sure, but still some. You will oblige me by keeping the others back so that Balbus does not get them unrevised or Brutus stale. But enough of this, or you will think I am making mountains out of molehills—though these are my mountains nowadays, for what else is there?</p>
<p>I am in such a hurry to send Varro what I have written, as you suggested, that I have already sent it to Rome for copying. You shall have it at once if you like. I wrote to the clerks to let your people take a copy if you wished. Please keep it to yourself till I see you, as you are always most careful to do when I have asked you.</p>
<p>But how did it slip my mind to tell you? Caerellia, in her amazing ardour for philosophy no doubt, is copying from your people. She has this very work ‘On the Limits.’ Now I assure you (being human I may be wrong) that she did not get it from my men—it has never been out of my sight. Moreover, so far from making two copies they had difficulty in finishing one. However I do not hold your people to blame and I don’t want you to do so. The oversight was mine, in omitting to say that I did not want it to get into circulation yet. Dear, dear, what a time I have spent on trifles! You see, on serious matters I have nothing to say.</p>

<p>I agree with you about Dolabella. I shall meet the coheirs at Tusculum, as you say. Balbus writes to me about Caesar’s return that it won’t be before the Kalends of August. Excellent news about Attica, that the attacks are lighter and slighter and that she takes them easily. With </p></section><notes></notes></section>
