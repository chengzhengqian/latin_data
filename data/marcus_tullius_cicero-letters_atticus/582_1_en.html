<p class="noindent">Now do you suppose I hear anything at Lanuvium? You on the other hand in Rome must be getting news every day. Things are in ferment. When Matius goes on as he does, what do you think the rest are saying? For my part I can only be sorry that freedom has been restored without the free constitution, a thing unprecedented in the history of any community. It’s enough to make one shudder, how they talk and threaten. Also I am afraid of wars in Gaul, even of where Sextus may end up.</p>
<p>But though all the vials of wrath descend upon our heads, the Ides of March are our consolation. Our heroes achieved all that lay with themselves most gloriously and magnificently. What remains to do needs men and money, and we have none. So much from me to you. On your side, if you have any news (I expect some every day), send it to me right away; and if you have none, let us keep to our custom none the less and not allow any intermission in our little exchanges. <span class="italic">I</span> shall not be the defaulter.</p>
