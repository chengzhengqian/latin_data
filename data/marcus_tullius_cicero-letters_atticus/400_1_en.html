different from mine. Not that right is not right for both of us as citizens of the Republic, but the Republic is not at issue. This is a fight for a throne. The expelled monarch is the more moderate, upright, and clean-handed, and unless he wins the name of the Roman people must inevitably be blotted out; but if he does win, his victory will be after the Sullan fashion and example. Therefore in such a conflict you should support neither side openly and trim your sails to the wind. My case however is different because I am bound by an obligation and cannot be ungrateful. Yet I don’t think I shall stand in the line of battle, but rather stay in Malta or some similar place or little town. You may ask me whether I am doing nothing to help the person to whom I don’t want to be ungrateful. On the contrary he would perhaps have preferred me to do less.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL097_131_2" id="target_note_LCL097_131_2"><sup>2</sup></a> But we shall see about this later on; only let me get away.

<p>I have been given a hope of sorts. Ser. Sulpicius is said to want to talk to me. I have sent my freedman Philotimus to him with a letter. If he chooses to be a man, it will be a notable fellow-travelling; if not, not. I shall take my usual line. Curio has been spending his time with me. He thinks Caesar is in bad odour because of the offence given to popular sentiment, and has no confidence in Sicily if Pompey should begin operations at sea.</p>
<p>I gave young Quintus a warm reception. I see it was greed and the hope of a handsome largesse. That is bad enough in all conscience, but I hope there was no such villainy as we feared. I think you will agree that this vice does not proceed from indulgence on our part but from nature. However I govern him with discipline.</p>
