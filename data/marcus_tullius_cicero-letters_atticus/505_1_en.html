<p class="noindent">When the courier arrived without any letter from you I concluded that your reason for not writing was that you had written the letter which I am now answering the day before. I had however expected something about Asinius Pollio’s letter—but I am too much inclined to judge of your leisure by my own. However, I give you leave not to feel you have to write unless in fact you have to—or unless you are really disengaged.</p>
<p>As to the couriers, I should do what you suggest if there were any necessary letters, as there used to be when even though the days were shorter the couriers used to keep to time every day. But then we had business in hand—Silius, Drusus, etc. Now we should have nothing to write about if Otho had not cropped up; and even that has been put off. Still it is a comfort to talk to you in absence, and a much greater one to read your letters. But since you are away (or so I suppose) and there is no necessity to write, our correspondence shall lapse unless something fresh crops up.</p>
