would you please write so that I know what it’s about and what I ought to say?</p>
<p>I am waiting to hear what you have done about the letter to Caesar. About Silius I am not so very much concerned. You must get me either Scapula’s or Clodia’s. But you seem to be in some doubt about Clodia; is it about when she is coming back or whether the place is for sale? But what is this I hear about Spinther divorcing his wife?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_25_2" id="target_note_LCL491_25_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>About the Latin Language<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_25_3" id="target_note_LCL491_25_3"><sup>3</sup></a> you can set your mind at rest. You will say ‘What’s that compared to your writings?’ (?) They are mere transcripts,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_25_4" id="target_note_LCL491_25_4"><sup>4</sup></a> requiring less work. I just contribute the words, which I have in plenty.</p>

<p class="noindent">Although I have nothing to write to you, I write all the same because I feel that I am talking to you. Nicias and Valerius are with me here. Today I am expecting your morning letter. Perhaps there will be another in the afternoon, unless you are busy with Epirotic documents, which I should not wish to interrupt. I am sending you letters to Marcianus and Montanus. Would you please put them in the same package, unless you have already dispatched it?</p>
