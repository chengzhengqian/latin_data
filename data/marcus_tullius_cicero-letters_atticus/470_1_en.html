<h2>244 (XII.7)</h2>
<h2><span class="italic">Tusculum (?), October (?) (by the sun) 46</span></h2>
<h2><span class="ac">Cicero to Atticus</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">I have put down all the items you desire on tablets and given them to Eros—briefly, but more in fact than you ask, including something about Marcus.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL097_271_1" id="target_note_LCL097_271_1"><sup>1</sup></a> You started me thinking about this. I spoke to him in a very liberal way—you might ask the boy himself about this, that is if you conveniently can. Still, why put it off? I explained that you had brought to my notice both his wishes and his wants: that he wished to go to Spain<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL097_271_2" id="target_note_LCL097_271_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and wanted a handsome allowance. As to the latter I said I would give him as much as P. Lentulus or Flamen Lentulus gave their sons. On Spain I made two comments. The first I had already made to you, that I was afraid of public censure. People might ask whether it was not enough that we had abandoned the struggle, without enlisting on the other side. Then I urged that it would be mortifying for him to find himself outdone by his cousin in friendly contacts and general consideration. I would rather he availed himself even to excess of <span class="italic">my</span> liberality than of his own liberty. However I gave my leave, as I had gathered that you were not too much opposed to the idea. I shall think about it further and would be glad if you would do likewise. It is no light matter, and the straightforward thing is for him to stay; the other has both pros and cons. However, we shall see.</p>
<p>I wrote about Balbus in the tablets, and I propose so to do, as soon as he gets back. But if he delays, I shall come all the same in three days’ time and, as I forgot to mention, Dolabella with me.</p>
