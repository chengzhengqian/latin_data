in truth the reminders will be no more poignant than those which harass me day and night. Is literature then no use, you may ask. In this case I’m afraid it actually makes the other way, for without it I should perhaps be harder. In a cultivated mind there is nothing coarse or callous.</p>
<p>Well then, you’ll do as you say—but not if it is inconvenient. After all a couple of letters will do the trick. And if it proves necessary I’ll come to you. So that shall be as you can manage.</p>

<p class="noindent">As regards Mustela, it is as you say; though it’s a big undertaking. So I incline more and more towards Clodia. In either case however we must see what can be done about my claim on Faberius. It won’t do any mischief if you have a word with Balbus and tell him, what is the fact, that I want to buy and cannot without this money and dare not while the matter hangs in the air. But when will Clodia be in Rome and how much do you estimate it will cost? I am definitely looking that way, not that I shouldn’t prefer the other, but it’s a big thing and it’s hard to compete with a rich man, eager to buy and an heir to the estate—though so far as eagerness goes, I shall yield to nobody. In other respects I am at a disadvantage. But we shall discuss all this together.</p>
