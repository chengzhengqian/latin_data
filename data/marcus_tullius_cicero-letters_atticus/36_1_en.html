There is at any rate one good thing in this bad business of Quintus’ estrangement and dudgeon, I mean that I and your other friends know from statements of your own made some time beforehand of your inclination to say no to the province, so that your not being together won’t be attributed to any difference or rift between you but to your own inclination and decision. Well then, so far as you and Quintus are concerned, trespasses shall be made good; while <span class="italic">our</span> friendship has been preserved inviolate and shall remain as sacred as ever.</p>
<p>The state of the commonwealth in which we live here is weak and sad and unstable. I suppose you have heard that our friends the Knights have pretty well broken with the Senate. To begin with they were greatly annoyed by the promulgation under a senatorial decree of a bill providing for an investigation into the conduct of jurors guilty of taking bribes.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL007_99_1" id="target_note_LCL007_99_1"><sup>1</sup></a> I happened to be absent when the decree was voted. Aware that the equestrian order took it amiss, though they said nothing in public, I administered what I felt to be a highly impressive rebuke to the Senate, speaking with no little weight and fluency in a not very respectable cause. Now along come the Knights with another fancy, really almost insupportable—and I have not only borne with it but lent it my eloquence. The farmers who bought the Asiatic taxes from the Censors complained in the Senate that they had been led by overeagerness into making too high an offer and asked for the cancellation of their contract. I was their foremost supporter, or rather foremost but one, for it was Crassus who egged them on to make such an audacious demand. An invidious business! The demand was disgraceful, a confession of recklessness. </p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL007_99_1"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL007_99_1" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">1</sup>Knights (unlike Senators) enjoyed legal immunity from prosecutions for judicial corruption.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL007_99_1').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
