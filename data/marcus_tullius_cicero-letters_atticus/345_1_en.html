Accordingly I shall follow your advice and not hide myself away in Arpinum at present, though I wanted to give Marcus his white gown in Arpinum and that was the excuse I intended to leave with Caesar. But perhaps he will take offence at that too, because I am not doing it in Rome. But anyhow, if I must meet him, let itbe here.
