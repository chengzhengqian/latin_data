<p>I have not buried myself down at Pompeii as I wrote that I should, partly because the weather is abominable, partly because I get letters every day from Octavian urging me to put my shoulder to the wheel, come to Capua, save the Republic a second time, and at all events return to Rome at once. ‘Durst not refuse for shame, for fear accept.’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_355_14" id="target_note_LCL491_355_14"><sup>14</sup></a> He has certainly shown, and continues to show, plenty of energy, and he will go to Rome with a large following; but he is very much a boy. Thinks the Senate will meet at once. Who will come? And who, supposing he comes, will run up against Antony in so uncertain a situation? On the Kalends of January he may be some protection; or perhaps the issue will be fought out before then. The boy is remarkably popular in the towns. On his way to Samnium he passed through Cales and stayed the night at Teanum. Amazing receptions and demonstrations of encouragement. Would you have thought it? For this reason I shall return to Rome sooner than I had intended. I shall write as soon as I decide definitely.</p>

Otherwise he should have sent me the names.</p>
