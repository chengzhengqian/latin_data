<section class="div1 language" lang="en"><header><hgroup><h1>Letters to Atticus</h1></hgroup></header><section class="div2"><p class="noindent">Brutus is only too willing to accept some loss? That he had 4 percent in the bond? That was not possible, and even if it had been, <span class="italic">I</span> could not have tolerated it. To be sure I hear that Scaptius is sorry now. As for his statement that a senatorial decree ordered judgement to be given in accordance with the bond, it was passed only because the Salaminians had broken the lex Gabinia in borrowing the money, which law prohibited judicial cognizance of money so borrowed. Therefore the Senate decreed that judgement be given according to this bond. It now has the same legal status as any other, no more, no less. I think I shall satisfy Brutus that I have acted correctly in this matter. As to yourself I don’t know, but I shall certainly satisfy Cato.</p>
<p>But now to return to yourself. Do you really mean it, Atticus, you, the encomiast of my fastidious rectitude? ‘This hast thou dared from thine own lips,’ as Ennius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_141_12" id="target_note_LCL008_141_12"><sup>12</sup></a> says, to ask me to give Scaptius mounted troops to extract the money? You tell me it sometimes chafes you that you are not here beside me. Well, supposing you <span class="italic">were</span> with me, would you let me do that if I wanted? ‘Not more than fifty’ you say. There were fewer with Spartacus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_141_13" id="target_note_LCL008_141_13"><sup>13</sup></a> to begin with. What damage would they not have done in so vulnerable an island? I say ‘would they not have done’; I should rather say ‘what did they not do, before I came on the scene?’ They kept the Salaminian senate shut up in their senate house for so many days that some of them starved to death. For Scaptius was Appius’ Prefect and had troops of horse from him. Well then, are <span class="italic">you</span>, whose face I do assure you is in my mind’s eye whenever I contemplate any right and creditable act, are <span class="italic">you</span> asking me to make Scaptius a Prefect? I had already made a rule not to appoint any businessman and Brutus approves of it. Troops of horse for that </p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL008_141_12"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL008_141_12" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">12</sup><span class="italic">Annals</span> 578 (Vahlen).</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL008_141_12').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note inline" id="note_LCL008_141_13"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL008_141_13" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">13</sup>Leader of the great Italian slave rebellion in the late seventies.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL008_141_13').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
