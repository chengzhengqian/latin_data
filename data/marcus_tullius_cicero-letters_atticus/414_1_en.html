unconcerned about it. But when Q. Axius does not repay me in this exile of mine the HS 12,000 I lent his son and pleads hard times, when Lepta and the rest do the like, I cannot help feeling surprised when I hear him say that he is being pressed about a matter of HS 20,000. You must see how tight things are. None the less he is giving categorical instructions to have you paid. Do you think him sticky or close about this sort of thing? No one could be less so. Well, thatâ€™s enough about my brother.</p>
<p>As for his son, he has always been indulged by his father, but indulgence does not make a boy untruthful or grasping or wanting in natural affection, though it may make him headstrong, overbearing, and aggressive. Accordingly he has these faults too, the products of over-indulgence, but they are tolerable, at least I suppose I may call them so, young people being what they are nowadays. But the qualities that cause me, fond of him as I am, more pain even than the miseries of our present condition do not arise from any compliance on our part. They have their own roots. No doubt I should tear them up if I had the opportunity. But the times are such that I must put up with all. I have no difficulty with my own boy, who is the most tractable of beings. It is out of pity for him that I have hitherto taken a weaker line, and the more positive he wants me to be the more I am afraid of proving an unkind father.</p>
<p>However Antony arrived yesterday evening. Presently perhaps he will call on me, or perhaps not even that as he has notified his wishes in writing. But you shall know the upshot at once. I shall now do nothing except by stealth. What am I to do about the boys? If I trust their lives to a small boat, how do you think I shall feel during the voyage?</p>
