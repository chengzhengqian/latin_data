Lepidus and Tullus, they have quite made up their minds to meet Caesar and take their seats in the Senate.</p>
<p>The most recent of the batch was dispatched on the Kalends, in which you pray for a meeting and do not despair of peace. But at the time I write I donâ€™t think they will meet, or that if they do Pompey will agree to any terms. You seem to be in no doubt what I ought to do if the Consuls cross the water. Well, they are certainly crossing, or as things now stand have crossed already. But remember that except for Appius there is practically no one among them not legally entitled to go overseas, being either in military command, like Pompey, Scipio, Sufenas, Fannius, Voconius, Sestius, and the Consuls themselves, who by ancient custom have the right to visit any province they please, or else Legates of these. But I am not postponing the issue. I see what you favour and what, broadly speaking, is right.</p>
<p>I should write more if I could write myself. However I think I shall be able to do so in a couple of days. I am - sending you a copy of a letter from Cornelius Balbus which I received the same day as I dispatched your letter to you, so you can be sorry for me when you see how I am mocked.</p>

<p class="noindent">I beg you, dear Cicero, put your thoughts and concern upon a design eminently worthy of your character, I mean the restitution of the old happy relations between Caesar and Pompey, now that intriguers have set them at variance.</p>
