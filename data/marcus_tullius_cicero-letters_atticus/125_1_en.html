<section class="div1 language" lang="en"><header><hgroup><h1>Letters to Atticus</h1></hgroup></header><section class="div2"><p class="noindent">let them only put <span class="italic">something</span> through, never mind what. I shall be satisfied with a single clause recalling me, provided only the thing be done. Already I feel ashamed to be writing at such length, and I fear that by the time you read this the matter may already have been given up as a bad job. In that case my solicitude will seem pitiable to you and ludicrous to others. But if there is anything left to hope for, take a look at the law which Visellius drafted for T. Fadius. It seems admirable to me. Sestius’ draft, which you say you approve of, I don’t like.</p>
<p>The third letter was dispatched on 12 November. In it you explain, knowledgeably and carefully, the factors which you think are holding matters back, covering Crassus, Pompey, and the rest. If therefore any hope emerges of carrying the business through by the support of the honest men, by influence, by a crowd brought up for the purpose, I beg you to try for a breakthrough at a single push. Put your heart into the effort and rouse the others. But if, as I see to be the case on your forecast and my own too, there is <span class="italic">no</span> hope, I beg and adjure you to care for my poor brother Quintus, whom I have ruined, unlucky wretch that I am. Don’t let him take any decision concerning himself which might be to the injury of your nephew. Protect my Marcus as far as you can. Poor little boy, I am leaving him nothing but my hated and dishonoured name. Support Terentia with your good offices: no woman ever had so much to bear.</p>
<p>I shall go to Epirus when I get news of the first few days. Please write to me in your next letter how the opening moves go.</p>
<p>Dispatched 29 November.</p>
