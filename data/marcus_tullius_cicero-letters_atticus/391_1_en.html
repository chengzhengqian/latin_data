<p class="noindent">I have really nothing to write, but there are a few things I should still like to know, namely whether he<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL097_113_1_1" id="target_note_LCL097_113_1_1"><sup>1</sup></a> has set out, in what state he has left Rome, in Italy too whom he has put in charge of the various districts and jobs, whether any peace envoys to Pompey and the Consuls have been appointed under the Senate’s decree. Anxious to learn these points I am sending this letter to you by special messenger. So I shall be grateful if you will kindly inform me about them and anything else I ought to know. I am waiting at Arcanum until I get your news.</p>

But I am waiting to hear from you, though I don’t quite see now <span class="italic">what</span> Iam waiting to hear; but all the same, even if you have nothing to tell me, please write and say so.</p>
<p>Caesar writes in forgiveness of my nonattendance and says he is not in the least offended on that account. No
