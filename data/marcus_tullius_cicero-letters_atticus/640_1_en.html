<p>Tiro and have summoned himself. It is most kind of you to promise that Marcus will not go short. Messalla, who is on his way back and came over from Lanuvium from them to me, brought a splendid report of him. And really his own letter is so affectionately and classically written that I should not mind reading it before an audience. This makes me the more inclined to indulge him. I think Sestius won’t be too much upset about Bucilianus.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_263_10a" id="target_note_LCL491_263_10a"><sup>10</sup></a> As soon as Tiro joins me I propose to go to Tusculum. Please send me word straight away of anything I ought to know.</p>

<p class="noindent">15 June. I think I have already explained sufficiently what I need and what I want you to do, if convenient to yourself. All the same, now that I have set out (I am just crossing the lake<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_263_1" id="target_note_LCL491_263_1"><sup>1</sup></a>), I have decided that Tiro should be sent to you so that he can take part in the affairs on hand. I have also written to Dolabella to say that, with his approval, I should like to leave and asking about baggage mules.</p>
<p>As best you can in the present circumstances, since I understand you are up to your eyes in work both in connection with Buthrotum and with Brutus, for in addition to other things I suspect that the care and management of his games is devolving upon you to a great extent—well then, as best you can in such circumstances, please spare me a little time; not much is required. Things seem to me
