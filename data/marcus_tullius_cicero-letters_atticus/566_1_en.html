your nephew of which I am sending you the original. It starts offensively enough, but perhaps he did not stop to think—anyway it reads thus: ‘For my part, whatever ugly things can be said against you . . .’ He implies that many ugly things <span class="italic">can</span> be said, but says he does not agree with them. Could anything be more outrageous? You will read the rest—I am sending you the letter—and judge. I suppose the constant eulogies of myself in which our friend Brutus, as a great many people have reported to me, daily indulges have provoked him to write something to me at long last, and to you also, I imagine—please let me know. What he has written about me to his father I don’t know, but isn’t this a dutiful way to write about his mother? ‘I desired,’ he says, ‘in order to be with you as much as possible, that a house should be rented for me and wrote to you accordingly. You took no notice. So we shall see less of one another, for I cannot stand the sight of <span class="italic">your</span> house. The reason you know.’ This reason, according to his father, is his dislike of his mother.</p>
<p>Now, my dear fellow, help me with your advice, ‘whether by honesty the loftier tower,’ i.e. whether I should openly rebuff the fellow and spurn him off, or ‘by crooked wiles.’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_115_2" id="target_note_LCL491_115_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Like Pindar’s, ‘my mind’s divided; which way declare the truth?’ The former best suits my character to be sure, but perhaps the latter best fits the times.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_115_3" id="target_note_LCL491_115_3"><sup>3</sup></a> However, you may take it that whatever you recommend to yourself is fully accepted by me. <span class="italic">My</span> chief fear is of being caught at Tusculum. In the crowd it would all be less awkward. Shall I wait at Astura? But what if Caesar should arrive without warning? Pray help me with your advice. I shall follow your ruling.</p>
