<p>I petitioned Caesar to recall Sex. Cloelius from exile, and gained my point. I had intended even then to take advantage of his favour only if you gave your consent. So I am all the more anxious to gain your sanction to my doing it through my own agency now. If however you show yourself unsympathetic towards his sad, unhappy case, I shall not persist in opposition to your wishes, although I feel I have a duty to uphold Caesar’s memorandum. But I must say that if you wish to take a view in accordance with humanity, wisdom, and a regard for myself, you will surely show yourself indulgent, and you will be willing for P. Claudius,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_175_1" id="target_note_LCL491_175_1"><sup>1</sup></a> a lad of the highest promise, to think that you refrained from bearing hard upon his father’s friends when it lay in your power. Allow it, I beg you, to appear that you were his father’s enemy for patriotic reasons, not because you despised the family. We lay aside feuds started on public grounds with greater credit and more readiness than those of arrogance. Further, give me the opportunity to influence the boy here and now and persuade his impressionable mind to the opinion that quarrels should not be hereditary. Although I am sure that your position, dear Sir, is beyond all danger, I imagine none the less that you would rather pass your declining years in tranquillity and honour than amid anxieties. Finally, I have some right to ask this favour of you, for I have done all I could on your behalf. But if I fail to obtain it, I shall not make the concession to Cloelius on my own. I hope you will see from this how much your approval means to me, and show yourself the more placable on that account.</p>
