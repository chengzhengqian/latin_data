You further asked him to leave an adequate garrison in Capua. On reading this I conceived, as did everyone else, that you intended to march on Corfinium with your entire force, and I did not think it would be safe for me to travel there with Caesar encamped before the town.</p>
<p>At the height of our suspense news arrived simultaneously of the outcome at Corfinium on the one hand and on the other that you had set out for Brundisium. Neither I nor my brother thought twice about pressing on to Brundisium, until we were advised by many persons coming from Samnium and Apulia to beware of falling into Caesarâ€™s hands, since he had started for the same area that we were making for and might be expected to reach his destination even more rapidly than we could do. In these circumstances neither I nor my brother nor any of our friends thought it right to run the risk of injuring the state as well as ourselves by our own imprudence, particularly as we felt sure that even if the journey had been safe for us it was now too late for us to catch up with you.</p>
