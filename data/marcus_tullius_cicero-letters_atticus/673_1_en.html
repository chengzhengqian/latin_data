<p class="noindent">So far (I have now reached Sicca’s place at Vibo) my voyage has been comfortable rather than strenuous, by oar in large part. No sign of the seasonable northerly gales. We were in luck to cross both the two bays we had to cross (of Paestum and of Vibo) with sheets level. So I arrived at Sicca’s a week after leaving Pompeii, having stopped for one day at Velia, where I had a very pleasant time at our friend Talna’s<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_329_1" id="target_note_LCL491_329_1"><sup>1</sup></a> house. My reception, particularly as he was away, could not have been more handsome. So to Sicca’s on the 24th. Here of course it is like being in my own home, so I am swallowing up the next day as well.

I shall write to you on
