<p class="noindent">There’s a Laconian dispatch for you! To be sure I shall lie in wait for him—he is coming on the evening of the 3rd, i.e. today, so perhaps he will call on me tomorrow. I shall sound him, listen to him. I shall say that I am in no hurry, that I shall send to Caesar. I shall act by stealth and conceal myself somewhere with a very few companions. At all events I shall escape from here, however much they want to stop me, and I only hope it will be to Curio. Mark my words.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL097_155_2" id="target_note_LCL097_155_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Intense vexation has been added to my other motives. I shall bring off something worthy of myself.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL097_155_3" id="target_note_LCL097_155_3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>I am much concerned about your strangury. Do, I beg of you, treat it while it is in the early stages. I am glad to hear from you about Massilia.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL097_155_4" id="target_note_LCL097_155_4"><sup>4</sup></a> Pray let me know whatever news comes your way. I should much like to take Ocella if I could travel openly, as I had arranged with Curio. I am waiting for Servius here; his wife and son ask me, and I think I ought. But this worthy here<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL097_155_5" id="target_note_LCL097_155_5"><sup>5</sup></a> is carrying Cytheris around with him in an open litter, a second wife. Seven other litters are attached, containing mistresses; and there are some containing <span class="italic">friends</span>. Look at the shame of the death we are dying and doubt if you can that Caesar will institute a massacre when he returns, victor or vanquished. I shall snatch myself from the clutches of these criminals in a rowing boat if I cannot get a ship. But I’ll write more when I have met him.</p>
