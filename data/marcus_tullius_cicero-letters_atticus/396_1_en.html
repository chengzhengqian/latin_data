<p>When I asked for his assessment—what way out, what constitution he foresaw—he frankly admitted that the situation is quite hopeless. He is afraid of Pompey’s fleet. If it put to sea (?) he said he would leave Sicily. ‘What about those six fasces of yours?’ I asked. ‘If they are from the Senate why the laurels? If from the great man, why six?’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL097_123_5" id="target_note_LCL097_123_5"><sup>5</sup></a> Answer: ‘I wanted to get them by a snap decree of the Senate—it was impossible otherwise. But Caesar hates the Senate now far more than ever. “Everything shall come from me” is his motto.’ ‘But why six?’ ‘Because I didn’t want twelve.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL097_123_6" id="target_note_LCL097_123_6"><sup>6</sup></a> I could have had them.’ Then I remarked: ‘How I wish I had asked for the permission<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL097_123_7" id="target_note_LCL097_123_7"><sup>7</sup></a> which I hear he has given to Philippus! But I did not like to because I was giving nothing to him.’ ‘He would have let you have it gladly’ said Curio. ‘But take it as granted. I shall write to him in terms approved by yourself that you and I have discussed the matter between us. After all, since you don’t come to the Senate, what does it matter to him where you are? Indeed you would have done his cause least harm just now if you had not been in Italy.’ To this I rejoined that I wanted retirement and solitude, especially because I had my lictors. He applauded my plan. ‘What about it then?’ I said. ‘My way to Greece lies through your province, since there are troops stationed on the Adriatic.’ ‘Nothing I should like better’ said he. On this topic he spoke at length and very handsomely. So there is this much gained, that I shall sail not only without risk but without concealment.</p>
