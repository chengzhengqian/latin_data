<p>It does not look as though Caesar will be at Athens by the Kalends of September. Many things are said to be holding him up in Asia, Pharnaces especially. The Twelfth legion, the first approached by Sulla, is said to have driven that worthy off with volleys of stones. Itâ€™s thought that none of them will move. Caesar was expected to go from Patrae direct to Sicily, but if this is true he will have to come this way. I should have preferred the other, for I should then have found some way of escaping from here. As it is, I am afraid I shall have to wait, and my poor girl will have to put up with the unhealthiness of the locality along with her other troubles.</p>
<p>You advise me to suit my behaviour to the time. I should, if the case allowed it and it was by any means practicable. But what with my own errors and the grave injuries done me by my own family, I can neither do nor feign anything worthy of myself. You compare the Sullan regime. In that all was basically admirable, though temper and moderation were somewhat lacking. The present government on the other hand is such that I find myself forgetting my own case and far preferring an outcome beneficial to the world<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL097_257_1" id="target_note_LCL097_257_1"><sup>1</sup></a> rather than to those with whose interests I have associated my own. All the same I should be grateful if you would write to me as often as you can, all the more so as nobody else writes; and even if they all did, yours are the letters to which I should most look forward. You write that Caesar will be readier to pardon Quintus on my account. I have already told you that he gave young Quintus everything he asked straight away, and that there was no mention of myself. Good-bye.</p>
