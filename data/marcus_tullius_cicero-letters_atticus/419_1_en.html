First he slept till 9 o’clock. Then, being informed that the bodies from Naples and Cumae (with whom Caesar is annoyed) had arrived, he told them to come back next day, as he wanted to take a bath and <span class="italic">satisfaire à ses besoins.</span> This was yesterday’s achievement. Today he has arranged to cross over to Aenaria to promise the exiles their recall. But enough of all this, and to our own concerns!</p>
<p>I have had a letter from Axius. Thanks about Tiro. I am Vettienus’ good friend. I have given Vestorius your letter. Servius is said to have spent the night of 6 May at Minturnae and to be staying this evening with C. Marcellus near Liternum. So he will see me in good time tomorrow and will provide me with material for a letter to you—I have now quite run out of topics. I am surprised that Antony has not so much as sent me a message, particularly as he has been most attentive to me in the past. I suppose he has either received some drastic orders concerning me or else does not want to refuse to my face what I had no intention of asking and would not have trusted if I had obtained it. I shall think of something or other none the less.</p>
<p>Pray let me know if anything happens in Spain. The news may soon be out, and everyone is waiting for it under the impression that if things go right the job is as good as done. I myself do not think that all will be over if Spain is held or that everything is lost if Spain goes. I imagine that Silius and Ocella and the rest have been delayed. I see that you too are held up by *, though I believe you have a passport (?).</p>
