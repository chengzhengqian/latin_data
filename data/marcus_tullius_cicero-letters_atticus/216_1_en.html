Matinius.’ He recommends them to me and adds by way of extra stimulus that he had gone surety for them for a large sum. I had arranged for payment by the debtors with interest calculated at 1 percent per month for * years, interest to be added to the principal annually. Scaptius however demanded 4 percent. I was afraid if I let him have it you yourself would turn against me. It would have meant departing from my edict and utterly ruining a community which was under Cato’s and Brutus’ own patronage<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_111_3" id="target_note_LCL008_111_3"><sup>3</sup></a> and on which I had conferred favours.</p>
