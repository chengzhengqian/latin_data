<p>I am sending you back young Quintus’ letter. What a heart of flint you must have to be unmoved by his perils! He complains of me too—I am sending you the letter with yours (?). The other one about the campaign I take to be a duplicate. I am sending a courier to Cumae today, and have given him your letter to Vestorius which you dispatched by Pharnaces.</p>

<p class="noindent">Please have the letters sent on to Oppius and Balbus. All the same (?), if you see Piso anywhere, speak to him about the gold.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_37_1" id="target_note_LCL491_37_1"><sup>1</sup></a> If Faberius comes, please see that the claims assigned, if any <span class="italic">are</span> assigned, equal in value the amount owed. You will get the figure from Eros.</p>
<p>Ariarathes, son of Ariobarzanes, is coming to Rome. I imagine he wants to buy a kingdom from Caesar, for as things now stand he has not a foot of ground to call his own. Our friend Sestius, the public purveyor,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_37_2" id="target_note_LCL491_37_2"><sup>2</sup></a> has snapped him up, which is quite all right with me. All the same, as I have a close connexion with his brother arising out of a signal service rendered by me,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_37_3" id="target_note_LCL491_37_3"><sup>3</sup></a> I am writing to invite him to stay overnight with me. As I am sending Alexander for that purpose, I give him this letter.</p>
