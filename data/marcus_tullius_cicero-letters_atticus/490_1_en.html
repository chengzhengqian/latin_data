<h2><span class="ac">Cicero to Atticus</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">Sicca has written to me fully about Silius and says he has put you in the picture, which your letter confirms. Both the purchase itself and the terms suit me, only I should prefer to pay in cash rather than by valuation. Silius will not want luxury properties, and while I can make do with my present revenues I can hardly manage with less. Where then is the cash to come from? Well, you will squeeze HS 600,000 out of Hermogenes,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL097_311_1" id="target_note_LCL097_311_1"><sup>1</sup></a> especially as the money will be needed; and I see I have HS 600,000 in hand. For the remainder we mustn’t mind paying interest to Silius until we pay cash with what comes from Faberius or some debtor of Faberius.’ And there will be the odd windfall. But you will handle the whole affair. I certainly put the property far above Drusus’; they have never been regarded as comparable. Believe me I have only one motive, and I know that Iam <span class="italic">entêté</span> over it. But indulge this aberration of mine, as you are doing. As to your talk of a retreat <span class="italic">pour ma vieillesse</span>, that’s all over and done with. I have other objects in mind.</p>
