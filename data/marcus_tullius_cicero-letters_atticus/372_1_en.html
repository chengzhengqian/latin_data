there is no more recent authority than Dolabella and none better, in this matter anyway.</p>
<p>I received a letter from you on the 22nd, in which you put off all plans until the time when we know what has happened. And certainly you are right, nothing can be decided or even considered in the meanwhile—though this letter of Dolabella’s sends me back to my earlier ideas. For the weather was excellent on the 18th, and I expect he has taken advantage of it.</p>
<p>My <span class="italic">recueil</span> of your advice was not made in any spirit of recrimination but rather for my own comfort. The evils of the time distressed me less than the suspicion of fault and thoughtlessness on my own part. Of this I acquit myself, since my actions and plans accord with your counsels. You write that if I appear so greatly indebted to Pompey it is more because of my own public acknowledgements than through his deserts. That is true. I have always made much of them, all the more because he might otherwise have supposed that I had some memory of what went before. However well I remembered that, I ought now to follow the pattern then set. He did not help me when he might; but afterwards he stood my friend, very much so even, I do not quite know why. Very well, I shall stand his. And there is another resemblance between us; we have both been taken in by the same set of people.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL097_75_2" id="target_note_LCL097_75_2"><sup>2</sup></a> But I only wish it had been in my power to help him as much as he could have helped me. Still for what he did I am truly thankful. And yet I don’t know how I can help him now, nor even if I could should I feel that he <span class="italic">ought</span> to be helped in preparing so baleful a war. It is simply that I do not want to hurt his feelings by remaining here, nor, be it added, could I bear to witness all that you can already see coming or be present </p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL097_75_2"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL097_75_2" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">2</sup>The optimates.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL097_75_2').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
