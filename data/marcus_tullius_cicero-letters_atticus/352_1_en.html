Yes, but against my own judgement and all ancient authority, nor is it so much to help there as to spare myself the sight of things here that I am anxious to leave. For take my word for it that the excesses of the men on the spot will be various and intolerable. But you must be well aware of all this—that after the subversion of laws, law courts, and Senate neither private wealth nor common can satisfy the lusts, impudence, extravagance, and necessities of such a multitude of starvelings. So let’s away from it all, by any sailing that offers—though that shall be as you think best; but at all events let’s away. We shall soon know what has happened at Brundisium, which is what you are waiting for.</p>
<p>You say that the honest men approve of my conduct thus far and know that I had good reason for not leaving. I am very glad to hear that, if one can be glad at anything nowadays. I shall make more thorough enquiries about Lentulus. I have entrusted that commission to Philotimus, a man of mettle and an ultra-optimate.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL097_35_4" id="target_note_LCL097_35_4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>To end, it may be that you no longer have a theme for a letter, for one can’t write about anything else at the present time and what more can one find to say about this? But since you have both wit (I say as I think, you can be sure) and affection, which stimulates even <span class="italic">my</span> wits, carry on and write as much as you can.</p>
<p>I feel a little aggrieved that you don’t invite me to Epirus, not being the most difficult of company. But goodbye. You to your exercise and massage, I to bed. And indeed your letter has brought sleep to my eyes.</p>
