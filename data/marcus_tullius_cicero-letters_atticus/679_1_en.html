I am sending you the speech,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_341_1" id="target_note_LCL491_341_1"><sup>1</sup></a> to be kept back and put out at your discretion. But when shall we see the day when you will think proper to publish it? The truce you write of seems to me impracticable. The better course is to make no rejoinder and I think I shall follow it. You say that two legions have arrived at Brundisium. You people get all the news first. So please let me know whatever you hear.</p>
<p>I am expecting Varro’s dialogue. I don’t reject the idea of writing something <span class="italic">à la Héraclide,</span> especially as you are so taken with it, but I should like to know what sort of thing you have in mind. As I wrote to you before (or rather <span class="italic">previously,</span> since you so prefer), if I may tell you the truth, you have made me keener to write. For to your own opinion of my work, which I already knew, you have added Peducaeus’ authority which counts for much with me—none weightier. I shall do my best not to fail you by any lack of conscientious industry.</p>
<p>Yes, I am cultivating Vettienus and Faberius. I don’t think Cloelius means any mischief, although—but let him do what he likes. About retaining one’s personal freedom, which is assuredly one of the most precious things in life, I am of your mind. To treat Caninius Gallus so!

And canny enough myself, though not as much so as I might be!</p>
<p>I have answered the longer and earlier letter. Coming now to the shorter and later one, what can I say except that it gave me the greatest pleasure? Affairs in Spain are highly satisfactory, only provided that I get dear young Balbus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_341_3" id="target_note_LCL491_341_3"><sup>3</sup></a>
