<p>In the political part of your letter there is both affection and wisdom in what you say, and your argument squares pretty well with my own ideas. Clearly I must not retreat from the high position I have taken up, nor must I enter somebody else’s lines without support, and the person of whom you write<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL007_121_1" id="target_note_LCL007_121_1"><sup>1</sup></a> <span class="italic">is</span> without largeness and loftiness of view, entirely given over to a mean pursuit of popularity. All the same I had my policy—a policy not perhaps without its advantages for me personally, as tending to give me a quiet life, but I really believe far more advantageous to the state than to myself; namely, to check the onslaughts of rascally citizens upon myself by strengthening the mind of one who stands preeminent in fortune, prestige, and influence, and turning him away from the hopes of wicked men to become an encomiast of my record. If that had involved any sacrifice of principle, I should not have thought anything worth such a price; but I have so managed throughout that instead of <span class="italic">my</span> losing respect by appearing to flatter him <span class="italic">he</span> has gained it by approving me. As for the future, I am so acting and shall continue so to act as to run no risk of having my achievements attributed to chance. Far from deserting those honest men of mine to whom you refer and the Sparta<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL007_121_2" id="target_note_LCL007_121_2"><sup>2</sup></a> which you say has fallen to my lot, I shall stay loyal to my old views even if Sparta deserts <span class="italic">me</span>. But I should like you to realize that since Catulus died I have been holding to this optimate road without supporters or companions. As Rhinton (I think) has it, ‘Some count for nothing, others nothing care.’ I shall write to you some other time about the jealousy towards me of our fish fancying friends, or reserve it for our meeting. But nothing shall separate me from the House, because that is the right </p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL007_121_1"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL007_121_1" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">1</sup>Pompey.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL007_121_1').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note inline" id="note_LCL007_121_2"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL007_121_2" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">2</sup>Atticus had quoted a Greek saying: ‘Sparta is your portion, make the most of it.’ Here Sparta symbolizes the cause of the optimates.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL007_121_2').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
