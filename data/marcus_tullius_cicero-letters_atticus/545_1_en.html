<p class="noindent">Stirred by what you wrote to me in your letter about Varro I have taken the whole Academy from highly aristocratic personages and transferred it to our friend; and from two books I have put it into four. They are bigger than the old ones, yet I have removed a good deal. But I should be very glad if you would tell me how you gathered that he would like it; one thing at any rate I am anxious to know, whom, according to what you gathered, he is jealous of—unless perhaps it’s Brutus. That would really be the last straw! All the same I should very much like to know. As for the work, unless my share of <span class="italic">amour propre</span> deceives me, it has turned out better than anything in its genre now existing, even in Greek. I am sure you will take a philosophical view of the waste of your copyists’ labour on the treatise on Academic doctrine which you already have. This one will be far finer, more concise, better.</p>
<p>Just now I am at my wits’ end. I should like to produce something for Dolabella, who greatly wants it, but I can’t think what, and at the same time ‘I fear the Trojans.’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_73_1" id="target_note_LCL491_73_1"><sup>1</sup></a> And even if I give him something different,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL491_73_2" id="target_note_LCL491_73_2"><sup>2</sup></a> I shan’t be able to evade criticism. So I must either rest on my oars or think something up.</p>
<p>But why trouble about these trifles? Tell me, I beg you, how is my dear Attica? I am terribly worried about her. But I keep resampling your letter and find comfort in it. However I expect a new one.</p>
<p>Brinnius’ freedman, my coheir, has written to me that the heirs would like himself and Albius Sabinus to visit me </p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL491_73_1"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL491_73_1" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">1</sup>See Letter 25, note 2.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL491_73_1').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL491_73_2"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL491_73_2" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">2</sup>I.e., apparently, from the political tract which he had thought of; see Letter 318.2.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL491_73_2').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
