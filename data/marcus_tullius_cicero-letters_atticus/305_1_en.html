Sosius the Praetor arrived at my house at Formiae to see my neighbour M’. Lepidus, under whom he served as Quaestor. He brought a copy of Pompey’s letter to the Consuls:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line indent2">I have received a letter from L. Domitius on 17 February,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">a copy of which I append. As matters now</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">stand I know that you will realize for yourself without</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">any letter from me how important it is for the</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">public interest that all forces should be concentrated</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">at the earliest possible moment. You will take</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">steps, if you see fit, to join us as soon as possible,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">leaving in Capua as large a garrison as you and your</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">colleague judge to be sufficient.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p></blockquote>
<p>He then appended a copy of Domitius’ letter which I sent you yesterday. Gods above, I am shivering all over with suspense. What is going to happen? Still I am hopeful that there will be great power in our general’s name, great terror in his advent. I hope too that, since only cowardice and negligence have stood in our way hitherto, the present operation, which seems likely to be (?) conducted with resolution and energy and also let me add ∗ ∗ ∗</p>
<p>∗ ∗ ∗ for I have just heard that your quartan has left you. Hang me if I am not as delighted as if it had happened to me. Tell Pilia it is not fair that she should keep hers any longer, nor proper in so united a couple. I hear that Tiro has lost one of his. But I see he has been borrowing money outside to meet his expenses. I had asked our friend Curius to advance anything required. I would rather think the fault lies with Tiro’s bashfulness than with any stinginess on Curius’ part.</p>
