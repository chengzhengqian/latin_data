<section class="div1 language" lang="en"><header><hgroup><h1>Letters to Atticus</h1></hgroup></header><section class="div2"><p class="noindent"> Philotimus arrived at Rhodes the previous day bringing a letter for me. You will hear what Agusius himself has to say, but as he is making a rather leisurely journey I thought it best to give this to a fast traveller. What is in that letter I don’t know, but my brother offers me hearty congratulations. For my part, after the blunder I have committed, I cannot even imagine anything that could be tolerable to me.</p>
<p>I implore you to think about this poor girl, both as to the matter on which I wrote to you in my last letter, how to raise something to keep the wolf from her door, and also as to the will itself. I wish the other thing<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL097_247_2" id="target_note_LCL097_247_2"><sup>2</sup></a> too had been taken in hand sooner, but I was afraid of everything. Certainly there was no better choice among evils than divorce. That would have been doing something like a man—whether on the score of the debt cancellation or his nocturnal housebreakings<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL097_247_3" id="target_note_LCL097_247_3"><sup>3</sup></a> or Metella or the whole chapter of delinquencies. I should have saved the money and given some evidence of manly resentment. I remember your letters—but also the situation at the time; though anything would have been preferable. Now he seems to be threatening it on <span class="italic">his</span> side—I have heard about Clodius’ statue. To think that my son-in-law of all people should be advocating this or debt cancellation either! Accordingly I am in favour, and so are you, of sending notice of divorce. He may ask for the third instalment, so consider whether we should send the notice when he himself takes the initiative or before. If I possibly can, even if it means travelling at night, I shall try to see you. Please write to me about these matters and anything which it may be desirable for me to know. Good-bye.</p>
