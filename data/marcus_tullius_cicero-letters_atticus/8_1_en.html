<h2>7 (I.11)</h2>
<h2><span class="italic">Rome, August 67</span></h2>
<h2><span class="ac">Cicero to Atticus</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">I had been active of my own accord before, but your two very sedulous letters to the same purpose were a powerful stimulus. Add to that constant exhortation from Sallustius to do my utmost with Lucceius for the restoration of your old friendship. But after all I could do I have failed, not only to reestablish his former sentiments towards you but even to get out of him <span class="italic">why</span> his sentiments have changed. To be sure he flourishes that arbitration business of his and other grievances which I knew existed even before you left, but there must surely be something else which has taken deeper root in his mind, something that cannot so easily be removed either by your letters or by my ambassadorial effort as by yourself in person—not only what you say but your old familiar face; that is, if you think it worth the trouble, as you certainly will if you take my advice and don’t wish to belie your own good heart. You may think it odd that I seem so pessimistic now after writing to you earlier that I expected him to do as I told him. The fact is, you can hardly believe how much stiffer I find his attitude and more obstinate in this dudgeon. But your return will cure it, or else whichever is to blame will be the sufferer.</p>
<p>When you wrote in one of your letters that you supposed I was already elected you little knew the worries of a candidate in Rome at the present time, with all kinds of injustices to plague him. No one knows when the elections will take place. But you’ll hear all this from Philadelphus.</p>
