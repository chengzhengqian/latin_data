this is. I wrote back that I was in an even poorer way than when I told her I wanted to be alone, so I should prefer her not to come at present. I thought that if I did not reply at all she would come with her mama. Now I don’t think she will, as the letter was obviously not her own composition. But I also want to avoid what clearly <span class="italic">is</span> impending, a visit from the other two;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL097_325_1" id="target_note_LCL097_325_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and the only way to avoid it is to make myself scarce. A nuisance, but it has to be. Now I want you to find out just how long I can stay here without getting caught. You’ll go about it, to use your own word, gently.</p>
<p>Would you please propose to Marcus, that is if you think it not unreasonable, that he should balance his expenses abroad with my rents from the Argiletum and the Aventine, which would easily have been enough to content him if he had taken a house in Rome, as he had in mind; and having made that proposal, would you please yourself make all necessary arrangements as to how we are to supply him with the money he needs from these rents. I’ll guarantee that Bibulus or Acidinus or Messalla,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL097_325_2" id="target_note_LCL097_325_2"><sup>2</sup></a> who I hear are going to be in Athens, will not spend more than the proceeds of these rents. So would you kindly see who are the tenants and what they pay, and further that they are the kind of people to pay punctually, and what should be allowed in the way of travel expenses and outfit. There would certainly be no need for a pack animal in Athens, while for his use on the journey there are more in my stables than will be needed, as you too observe.</p>
