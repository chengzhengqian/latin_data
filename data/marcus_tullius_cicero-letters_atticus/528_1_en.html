<p class="noindent">Early on the 28th I received from Demea your letter dispatched the previous day, in which you give me to understand that I am to expect you either today or tomorrow. But I imagine that I, who am so looking forward to your coming, shall be the one to delay you. For I don’t suppose the Faberius business will be so straightforward, even supposing it takes place, as not to involve some delay. So come when you can.

Pilius, if I remember rightly, for HS 11,500,000. Of course everything has dropped now. But there is also the factor of anxiety to buy, in which except for Otho I think I shall have no rival.
