you would have done the same if the Gauls were coming? ‘House walls’ he might answer ‘don’t make the Republic.’ But altars and hearthstones do. ‘Themistocles did it.’ Yes, because one city could not stand against the tide of the whole barbarian world.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_229_4a" id="target_note_LCL008_229_4a"><sup>4</sup></a> But Pericles did not half a century later, though he held nothing except the town walls. Our own forebears still held the citadel after the rest of Rome was in enemy hands. ‘Such the brave tales we’ve heard of men of old.’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_229_5" id="target_note_LCL008_229_5"><sup>5</sup></a> And yet again, to judge from the indignation in the towns and the talk of the people who come my way, it looks as though this proceeding may achieve something after all. The public outcry is astonishing (whether so in Rome I do not know, but you will inform me) at the thought of the capital without magistrates or Senate. Finally the picture of Pompey on the run affects people marvellously. In a word, the case is altered. They are now against any concessions to Caesar. You must explain to me what all this adds up to.</p>
<p>I have a fairly quiet job to look after. Pompey wants me to exercise supervision over all this part of Campania and the sea coast, with general authority over recruiting, etc. I therefore expect to be moving about from place to place. I imagine that by now you see the direction of Caesar’s drive, the popular reaction, the state of the whole business. I hope you will write to me about these matters and as often as possible, since they won’t stand still. Both when writing to you and when reading what you write I feel calmer.</p>
