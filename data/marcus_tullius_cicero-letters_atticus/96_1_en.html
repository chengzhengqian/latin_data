He is a strange person, as you know, ‘crooked in mind and naught . . .’ But I am holding to the old maxim ‘To bear with rulers’. . .’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL007_219_1" id="target_note_LCL007_219_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Now your other crony Hortalus, how ungrudgingly and candidly and eloquently he lauded my merits to the stars in speaking of Flaccus’ Praetorship and the business of the Allobroges!<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL007_219_2" id="target_note_LCL007_219_2"><sup>2</sup></a> You can take my word for it that no one could have spoken in more friendly, flattering, and ample terms—and I very much hope you will write to him that I have told you so. But why should you write? I expect you are already on your way or nearly home after the appeal in my last letter.

I say less than I might because I hope we shall soon be able to discuss what we want together. Take care of your health.</p>
