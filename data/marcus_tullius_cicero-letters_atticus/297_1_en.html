the capital so now on not abandoning Italy I am putting my view on record. Clearly the plan is to concentrate all our forces at Luceria and not to make even that a firm point, but to prepare for flight from Luceria itself if we are pressed—so you may be the less surprised if I embark with reluctance in a cause in which there has at no time been any attempt to plan either peace or victory, but always infamous and disastrous flight. I must go, so that rather than appear to be at variance with the honest men I may meet whatever fate fortune brings in company with those who are so called. And yet I can see that Rome will soon be full of honest men, i.e. men of style and substance, full to bursting indeed when the townships here are given up. I should be one of them if I did not have these confounded nuisances of lictors, and I should not be ashamed to be in company with M’. Lepidus, L. Volcacius, and Ser. Sulpicius. None of them is more stupid than L. Domitius or more fickle than Ap. Claudius. Pompey alone counts with me, because of what he did for me, not because of the weight of his name. What weight after all could it carry in this cause? When all of us feared Caesar, Pompey was his friend; now that <span class="italic">he</span> has started to fear him he expects us all to be Caesar’s enemies. However I shall go to Luceria, and it may be that my coming won’t make him any happier, for I shall not be able to conceal my disapproval of what has been done so far.</p>
<p>If I could get any sleep I should not bore you with such long letters. If you are in the same case, I very much hope you will repay me in kind.</p>
