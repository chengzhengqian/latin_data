come and look at the empty husks of the real old Roman Republic we used to know. For example, come and see money distributed before the elections tribe by tribe, all in one place openly, see Gabinius acquitted, get the whiff of a Dictatorship in your nostrils, enjoy the public holiday and the universal free-for-all, behold my equanimity, my amusement, my contempt for Selicius’ 10 percent,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_23_2" id="target_note_LCL008_23_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and, yes, my delectable rapprochement with Caesar. That does give me some satisfaction, the one plank left from the wreck. The way he treats my (and your) dear Quintus! Such distinction, such appreciation and favour! I couldn’t do more if I were G.O.C. myself. He has just offered him the choice of a legion for the winter, so Quintus writes to me. Wouldn’t you love such a man? If not, then which of your fine friends?</p>
<p>Now pay attention. Did I tell you that I have joined Pompey’s staff<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_23_3" id="target_note_LCL008_23_3"><sup>3</sup></a> and shall be out of town after the Ides of January? I thought this would fit in nicely from several points of view. But I won’t ramble on. The rest, I think, when we meet—might as well leave you <span class="italic">something</span> to wait for! My kindest regards to Dionysius; I have not only kept a place for him, but, actually built one. In fact the prospect of his arrival makes no small addition to the great happiness I feel in your return. Do please stay with me your first night in Rome, you and your people.</p>
