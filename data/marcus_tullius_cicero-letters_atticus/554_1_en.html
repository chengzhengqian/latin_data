<p>To revert, there is nowhere I would rather have my pieces than in your keeping, but I like them to be given to outsiders only when both of us see fit. I exonerate your copyists and make no complaint against yourself, but I did mention something else, namely that Caerellia is in possession of some items which she could not have got from my people. I realized that Balbus’ wishes had to be met; I just did not want Brutus to be presented with a shop-soiled piece or Balbus with an unfinished one. I shall send my book to Varro as soon as I have seen you, if you see fit. You shall hear the reasons for my hesitation when I see you.</p>
<p>You are perfectly right to demand payment of the loans made over to me. I am sorry you are having difficulties over Ovia’s property. It’s most tiresome about our friend Brutus, but that’s life.
