<p>What else would you care to hear about, I wonder? The trials, perhaps. Well, Drusus and Scaurus are found not guilty. Three of the candidates are expected to have to face a prosecution, Domitius by Memmius,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_15_4" id="target_note_LCL008_15_4"><sup>4</sup></a> Messalla by Q. Pompeius Rufus, Scaurus by Triarius or L. Caesar. What am I going to say for them, you may ask? I’ll be hanged if I know. Certainly I find nothing in those three volumes<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_15_5" id="target_note_LCL008_15_5"><sup>5</sup></a> which you praise so generously.</p>

<p class="noindent">... As it is, to give you my (?) view of things, we must grin and bear it. You ask how I comported myself. Firmly and frankly. ‘Well, how did he<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_15_1" id="target_note_LCL008_15_1"><sup>1</sup></a> take it?’ Pleasantly enough—he seemed conscious of his obligation to consider my dignity until amends had been made to me. You wonder how Gabinius was acquitted? To be sure, the long and the short of it was the unbelievable oratorical incompetence of the prosecution, i.e. of L. Lentulus junior,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL008_15_2" id="target_note_LCL008_15_2"><sup>2</sup></a> who is loudly and universally accused of collusion. Add Pompey’s extraordinary efforts and a corrupt jury. Even so 32 voted ‘Guilty’ to 38 ‘Not Guilty.’ The other trials are still hanging over him. He’s not yet completely out of the woods.</p>
