<p>Now to your inquiries about C. Cato. You know that he has been acquitted of charges under the lex Junia Licinia, and I tell you here and now that he will be acquitted of others under the lex Fufia,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL007_339_4" id="target_note_LCL007_339_4"><sup>4</sup></a> and his prosecutors will be happier about the result than his counsel. However, he has made his peace with both Milo and myself. Drusus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL007_339_5" id="target_note_LCL007_339_5"><sup>5</sup></a> has been charged by Lucretius; jury to be challenged on 3 July. There are sinister reports about Procilius, but you know the courts. Hirrus and Domitius are friends.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL007_339_6" id="target_note_LCL007_339_6"><sup>6</sup></a> The senatorial decree<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL007_339_7" id="target_note_LCL007_339_7"><sup>7</sup></a> which the present Consuls have passed about the provinces, ‘Whosoever henceforth . . .,’ seems to me unlikely to work.</p>
<p>I don’t know what to say to your question about Messalla. I have never seen candidates so evenly matched. Messalla’s resources you know. Scaurus has been prosecuted by Triarius. I may add that no very noticeable sympathy has been aroused on his behalf, but still his Aedileship is not ungratefully remembered and his father’s memory counts with the country voters. There remain the two plebeians, who are nicely balanced, Domitius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL007_339_8" id="target_note_LCL007_339_8"><sup>8</sup></a> having powerful friends and being helped by his show (not a particularly popular one however), while Memmius is recommended to Caesar’s soldiers and relies on Pompey’s influence. It is thought that if these advantages do not suffice, someone will be found to stave off the elections until Caesar comes, especially after Cato’s acquittal.</p>
<p>The Paccius letter having been answered, let me tell
