<p>On 3 November an armed gang drove the workmen from my site, threw down Catulus’ portico which was in process of restoration by consular contract under a senatorial decree and had nearly reached the roof stage, smashed up my brother’s house by throwing stones from my site, and then set it on fire. This was by Clodius’ orders, with all Rome looking on as the firebrands were thrown, amid loud protest and lamentation—I won’t say from honest men, for I doubt whether they exist, but from all and sundry. Clodius was running riot even before, but after this frenzy he thinks of nothing but massacring his enemies, and goes from street to street openly offering the slaves their freedom. Earlier on, when he would not stand trial, he had a difficult, obviously bad case, but still a case. He could have denied the charges or blamed others or even have defended this or that action as legitimate. But after this orgy of wrecking, arson, and loot, his followers have left him. It is all he can do to keep Decius (?) the undertaker or Gellius, and he takes slaves for his advisers. He sees that if he slaughters everybody he chooses in broad daylight, his case, when it comes to court, won’t be a jot worse than it is already.</p>
<p>Accordingly, on 11 November as I was going down the Via Sacra,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL007_301_1" id="target_note_LCL007_301_1"><sup>1</sup></a> he came after me with his men. Uproar! Stones flying, cudgels and swords in evidence. And all like a bolt from the blue! I retired into Tettius Damio’s forecourt, and my companions had no difficulty in keeping out the rowdies. Clodius himself could have been killed, but I am becoming a dietician, I’m sick of surgery. When he found that everyone was calling for him to be bundled off to trial or rather to summary execution, his subsequent behaviour was such as made every Catiline look like an Acidinus.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL007_301_2" id="target_note_LCL007_301_2"><sup>2</sup></a> On </p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL007_301_1"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL007_301_1" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">1</sup>Street adjoining the north side of the Forum.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL007_301_1').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL007_301_2"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL007_301_2" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">2</sup>A respectable personage, Consul in 179.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL007_301_2').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
