done something which I imagine no one has ever done before, consoled myself in a literary composition.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL097_283_2" id="target_note_LCL097_283_2"><sup>2</sup></a> I shall send you the piece as soon as the copyists have finished it. I can assure you there is no consolation as effective as this. I write all day long, not that I do myself any real good, but just for the time being it distracts me—not indeed enough, for grief is powerful and importunate; still it brings a respite. And I try all I know to bring my face if not my heart back to composure, if I can. While I do this I sometimes feel I am committing a sin, at others that I should be sinning if I failed to do it. Solitude helps, but it would be far more efficacious, paradoxically, if you were there to share it. That is my only reason for leaving this spot, which is well enough in the circumstances. And yet this too is a source of distress, for you will not be able to feel towards me as in the past. The things you liked in me are gone for good.</p>
<p>I have already written to you about Brutus’ letter. There was much good sense in it, but nothing that could help me. I wish he were here himself as he wrote to you he would be. He would certainly have done me some good, so fond of me as he is. But if you get any news please let me know, especially when Pansa is leaving.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL097_283_3" id="target_note_LCL097_283_3"><sup>3</sup></a> I am sorry about Attica, but I trust Craterus. Tell Pilia not to distress herself. It is enough that I should grieve for all.</p>
