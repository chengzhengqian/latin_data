the Senate, whom, as you see, I am convening, the decision upon all other measures, their despatch and their execution.</p>
<p>To those who have remained in Rome, or rather to <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">27</span><span class="br"></span> those who have been left in Rome by Catiline to destroy both the city and all of you, I now wish to reiterate my warning; for although they are enemies, still they were born citizens.
