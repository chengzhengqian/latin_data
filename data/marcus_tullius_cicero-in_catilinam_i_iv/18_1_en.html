You, Jupiter,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL324_66_a" id="target_note_LCL324_66_a"><sup>a</sup></a> whom Romulus established with the same auspices as this city, whom we justly call the Supporter of this city and empire, will keep him and his confederates from your temple and those of the other gods, from the houses and the walls of the city, from the lives and fortunes of all her citizens. And these men, the foes of loyal citizens, public enemies of their native land, plunderers of Italy, men who are joined together in an evil alliance and companionship of crime, these men alive or dead you will visit with eternal punishment.</p>
