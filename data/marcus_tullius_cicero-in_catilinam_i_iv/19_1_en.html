<p><span class="sc">At</span> long last, citizens,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL324_68_a" id="target_note_LCL324_68_a"><sup>a</sup></a> we have expelled Lucius <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1</span><span class="br"></span> Catilina, or, if you prefer, sent him off, or followed him on his way with our farewells as he left Rome of his own accord, roused to a frenzy of audacity, breathing crime, foully plotting the destruction of his country, and ceaselessly threatening you and this city with fire and the sword. He has gone, left us, got away, broken out. No longer will that misbegotten monster plan the destruction of our very walls within these walls; no longer is our victory over the one true leader of this civil war in doubt; no longer will that dagger be twisted in our sides; no longer shall we tremble in the Campus Martius, in the Forum, in the Senate-house,—yes, even in our own homes. He was shifted from his vantage-point when he was driven from the city. We shall now wage open war without hindrance upon a public enemy. There is no doubt that we destroyed the man and won a glorious victory when we drove him from secret plots to open banditry. Because he did not bear off a dagger stained with <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> blood as he wished, because he left us still alive, because we wrenched his weapon from his hands, because he left the city still standing and its citizens safe and sound—just think of the sense of desolation
