distinguished and gallant Quintus Catulus, but the Republic did not mourn his death as deeply as that of those who died with him.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL324_129_aa" id="target_note_LCL324_129_aa"><sup>a</sup></a></p>
<p>[Yet all those] conflicts were not concerned with <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">25</span><span class="br"></span> destroying the Republic but with changing it. Those men did not want there to be no Republic at all but they wanted there to be a Republic in which they were the leading men; they did not want to burn this city but wished to have power in it. Yet all those conflicts, not one of which sought the destruction of the Republic, were resolved not by a peaceful reconciliation but by the slaughter of citizens. In this war, however, the most important and the most savage within memory of man, a war such as no tribe of barbarians ever fought among its own people, a war in which Lentulus, Catiline, Cethegus and Cassius laid it down as a law that all who could be safe so long as Rome was safe should be counted among their enemies, in this war, citizens, my actions have secured the salvation of you all. Although your enemies thought that only those citizens would remain who had survived indiscriminate slaughter and only that area of Rome which the flames could not reach, I have preserved both city and citizens safe and sound.</p>
<p>In recognition of such great services, citizens, I shall <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">26</span><span class="br"></span> demand of you no reward for my valour, no signal mark of distinction, no monument in my honour except that this day be remembered for all time. It is in your hearts that I wish to have set all my triumphs, all the decorations of distinction, the monuments of fame, the tokens of praise. Nothing
