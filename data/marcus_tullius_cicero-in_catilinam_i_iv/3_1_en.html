the Republic to the consuls, Gaius Marius and Lucius Valerius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL324_37_a" id="target_note_LCL324_37_a"><sup>a</sup></a>: did the tribune of the commons, Lucius Saturninus, and the praetor, Gaius Servilius, have to wait a single day for the death penalty imposed by the Senate?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL324_37_b" id="target_note_LCL324_37_b"><sup>b</sup></a> For twenty days now<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL324_37_c" id="target_note_LCL324_37_c"><sup>c</sup></a> we have been allowing the edge of the Senate’s authority to grow blunt. We have a decree of the Senate like theirs, but it is locked up with the records like a sword buried in its sheath; yet it is a decree under which you, Catiline, ought to have been executed immediately.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL324_37_d" id="target_note_LCL324_37_d"><sup>d</sup></a> You still live and, as long as you live, you do not cease your acts of recklessness but add to their number. It is my wish, gentlemen, to be a man of compassion,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL324_37_ea" id="target_note_LCL324_37_ea"><sup>e</sup></a> it is my wish not to seem easygoing at a time of serious danger for the Republic, but now I condemn myself for my inaction and my negligence.</p>
<p>There is in Italy a camp of enemies of the Roman <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span> people situated in the passes of Etruria<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL324_37_f" id="target_note_LCL324_37_f"><sup>f</sup></a> and the number of those enemies is increasing daily. The commander of that camp and the leader of those enemies you see within the walls and even, indeed, in the Senate, plotting daily in our midst the destruction of the Republic. If I give orders, Catiline, for your instant arrest and execution, what I shall have to fear, I suppose, is not that all loyal citizens will say that I have acted too late but that some individual will say that I have acted too harshly. In fact there is one particular reason why I, for my part, cannot bring myself to do what I ought to have done long ago.
