handle the situation in such a way, citizens, that if it can possibly be avoided, not even a common criminal will suffer in this city the penalty for his crime. If, however, the extent of the conspiracy now revealed, if the danger that threatens our fatherland compels me to abandon my policy of clemency, then I shall certainly see to it—an aim that might be thought virtually hopeless in so extensive and treacherous a war—that no patriot perishes and that by the punishment of only a few you can all be saved.</p>
<p>When I make this promise, citizens, I do not rely <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">29</span><span class="br"></span> upon my own good sense or upon any human wisdom, but upon the many clear omens from the immortal gods under whose guidance I entertained these hopes and embarked upon this policy.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL324_99_aa" id="target_note_LCL324_99_aa"><sup>a</sup></a> No longer, as was once their practice, do they guard us from afar against a foreign and distant enemy, but here at our side they defend their temples and the city’s buildings with the protection of their divine power. These gods, citizens, have ordained that this city be the most beautiful, the most prosperous, the most powerful in the world, and now that all the forces of her foreign foes have been defeated on land and sea, you ought to pray to them, to worship them, to implore them to defend her from criminal attack by traitors among her own citizens.</p>
