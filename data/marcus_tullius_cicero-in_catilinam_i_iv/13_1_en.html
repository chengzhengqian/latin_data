of exile? If only the immortal gods would put <span class="italic">that</span> idea into your head! Yet I see what a storm of unpopularity would break over my head if you are frightened by what I say and decide upon exile. It may not come immediately, while the memory of your crimes is still fresh, but in the future. But it is worth it, provided that your ruin remains the ruin of one man and is kept clear of peril to the Republic. But that you should be shifted from your evil ways, that you should fear the penalties of the law, that you should yield to exigences of state, that is too much to ask.
