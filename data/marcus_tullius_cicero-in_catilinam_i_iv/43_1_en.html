The Senate displayed such clemency, citizens, <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">15</span><span class="br"></span> because, although the conspiracy was so widespread and the number of traitors so great, it thought that the punishment of nine desperate criminals would suffice to save the Republic and bring the others to their senses.
