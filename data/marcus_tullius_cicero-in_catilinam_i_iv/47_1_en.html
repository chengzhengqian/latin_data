clear proof of the intervention of Jupiter Optimus Maximus?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL324_125_a" id="target_note_LCL324_125_a"><sup>a</sup></a> When the statue had been placed in position and turned towards yourselves and the Senate, both Senate and people saw the plots against the safety of you all brought into the light of day and laid bare. Those men who have tried to fire with the <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">22</span><span class="br"></span> torches of death and crime not only your homes and dwellings but the temples and shrines of the gods deserve an even more bitter hatred and condign punishment. If I were to say that I foiled them, I should be taking too much credit for myself—an intolerable presumption. It was Jupiter, the mighty Jupiter, who foiled them; it was Jupiter who secured the salvation of the Capitol, of these temples, of the whole city and of you all. The immortal gods have been my guides in my purpose and determination and have led me to this vital evidence. Again, surely there would never have been the intrigue with the Allobroges; surely Lentulus and the other enemies in our midst would never have so foolishly entrusted matters of such importance to barbarians who were not known to them and committed letters to their care, if the immortal gods had not robbed their boundless audacity of all discretion. What is more, the fact that men from Gaul, from a state not completely pacified and the only remaining nation to appear both able and not unwilling to make war upon the Roman people, would disregard the hope of independence and great rewards, offered gratuitously to them by patricians, and would set your safety before their own again—do you think that the gods had no hand in this? Why, these Gauls did not need to fight, only to keep silent, for them to be able to overcome us.</p>
