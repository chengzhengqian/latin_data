assigned, who has Etruria, who Picenum, who Umbria, and who has demanded as his task the plans for murder and arson in Rome itself. They know that all their plans laid the other night have been reported to me. I revealed them in the Senate yesterday; Catiline himself was terrified and fled. What are <span class="italic">these</span> men waiting for? I can assure them that they are very much mistaken if they expect the clemency that I have shown in the past to last for ever.</p>
<p>I have now achieved what I have been waiting forâ€”you all see that a conspiracy has been openly formed against the Republic; unless, of course, anyone thinks that men like Catiline are not in agreement with him. There is no longer any place for clemency; the situation demands severity but I shall even at this late hour make one concession; let them leave, let them depart, so that they do not allow poor Catiline to pine away in longing for them. I will show them the road; he left by the Aurelian Way,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL324_74_a" id="target_note_LCL324_74_a"><sup>a</sup></a> and if they are prepared to hurry, they will catch him up by evening. What a relief for the Republic to have baled out of it <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">7</span><span class="br"></span> this bilge-water! I feel that the disposal of Catiline alone has lightened the Republic and restored it. Can you rack your brain for a single misdeed or crime that has not already occurred to him? What poisoner in the whole of Italy, what gladiator, what bandit, what assassin, what parricide, what forger of wills, what cheat, what glutton, what spendthrift, what adulterer, what whore, what corrupter of youth, what rogue, what scoundrel can be found who does not admit to having lived on the most intimate terms with Catiline? What murder over all these years in which he has not had a hand? What criminal debauchery for which he has not been responsible?
