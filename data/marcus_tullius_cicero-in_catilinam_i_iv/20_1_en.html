that weighed him down! He lies helpless now, citizens, and realizes that he has been struck down and laid low. Again and again, I know, he gazes back at this city in his anguish that his prey has been snatched from his jaws. And the city? I think that it is thankful that it has vomited forth that deadly pestilence and rid itself of it.</p>
<p>One of you, however, may react with feelings that <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> all should share and make a violent attack upon me for the very decision that is the triumphant boast of my speech, that I did not arrest so fatal an enemy but let him go. That fault is not mine, citizens, but lies in the circumstances. Lucius Catilina ought to have suffered the supreme penalty and been put to death long ago, a course required of me by the practice of our ancestors, the stern tradition of my office, and by interests of state. But how many do you think there were who did not believe my charges, who were too stupid to have any views at all, who went so far as to defend him, or who were criminal enough to support him? If I thought that by removing him I could free you from all danger, I would long ago have risked not merely unpopularity but my very life and got rid of Lucius Catilina. At a time, however, when some <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span> even of you still remained unconvinced of the facts, I saw that, if I had inflicted the death penalty that he deserved, the unpopularity of that action would have prevented me from tackling his confederates. I therefore created a situation in which you could see your enemy clearly and fight him in the open. You may judge too, citizens, how formidable an enemy I consider him to be, now that he has left the city, from my concern that he left Rome with so few companions.
