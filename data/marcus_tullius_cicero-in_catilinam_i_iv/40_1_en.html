argument with the other conspirators: Lentulus and the others proposed that the massacre and the burning of Rome should take place on the Saturnalia,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL324_111_a" id="target_note_LCL324_111_a"><sup>a</sup></a> but Cethegus thought that this was too long to wait.</p>
<p>Not to make a long story of it, citizens, we ordered the letter to be produced which each man was alleged to have given them. We first showed Cethegus his letter and he identified his seal. We cut the string and read the letter. He had written in his own hand to the senate and people of the Allobroges that he would honour his undertakings to their envoys and asked them, on their side, to carry out the requests that their envoys had received from him. A little earlier Cethegus had managed a reply to questions about the swords and daggers which had been found at his house and had said that he had always been a keen collector of fine arms. Now, when his letter was read out, he stood paralysed and smitten by his guilty conscience and suddenly fell silent. Statilius was brought in and identified his seal and handwriting.

I offered him the chance to say anything he wanted about its contents. At first he refused, but shortly afterwards
