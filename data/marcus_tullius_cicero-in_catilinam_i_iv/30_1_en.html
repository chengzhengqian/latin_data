<p>The fourth group is a motley assortment of troublemakers; <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">21</span><span class="br"></span> those who have been in financial straits for years, who never get their heads above water, who are staggering under age-old debts which result partly from laziness, partly from failures in business, partly too from extravagance. Many of them have been worn down by summonses on bail, judgements given against them and enforced sales of property, and are said to be making off from town and country alike to Catiline’s camp. These men, I would say, are not so much eager soldiers as reluctant defaulters. If these men cannot stand on their own feet,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL324_91_a" id="target_note_LCL324_91_a"><sup>a</sup></a> let them crash as soon as possible, but don’t let the State or even the neighbours next door hear the thud. I do not understand why men who cannot live an honourable life should want to die in disgrace or why they think that it will be less painful to perish in a crowd than to die alone.</p>
<p>The fifth group is composed of parricides, assassins <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">22</span><span class="br"></span> and every sort of criminal. These men I have no wish to redeem from Catiline; indeed, they cannot be torn from him. Let them perish in the course of their crime, for there are too many of them for the prison<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL324_91_b" id="target_note_LCL324_91_b"><sup>b</sup></a> to hold them all.</p>
<p>The last group is not only last in order but also in character and way of life. It is Catiline’s very own; his special choice—let me say—or rather his most intimate and bosom friends. These are the men you see with their carefully combed hair, dripping with oil, some smooth as girls, others with shaggy beards, with tunics down to their ankles and wrists, and wearing frocks not togas. All the activity of their lives and all the efforts of their waking hours are devoted to banquets that last till dawn. In this herd <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">23</span><span class="br"></span>
