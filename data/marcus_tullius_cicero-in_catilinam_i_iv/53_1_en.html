endured much, I have made many concessions<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL324_137_a" id="target_note_LCL324_137_a"><sup>a</sup></a> and at some cost to myself I have put right much that frightened you. Now, if this is the end that the immortal gods have willed for my consulship, that I should rescue you and the Roman people from the horrors of massacre, your wives, children and the Vestal Virgins from vile outrage, the temples and shrines, this fairest fatherland of us all from the foulest of fires, and all Italy from war and devastation, then let me suffer alone whatever fortune has in store for me. If Publius Lentulus was persuaded by the soothsayers to think that his name was destined by fate for the destruction of the Republic,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL324_137_b" id="target_note_LCL324_137_b"><sup>b</sup></a> why should not I rejoice that my consulship has been destined by fate, as I might put it, for the salvation of the Roman people?</p>

Firstly, I am bound to hope that all the gods who watch over this city will recompense me as I deserve; and secondly, if anything happens to me, I shall die calm and resigned. A brave man’s death cannot bring dishonour, a consul’s cannot be before its time,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL324_137_c" id="target_note_LCL324_137_c"><sup>c</sup></a> a philosopher’s cannot bring sorrow. But I do not have such a heart of steel that I am unmoved by the anguish of the most dear and most loving of brothers<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL324_137_d" id="target_note_LCL324_137_d"><sup>d</sup></a> and by the tears of all these gentlemen whom you see around me. My thoughts often go back to my home and to my terror-stricken wife,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL324_137_ea" id="target_note_LCL324_137_ea"><sup>e</sup></a>
