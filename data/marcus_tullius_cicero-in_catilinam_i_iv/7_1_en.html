deadly to the Republic. Never again must one man have the power to imperil the very existence of the State. As long as you, Catiline, plotted against me when I was consul-designate, I protected myself not with a public guard but by my own alertness. At the last consular elections when I was consul you wanted to kill me and your fellow candidates in the Campus Martius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL324_44_a" id="target_note_LCL324_44_a"><sup>a</sup></a>; I sounded no public call to arms but foiled your wicked efforts with a guard provided by a force of friends; whenever you went for me, I thwarted you in person, although I saw that my death would be a major disaster to the Republic. Now you are openly attacking the whole commonwealth; <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">12</span><span class="br"></span> you are hailing to their destruction and devastation the temples of the immortal gods, the buildings of this city, the lives of all the citizens and the whole of Italy. I do not yet, however, presume to take the most obvious course, the course appropriate to the authority of my position and the stern tradition of our ancestors, and I shall therefore act in a way that is more lenient in degree of severity but more conducive to the common safety. If I give an order for you to be killed, there will remain in the State the rest of the conspirators; but if, as I have long been urging, you leave the city, there will then be drained from it that flood of the State’s deadly sewage<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL324_44_b" id="target_note_LCL324_44_b"><sup>b</sup></a>—your accomplices. Well, Catiline? Surely <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">13</span><span class="br"></span> you are not hesitating to do at my bidding what you were minded to do of your own free will?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL324_44_c" id="target_note_LCL324_44_c"><sup>c</sup></a> The consul orders a public enemy to leave the city. You ask me, “You don’t mean exile?” I do not command that but, if you ask my opinion, that is my advice.</p>
