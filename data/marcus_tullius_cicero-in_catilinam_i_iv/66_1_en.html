Yet in one respect a victory won abroad is <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">22</span><span class="br"></span> preferable to a victory gained in a civil war because foreign enemies are either conquered and become subjects or are accepted as allies and feel themselves bound by ties of gratitude; but when some of your own citizens have been unhinged by an attack of madness and have once become traitors to their own country, and you have repulsed their attempt to destroy the State, you can never coerce them by force or win them over by kindness. I realize, therefore, that there lies before me an unending war against evil citizens. It is my confident belief that your support and the support of all loyal citizens, the recollection of the seriousness of these dangers, a recollection that will always remain fixed not only among our own people because of its salvation, but upon the lips and in the minds of every nation, can easily repel these perils from me and my supporters.
