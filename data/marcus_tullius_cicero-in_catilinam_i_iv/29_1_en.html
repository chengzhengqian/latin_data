help in person to this unconquered people, this most renowned of empires and fairest of cities. Let us suppose, however, that they were to attain the goal to which their utter madness directs them, do they then hope—for this is the heart’s desire of these wicked criminals—to be consuls, dictators or even kings amid the ashes of their city and in the blood of their fellow-countrymen? Do they not see that, if they get what they want, they will be bound to lose it to some runaway slave or gladiator?</p>
<p>The third group comprises men who are now getting <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">20</span><span class="br"></span> on in years but whose active life has kept them physically fit. The Manlius from whom Catiline has taken over is in this class. They are men from those colonies which Sulla founded and which, I appreciate, are as a whole composed of men of complete loyalty and outstanding bravery.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL324_88_a" id="target_note_LCL324_88_a"><sup>a</sup></a> Nevertheless there are some colonists who have used their sudden and unexpected wealth to give a display of luxury to which they were quite unaccustomed and which was beyond their means. Putting up buildings as men of wealth and enjoying their choice of farms, their large establishments, and their sumptuous banquets, they have run so deeply into debt that they would have to raise Sulla from the dead if they wanted to be in the clear. They have also induced some poor smallholders to share their hopes that earlier confiscations will be repeated. I include both these groups in the one class of thieves and robbers; but I give them this advice: let them give up their wild thoughts of proscriptions and dictatorships. The horror of that period is so deeply branded upon the State that not even the dumb animals, let alone men, will tolerate its return.</p>
