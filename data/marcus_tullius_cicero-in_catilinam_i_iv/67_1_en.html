in a province—although I still strive by means of my influence in Rome to acquire them as energetically as I maintain them-—in place of all these lost opportunities, then, and in return for my exceptional devotion to your cause and for the painstaking efforts with which, as you see, I have preserved the Republic, I ask nothing of you except that you remember this occasion and the whole of my consulship. So long as they remain fixed in your minds, I shall feel that I am protected by an impregnable wall. But if the power of these traitors dashes my hopes and wins the day, I entrust to you my little son and he will surely receive protection enough to ensure not only his safety but also the career that is his due, if only you remember that he is the son of the man who imperilled no life but his own to save the entire country. With the care, <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">24</span><span class="br"></span> therefore, and the courage that you have displayed from the beginning, take your decision upon the salvation of yourselves and of the Roman people, upon your wives and children, your altars and hearths, your shrines and temples, the buildings and homes of the entire city, your dominion and your freedom, the safety of Italy and upon the whole Republic. You have a consul who will not shrink from obeying your decrees and, while he lives, from defending your decisions and answering for them in person.</p>
