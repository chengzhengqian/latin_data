And I propose that no such person be accused on the ground of his being a Christian. But, if anyone be found accusing the Christian for being a Christian, I wish it to be made clear that the Christian who is brought to trial should be (acquitted), if he confesses himself to be a Christian, and no other charge is brought against him except that he is a Christian, but that his accuser shall be burnt alive;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL113_305_1" id="target_note_LCL113_305_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and the Governor who is set over the province must not force to recant or deprive of his liberty the Christian who confesses that he is one, and is credited.</p>

Anyone who wishes to appeal to it and to have it by him must not be prevented from obtaining a copy from the official gazette of our decrees.</p>
