<h2><span class="sc">Addendum</span></h2>
<p>A rescript of some length and not without interest, though much mutilated in the last half, has been omitted as not being strictly a letter. It was sent in 162 or 163 from Marcus and Verus conjointly to the logister or “curator” of the Senate of Ephesus in answer to three questions which he had put. After being reproved for applying direct to the Emperor instead of through the proper channels, he was told about the obsolete statues of the emperors in the Senate house of Ephesus, as to which he had asked, whether they, if unidentified, should be altered to represent the reigning Emperor and re-dedicated, that this should of course on no account be done, since the Emperors had not in other cases shown any hankering for honours, much less a wish to take honours from others.</p>
<p>The other matter referred to by Eurycles concerned a certain Saturninus, a slave or servant of the Senate, and the management of the public money.</p>
