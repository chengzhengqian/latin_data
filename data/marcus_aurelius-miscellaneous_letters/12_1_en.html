<p>My mother Faustina exhorted your father Pius, on the revolt of [the same] Celsus, that he should shew loyalty in the first place to his own family and then to others. For an Emperor cannot be called <span class="italic">Pius</span> who does not think of wife and children. You see how young our Commodus is: Pompeianus, our son-in-law,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL113_317_1" id="target_note_LCL113_317_1"><sup>1</sup></a> is both aged and a provincial.
