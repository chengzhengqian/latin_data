Having imperative need of him we have sent Valerius and Bassianus representatives of our officials for sacred things, to bring the man to us with all reverence and honour. Accordingly we bid you with your usual firmness to persuade him to come to us with all speed, and you know that this, too, will gain for you no little praise from us. Farewell.</p>

The latter attributed the victory to the prayers or merits of the emperor, the Christians to the intercessions of the soldiers of their religion in the <span class="italic">Legio fulminata</span>, called from their success <span class="italic">fulminatrix</span>. It is curious, however, that this legion (twelfth) is not mentioned here. The commander was probably Pertinax (see <span class="italic">Chronicon Paschale</span>), not Pompeianus, the son-in-law of Marcus. The word δράκοντες (serpents, <span class="italic">i.e</span>. standards of cohorts) is also used by Lucian, <span class="italic">Quom. Hist</span>. 29. It here stands for the name of the barbarian regiments or divisions (Drungi). For the victory see Claudian <span class="italic">De tert.
