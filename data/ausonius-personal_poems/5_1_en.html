The Sinless One was hurried to the cross of direst penalty, that by his death he might renew the life we forfeited, himself the theme of praise for all his matchless deeds. Who can worthily express the praises of the Lord? Can earth with its human tongues enrich his renown which tuneful choirs of angels echo forth above? Thou didst open thy splendid palace for Stephen stoned, thou didst give the keys of heaven to that first founder of the Apostolic Throne: much more, thou didst add Paul the persecutor to thy flock. He who urged on the men who stoned Stephen, became a teacher of the people, as the thief who confessed thee received a place in Paradise, so, methinks, following up his heinous deeds with acts worthy of renown. Thou wilt suffer us thy servants of these latter days to grow in grace, led by the teaching of that great prelate of our creed: give us an heart established with firm faith. Grant that I, being glorified, may join the company of them that live again, when thou shalt call the fellowship of earth-born men to Heaven, O God, our hope, who dost provide for us an endless home!</p>
