I lived to see his son and son-in-law proconsuls,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL096_47_2" id="target_note_LCL096_47_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and my hope was always sure that he himself would be consul. My daughter enjoyed the pride of the wedded state, and won the highest praise both as wife and widow. She lived to see her son, her son-in-law, and her granddaughter’s husband all bring glory to their house in titles manifold. And I, although I neither angled for distinctions nor affected to disdain them, bore the title of prefect of the great Illyricum. Such lavish kindness on fortune’s part moved me to praise my God, and pray that my life might end before any day with fell tooth should fret the unmarred span of so fortunate a life. My prayers were heard and my request was granted: now I am fallen asleep after a peaceful end, and leave to others hopes, and prayers, and fears. And so, after the allowances<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL096_47_3" id="target_note_LCL096_47_3"><sup>3</sup></a> for my funeral had been allotted, I lay amid grieving friends, myself not grieving. Ninety years I lived, without a staff, my body whole and unfailing in all its functions. Whoe’er you are who shall read these lines, you will not scorn to say: “Your life was such as I pray mine may be.”</p>
