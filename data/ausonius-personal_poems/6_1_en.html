It is a title consecrated by Greek writers to the honour of the departed, and is expressive not of vanity but of devotion. And this poem I commend to my reader, be he son, or father, or both. I do not demand that he should praise it, but I do ask him to love it. And indeed I do not here sing the praises of my father; for he needs no praise, and I have no right to burden the dead with the entertainment of the living. Furthermore, I say nothing more of him than what those who were to some degree his contemporaries recognize as fact. For me to say what is untrue about him because he is dead, and to disguise what is true, I consider to be equally heinous. These verses were written under his portrait, and likewise entered in the collection of my works. I am dissatisfied with all else of mine; but this poem I love to read over and over again.</p>
<p>My name was Ausonius, of no mean repute in the art of healing; nay, if you but knew my age, I was the foremost. I was born and had my dwelling in two neighbouring towns; Bazas was my birthplace, but Bordeaux was my home. I was a senator in the council<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL096_43_1" id="target_note_LCL096_43_1"><sup>1</sup></a> of both towns, although I filled no office and my rank was honorary. Not wealthy nor yet needy, I lived thriftily yet not meanly: as to my table, dress, and habits, I have always followed the same way. For Latin I never had a ready tongue; but the speech of Athens supplied my need with words of choice eloquence. To all who asked I brought the aid of my art without fee, and pity bare a large share in my work.</p>
