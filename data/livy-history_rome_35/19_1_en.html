at the end of winter, came through Cilicia to Ephesus. From here, at the start of spring, he sent his son Antiochus into Syria to oversee the most remote areas of his kingdom so there should be no unrest at his rear while he was away, and then set off in person at the head all his land forces to launch a campaign against the Pisidians, who live in the area of Side.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL301_39_53" id="target_note_LCL301_39_53"><sup>53</sup></a> Publius Sulpicius and Publius Villius (the Roman commissioners who had been sent to Antiochus, as mentioned above)<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL301_39_54" id="target_note_LCL301_39_54"><sup>54</sup></a> had been instructed to see Eumenes first, and they came to Elaea<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL301_39_55" id="target_note_LCL301_39_55"><sup>55</sup></a> at this time.
