there at the time, in order to sound out his attitudes and, if at all possible, allay his fear that he faced some threat from the Romans. Nothing was achieved in these discussions, but an incidental result—which might have appeared intentional—was that Hannibal began to lose credit with the king because of them and to become generally regarded with suspicion.</p>
<p>Claudius, following the Greek account by Acilius, records that Publius Africanus was on that delegation and conversed with Hannibal at Ephesus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL301_41_58" id="target_note_LCL301_41_58"><sup>58</sup></a> and he gives an account of one of these conversations. Africanus asked who Hannibal thought had been the greatest general, and Hannibal replied that it was King Alexander of Macedon because, with a small force, he had defeated countless armies, and because he had penetrated to the ends of the earth, visiting which lay beyond the hope of human beings. When Scipio then asked whom Hannibal would put second, he said that it was Pyrrhus: it was Pyrrhus who first taught the technique of laying out a camp and, in addition, no one had selected his terrain and deployed his troops with more finesse. He also had a way of gaining men’s support so that the peoples of Italy preferred to be ruled by a foreign king than by the Roman people, despite their long hegemony in the land. Scipio went on to ask whom he considered third, and Hannibal replied that it was clearly himself. Scipio then burst into laughter and retorted: “What would your answer be if you had defeated me?” “In that case,” Hannibal replied, “it would be that I am ahead of both Alexander and Pyrrhus, and all other generals.”</p>
