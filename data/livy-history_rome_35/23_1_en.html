into tribute- and tax-paying states, and now Antiochus is reclaiming his erstwhile rights to them. And so I would like a response from you on these points, if this is a discussion based on equity and not merely a search for an excuse for war.”</p>
<p>Sulpicius replied as follows: “Antiochus has behaved with propriety. No other arguments being available to support his case, he has chosen to have anyone other than himself make these points. For what similarity is there between the cases of the states that you have compared? We demand of the people of Rhegium, Naples and Tarentum what they owe us under the terms of our treaty with them and we have done so ever since they came into our power, exercising our rights uninterruptedly and continuously without a break. These peoples have never, through their own actions or anyone else’s, effected any change in their treaty, but can you say that the communities of Asia have likewise remained continuously the property of your realm once they came under the control of Antiochus’ ancestors? Can you say that some have not been under Philip and others under Ptolemy, and that yet others have not affirmed their independence, with none disputing it, for many years? Will the fact that people were once in servitude, disadvantaged by the iniquity of a particular period of history, give others the right to enslave them after so many generations have passed? Is that not tantamount to saying that we accomplished nothing in liberating Greece from Philip—and that his descendants may reclaim Corinth, Chalcis, Demetrias<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL301_47_63" id="target_note_LCL301_47_63"><sup>63</sup></a> and the entire Thessalian people? But why am<span class="italic"> I</span> pleading the cause of these city-states when it is fairer for us and the king himself to hear it from their own presentations?”</p>
