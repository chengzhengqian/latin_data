<p>That same year the triumvirs Aulus Manlius Vulso, Lucius Apustius Fullo and Quintus Aelius Tubero established a Latin colony at Castrum Frentinum (it was by Tubero’s law that it was established).<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL301_25_34" id="target_note_LCL301_25_34"><sup>34</sup></a> Three thousand infantrymen and 300 cavalrymen went there, a small number in view of the amount of land available.

But the eyes of all were focused on Quinctius and Cornelius; for both were patricians seeking the same seat,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL301_25_37a" id="target_note_LCL301_25_37a"><sup>37</sup></a> and recent military achievements made them both attractive choices.
