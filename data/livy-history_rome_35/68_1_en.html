 should remain at peace, the easiest and safest course; watching the conflict, they should wait to see how the fortunes of others turned out without putting their own at risk. Then his outspokenness ran away with him as he descended to insulting the Romans in general at one point and Quinctius himself specifically at another. The Romans were ungrateful, he said, and he sneeringly claimed that not only their victory over Philip but even their survival was achieved through the courage of the Aetolians, that it was by them that Quinctius himself and his army had been saved. What duty of a commander had Quinctius ever discharged, he asked. He had seen him in the battlefield taking the auspices,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL301_137_157" id="target_note_LCL301_137_157"><sup>157</sup></a> making offerings and uttering vows like some little priest at sacrifice, while he himself was throwing his body in the way of the enemy’s weapons on his behalf.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL301_137_158" id="target_note_LCL301_137_158"><sup>158</sup></a></p>

If anyone had been unaware earlier of what it was that had brought Antiochus and the Aetolians together, it could have been easily seen in what their delegates said. By lying to each other, and boasting of strength that they did not possess they had managed to fill each other with groundless expectations.</p>
