generals in experience and skill in the tactics of fighting on land, was also unfamiliar with naval warfare. He was an Arcadian, a man from inland who, apart from service as commander of auxiliary troops in Crete, had no knowledge of foreign lands.</p>
<p>There was an antiquated quadrireme that had been captured eighty years<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL301_71_97" id="target_note_LCL301_71_97"><sup>97</sup></a> earlier while transporting Nicaea, wife of Craterus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL301_71_98" id="target_note_LCL301_71_98"><sup>98</sup></a> from Naupactus to Corinth. Impressed with the reputation of this vessel (for it had once been a famous ship in a royal fleet) Philopoemen ordered it brought from Aegium although it was now quite rotten and decomposing with age. Then with the quadrireme as its flagship leading the fleet and with Piso of Patrae, the fleet’s admiral, aboard, the flotilla was met by the Spartan ships coming from Gytheum. At the first collision with a new and sturdy vessel, the old ship, which was already taking in water at every joint, was immediately shattered and all aboard were taken prisoner. The flagship lost, all the other ships fled as quickly as their oars could take them. Philopoemen himself made good his escape in a light reconnaissance vessel and did not arrest his flight until he reached Patrae. The incident in no way crushed the spirit of a man who was a true soldier with a breadth of experience. Quite the reverse, in fact. Failure in the unfamiliar sphere of naval operations only gave him greater hope of success in one in which he had competence, and he repeatedly declared that he would make sure that the tyrant’s jubilation was short lived.</p>
