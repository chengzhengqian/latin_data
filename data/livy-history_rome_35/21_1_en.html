<p>The cryptic answer with its Punic ingenuity<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL301_43_59" id="target_note_LCL301_43_59"><sup>59</sup></a> as well as its unexpected mode of flattery had a profound effect on Scipio, according to Claudius—Hannibal had set him apart from run-of-the-mill commanders as being one of incalculable worth.</p>
<p>15. Villius went ahead to Apamea<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL301_43_60" id="target_note_LCL301_43_60"><sup>60</sup></a> from Ephesus, and Antiochus also came there on hearing of the arrival of the Roman commissioners. The discussion at their meeting in Apamea was much the same as the one that had taken place at Rome between Quinctius and the king’s ambassadors.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL301_43_61" id="target_note_LCL301_43_61"><sup>61</sup></a> News of the death of the king’s son Antiochus (who, as I noted a little eaerlier, had been sent into Syria) broke off the proceedings. There was intense grief in the palace and the young man was sorely missed. Such were the traits that he had already revealed that it was clear that he had the makings of a great and righteous king had he been granted a longer life. The extent to which he was loved and esteemed by all made his death all the more suspicious; people thought that the father had employed certain eunuchs—individuals who endear themselves to monarchs by performing such criminal services—to do away with him by poison, because he believed that having such a successor on his heels would be a threat to him in his old age. They also adduced as a motive for the covert act that the king had given Lysimachia to his son Seleucus but had not had a similar capital to give to Antiochus as a means of also keeping him at a distance by conferring that honor on him. Even so, a display of deep mourning overspread the court for several days and, not to be in the way at this difficult time, the Roman delegate repaired to Pergamum. The king abandoned the war he had started and returned to Ephesus.</p>
