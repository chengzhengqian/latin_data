because of the regard in which their state was held and also because of their long-standing alliance with the Aetolians. Quinctius accordingly asked them to send ambassadors to the Panaetolian council.</p>
<p>At the council, Thoas opened the proceedings with a report on his embassy. Menippus, introduced after him, declared that it would have been best for all who lived in Greece and Asia if Antiochus could have intervened when Philip’s power was still intact: then each would have retained what was his and everything would not have been subject to the approval and authority of Rome. “Even now,” he continued, “if you just resolutely carry through to the end the policies you have embarked upon, Antiochus will, with the help of the gods and with the Aetolians as his allies, still be able to restore the fortunes of Greece to their former level of respect, however far they have declined. But this respect depends on freedom, and freedom that stands through its own strength and does not depend on the will of another.”</p>
<p>The Athenians, who were first after the king’s ambassadors to be permitted to speak their minds, avoided all mention of the king, and simply reminded the Aetolians of their alliance with Rome and the advantages conferred on all Greece by Titus Quinctius. They cautioned the Aetolians against recklessly destroying that alliance with plans too hastily conceived; hotheaded and foolhardy decisions looked appealing at first, they said, but were difficult to execute and dire in their outcome. The Roman commissioners, Titus Quinctius included, were not far distant and, while the whole situation remained unchanged, they should discuss any contentious issues with them rather than arm Asia and Europe for a deadly conflict.</p>
