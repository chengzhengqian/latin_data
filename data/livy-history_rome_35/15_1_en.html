<p>The Numidians mounted their horses and started to ride toward the enemy outposts, but without attacking anyone. At first there could not have been a sorrier sight. Horses and men were puny and scrawny; the riders wore only a tunic and had no weapons apart from the javelins they carried; the horses had no bridles, and their very gallop was unsightly, running along as they did with necks stiff and heads outstretched. The Numidians, purposely enhancing the enemyâ€™s derision, would fall from their mounts and make themselves look ridiculous. The result was that the men in the outposts, at first attentive and prepared for any attack, were now for mostly sitting around unarmed watching the show. The Numidians would ride forward and then fall back, but little by little they were approaching the mouth of the pass, looking like men carried off unwillingly by mounts that they could not control. Finally they put in the spurs, broke through the midst of the enemy outposts and, riding out into more open country, set all the buildings bordering the road on fire. Next they put the torch to the nearest village and destroyed everything with fire and the sword. First smoke was sighted, then shouts were heard from panic-stricken people in the villages, and finally old men and children running in flight caused uproar in the camp. So it was that, with no plan and following no order, they all hurried off willy-nilly to protect their own property. In a moment the camp was left deserted and, delivered from the blockade, the consul reached the destination for which he had been bound.</p>
