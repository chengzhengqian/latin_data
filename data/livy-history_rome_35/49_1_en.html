because he had no hope otherwise of returning to his homeland. Eurylochus’ relatives, friends and partisans, briefed in a letter from him, brought his children and his wife into a crowded assembly in clothes of mourning and carrying the olive branches of suppliants;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL301_99_117" id="target_note_LCL301_99_117"><sup>117</sup></a> and they begged those present, as individuals and as a body, not to allow a man to grow old in exile when he was innocent and had not been condemned. The naive were moved by compassion, scoundrels and subversives by the hope of stirring up trouble with an uprising spearheaded by the Aetolians; and all, for their own reasons, demanded the recall of Eurylochus.</p>
<p>These preparations made, Diocles set out with all the cavalry (he was the cavalry commander at that time), ostensibly on the mission to bring his exiled friend back home. He covered an enormous amount of ground, traveling day and night, and when he was six miles from the city he went ahead at daybreak with three crack squadrons, ordering the main body of cavalrymen to follow behind. After approaching the gate, he told all his men to dismount, lead their horses by the reins and not keep ranks, as if they were on a journey more than anything else so that they would seem to be simply the commander’s escort rather than an armed force. He then left one of the squadrons there so the cavalrymen who were following could not be shut out and, taking Eurylochus by the hand, conducted him through the town center and forum to his home, as crowds of people rushed up and congratulated him. Soon the city was full of horsemen and the key points were occupied; men were then sent into the houses to put to death the leaders of the opposing party. So it was that Demetrias fell to the Aetolians.</p>
