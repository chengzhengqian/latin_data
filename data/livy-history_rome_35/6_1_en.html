through either exhaustion or fear. He suggested that the consul send help in the form of one of the two legions, if he saw fit, before they were dealt an ignominious defeat. The second legion was sent in and the irregulars withdrawn. With fresh troops and a legion with a full complement of companies joining in, life was now restored to the battle. The left wing was also withdrawn from the engagement, and the right replaced it in the front line.</p>
<p>The sun was beating down with a fierce intensity on the Gauls, whose bodies are incapable of coping with heat,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL301_13_15" id="target_note_LCL301_13_15"><sup>15</sup></a> but with their ranks closely ordered and the men leaning now on one another, now on their shields, they continued to parry the Roman assaults. When the consul saw this, he instructed Gaius Livius Salinator,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL301_13_16" id="target_note_LCL301_13_16"><sup>16</sup></a> commander of the allied cavalry, to send in his horsemen at full gallop to break their ranks, and ordered the legionary cavalry to provide support. This violent cavalry charge at first unsettled and disrupted the battle line of the Gauls, and then broke it up completely, but without making the enemy turn to flight. This the Gallic officers kept trying to prevent, striking the backs of their panicking men with their spear shafts and forcing them back into line, but the allied cavalry rode among them and would not let them reform. The consul earnestly appealed to his men to put on a little more pressure; victory was in their hands, he said. They should press the attack as long as they saw the enemy in disorder and panic; allowing their ranks to be reformed would mean once more fighting the battle from the start and its outcome would be uncertain. With that he ordered the standard-bearers to advance. All then made a concerted effort and finally drove back the enemy. After the Gauls turned and scattered in flight in all directions the legionary cavalry were sent out to pursue them.</p>
