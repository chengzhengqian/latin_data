 Villius beat a retreat to Quinctius. Quinctius then sent a message to the praetor<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL301_115_131" id="target_note_LCL301_115_131"><sup>131</sup></a> ordering him to take his forces home, and Quinctius himself returned to Corinth with his fleet.</p>
<p>40. These events where Greek and Roman history converge have taken me off course, as it were, not because the narration of them was worthwhile of itself but because they were the causes of the war with Antiochus.</p>
<p>When the new consuls had been designated (which was where I began my digression), the consuls Lucius Quinctius and Gnaeus Domitius left for their provinces, Quinctius going to the Ligurians, and Domitius against the Boii.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL301_115_132" id="target_note_LCL301_115_132"><sup>132</sup></a> The Boii remained pacified, and even their senate together with their children and their cavalry commanders together with their troops surrendered to the consul, a total of 1,500 people. The Ligurian farm lands were plundered far and wide by the other consul and several fortresses were captured. Not only was there booty of all kinds forthcoming from them, and captives along with it, but a number of Roman citizens and allies who had been in the hands of the enemy were also recovered.</p>
<p>In this same year a colony was established at Vibo<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL301_115_133" id="target_note_LCL301_115_133"><sup>133</sup></a> following a decree of the senate and its ratification by the plebs. Three thousand, seven hundred infantry and 300 cavalry went there and the triumvirs Quintus Naevius, Marcus Minucius and Marcus Furius Crassipes were its commissioners. Infantrymen were each given fifteen <span class="italic">iugera</span> of land and a cavalryman twice that amount. The land had most recently belonged to the Bruttii, and the Bruttii had taken it from the Greeks.</p>
