<p>18. The Acarnanian Alexander was at the meeting. He had formerly been a friend<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL301_51_65" id="target_note_LCL301_51_65"><sup>65</sup></a> of Philip’s, but had recently abandoned him to latch on to the wealthier court of Antiochus. Knowing Greece well and being not unacquainted with the Romans, Alexander had established such a close relationship with the king as to be party to all his secret plans. For him the question was not whether or not to go to war but rather where and how it should be conducted; and he would declare that he foresaw certain victory if the king crossed to Europe and established the theater of war in some part of Greece. Antiochus would first of all find that the Aetolians, who lived in the heart<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL301_51_66" id="target_note_LCL301_51_66"><sup>66</sup></a> of Greece, were up in arms—these were his frontline troops, ready to face the greatest hardships of the war.

<p class="noindent">Greece, as it were, there would be Nabis, who would wreak sheer havoc on the Peloponnese in trying to recover the city of Argos and trying to recover the maritime states from which the Romans had driven him before shutting him up within the walls of Sparta; and in Macedonia, Philip would immediately take up arms on hearing the clarion call to war. He was well acquainted with Philip’s dynamism and temperament, said Alexander. He knew that he had long been churning over fierce resentment in his heart, like wild animals that are caged or chained; and he also remembered how often during the war Philip would pray to all the gods to give him Antiochus as his associate. If he now had that prayer answered he would not put off rebelling for a moment. Only Antiochus must not hesitate or hold back: victory depended on forestalling their enemy in both seizing strategic positions and securing allies. In addition, Hannibal should be immediately sent to Africa to distract the Roman troops.</p>
