After this, thanks to the declarations made, the size of the debt accumulated by this fraudulent practice was uncovered and with the authorization of the senate a plebeian tribune, Marcus Sempronius, made a proposal to the plebs, which the plebs ratified, that allies and those with Latin rights<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL301_19_21" id="target_note_LCL301_19_21"><sup>21</sup></a> should be subject to the same laws dealing with loans as Roman citizens.</p>
