<p class="noindent">Sent as an ambassador to Antiochus, Publius Scipio Africanus conversed with Hannibal (who had attached himself to Antiochus) with the aim of removing from him, if it could be done, the fear of the Roman people that he had developed. When, among other things, he asked Hannibal who he thought had been the greatest general, Hannibal replied Alexander, king of the Macedonians, because with a small number of men he had routed innumerable armies and because he had traveled to the farthest shores, visiting which lay beyond human expectations. When Scipio next  asked him whom he placed second he said Pyrrhus: he was the man who had first shown how to lay out a camp, and in addition no one had shown such skill in choosing locations and stationing troops. To the further question of whom he declared third Hannibal replied himself. With a smile, Scipio said: “And what would you say if you had defeated me?” “Well, then, in that case,” he replied, “I would have placed myself ahead of Alexander, Pyrrhus, and all the others.”</p>
<p>Among the prodigies that occurred (which are reported to have been numerous), it is claimed that an ox belonging to the consul Gnaeus Domitius said “Rome, watch out for yourself.”</p>
