for your daughter. Such is your motherly love, so does your daughter never leave your heart; night and day you hold her fast in the inmost recesses of your being. Not thus does Trachinian Alcyone flutter round her nest, nor thus Philomela round her vernal home, embracing it, giving her life’s breath over to her young. Now is it she that holds you,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL206_213_6" id="target_note_LCL206_213_6"><sup>6</sup></a> because alone in her widowed bed she passes a youth so fair in barren idleness? But marriage will come, yea, come with all its flambeaux—so surely her gifts of beauty and mind deserve, whether she clasps and shakes the lute, or with voice to match her father’s makes music for Muses to learn and modulates my verses, or spreads white arms wide in supple motion. Her goodness is greater than her talent, her modesty than her skill. Shall not your lightsome Loves, Cytherea, shall not yourself take shame that such charm is wasted? Nor is Rome alone fertile in making matches and kindling the festal torch. In my country too sons-in-law shall be given. Not so entirely has Vesuvius’ summit and the flaming tempest of the dire mountain drained the terrified cities of their population; they stand and flourish with folk. On one side are the dwellings of Dicaearchus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL206_213_7" id="target_note_LCL206_213_7"><sup>7</sup></a> founded under Phoebus’ auspices and the harbor and world-welcoming strand, on the other the walls that Capys filled with Teucrian migrants, mimicking the expanses of great Rome. There also is our Parthenope, neither meager in her own folk nor lacking in settlers; to her, a traveler from overseas, Apollo himself showed a gentle soil with Dione’s dove.</p>
