<p>None forbids you. Take your fill of misery and tame bitter sorrow by giving it free course. Is the pleasure of weeping sated now? Are you now weary and no longer resentful of a friend’s entreaties? Shall I sing now? See, my face too swims with tears even as my song proceeds and sad blots fall on the page. For I myself led forth the black-garbed funeral procession by your side, the childish bier (alas the crime!) watched by all Rome. I saw the cruel heaps of doomed incense and the soul weeping above its body. And as you outdid the groans of fathers and the arms of mothers, embracing the pyre and ready to swallow the flame, I could scarce restrain you, your companion in like case, and by restraining angered you. And now alas! a poet of ill omen, I cast off the fillets that dignify my brow, I turn my lyre over and with it beat my breast along with you. Be gentle now and suffer me as your fellow and partaker in raw grief, I pray, if I have so deserved and felt comradeship in your mourning. Fathers have listened to me in the very shock, I have sung solace to mothers prostrate by the pyre and loving children—and to myself, when at fires of my own I lamented fainting (O Nature!) what a father! I do not tell you sternly not to mourn; but mingle your groans and let us weep together.</p>
