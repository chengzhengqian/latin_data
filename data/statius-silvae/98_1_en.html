<p>Through twice eight lusters the generations of prosperity flowed by, the tenor of his life was unclouded. How rich he was for his sons’ behoof, how ready to step away from his entire fortune, the unchanging elegance of lavish Etruscus still stands witness; ’twas your love that gave him his high style. For you held him in an embrace that ever called him back, a father in affection, never in authority.

No wonder, most merciful of rulers! For this is the clemency that grants mild terms to the vanquished Catti and their mountain to the Dacians, that lately after rough warfare did not deem the Marcomani and the nomad Sarmatians worthy of a Latian triumph.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL206_195_27" id="target_note_LCL206_195_27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
