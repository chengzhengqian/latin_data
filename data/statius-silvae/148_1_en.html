<p class="noindent">Good examples should be unreservedly honored since they are for the public benefit. The devotion you give your Priscilla is both part of your own character and must win you everyone’s sympathy, every husband’s especially. To love a living wife is pleasure, to love a dead wife is religion. However, I have not jumped to this work as one of a multitude nor only as performing an obligation. For Priscilla loved my wife and by loving her made her stand higher in my eyes; after that, I am an ingrate if I take no notice of your tears. Furthermore, I always do my humble best to oblige any appendage of the Divine House; for whoever worships the gods in good faith, loves their priests too. But although I desired for a long while past that my friendship with you become closer, I would rather not have found an occasion so soon.</p>
