maiden is no burden to your left as she holds out severed Medusa’s neck as though to spur the horse forward;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL206_13_13" id="target_note_LCL206_13_13"><sup>13</sup></a> nowhere did the goddess choose a sweeter resting place, not even, Father,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL206_13_14" id="target_note_LCL206_13_14"><sup>14</sup></a> if yourself held her. Your breast is such as may suffice to unwind the cares of the universe; to make it, Temese has given her all, exhausting her mines. A cloak hangs down your back.

His mane lies stiff on his neck, life thrills through his shoulders, his widely spreading flanks will suffice for the great spurs. Instead of a clod of empty earth, his brazen hoof chafes the hair of captive Rhine.
