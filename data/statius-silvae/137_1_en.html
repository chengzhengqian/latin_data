No palace, Tirynthian, or royal pomp surrounds you, but your master’s soul is innocent, knowing no fault. Old-time loyalty is his and pact of friendship perennial once begun. Vestinus knows it, that still in life’s flower equaled his great ancestors, Vestinus, whose spirit Vindex breathes night and day, living in the arms of the dear shade. Here then you have happy repose, Alcides, most valiant of the gods. You see no wars and fierce fighting, but lyre and garlands and song-loving laurels.

He shall sing of the gates of Death that you invaded and despoiled and of the weeping girls of Libya and Scythia.
