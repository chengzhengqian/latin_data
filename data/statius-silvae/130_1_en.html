future progeny of men believe, when crops grow again and this desert shall once more be green, that cities and peoples are buried below and that an ancestral countryside vanished in a common doom?

<p>Now if perchance you would know what my Muse essays, the <span class="italic">Thebaid</span> has already accomplished her Sidonian labors and furled her sails in longed-for haven. On Parnassus’ ridges and the woods of Helicon she has given incense and the entrails of a virgin heifer to the festal flames and hung my chaplets from a votive tree. Now a different band comes to entwine my vacant locks: Troy I attempt and great Achilles, but the Father that bears the bow calls me elsewhere, pointing to the Ausonian leader’s mightier arms. Impulse has long been drawing me that way, and fear draws me back. Will my shoulders hold fast under such a mass, or will my neck sink beneath the mighty load? Say, Marcellus, shall I bear it? Or is my ship, accustomed to sail lesser seas, not yet to be trusted to the perils of the Ionian?</p>
