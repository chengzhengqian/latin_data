unmanly grace upon your brow, as with those whom reproach of ambiguous beauty makes change their sex; your charm was stern and virile. Not impudent your look; your eyes were gentle with a spark of austerity, the like of Parthenopaeus now handsome in his helmet.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL206_133_4" id="target_note_LCL206_133_4"><sup>4</sup></a> Your hair style simple and rough, yet becoming, your cheeks aflash with first down, but not yet smothered. Such youth Eurotas rears by Leda’s stream, so comes a lad at the tender age of innocence to Elis,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL206_133_5" id="target_note_LCL206_133_5"><sup>5</sup></a> approving his early years to Jove. As for modesty of a freeborn soul and calm temperance of manners and spirit riper than your tender age, what song could reveal them? Often he would chide his lord (and welcome!), aiding him with commitment and deep counsel. With you he was grave and gay, his mood never his own, from your face he took his countenance. Worthy he to lead in fame the Haemonian Pylades<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL206_133_6" id="target_note_LCL206_133_6"><sup>6</sup></a> and Cecropian loyalty.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL206_133_7" id="target_note_LCL206_133_7"><sup>7</sup></a> But let praises end where Fortune permits: no more faithful was Eumaeus, sadly hoping for tardy Ulysses’ return.</p>
<p>What god or what chance chooses so grievous a wound? Whence did the Fates come by a harming hand so sure?
