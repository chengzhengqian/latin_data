<p class="noindent">Martial’s two epigrams on the same theme, 6.28 and 29, again point to late 90. Atedius Melior, recipient of Book 2 and two other of its constituents, was another wealthy patron (also of Martial), living in quiet elegance in his house on the Caelian hill. No mention of wife or family nor yet of literary or artistic pursuits.</p>

<p class="noindent">Date: probably 90. Statius’ visit to Pollius’ villa in mid-August (vv. 6ff.) was in all probability the one mentioned in 3.1.52ff., written about a year later. The proprietor of the villa, Pollius Felix, now apparently in his fifties, was born in Puteoli of a prominent local family and in his younger days took an active part in public life there and in Naples, of which he was also a citizen. In later years he devoted himself to poetry (vv. 112–15) and the philosophy of Epicurus (v. 113) along with building and improvements on his land, leaving financial management to his wife, Polla (vv. 147–53). Other properties at Tibur, Limon near Puteoli, and Tarentum are mentioned (vv. 82, 109–11).</p>
