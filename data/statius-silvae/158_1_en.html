without complaint. Servants stand around, a multitude accustomed to obey. Then couches and tables are duly prepared, always at hand. It is a house, yes, a house! Who would call it a somber sepulcher? Seeing the husband’s devotion, one might justly exclaim forthwith: “Yes, I see, this is the minister of him that lately founded a shrine for his eternal race and set his stars in another firmament.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL206_315_24" id="target_note_LCL206_315_24"><sup>24</sup></a> So, when a great ship has started a new voyage from Pharian shore and already stretched countless ropes on either side and the broad arms of her sail-bearing mast, and launched out upon her way, a narrow pinnace on the same sea claims part of the measureless South Wind for herself.</p>
<p>Why now, most distinguished young sir, do you cherish immoderate tears in your heart and forbid long grief to leave it? You fear perhaps lest Priscilla tremble at Cerberus’ bark? He is silent for the pious. Lest the ferryman come slowly or thrust her from the water? He conveys the deserving promptly, gently placing their ghosts in his hospitable boat. Moreover, if from time to time a shade comes with the praises of a devoted husband, Proserpine bids joyful torches go forth, bids the heroines of old leave their sacred grottoes and thin the gloomy darkness with gleaming light, strewing garlands and Elysian blooms before the soul. That was how Priscilla entered the world below. There she entreats the Fates on your behalf with suppliant hand, there she appeases the rulers of grim Avernus for you, praying that when the term of human life is fulfilled you may leave your master giving peace to the world and still young, yourself a greybeard. The sure Sisters swear to honor her prayer.</p>
