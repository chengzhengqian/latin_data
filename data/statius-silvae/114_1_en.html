 but now I appeal to him to hasten his return from Dalmatia. Conjoined therewith is a poem addressed to my fellow townsman Julius Menecrates, a distinguished young man and my friend Pollius’ son-in-law; I congratulate him for having brought honor to our city of Naples by the number of his children. To Plotius Grypus, a young man of senatorial rank, I shall be paying a worthier tribute, but in the meantime I have included in this volume some hendecasyllables over which we laughed together at the Saturnalia.</p>

In sum, I am the one under fire; let him hold his tongue and be thankful. As for this book, however, you will defend it, Marcellus, if you think fit; and so much for that. If not, I shall live with the censure. Farewell.</p>
