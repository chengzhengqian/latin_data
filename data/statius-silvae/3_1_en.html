<span class="label"><span class="ac">STATIUS TO HIS FRIEND STELLA GREETINGS</span></span>
<p class="noindent">Much and long have I hesitated, my excellent Stella, distinguished as you are in your chosen area of our pursuits, whether I should assemble these little pieces, which streamed from my pen in the heat of the moment, a sort of pleasurable haste, &lt;emerging&gt; from my bosom one by one, and send them out myself. For why &lt;should they&gt; too be burdened with the authority of publication &lt;at a time&gt; when I am still anxious for my <span class="italic">Thebaid,</span> although it has left my hands? But we read <span class="italic">The Gnat</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL206_5_1" id="target_note_LCL206_5_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and even recognize <span class="italic">The Battle of the Frogs</span>;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL206_5_2" id="target_note_LCL206_5_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and none of our illustrious poets but has preluded his works with something in lighter vein. Moreover, it was too late to keep them back, since you at least and the others in whose honor they were produced already had them. But with the general public they must necessarily forfeit much of its indulgence since they have lost their only commendation, that of celerity. For none of them took longer than a couple of days to compose, some were turned out in a single day. How I fear that the verses themselves will testify on their own behalf to the truth of what I say!</p>
