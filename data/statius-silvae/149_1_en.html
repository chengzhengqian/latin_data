<span class="label"><span class="ac">A CONSOLATION ON THE DEATH OF PRISCILLA, WIFE &lt;OF ABASCANTUS&gt;</span></span>
<p class="noindent">If my hand were skilled to mold likenesses in wax or bring life to ivory or gold by impress of features, thence, Priscilla, would I conceive a solace that your husband should welcome. For by his extraordinary devotion he deserves to have you returned to his grief as Apelles would have rendered your face in paint or Phidias’ hand have given you birth. So does he strive to rescue your shade from the pyre and wages a mighty contest with Death, wearying the efforts of artists and seeking to love you in every material. But beauty created by toil of cunning hand is mortal. Whereas I, rarest lady of applauded spouse, essay with timeless lyre to give you obsequies that last long nor end in oblivion, only let Apollo be propitious and Caesar, who ever comes to me in Apollo’s company,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL206_297_1" id="target_note_LCL206_297_1"><sup>1</sup></a> nod assent. In no other tomb will you be better laid to rest.</p>
<p>Late indeed is the medicine compounded for so great an affliction, now that Phoebus’ swift wheel brings round a second year. But when the stroke was fresh and the house still black in first shock, what access was there then to the sad ear of the bereaved husband? Then all his consolation was to weep and tear his clothes and weary his flocks of servitors, outdoing their laments, and assail the Fates and unjust sky-dwellers with frenzied plaints.
