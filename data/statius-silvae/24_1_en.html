<p>Why should I relate the tables alternate on the double bank or cool pools and springs deep under water or you, Marcia, gliding far down athwart the river, your daring lead running across its flow, lest Elis’ stream alone be led by a salt-free path below Ionian waters to Aetnaean haven? There Anio himself, leaving grotto and fount in the secrecy of night, stripped of his gray-green garb moves this way and that, spreading his chest<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL206_47_10" id="target_note_LCL206_47_10"><sup>10</sup></a> with fragile moss; or his bulk plunges into the stream and splashes the glassy waters as he swims.
