<p class="noindent">Flavius Abascantus, entitled <span class="italic">Aug(usti) lib(ertus) ab epistulis</span> in inscriptions of his freedmen, had charge of the imperial correspondence. His wife probably died in 95 (mention of the temple to the Flavian family in v. 240).</p>

<p class="noindent">Crispinus, a boy of sixteen (v. 12) at the time of writing (probably summer of 95; cf. v. 163), is known only from this poem. He was the son of M. Vettius Bolanus, consul suffect in 66, with a distinguished career as Corbulo’s right hand in Armenia, governor of Britain, and proconsul of Asia.</p>

<p class="noindent">Statius’ father died some five to fifteen years before the publication of Book 5. According to v. 29 the lament was written three months later, which is at odds with the mention of the festivals in vv. 219–33 (Vollmer, p. 9, n. 10; Coleman, pp. xviii f.). Whenever written, it was not published in the poet’s lifetime.</p>
