 herbage, and perfumes Arabian, Pharian, Palestinian washed the hair about to burn? Prodigal Melior is eager to bring all he has, to put his entire fortune to the torch, hating his forsaken wealth. But the jealous fire does not take it, the flames are choked, unequal to the offerings.</p>
<p>A shudder seizes my senses. Melior, once most equable of men, how I feared you at the final rite, hard by the pyre! Is this the cheerful, friendly face I know? Whence that passion, those cruel hands, that outlandish shaking? Now prostrate on the ground you shun the cruel daylight, now fiercely you tear your dress and breast alike, pressing with your mouth<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL206_97_20" id="target_note_LCL206_97_20"><sup>20</sup></a> the beloved eyes and the cold lips. The father and sad mother of the dead were present, but the parents gazed on you dumbfounded. No wonder! All the populace bewept the outrage, and the crowds ahead<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL206_97_21" id="target_note_LCL206_97_21"><sup>21</sup></a> that crossed the Mulvian Bridge by the Flaminian road as the blameless child is surrendered to the sad flames, earning lamentation by beauty and by age. So shipwrecked Palaemon was carried from the sea to the Isthmian harbor and lay with his mother covering the body. So too the greedy fire consumed Opheltes, torn by scales as he played in snake-infested Lerna’s grass.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL206_97_22" id="target_note_LCL206_97_22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>

There are variants, but this of Statius is found nowhere else. Presumably the two bodies were washed up together. The comparisons are stretched. Glaucias was on the verge of puberty, Melicertes (<span class="italic">Theb.</span> 4.563) and Opheltes babies; and the circumstances were quite dissimilar. But presumably Statius wanted mythological precedents, and these were the best he could think of; cf. 2.6.30ff., 3.1.142ff. (much less forced). Lerna stands for nearby Nemea.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL206_97_22').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
