 beasts crawled beneath their high yoke, grumbling at too heavy a load. But now the route that used to wear out a solid day barely takes two hours. The stretched wings of birds flying through the stars will go no faster, nor ships either.</p>

Next, to fill the trenches they dug with other material and prepare a basin for the raised spine, so that the foundations do not wobble nor a niggardly bottom offer a treacherous bed for the packed stones. After that, to knit the road with blocks close set on either side and with frequent wedges. Oh, how many hands work in unison! Some fell the forest and strip the mountains, some with iron smooth stakes and beams; others bind stones together, weaving the work with baked sand and grimy tufa; others toil to dry up thirsty puddles and lead off lesser streams. These hands could have hollowed out Athos and separated lamenting Helle’s mournful sea with a bridge that did not float.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL206_243_10" id="target_note_LCL206_243_10"><sup>10</sup></a> To these obedient, Ino’s isthmus might have mingled seas did the gods not forbid passage.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL206_243_11" id="target_note_LCL206_243_11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
