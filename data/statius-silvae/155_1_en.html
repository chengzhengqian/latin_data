or worship of gods’ deity? On all sides the dark snares of Death encompassed the poor lady, the Sisters’ pitiless skein is tightened, only the last scrap of the exhausted thread remains. The flocks of servitors, the painstaking skill of physicians brought no succor to her malady; yet her attendants all around feign hope with false expressions, while she marks her husband weeping. As for him, he vainly implores infernal Lethe’s incorruptible stream, now sheds tears of anguish at every altar, leaving his marks on the doors and rubbing the threshold with his breast, now calls on great Caesar’s merciful deity. Alas, harsh course of fate! Is aught forbidden to Him? What stays might have accrued to mortal years if you, Father, were all-powerful! Death would have groaned far off, imprisoned in the sightless pit, and the idle Fates have laid aside their spinning.</p>

Him alone her mind sees, returning from the midst of death, him her failing arms tightly clasp as her stiffened eyes meet his; nor with final sunlight would she sate them, but rather with her sweet husband. Then dying, thus she comforts her true love:</p>

I leave your marriage bed, ’tis true, but death’s order is preserved, for I go first.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL206_309_16" id="target_note_LCL206_309_16"><sup>16</sup></a> Better the time I have lived than a long old age. I have seen you this while shining in full flower, I have seen you draw closer and closer to the right hand on high.
