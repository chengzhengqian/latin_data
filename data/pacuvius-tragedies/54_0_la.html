<p>Ulysses had been told by a prophecy that he would die by a son’s hand; therefore on reaching Ithaca he adopted a disguise
in order to avoid Telemachus his son. Only his old nurse Euryclea recognised him, through a foot-bath in his possession. Telegonus a son of Circe by Ulysses, sent by his mother to find his father, was driven to Ithaca by a storm, and wasted the fields to obtain food. He went to Ulysses’ dwelling by night, but the sentinels refused to admit him. An altercation led to violence, and Ulysses, thinking that Telegonus was Telemachus, fought with him. Telegonus wounded Ulysses</p>
