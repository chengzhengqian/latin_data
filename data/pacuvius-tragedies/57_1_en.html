<span class="italic">Ulysses is mortally wounded by Telegonus</span>:</p>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker">Cicero:</span><p class="lineGroup">In <span class="italic">The Washing</span> the wisest hero of Greece laments not too much; rather should we say moderately. Says he—</p></div>

<span class="italic">Ulysses</span>
</span>
<p>Step by step, with gentle strain, lest by a jolt a greater pain should grip me.</p>
<p>Pacuvius puts this better than Sophocles; for in the latter’s play Ulysses laments very tearfully over his wound; still, in the case of Pacuvius’ hero the very persons who carry him wounded, having an eye to the dignity of his character, do not hesitate to say to him, as he groans softly—</p>

<span class="italic">Chorus</span>

<p>You too, Ulysses, though we see you sore stricken, are almost too soft in spirit, you who, accustomed to live life-long under arms . . .</p>

<span class="line indent1">Lay it bare! Ah! Poor me, I am in torture!</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
He begins to lose hold on himself; then at once he pulls up—
<span class="line indent1">Cover it; and now withdraw. Let me alone, for by</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent1">handling and jolting you increase the cruel pain.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p></blockquote>
