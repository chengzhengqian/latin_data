He and Telemachus and Penelope at Minerva’s orders carried Ulysses dead to Circe on Aeaea Island, and buried him there. Model: Sophocles’ Νίπτρα or Ὀδυσσεὺς Ἀκανθοπλήξ (Cic, <span class="italic">Tusc. Disp.</span>, II, 21, 48), based on that part of the Odyssey called Νίπτρα because of the recognition of Odysseus by his nurse when she washed him (<span class="italic">Od.</span>, XIX). Scene: Before the king’s palace in Ithaca. Cf. Ribb., 270 ff.; P. Venini, in <span class="italic">R.I.L.</span>, LXXXVII, 1954, 175 ff.</p>
