</a> my dear sir, after the interposition of a few lines, say brilliantly enough—

<span class="line indent1">Whatever this may be, it quickens, makes,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent1">Forms, nourishes, increases; buries too,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>

<span class="line indent1">And it is likewise father of all things;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent1">And these same things do from this very matter</span><span class="linebreak"></span>

<div class="sp"><span class="speaker">Nonius:</span><p class="lineGroup">‘Adiugare,’ the same as ‘adiungere’ . . .—
</p><blockquote><p>
<span class="line indent1">Earth is the mother; she gives birth to body,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent1">Ether yokes breath to it.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p></blockquote><p class="lineGroup">Euripides has:—</p><p class="lineGroup">Ether that belongs to Zeus is the begetter of the gods and of mankind; while most mighty earth by receiving of herself from ether damp drops that spatter wetness, is the mother of mortals and the tribes of beasts, and likewise is the mother of their meat. Hence not unjustly is she held to be Mother of all. All things that grow up from the earth move back into the earth, while all that sprout from ether’s seed go again into the vault of heaven; and nothing of created things dies out; but one is dissolved into the nature of another and so displays a new and different shape.</p></div>
