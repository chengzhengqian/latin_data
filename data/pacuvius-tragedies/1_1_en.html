<h2><span class="ac">Antiopa</span></h2>
<p>from the prologue and action of Pacuvius’ play. Cf. B. Biliński,
‘<span class="italic">Contrastanti ideali di cultura sulla scena di Pacuvio</span>’, in <span class="italic">Accad. Polacca di Sci. e Lett., Bibl, di Roma, Conf.</span> 16; R., 281 ff.; L.

<p>Hyginus (on the story of Antiopa): The plot of Euripides’ play is the same as that of which Pacuvius treats.</p>
<p>
<span class="italic">From the prologue</span>:</p>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker">Hyginus:</span><p class="lineGroup">Nycteus a king in Boeotia had a daughter Antiopa. Jupiter, attracted by the beauty of her person, made her heavy with child. When her father would have punished her for her disgrace, Antiopa fled from the danger which threatened her. It happened that Epopeus of Sicyon was standing at a place whither she too had come; he conveyed the woman home and united her to himself in marriage. Nycteus bore this ill, and on his deathbed made a solemn agreement with Lycus his brother, to whom he at that hour was bequeathing his kingdom, entrusting to him the task of preventing Antiopa from going unpunished. After Nycteus’ death Lycus went to Sicyon. He killed Epopeus and took Antiopa away in bonds. On Cithaeron she gave birth to twin boys and deserted them.</p></div>
