<span class="italic">Hermiona</span>
</h2>
<p>Delphians at Delphi, Hermiona was sent back again to Orestes, and a son Tisamenus was born to them.</p>
<p>The model of this play was probably Sophocles’ ‘Ἑρμιόνη and the scene is Delphi, in front of Apollo’ s temple. Cf. R., 261 ff.; I. Lana as given on p. 273.</p>

But even this is stultified by the fact that after the quotation (which is hopelessly corrupt at the beginning) Nonius says ‘the same in Eumenides,’ which seems to show at any rate that the author of the corrupt quotation is not Pacuvius, who did not write a <span class="italic">Eumenides.</span> Ennius certainly did write one based on Aeschylus; but hero Nonius’ quotation from a <span class="italic">Eumenides</span> has no Greek parallel and mentions ‘sestertii’—an unsuitable word for a tragedy modelled on a Greek one.
