<h3>9<span class="linebreak"></span><span class="italic">Reconciliation</span></h3>
<p>As long as I was dear to you, and no favored rival put his arms around your white neck, I lived a richer life than the king of Persia.</p>
<p>“As long as you had no other flame, and Lydia did not take second place to Chloe, I, Lydia, was a great celebrity and lived a more famous life than Rome’s Ilia.”</p>
<p>Thracian Chloe now rules me; she can sing sweet songs and play the lyre delightfully. I shan’t be afraid to die for her, if the fates spare my darling and let her live.</p>
<p>“Calais, the son of Ornytus from Thurii, kindles in me the flame that he feels himself. I’m prepared to die for him twice over, if the fates spare the boy and let him live.”</p>
<p>What if Venus returns as she was before, and forces under her brazen yoke those who have been driven apart? What if flaxen-haired Chloe is got rid of, and the door stands open for the jilted Lydia?</p>
<p>“Although he is more beautiful than a star, while you are more lightweight than a cork, and more bad-tempered than the unconscionable Adriatic, I would love to live with you, and with you I would gladly die.”</p>
