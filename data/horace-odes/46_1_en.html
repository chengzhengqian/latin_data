<p>Why, Venus herself laughs at this, yes, laughs; so do the guileless Nymphs and savage Cupid who is forever sharpening his burning arrows on a bloody whetstone. Moreover, a whole generation of young males is growing up to provide you with new slaves, while their predecessors do not leave the house of their unholy mistress, in spite of their frequent threats. You are the one who is dreaded by mothers for your effect on their young steers, by old men, too, who are anxious for their money,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL033_113_18" id="target_note_LCL033_113_18"><sup>18</sup></a> and by virgin brides, unhappy for fear your scent may make their new husbands dally.</p>
<h3>9<span class="linebreak"></span><span class="italic">No more tears, Valgius!</span></h3>
<p>Not forever does the rain pour down from the clouds onto the bedraggled fields, nor do gusty squalls always whip up the Caspian Sea, my dear Valgius; the ice does not stand motionless on Armenia’s coast through every month of the year, nor do the oaks of Garganus always struggle against the northern blasts, nor are the ash trees widowed of their leaves. You, however, never cease to pursue your lost Mystes with tearful verses; your love does not subside when the evening star rises or when it flees before the on-rushing sun.</p>
<p>Yet the old man who lived three generations<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL033_113_19" id="target_note_LCL033_113_19"><sup>19</sup></a> did not spend all his years grieving for his dear Antilochus, nor did his Phrygian parents and sisters mourn young Troilus for­ever.
