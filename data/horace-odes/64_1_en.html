<p>“Ilium, Ilium, has been reduced to rubble by that calamitous and polluted judge and a foreign woman<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL033_149_8" id="target_note_LCL033_149_8"><sup>8</sup></a>—Ilium which was given over to me and chaste Minerva for punishment along with its people and its treacherous king ever since Laomedon cheated the gods, even though their wages had been agreed. No longer now does the infamous guest<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL033_149_9" id="target_note_LCL033_149_9"><sup>9</sup></a> dazzle his Spartan adulteress, nor does the fraudulent house of Priam hurl back the Achaeans’ onslaught with Hector’s help. The war that was prolonged by our quarrels is at an end. From this point I shall give over my bitter anger, pardoning for Mars’ sake the grandchild I have hated: the son of the Trojan priestess.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL033_149_10" id="target_note_LCL033_149_10"><sup>10</sup></a> I shall allow him to enter the abodes of light, to quaffthe juice of nectar, and to be enrolled in the peaceful ranks of the gods.</p>
<p>As long as the wide sea rages between Ilium and Rome, let the exiles reign and prosper in whatever place they like. As long as cattle trample on the tombs of Priam and Paris, and wild beasts safely hide their whelps within them, may the gleaming Capitol stand, and may warlike Rome have the power to rule over the conquered Medes. Feared far and wide, may she spread her name to the most distant shores, where the straits intervene to separate Europe from the African, and the swollen Nile waters the cornfields.</p>
