<h3>20<span class="linebreak"></span><span class="italic">The poet’s metamorphosis</span></h3>
<p>On no common or flimsy wing shall I be borne aloft through the clear air, a poet of double shape. I shall remain no longer on earth, but shall leave the cities of men, superior to envy. I, sprung from humble parents, I whom you, my dear Maecenas, send for to be your guest, shall not die, shall not be confined by the waters of the Styx.</p>
<p>Now as I speak, rough skin forms on my legs; I am changing into a white bird in my upper part, smooth feathers sprout from finger to shoulder. Soon, more renowned than Daedalus’ Icarus, I shall visit as a tuneful swan the shores of the bellowing Bosphorus, the Gaetulian Syrtes,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL033_139_49" id="target_note_LCL033_139_49"><sup>49</sup></a> and the plains of the folk beyond the North Wind. The Colchian shall come to know me, and the Dacian who pretends not to fear the Marsian cohorts, and, furthest of all, the Geloni; the Spaniard will become educated by reading my works, and so will he who drinks the Rhone. Let there be no lamentations or any ugly expressions of grief and mourning at my hollow funeral;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL033_139_50" id="target_note_LCL033_139_50"><sup>50</sup></a> restrain all cries, and do not trouble with the empty tribute of a tomb.</p>
