<p>Neither the Goddess of Dindymus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL033_57_32" id="target_note_LCL033_57_32"><sup>32</sup></a> nor the resident in Pythoâ€™s shrine,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL033_57_33" id="target_note_LCL033_57_33"><sup>33</sup></a> nor the God of Freedom<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL033_57_34" id="target_note_LCL033_57_34"><sup>34</sup></a> has such a shattering effect on the minds of his priests, nor do the Corybantes, when they clash their earsplitting cymbals again and again, cause such chaos as grim anger. That is not deterred by Noric sword nor shipwrecking sea nor cruel fire nor Jupiter himself when he comes hurtling down in a frightening tempest.</p>
<p>They say that when Prometheus was compelled to add an element cut from every animal to our primordial clay, he also put into the human heart the violence of a raging lion. It was anger that laid Thyestes low in dire destruction; anger too is the chief reason why lofty cities have been utterly levelled, and arrogant armies have gouged their walls with a hostile ploughshare. Control your emotions. I too, in my sweet youth, was afflicted with a hot temper which drove me in a passion to write impetuous invectives. Now I am eager to replace anger with gentleness and to withdraw my insults, if only you will become my friend and give me back your heart.</p>
