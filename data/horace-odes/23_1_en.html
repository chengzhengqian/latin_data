<p>The man of unblemished life who is unstained by crime has no need of Moorish javelin or bow, or a quiver full of poisoned arrows, Fuscus, whether he means to travel through the sweltering Syrtes<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL033_67_47" id="target_note_LCL033_67_47"><sup>47</sup></a> or the hostile Caucasus or the regions washed by the legendary Hydaspes. For in a Sabine wood, while I was singing of my Lalage and roaming carefree beyond my boundaries, a wolf fled from me, though I had no weapons. It was a monster unlike any bred by martial Daunia in its vast oakwoods or by the land of Juba, that dry wetnurse of lions. Put me on a lifeless plain where no tree is refreshed by summer breezes, a part of the world oppressed by fog and sullen skies, set me beneath the chariot of the sun where it comes too close to the earth in a land forbidding housesâ€”I shall still love my Lalage with her sweet laughter and her sweet talk.</p>
