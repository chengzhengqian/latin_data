gold. For no riches, no consul’s lictor,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL033_129_35" id="target_note_LCL033_129_35"><sup>35</sup></a> can move on the disorders of an unhappy mind and the anxieties that flutter around coffered ceilings.</p>
<p>The good life is enjoyed at little expense by the man whose forefathers’ saltcellar gleams on his frugal table, one who is not robbed of his blithe slumbers by fear or sordid greed. Why do we, valiant fellows that we are, aim at so many targets in our short life? Why give up our own country for one that is warmed by another sun? What expatriate has ever succeeded in escaping from himself as well? Morbid Anxiety boards warships with their brazen rams, nor does it leave squadrons of cavalry alone, for it is faster than stags, and faster than the East Wind as it drives the storm clouds before it.</p>
<p>The mind that is happy for the present should refuse to worry about what is further ahead; it should dilute bitter things with a mild smile. Nothing is happy in every respect. An early death overtook the famous Achilles; a protracted old age wasted Tithonus away; it may be that time will offer me what it has denied to you.
