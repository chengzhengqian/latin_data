<h3>18<span class="linebreak"></span><span class="italic">A prayer to Faunus</span></h3>
<p>Faunus, lustful pursuer of the fleeing Nymphs, come gently onto my land with its sunny acres, and as you depart look kindly on my little nurslings, seeing that a tender kid is sacrificed to you at the end of the year, plenty of wine is available for the mixing bowl (Venusâ€™ companion), and the old altar smokes with lots of incense. The whole flock gambols in the grassy meadow when your day comes round on the fifth of December. The village in festive mood is on holiday in the fields along with the oxen, which are also resting. The wolf wanders among the lambs, and they feel no fear. The forest sheds its woodland leaves in your honour. The digger enjoys beating with his feet in triple time his old enemy, the earth.</p>
<h3>19<span class="linebreak"></span><span class="italic">A celebration for Murena</span></h3>
<p>The length of time between Inachus and Codrus, who was not afraid to die for his country, the line descending from Aeacus, and the wars fought beneath sacred Troy: all this you tell us at length. What price we have to pay for a jar of Chian, who is to heat the water with fire, at whose house and at what time I can get out of this Paelignian cold: of all this you say nothing.</p>
