<h3>26<span class="linebreak"></span><span class="italic">A present for Lamia</span></h3>
<p>As a friend of the Muses, I shall fling gloom and fear to the turbulent winds to carry them into the Cretan sea; I am singularly indifferent about what king of a frozen region under the Bear is causing alarm, what it is that’s frightening Tiridates. You, sweet Lady of Pipla, who take pleasure in fresh springs, weave sunny flowers, weave them into a garland for my dear Lamia. Without you all my tributes are worthless. To sanctify Lamia with new strings and the quill of Lesbos:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL033_73_48" id="target_note_LCL033_73_48"><sup>48</sup></a> that is a fitting task for you and your sisters.</p>

<p>Tankards were meant for joy; only Thracians use them as weapons. Away with that barbarous behaviour, and protect Bacchus, who is a respectable deity, from bloody brawls! Where there is wine and lamplight a Persian dagger is utterly out of place. Quieten down this unholy row, my friends, and stay where you are, reclining on your elbow. Do you want me to drink my share of dry Falernian? Well then, let Megylla’s brother from Opus tell us what wound and what arrow have caused the blissful death that he dies.
