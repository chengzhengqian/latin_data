<h3>17<span class="linebreak"></span><span class="italic">An invitation to country joys</span></h3>
<p>Often, by way of a change, swift Faunus comes from Lycaeus to my delightful Lucretilis and unfailingly protects my goats from the blazing summer heat and rainy winds. The wives of the malodorous spouse wander unharmed through the safe woodland in search of concealed arbutus leaves and thyme; the kidlings, Tyndaris, have no fear of green snakes or Marsâ€™ wolves, when the valleys and smooth rocks on the slopes of Ustica echo to his sweet pipe. The gods watch over me; the gods are pleased with my devotion and my Muse. Here in your honour Plenty will flow to the full, rich with her horn that pours out the glories of the countryside.</p>
<p>Here in my secluded valley you will escape the heat of the Dog,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL033_59_35" id="target_note_LCL033_59_35"><sup>35</sup></a> and with Teian lyre sing of Penelope and glass-green Circe, who were lovesick for the same man. Here in the shade you will drink cups of innocuous Lesbian; the son of Semele Thyone<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL033_59_36" id="target_note_LCL033_59_36"><sup>36</sup></a> will not combine with Mars to stir up a fight; and you will not have to worry in case the lustful Cyrus, in a fit of jealous suspicion, lay his wild hands on one who is ill-equipped to stand up to him, tearing the garland you have on your head and also your unoffending dress.</p>
