nothing to dark death save flesh and sinew—in your view no mean authority on nature and on truth.</p>
<p>But one common night awaits us all, and the road to death can be trodden only once. The Furies hand over some to provide entertainment for grim Mars; to sailors destruction comes from the hungry sea. Young and old alike crowd together in death; merciless Proserpine never shuns a head.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL033_77_51" id="target_note_LCL033_77_51"><sup>51</sup></a></p>
<p>I, too, was overwhelmed in the Illyrian waves by the South Wind, the wild henchman of Orion when he sets.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL033_77_52" id="target_note_LCL033_77_52"><sup>52</sup></a> But you, seafarer, do not be so mean as to grudge a grain of wind-blown sand to my unburied skull and bones. Then, whatever threats are hurled by the East Wind at the waves of Westland, may the woods of Venusia bear the brunt while you are safe, and may profits cascade upon you from the only possible source: kindly Jove and Neptune, the protector of holy Tarentum.</p>
<p>Are you not worried about committing a crime that will one day bring harm to your innocent descendants? It may be that you yourself will have to pay the debt you owe to justice in retribution for your insolence. If I am abandoned, my curses will not go unfulfilled; no acts of atonement will absolve you. Although you are pressed for time, it will not take long: just throw three handfuls of dust;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL033_77_53" id="target_note_LCL033_77_53"><sup>53</sup></a> then you can speed on your way.</p>
