<h3>4<span class="linebreak"></span><span class="italic">Spring’s lesson</span></h3>
<p>Sharp winter is loosening its grip as spring and the West Wind bring a welcome change; winches drag down the dry hulls; no longer now do the livestock enjoy the stall or the ploughman his fire; and the meadows are no longer white with hoar frost. Now Cytherean Venus leads the dancers as the moon hangs overhead, and the lovely Graces, hand in hand with the Nymphs, beat the ground with one foot after the other, while glowing Vulcan goes to inspect the heavy forges of the Cyclopes.</p>
<p>Now is the time to bind one’s glistening<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL033_33_12" id="target_note_LCL033_33_12"><sup>12</sup></a> head with green myrtle or with the flowers that the loosened earth brings forth. Now is the time to offer sacrifice to Faunus in the leafy groves with a lamb, if that is what he wants, or a kid if he so prefers.</p>
<p>Pale Death knocks with impartial foot on the poor man’s cottage and the rich man’s castle. Sestius, well-off as you are, the brief span of life forbids us to embark on far-reaching hopes. Soon night will close round you, and the storied Ghosts and the meagre house of Pluto. Once you reach there, you will not throw dice to decide who directs the party, nor will you gaze in admiration at the boyish Lycidas, who now makes all the young men burn with passion and before long will kindle the desires of the girls.</p>
