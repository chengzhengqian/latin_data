<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Possibly a reference to a division of the fugitives into two rival factions that came into being shortly after their escape from Crassus’ blockade (Plut. </span>Crass. <span class="italic">11.1): one of Gauls and Germans under the leadership of Castus and Cannic(i)us (Frontin. </span>Str. <span class="italic">2.4.7, 2.5.34; Plut. </span>Crass.<span class="italic"> 11.4; named Castus and Gannicus in Liv. </span>Per.<span class="italic"> 97); the rest remaining loyal to Spartacus.</span> <span class="italic">Alternatively,</span> <span class="italic">this fragment may describe dissension between Pompey and Crassus during their joint consulship in 70 (Syme,</span> Sallust, 212 n. 149<span class="italic">).</span></p>
<p class="noindent">They began to disagree among themselves and not to take counsel for a common purpose.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">The German and Gallic contingent of fugitives is said to have encamped in Lucania, near a lake whose water by turns changed from sweet to bitter and back to sweet (Plut. </span>Crass. <span class="italic">11.1).</span></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Soldiers who had been sent surreptitiously by Crassus to take up a strategic position prior to an attack on the Gallic-Germanic band of rebels were spotted by two women of the enemy (Plut. </span>Crass. <span class="italic">11.5). According to Plut., those women were engaged in offering sacrifices on behalf of the group. Possibly Plut., or his source, misunderstood S.’s </span>menstrua<span class="italic"> as referring to “monthly sacrifices” (</span>menstrua &lt;sacra&gt;,<span class="italic"> the meaning assigned to </span>menstrua<span class="italic"> in this passage by Lewis and Short). The parallel in Lucretius (6.796, </span>quo menstrua solvit<span class="italic">;</span> <span class="italic">cf. Tac. </span>Hist. <span class="italic">5.6) makes it clear that the women were going off to attend to their menstrual cycles in seclusion.</span></p>
