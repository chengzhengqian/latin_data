<h3><span class="bold">87</span> 18M, 92Mc, 71D, 91K</h3>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Maurenbr. speculated that these words described Pompey, but they could equally well have described Sertorius since they closely resemble Appian’s characterization of him: “no one else was more skilled in the art of war” </span>(οὔτε πολεμικώτερος ἄλλος, <span class="italic">B Civ.</span> 1.112).</p>
<blockquote><p>truly knowledgeable in war</p></blockquote>
<h3><span class="bold">88</span> 20M, 93Mc, 25D, 31K</h3>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Maurenbr. speculated that this incident involving the king of Mauretania figured in the summary of Pompey’s past achievements, including his Numidian campaign in 81, but Leptasta is otherwise unattested.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>whom king Leptasta had sent from Mauretania, under guard and accused of treason</p></blockquote>

<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Possibly to be assigned to the context of Pompey’s victory in early 75 over Sertorian forces under the command of Perperna and Herennius (see fr. 45). Since Servius quotes the fragment to illustrate the adj. </span>verus<span class="italic"> in the sense of “good” or “upright,” the statement presumably concerns something admirable that is being contrasted with the criticism implicit in </span>tam paucis prospectis.<span class="italic"> Consequently, it is best to supply a noun denoting “bravery,” such as </span>fortitudo<span class="italic"> or </span>virtus<span class="italic"> (Maurenbr.), rather than </span>culpa<span class="italic"> (Schulten) or </span>ratio<span class="italic"> (Frassinetti).</span></p>
