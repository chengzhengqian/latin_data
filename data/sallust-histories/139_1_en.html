<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">The reference to three wasted years is perhaps to be connected with Antonius’ fruitless campaign against the pirates, begun in 74 and ending with his death abroad in 72, or early 71 (Liv.</span> Per. <span class="italic">97), after he was forced to conclude a treaty with the Cretans (Diod. 40.1).</span></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">The scholiast identifies the object of the denial (“this”) as “something written by a Celtiberian.” Hence, the context may be an attempt by Tarquitius Priscus, a staff officer of Sertorius (Frontin. </span>Str.<span class="italic"> 2.5.31) and one of the conspirators who plotted with Perperna to murder Sertorius (cf. fr. 57), to refute some written message that was designed to thwart the plot. Maurenbr. assigns this and the following fragment to an otherwise unattested “first” conspiracy that was unmasked.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">And so Tarquitius refuted this.</p>
