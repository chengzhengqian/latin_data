<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">S. located the town of Corycus, famed for its production of saffron (Strabo 14.5.5, p. 670), in Cilicia (Serv. auct. ad </span>G. <span class="italic">1.56). If this fragment refers to a visit paid to that city by P. Servilius Vatia (cos. 79, procos. Cilicia 78–74), it attests his presence far to the east of where he is known to have conducted most of his campaigns against the Cilician pirates, in Lycia and Pamphylia (in 77–76) and against the Isauri (in 75) to the north of the Taurus mountain range. Possibly, therefore, S. or his source has confused Corycus in Lycia (cf. frr. 1.117–18), which lay on Servilius’ route to the Isauri, with the town of the same name in Cilicia.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">He turned his course to Corycus, a city famed for its port and woods in which the crocus [saffron plant] grows.</p>

<p class="noindent">Worn out he had returned to Pamphylia.</p>
