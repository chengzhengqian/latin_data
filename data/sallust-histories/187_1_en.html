<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">In the winter of 69/68 Lucullus visited Gordyene, a region of Armenia (present-day Kurdistan) south of Tigranocerta (Plut. </span>Luc. <span class="italic">29.9; Dio 36.2.3–5).</span></p>
<p class="noindent">In the land of the Gordyenes, amonum and other pleasant-scented plants grow.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Lucullus defeated Tigranes in a series of battles fought in 68, and then moved against Tigranes’ capital, Artaxata,</span> <span class="italic">crossing the Arsanias/mod. Murat (Plut. </span>Luc.<span class="italic"> 31.5–6), a river in western Armenia that rises near Mt. Ararat and is a principal source of the Euphrates.</span></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Possibly the same context as fr. 65, since the spaciousness of the battlefield does not suit the locales of the other two chief scenes of Lucullus’ victories in Book 4 (over Mithridates at Cabira or over Tigranes near Trigranocerta).</span></p>
<p class="noindent">More cohorts and all equally ferocious, as to be expected in favorable circumstances, attack both those troops [the first ones to be routed?] and the whole throng now that they wavered as a result of the spaciousness of the locale.</p>
