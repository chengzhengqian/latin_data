<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">In 78, the consuls M. Lepidus and Q. Catulus quarreled over the selection of the City Prefect, an official deputized to serve in an honorary capacity as a substitute for the consuls when they went in the spring to the Alban Mt. (ca. thirteen miles southeast of Rome) to celebrate the Latin Festival </span>(Feriae Latinae).</p>
<p class="noindent">On both sides there was violent contention over the City Prefecture, as if over the control of the nation.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">As a prelude to launching a revolution toward the end of his consulship in 78, M. Lepidus (father of the future Triumvir) criticizes the tyrannical power and radical legislative reforms of the dictator L. Sulla. Since Sulla is portrayed as being still alive (§§1, 5, 16), this speech belongs to the opening months of 78, before Sulla’s death and public funeral in the early part of that year (frr. 50–53). Anachronistically, too, Sulla is described as still ruling with an iron fist (§§7–8, 24), although in the previous year he had retired into private life.</span></p>
