<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Since the writer M. Varro is known to have served on Pompey’s staff in Spain (Varro, </span>Rust. <span class="italic">3.12.7), Maurenbr. places this fragment in the context of events immediately after the Battle of Segontia in the autumn of 75, on the assumption that Varro may have filled the vacancy resulting from the death of Pompey’s pro-quaestor and brother-in-law C. Memmius, who was killed in that battle (Plut. </span>Sert.<span class="italic"> 21.2; Oros. 5.23.12).</span></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">The death of King Nicomedes IV of Bithynia in late 75 and his will leaving his kingdom to the Roman people provided the catalyst for Mithridates to invade Bithynia and renew his struggle with Rome for control of Asia Minor. Mithridates did so on the pretext of setting the son of Nysa, wife of King Nicomedes, on the Bithynia throne. This fragment may describe Bithynians who came to Rome to challenge the legitimacy of that child against other Bithynians who sought to have him recognized as king.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>against whom many willingly hastened from Bithynia, intending to prove the son an imposter</p></blockquote>

<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Since this expression recalls Vellius Paterculus’ characterization of Mithridates, king of Pontus, as “a man not to be passed over in silence or to be spoken of lightly” (2.18.1, </span>“vir neque silendus neque dicendus sine cura”<span class="italic">), it may have formed part of S.’s biographical sketch of Mithridates.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>a man to be spoken of with due regard</p></blockquote>
