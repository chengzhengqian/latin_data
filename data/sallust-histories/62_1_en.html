<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Possibly the same context as fr. 1: settlers were brought from Spain to Sardinia by Norax, the eponymous founder of the town Nora; he was the son of Mercury and Erytheia, the daughter of Geryon (Paus. 10.17.4; cf. Solin. 4.1).</span></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Norax (see fr. 6) is said to have come from Tartessus (Solin. 4.1), a region of southwest Spain, the name of which was sometimes extended to the Phoenician emporium Gaddir (= Gades; mod. Cádiz).</span></p>
<blockquote><p>according to another tradition, the Spanish community of Tartessus, which with a change of name the people of Tyre now occupy as Gaddir</p></blockquote>

<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Same context as fr. 1: descendants of Hercules were led by Hercules’ nephew Iolaus to Sardinia, where they settled (Strabo 5.2.7, p. 225; cf. Paus. 10.17.4). During a period when Sardinia was largely, but not exclusively, under Carthaginian control, Libyan or Iberian deserters from the Carthaginian army joined settlers from abroad (Corsica?) in the mountains of Sardinia; they were known as “Balari,” meaning “fugitives” in the Corsican language (Paus. 10.17.5).</span></p>
