<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">The banquet given by Perperna at the town of Osca (Vell. 2.30.1), in the course of which Sertorius was assassinated. Diod. (37.22a) reports a different placement of the guests, having Sertorius recline between Tarquitius and Antonius, the latter of whom, according to Plut. (</span>Sert.<span class="italic"> 26.11) struck the first blow.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">And so they reclined at table: Sertorius in the lower position on the middle couch, above him Lucius Fabius Hispaniensis, one of the proscribed senators; on the top couch, Antonius, and below him Sertorius’s scribe Versius; and the other scribe, Maecenas, in the middle position on the bottom couch, between Tarquitius and the host Perperna.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL522_279_1" id="target_note_LCL522_279_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

The diagram shows the arrangement. Servius, who seems to have mistakenly concluded that Sertorius was the host, quoted Sallust in support of the view that Virgil’s <span class="italic">“mediamque locavit”</span> described the usual position of the host. Sertorius, in fact, was the guest of honor, and as such he occupied the place reserved for that person, the <span class="italic">locus consularis,</span> the lowest (<span class="italic">imus</span>) position on the middle couch. Fabius, who shared the couch with Sertorius, was a former quaestor under C. Annius, governor of Spain in 81 (<span class="italic">MRR</span> 3.86).</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL522_279_1').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
