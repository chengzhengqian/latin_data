<span class="label">Letter of Mithridates</span>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">In the winter of 69/68, after Lucullus crushed the vast forces of King Tigranes of Armenia in the battle near Tigranocerta (cf. §15), Mithridates writes to Phraates III, king of Parthia (whose dynastic name was Arsaces [XII]). His aim is to convince Arsaces that it is in the Parthians’ self interest to join in the fight to drive the Romans out of Asia, since the Parthians are bound to be the next victim of Roman aggression. The picture that Mithridates paints grossly distorts the ultimate aims of Rome’s foreign policy in that region. Like Pompey’s dispatch (fr. 2.86), this letter serves as a substitute for a speech to provide variation, and once again, Thucydides may have provided a model: viz., the letter of appeal for succor written by the ostracized Athenian hero Themistocles to King Artaxerxes of Persia (Thuc. 1.137.4).</span></p>
<p class="noindent">“King Mithridates sends greeting to King Arsaces. All persons who in time of prosperity are entreated to enter into an alliance for making war ought to consider whether they are in a position to maintain peace at that time; next, whether what is being asked of them is sufficiently righteous, safe, and honorable or, on the contrary, disgraceful.
