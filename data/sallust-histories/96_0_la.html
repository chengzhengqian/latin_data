<p class="noindent">A–D = four columns of text, each 21 lines in length and 18–23 letter-spaces in width, inscribed on the recto (AB) and verso (CD) of a single leaf forming one-half of a partially preserved double leaf that once belonged to the so-called Fleury manuscript (<span class="italic">Floriacensis</span>). Somewhat less than three-quarters of this double leaf is preserved on ff. 16r, 17v, 17r, and 16v<span class="italic"> </span>of the Orleans palimpsest, the Aurelianensis (<span class="bold">A</span>). It belonged to the same gathering as the one containing fr. 80, from the last line of which this leaf is separated by one, no-longer-extant, double leaf (eight columns of text, = 168 lines in the manuscript). Since approx. one and a half of those eight columns would have been occupied by the opening of Pompey’s letter (§§1–3a), the gap between fr. 80 and the opening of the letter is approx. 140 lines in the manuscript, = 75 lines of printed text. See Bloch, <span class="italic">Didascaliae</span> (1961), 67–68.
