<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Quoted from S.’s description of M. Antonius’ spendthrift nature (cf. Plut. </span>Ant.<span class="italic"> 1; Cic. </span>Phil.<span class="italic"> 2.42, 44).</span></p>
<blockquote><p>a man born to squander money and devoid of worries except for those immediately pressing upon him</p></blockquote>
<h3><span class="bold">4</span>*<span class="bold"> </span>7M, 4Mc, inc. 50D, inc. 16K</h3>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Rome’s halfhearted and ineffective measures taken against the pirates prior to Pompey’s appointment in 67 caused harm to Rome’s allies (Dio 36.23.2). Antonius was notorious for his corrupt management of the campaign (Cic. 2 </span>Verr.<span class="italic"> 3.213).</span></p>
<blockquote><p>that the conduct of those who had come as allies to prevent war was more grievous than the war</p></blockquote>
<h3><span class="bold">5</span>*<span class="bold"> </span>4M, 5Mc, inc. 121D, not included in K</h3>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Setting the scene for some unknown incident that befell Antonius soon after he had departed from Rome or from some city while on campaign.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">A few days earlier Antonius sallied forth from the city.</p>
<h3><span class="bold">6 </span>5M, 6Mc, not included in D and K</h3>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Antonius makes an unsuccessful attack on a Ligurian stronghold on the southeast coast of Transalpine Gaul and afterward sails to Spain. Slightly more than one or two printed pages of text (approx. 40–80 lines) would have occupied the gap between this fragment and the end of fr. 2.86.12 reporting the reaction to Pompey’s dispatch in January 74 (see testimonia). (Italics in the translation signifies that the text or a supplement is uncertain.)</span></p>
