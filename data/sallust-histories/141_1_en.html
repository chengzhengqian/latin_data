<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Maurenbr. connected this fragment with the flight of Sertorian forces led by Perperna, after their defeat at the hands of Pompey (Plut. </span>Pomp.<span class="italic"> 20.4–6; Frontin. </span>Str. <span class="italic">2.5.32; App. </span>B Civ.<span class="italic"> 1.115). Kritz and Dietsch less plausibly assigned this fragment to a description of the runaway Germanic and Gallic slaves under Crixus, who were defeated in 72 by the consul Gellius (cf. frr. 3.68–69).</span></p>
<p class="noindent">&lt;the throng?&gt; . . . had recourse to various expedients, as usual in desperate situations: some, relying on their familiarity with the locale, scattered and attempted undetected flight; others tried a break out in tightly packed bands.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Same context as fr. 58. After his defeat, Perperna tried to hide in a thicket but was discovered and dragged before Pompey for execution (App. </span>B Civ. <span class="italic">115; Amm. Marc. 26.9.9).</span></p>
<p class="noindent">By chance a contractor’s muleteer recognized Perperna.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">During the lengthy siege of the Sertorian stronghold Calagurris, by Pompey’s lieutenant Afranius, the defenders resorted to eating the dead bodies of their women and children when their food failed (Val.
