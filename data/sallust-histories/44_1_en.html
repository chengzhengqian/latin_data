<span class="label"><span class="italic">80 BC: Beginning of the Sertorian War, frr. 91–98</span></span>
<h3><span class="bold">91</span>* 94M, 83Mc, inc. 79D, inc. 45K</h3>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">The reputation of Sertorius as a fair-minded and capable commander caused the Lusitanians to summon him to return to Spain from Mauretania—to which he had withdrawn in 81—to lead a revolt against the Romans in 80 (Plut. </span>Sert. <span class="italic">10.1–5, 11.1). Maurenbr. and McGushin, by contrast, assign this fragment to 82 BC, when Sertorius first arrived in Spain and won the loyalty of the Spaniards by his moderate administration (Exsuper. 8 [51Z]: </span>modeste tuendo atque blandiendo . . . ut et carus esset<span class="italic">).</span></p>
<p class="noindent">He was very much beloved as a result also of his temperate and refined manner of command.</p>
<h3><span class="bold">92</span> 104M, 93Mc, 65D, 64K</h3>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Same context as fr. 91: describing Sertorius’ crossing of the Strait of Gibraltar.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">And so Sertorius, having left a light-armed garrison in Mauretania, took advantage of a dark night with a favorable tide and tried by means of stealth or speed to avoid a battle in his crossing.</p>
<h3><span class="bold">93 </span>105M, 94Mc, 66D, 65K</h3>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Gell. and Non. state that this fragment was found slightly later in the same passage from which they quoted fr. 92. According to Plut. (</span>Sert. 12.2<span class="italic">), Sertorius arrived in Lusitania with 2,600 Romans and 700 Libyans.</span></p>
