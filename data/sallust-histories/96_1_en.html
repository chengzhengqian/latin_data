<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">At the end of his third campaign season since being appointed to fight Sertorius (§2), in the autumn of 75 (§11), Pompey found himself cut off from supplies (cf. fr. 83) and unable to force the enemy to a decisive battle (fr. 43.6). Having long since exhausted his own means (§§2, 9), Pompey wrote to the senate, requesting reinforcements and money. The device of having a letter serve the function of a speech was employed by Thucydides, and Pompey’s dispatch shares much in common with the report sent by the general Nicias to Athens in the autumn of 414, when the Syracusan expedition was in dire straits (Thuc. 7.11–15).</span></p>
