If you are in a position to enjoy uninterrupted <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">[fr. 60]</span><span class="br"></span>peace, if you are not threatened by strategically placed and utterly treacherous foes, not destined to have outstanding renown if you crush the Romans, I would not venture to seek an alliance with you, and I would hope in vain to unite my own unfavorable circumstances with your favorable ones. But those considerations which seem able to give you pause, such as your anger against Tigranes in connection with the recent war,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL522_361_1" id="target_note_LCL522_361_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and my not very favorable circumstances<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL522_361_2" id="target_note_LCL522_361_2"><sup>2</sup></a>—if you are willing to make a true appraisal—will be major incentives.

When Antiochus came to Philip’s aid, they craftily diverted him from his purpose by the surrender of Asia, and then, after Philip’s power had been broken, Antiochus was robbed of all territory this side of the Taurus, and of ten thousand talents.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL522_361_4" id="target_note_LCL522_361_4"><sup>4</sup></a> Next Perseus, the son of Philip, after many contests of varying results—after he
