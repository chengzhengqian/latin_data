<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Sulla’s distribution of land to his veterans as a reward for their service ensured their loyalty to him. Land had to be found in Italy for 23 demobilized legions (App. </span>B Civ.<span class="italic"> 1.100), some 120,000 men (ibid. 1.104)—the actual number being, perhaps, closer to 80,000 (Brunt, </span>Italian Manpower,<span class="italic"> 305).</span></p>
<blockquote><p>&lt;Sulla was confident?&gt; that on account of such great recompense they would refuse him nothing</p></blockquote>

<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">The reign of terror after Sulla’s victory exposed the pretense that the civil war had been fought to rescue the Republic from tyranny (Exsuper. 5 [32Z]).</span></p>
<blockquote><p>by which it was revealed that the republic had been recovered for the sake of plunder, not freedom</p></blockquote>

<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Same context as fr. 42. The fact that the scholiast quoted S. to illustrate Lucan’s description of Sulla as “avenger” </span>(ultor),<span class="italic"> taken with the close verbal resemblance of this fragment to a statement in Exsuperantius, who drew heavily upon S.—“people desired the tyranny of Marius and Cinna on which Sulla had proceeded to exact vengeance”—makes it seem probable that S. was commenting on the excesses of Sulla after his capture of Rome.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>so that people longed for the tyranny [[of Sulla]] on which he had proceeded to exact vengeance</p></blockquote>
