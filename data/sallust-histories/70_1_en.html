<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Early in 76, Pompey attempted to relieve the town of Lauro from a siege by Sertorius but was outmaneuvered (Plut. </span>Sert. <span class="italic">18.5–10). His foraging party was cut off by a threefold ambush planned by Sertorius (Frontin. </span>Str. <span class="italic">2.5.31).</span></p>
<blockquote><p>against them Sertorius had laid a threefold ambush in woodland gorges ideally suited for the purpose: the first which was to intercept those who happened to come along,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL522_139_1" id="target_note_LCL522_139_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p></blockquote>
