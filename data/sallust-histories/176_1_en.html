<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Those who had participated in the rebellion of Lepidus in 78–77 were not restored until 70 BC, when the tribune Plautius passed a bill granting pardon (</span>MRR<span class="italic"> 2.128), a bill that appears from this fragment to have been sanctioned by a decree of the senate. Clearly, therefore, the book number given for this fr. (III) needs to be emended to “IV,” since Book 3 leaves off in the year 72, while Book 4 covers the remainder of 72, ending with events in 68.</span></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">The censors of 70 deprived sixty-four senators of their seats, and one of the grounds for stripping senators of their rank was indebtedness. These words may describe such a person as Cicero’s future consular colleague in 63 C. Antonius Hybrida, who was removed from the senate in part for the great magnitude of his debts (Ascon. p. 84C).</span></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Possibly from S.’s account of the trial of Gaius Verres in 70, but the text is uncertain and heavily emended. Verres was accused by Cicero of having taken bribes from robbers to release them from custody, or to allow them a free hand to operate, when Verres was the governor of Sicily from 73 to 71 (2 </span>Verr.<span class="italic"> 1.9 and 12).</span></p>
