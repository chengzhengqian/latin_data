Past editors place this fragment in Book 2 on the basis of two citations from Nonius credited to Book 2 (pp. 180M, 222M), however, the only way to find room in Book 2 for an event in the autumn of 74 is to assume that it was treated proleptically, since Book 3 begins S.’s account of the year 74. A third citation in Nonius (p. 286M) is assigned to Book 3, which is in accord with the structure of S.’s annalistic account of events. Cf. fr. 2.55, which Nonius cites twice, giving different book numbers.</span></p>
