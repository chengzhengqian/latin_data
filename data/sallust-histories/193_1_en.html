<span class="label"><span class="ac">CONCLUSION OF THE WAR WAGED BY LUCULLUS (68 [autumn]–67 BC), FRR. 1–14</span></span>
<h3><span class="bold">1</span>* 1M, 1Mc, inc. 46D, inc. 12K</h3>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Because of its close resemblance to Dio’s description of a surprise attack on the Romans while they wandered the countryside (36.9.1; cf. App. </span>Mith.<span class="italic"> 88), this fragment may describe Mithridates’ sudden incursion into his former kingdom of Pontus in the autumn of 68 by way of Lesser Armenia, while Lucullus was engaged in the siege of Nisibis (so Maurenbr.). Alternatively, since this fragment is not assigned to a specific book, it could conceivably concern a raid by Spartacus in the Servile War (73–71): so Gerlach (3.71), and La Penna (1963), 47.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Suddenly he invaded undefended territory.</p>
<h3><span class="bold">2</span>* 2M, 2Mc, inc. 25D, 3.72K</h3>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Same context as fr. 1.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">A huge force of men from many locales simultaneously attacked &lt;cities&gt; that were then standing open and, after the fashion of peacetime, were off guard.</p>
