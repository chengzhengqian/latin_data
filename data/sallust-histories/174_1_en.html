<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">The logical person to receive this news is Lucullus, on his journey back to Pontus from Lesser Armenia, after his victory over Mithridates near Cabira in the summer of 71 (Plut. </span>Luc.<span class="italic"> 19.1). The city of Amisus held out for two years after it was put under siege in 72.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>and he heard that Amisus was being besieged without any pitched battles</p></blockquote>
<h3><span class="bold">43 </span>14M, 47Mc, 55D, 14K</h3>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Lucullus captured the Pontic city Eupatoria and soon afterward Amisus, by having his soldiers employ ladders to mount a part of the ramparts that were temporarily left unattended (Memnon, </span>FGrH <span class="italic">434F30.4; cf. Plut. </span>Luc. <span class="italic">19.3). Ladders were likewise employed in Lucullus’ capture of Sinope (Memnon, </span>FGrH <span class="italic">434F37.8).</span></p>
<blockquote><p>ladders equal to the height of the ramparts</p></blockquote>
<h3><span class="bold">44 </span>15M, 48Mc, 43D, 69K</h3>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Roman soldiers added to the destruction of Amisus, which had already been set ablaze by the fleeing garrison, by ransacking the houses with flaming torches (Plut. </span>Luc. <span class="italic">19.5).</span></p>
<blockquote><p>because pillagers, lighting their way with torches, had carelessly left them smoldering in the buildings</p></blockquote>
