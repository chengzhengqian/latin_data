Marius’ sister and a leader in the Cinnan regime, was put to death. His cruel execution took place at the instigation of Q. Catulus (cos. 78) and was carried out at the tomb of Catulus’ father (cos. 102), across the Tiber, in retribution for Gratidianus’ role in driving the elder Catulus to suicide soon after Gaius Marius and Cinna took possession of Rome in late 87.</span></p>
