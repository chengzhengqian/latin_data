<h3><span class="bold">82</span> 97M, 86Mc, 108D, 116K</h3>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">When in the spring of 81 Sulla dispatched C. Annius as proconsul to govern one, or probably both Spains (</span>MRR<span class="italic"> 3.15), with the charge to expel Sertorius, Sertorius sent his legate Livius (called Julius by Plut.) Salinator with six thousand men to block the passes in Pyrenees and so prevent C. Annius from crossing into Spain (Plut. </span>Sert. <span class="italic">7.1).</span></p>
<blockquote><p>a few men [a detachment of Salinator’s soldiers?] occupying a defile</p></blockquote>
<h3><span class="bold">83</span>* 95M, 85Mc, not included in D and K</h3>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Same context as fr. 82. P. Calpurnius Lanarius was an officer on Annius’ staff in 81 (</span>MRR<span class="italic"> 3.46), who found a way to turn the pass occupied by Sertorius’ forces. Plut. (</span>Sert. <span class="italic">7.3) mistakenly identifies Lanarius as a traitor among the blockading Sertorian forces.</span></p>

<h3><span class="bold">84</span>* 96M, 84Mc, not in D and K</h3>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Same context as frr. 82–83. According to Plut. (</span>Sert.<span class="italic"> 7.3), Salinator died at the hands of Lanarius.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Salinator is killed while on the march.</p>
