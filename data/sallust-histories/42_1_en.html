<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">After being expelled from Spain by C. Annius and fleeing to Mauretania in 81, Sertorius returned later in the year, and in alliance with Cilician pirates, he briefly occupied one of the Pityussae islands (lying southwest of the Balearics, off the east coast of Spain). C. Annius arrived with a substantial force to expel him, and Sertorius fought a sea battle despite having only light ships not built for combat (Plut. </span>Sert. <span class="italic">7.5–7).</span></p>
<blockquote><p>some of them [the skiffs], after advancing a little, began to sink as a result of too much unstable weight when panic had caused the passengers to shift about</p></blockquote>

<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Same context as fr. 85: in the sea battle, foul weather prevented Sertorius’ light ships from escaping onto the open sea, and hostile forces prevented a landing (Plut. loc. cit.).</span></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">After fleeing from the battle described in frr. 85–86, Sertorius sailed to the southwest coast of Spain, just beyond the Strait of Gibraltar, and met with sailors who brought back tales of faraway, Atlantic islands called Isles of the Blessed (Plut. </span>Sert. <span class="italic">8.2).</span></p>
