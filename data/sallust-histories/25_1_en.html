<p>“Why, then, does the tyrant go about with such a great following and assurance? Because success serves as a wonderful screen for vices<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL522_49_28" id="target_note_LCL522_49_28"><sup>28</sup></a>—if a reverse occurs, he will be despised as much as he is now feared—unless, perhaps, it is out of a pretense of harmony and peace, which are the names he has conferred on his criminal treason. And he asserts that in no other way can the nation and an end of war exist, unless the commons remain driven from their lands (the cruelest plunder of citizens) and the control and jurisdiction over all matters, which once belonged to the Roman people, remain in his own hands.

If you endorse this view, Citizens, let your presence be felt, and with the kindly aid of the gods, follow Marcus Aemilius, your consul, as your leader and advocate for the recovery of freedom!”</p>
