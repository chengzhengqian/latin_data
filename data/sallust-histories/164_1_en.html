<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">S. refers to the “heel” of Italy (Calabria) by the name of the promontory at its tip, Sallentinum, whereas he uses the name of the broader ager Bruttius to refer to the “toe.”</span></p>
<p class="noindent">All Italy, which terminates in narrow land masses, is split into two promontories: Bruttium and Sallentinum.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">A description of Calabria, which is relatively low-lying and flat in contrast with the rugged ager Bruttius, the other of the two large peninsulas in which Italy terminates.</span></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">S. reckons the shortest distance from coast to coast in the ager Bruttius as roughly 35 Roman miles, which is approximately the distance by air at the latitude of Thurii (ca. 40 English miles). The neck of land is even narrower (ca. 20 English miles) at the latitude of Scolacium. Plut. appears to have mistaken this measurement for the far shorter distance that must have been spanned by the wall and trench (15 feet wide and 15 feet deep) built by Crassus to blockade Spartacus and his men in the ager Bruttius</span> <span class="italic">(Plut. </span>Crass.<span class="italic"> 10.7–8). Plut. claims that the wall stretched 300 stades (ca. 37.5 Roman miles), an impossible length to garrison. More realistically, the wall and ditch were probably intended to cut off the promontory of Scyllaeum (mod. Scilla), to which Spartacus retreated, on the coast of the ager Bruttius, opposite Cape Pelorus in Sicily (so Ward, </span>Crassus,<span class="italic"> 89–90).</span></p>
