How shameless you are before both men and the gods, whom you have insulted by your faithlessness or perjury! Since such is your character, I urge you to remain true to your purpose and to retain your arms, and (granted that you yourself are restless) not to keep us in a state of anxiety by deferring your rebellious plans. Neither the provinces, nor the laws, nor the tutelary gods<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL522_69_21" id="target_note_LCL522_69_21"><sup>21</sup></a> tolerate you as a citizen. Proceed along the path you have begun, so that you may meet with your deserts as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>“But you, Members of the Senate, for how long will you suffer the nation to be defenseless by your hesitation, will you combat arms with words? Forces have been levied against you, money extorted from the public coffers and from individuals, garrisons removed and installed; laws are being arbitrarily put into force, while you in the meantime are getting ready envoys and decrees. But, so help me Hercules, the more eagerly you seek peace, the more fierce the war will be, when he realizes that he has been sustained more by your dread than the justice and righteousness of his cause. For a person who professes hatred for turmoil and the slaughter of citizens and on that account keeps you unarmed while Lepidus is in arms, is proposing instead that you suffer what the conquered must endure, although you have the ability to take action. He urges from you peace toward Lepidus, and from him war toward you. If you are in favor of this outcome—if such torpor has numbed your spirits that forgetting the crimes of Cinna, upon whose return to the City the flower thought to be guardian gods brought to Italy by the Trojan hero Aeneas (Serv. ad <span class="italic">Aen.</span> 3.148); cf. fr. 2.86.1.
