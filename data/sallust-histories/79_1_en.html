I do what our ancestors often did in savage wars; I consecrate and offer myself for the nation!<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL522_157_18" id="target_note_LCL522_157_18"><sup>18</sup></a> Consider to whom you are going to entrust it next; for no virtuous man will want such an honor, when he must be accountable for the vagaries of fortune and of the sea and of a war conducted by others, or else must die a shameful death. Only bear in mind that I was put to death not on account of crime or avarice, but that I willingly gave my life as a gift in return for the greatest benefits.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL522_157_19" id="target_note_LCL522_157_19"><sup>19</sup></a> I implore you in your own name, Citizens, and by the glory of your ancestors: endure adversity, and take counsel for the nation. Inherent in the greatest empire is much responsibility, many heavy burdens, which it is futile for you to refuse while you seek the sumptuousness of peace, when all the provinces, kingdoms, seas, and lands are roiled or exhausted by wars.”</p>
