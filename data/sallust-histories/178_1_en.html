<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Lucullus’ march to the Euphrates and crossing in the spring of 69.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">By forced marches he hastened through the kingdom of Ariobarzanes to the Euphrates River, in the place where Cappadocia is separated from Armenia; and although there were on hand about 500(?) river barges, which had secretly been constructed during the winter, . . .</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Same context as fr. 53. The sudden lessening of the winter spate of the Euphrates seemed heaven sent (Plut. </span>Luc. <span class="italic">24.2–3). As further evidence of divine favor toward Lucullus, a sacrificial heifer made a seemingly miraculous appearance after the army had crossed to the other side (Plut. </span>Luc <span class="italic">24.4).</span></p>
<blockquote><p>so that such a sudden change of circumstances seem to be not without the will of a god</p></blockquote>

<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Siege of Tigranocerta. Naphtha, a flammable mineral oil found in Mesopotamia (Plin. </span>HN <span class="italic">2.235), was employed by the defenders of Tigranocerta to set fire to Lucullus’ siege engines (Dio 36.1b.1–2). Beyond the fact that S. mentioned naphtha, it is impossible to say to what extent, if any, the words used to describe it are quoted directly.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span class="bold">naphtha</span>, <span class="italic">a kind of oil, like cedar oil</span></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><span class="italic">Sallust writes in the Histories that </span><span class="italic"><span class="bold">nap(h)t(h)a</span></span><span class="italic"> is a kind of fire-starter among the Persians by which fires are very greatly fed</span></p></blockquote>
