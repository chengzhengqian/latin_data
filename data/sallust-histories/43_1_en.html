<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Same context as fr. 87. Location of the Isles of the Blessed. The description of the climate suggests identification with the two largest islands of the Madeira Archipelago (Porto Santo and Madeira), the former being ca. 750 miles (roughly 6,500 stades) from Gades (mod. Cádiz).</span></p>
<p class="noindent">And it was held that those two neighboring islands, located 10,000 stades from Gades, produced of their own accord nourishment for mortals.</p>
<h3><span class="bold">89</span>* 101M, 91Mc, 62D, K</h3>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Same context as fr. 87. Isles of the Blessed identified with Homer’s Elysium (Plut. </span>Sert. <span class="italic">8.5).</span></p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">According to philosophers, Elysium is identical with of the </span><span class="italic"><span class="bold">Isles of the Blessed</span></span><span class="italic">, which Sallust states are </span><span class="italic"><span class="bold">celebrated in Homer’s verses</span></span><span class="italic"> [</span>Od<span class="italic">. 4.563–68]</span></p>
<h3><span class="bold">90</span> 102M, 92Mc, 61D, K</h3>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Kritz, followed by Dietsch, joined fr. 88 to this one as its continuation, retaining the paradosis </span>cuius<span class="italic"> in fr. 88, which will have </span>Oceani<span class="italic"> here as its antecedent. Plut., however, first describes separately, in language closely resembling fr. 88, the two islands (</span>Sert. 8.2–3<span class="italic">) and somewhat later </span>(9.1)<span class="italic"> mentions that Sertorius contemplated withdrawal there.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">According to tradition, he contemplated flight to distant regions of the Ocean.</p>
