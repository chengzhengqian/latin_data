<h3><span class="bold">33</span>*<span class="bold"> </span>78M, 26Mc, not included in D and K</h3>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Possibly describing some region of Cyzicus that was less troubled by the outbreak of pestilence owing to the healthy air brought by the North Wind, as in the passage of Lucan on which the scholiast commented (so La Penna). Maurenbr., on the contrary, assigned this fragment to a description of the Tauric Chersonesus.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>because, jutting out, it was less burdened than the other regions thanks to the North Wind</p></blockquote>
<h3><span class="bold">34</span>*<span class="bold"> </span>1.43M, 3.27Mc, 3.25D, 3.29K</h3>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Possibly describing deaths in the plague at the siege of Cyzicus (so Kritz and La Penna). Maurenbr., on the contrary, linked these words to the death of Marius Gratidianus (see fr. 1.36) and other victims of Sulla’s bloodletting, comparing Oros. 5.21.6, “and the pathway of death itself was not simple, nor was it the only suffering” </span>(nec ipsius mortis erat via simplex aut una condicio).</p>
<blockquote><p>they were dying from multifarious deaths</p></blockquote>
<h3><span class="bold">35 </span>40M, 28Mc, 72D, 87K</h3>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Either (a) a description of the defenders of Cyzicus, faint with hunger (cf. similar language in Liv. 5.48.7 describing the Gallic siege of Rome in 390/387), or (b) a description of those of Lucullus’ soldiers who fell behind, worn out by the cold of winter and fatigue, when in pursuit of Mithridates’ forces withdrawing from Cyzicus (Plut. </span>Luc.<span class="italic"> 11.4).</span></p>
<blockquote><p>so that the majority, being unable to support the weight of their bodies, stood each leaning on his own arms</p></blockquote>
