<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Possibly the same context as fr. 105: Aquinus’ troops were thrown into confusion.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>and they were unable to pull back or marshal themselves for battle</p></blockquote>
<h3><span class="bold">107 </span>135M, 109Mc, 71D, 69K</h3>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Some action in the Sertorian War, as can be surmised from the reference to Metellus and the assignment to Book 1. The identification of Metellus as “Metellus Celer” in the glossator, a late source, is not to be trusted.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">At the command of Metellus, the horn-blowers gave a sudden blast with their trumpets.</p>
<h3><span class="bold">108 </span>116M, 110Mc, 92 et inc. 113D, 94 et inc. 80K</h3>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">This description could have been applied to Metellus (so Maurenbr.) or Sertorius (Büchner; cf. fr. 78). “</span>Alias<span class="italic">” indicates that somewhat before, or after, these words S. criticized some shortcoming.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>a man irreproachable in other respects and of a sound disposition</p></blockquote>
<h3><span class="bold">109 </span>118M, 111Mc, 99D, 101K</h3>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Possibly a description of Sertorius’ resiliency in carrying on guerilla warfare despite setbacks.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>and though driven off a number of times, he is not frightened off</p></blockquote>
