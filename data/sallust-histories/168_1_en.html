<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Same context as fr. 21. Cicero in his prosecution of Verres in 70 scoffed at the claim of the ex-governor that he deserved credit for preventing the war with Spartacus from spreading across the Strait of Messina to Sicily (2 </span>Verr.<span class="italic"> 5.5). Yet contrary to Cicero’s portrayal, it may have been Verres’ defensive measures that caused the Cilician pirates to break their agreement to transport Spartacus and his men to the coast of Sicily (Plut. </span>Crass. <span class="italic">10.7).</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Gaius Verres fortified the shores near Italy.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Maurenbr., comparing Plut. </span>Crass. <span class="italic">10.9, detected in these words a reference to the snowy and wintery night on which one-third of Spartacus’ forces managed to cross the trench and wall with which Crassus had attempted to seal off Cape Scyllaeum in the vicinity of Rhegium, where the slaves had taken up a position.</span></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Servius states that the quotation from S. concerns fugitives. Since Sila is a vast, forested mountain in northeast Bruttius ager (Dion. Hal.</span> Ant. Rom.<span class="italic"> 20.15 [fr. 20.5 Ambr.]), ca. eighty miles in length</span> <span class="italic">(Strabo 6.1.9, p. 261), it made a logical hiding place for Spartacus and his band after their escape from Crassus’ entrenchment to the south (cf. frr. 24–25).</span></p>
<blockquote><p>they were in the forest of Sila</p></blockquote>
