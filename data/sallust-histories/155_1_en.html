<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">A description of a politician who was adept at using intimidation: possibly the plebeian tribune of 74 L. Quinctius (Cic. Clu. 77, 79; cf. fr. 3.15.11), so Maurenbr.; or the political boss P. Cornelius Cethegus (Plut. </span>Luc.<span class="italic"> 5.4, 6.1–4), so McGushin.</span></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Maurenbr. assigned this fragment to the failed attempt of L. Lucullus’ soldiers in 73 to persuade their commander to invade and seize control of Mithridates’ kingdom of Pontus in his absence, rather than to go to the relief of M. Cotta (cos. 74), who had been defeated by Mithridates and was being besieged in Chalcedon (Plut. </span>Luc. <span class="italic">8.3).</span></p>
<p class="noindent">And when this attempt failed, the soldiers began to march more negligently, with arms not properly arrayed, as they had been in the beginning, and with a looser line of march.</p>
