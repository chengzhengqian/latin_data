<h3><span class="bold">99</span> 110M, 101Mc, 70D, K</h3>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">By late 80, after the defeats of Fufidius and Domitius (frr. 95–98), word of the growing size of Sertorius’ forces in Lusitania (Farther Spain) must have reached Rome.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>and Metellus, &lt;made?&gt; aware of their number through a dispatch</p></blockquote>
<h3><span class="bold">100</span> 112M, 102Mc, 86D, K</h3>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">This fragment, which is identified as coming from Book 1, may describe Metellus’ tactics early in his proconsulship, since Frontinus’ description of the facility of light-armed Spaniards at laying an ambush (Str.</span> 2.5.31, “aptissimos ad furta bellorum”<span class="italic">) bears a striking verbal resemblance to S.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Setting out from there, he burned villages and strongholds, and with fire laid waste to regions deserted owing to the flight of the cultivators, not far afield or * * * out of his fear of a people very adept at snares of war.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Dipo, a town on the Anas River, ca. thirty-five miles west of Metellinum (mod. Medellín), a base of operations utilized by Metellus, may have been an early target of his strategy aimed at reducing strongholds in Lusitania (see preceding fragment).</span></p>
<blockquote><p>and he overcame by warfare the strong city of Dipo despite its holding out for many days</p></blockquote>
