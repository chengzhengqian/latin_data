<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Italics in the translation signifies that text is uncertain, and without more context, it is impossible to expand the abbreviation with which this fragment concludes. If </span>Poeni<span class="italic"> is the correct reading (</span>poni<span class="italic"> [to be put] is found in the bulk of the manuscripts), S. may have mentioned the Carthaginians in Book 2 in connection with Sardinia (cf. fr. 8) or New Carthage (cf. fr. 46), as Dietsch and Maurenbr. pointed out.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">And the <span class="italic">Carthaginians generally</span> against * * *</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Stobi, a town in Macedonia, may have been mentioned in Book 2 in connection with the campaigns of the governors Ap. Claudius (cos. 79) in 76 (so Maurenbr. assumes) or C. Scribonius Curio (cos. 76) in 75.</span></p>

<h3><span class="bold">110a–b</span> 52a–bM, not included in Mc, D, and K</h3>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">These two fragments are preserved in the Orleans palimpsest, the </span>Aurelianensis<span class="italic"> (</span><span class="italic"><span class="bold">A</span></span><span class="italic">). The first line of fr. 110a stood anywhere from four to six leaves after the leaf on which fr. 43.1a-1 (the preface to and opening words of Cotta’s speech of ca. June 75) was inscribed on the verso. It is impossible to recover the content.</span></p>
