<h3><span class="bold">3</span>* 3M, 3Mc, 1D, 1K</h3>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Since the three scholiasts who preserve this fragment state that S. was describing the inhabitants of Media (mod. Azerbaijan), it may belong to the same context as fr. 1 and refer to the former subjects of Mithridates who reverted to loyalty to him out of respect for his hereditary title as king (Dio 36.9.2).</span></p>
<p class="noindent">To such an extent was the sacrosanctity of the title king ingrained in those people.</p>
<h3><span class="bold">4</span>* 4M, 4Mc, inc. 31D, 5.5K</h3>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Possibly the same context as fr. 1. The comment made by the scholiast who preserves this fragment suggests that these words may have formed part of S.’s description of the battle in which Mithridates was wounded (Dio 36.9.5).</span></p>
<blockquote><p>and quick to action in battles</p></blockquote>
<h3><span class="bold">5</span> 5M, 5Mc, 3D, 4K</h3>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Possibly the same context as fr. 1, since Dio</span> <span class="italic">(36.9.5) mentions the fact that Mithridates took a direct role in battle, even though he was more than seventy years of age.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>though over seventy &lt;he was accustomed/able?&gt; when fully armed to spring up onto his horse</p></blockquote>
<h3><span class="bold">6</span>* 6M, 6Mc, 2D, 2K</h3>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Possibly a reference to the wound suffered by Mithridates in a battle with Lucullus’ legate Fabius Hadrianus in late 68, although that wound, caused by a stone, is said to have injured Mithridates’ knee, not his foot (App. </span>Mith.<span class="italic"> 88; cf. Dio 36.9.6).</span></p>
<blockquote><p>with a dislocated foot</p></blockquote>
