<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">In the late spring or summer of 87, Metellus Pius (pr. 89) and his army were summoned from Samnium, where he was battling Italians still in revolt, to defend Rome against Cinna and </span>Marius <span class="italic">(Dio fr. 102.7; App. </span>B Civ.<span class="italic"> 1.68).</span></p>
<blockquote><p>[the senate/consuls? ordered Metellus] to break off the war on whatever terms he could [work out with the Samnites]</p></blockquote>
<h3><span class="bold">26 </span>26M, 24Mc, 20D, 22K</h3>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Possibly a denial on the part of Cinna and Marius that they were bound by a prior agreement to refrain from doing as they pleased when Rome surrendered to them in late 87. Kritz, followed by Maurenbr., less plausibly connected these words with a denial by the consul Cinna in 87 that he was bound by his oath to uphold Sulla’s legislation of 88 (Plut. </span>Sull. <span class="italic">10.6–7).</span></p>
<blockquote><p>that no commitment had been made concerning the government and the freedom of the Roman people</p></blockquote>
<h3><span class="bold">27 </span>29M, 26Mc, 115D, 114K</h3>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Possibly describing the slaves who joined the side of Marius and Cinna in 87 in response to an offer of freedom (App. </span>B Civ.<span class="italic"> 1.69). In particular, perhaps describing the slaves known as “Bardyaei,” who formed Marius’ personal bodyguard and ran amuck after Rome fell to Marius and Cinna in late 87</span> <span class="italic">(Plut. </span>Mar.<span class="italic"> 43.4–5). Alternatively, the reference may be to people encountered abroad by Sertorius (in Mauretania) or by the governors of Cilicia or Macedonia.</span></p>
