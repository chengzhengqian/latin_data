<p>“But according to Sulla, <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">[fr. 49]</span><span class="br"></span>I who criticize the rewards of civil commotion am rebellious; I who reclaim the rights of peace am craving war. Evidently because you, the Roman people, will not otherwise be safe and sufficiently secure in your dominion, unless Vettius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL522_45_17" id="target_note_LCL522_45_17"><sup>17</sup></a> of Picenum and the clerk Cornelius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL522_45_18" id="target_note_LCL522_45_18"><sup>18</sup></a> squander assets belonging to others and acquired by honest means, unless all of you approve the proscription of innocent men on account of their wealth, the torture of distinguished citizens, the desolation of the City as a result of banishments and assassinations, the putting up for sale or the giving away of the goods of wretched citizens, as if those goods were the spoils of the Cimbri.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL522_45_19" id="target_note_LCL522_45_19"><sup>19</sup></a> But Sulla criticizes me for having possessions derived from the goods of the proscribed.

Let those sufferings be enough which we have endured as the product of frenzy: Roman armies fighting hand to hand against each other, and our arms turned away from outsiders against our very selves. Let there be an end of all crimes and outrages which fail to cause Sulla any feeling of regret, so much so that he counts them as deeds
