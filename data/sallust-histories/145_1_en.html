Cornelius Lentulus Clodianus and Gellius in separate battles in Picenum, and later their combined forces (App. </span>B Civ.<span class="italic"> 1.117; cf. Plut. </span>Crass. <span class="italic">9.9). This fragment may refer to the first or the second battle in which Lentulus suffered a loss despite, apparently, receiving support from a relief force led either by his own legates or by his colleague Gellius. (Italics in the translation signifies that the text or a supplement is uncertain.)</span></p>
