<p>“Do as you please! Make ready for yourselves the patronage of Cethegus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL522_71_23" id="target_note_LCL522_71_23"><sup>23</sup></a> and of other traitors, who are eager to renew looting and arson and to arm their hands once more against household gods.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL522_71_24" id="target_note_LCL522_71_24"><sup>24</sup></a> But if you prefer liberty and integrity, pass decrees worthy of your renown, and strengthen the inclination of brave men.
