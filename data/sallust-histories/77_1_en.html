lack of spirit for a task or a <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">[fr. 43]</span><span class="br"></span>lack of effort for carrying out decisions. Adversity and prosperity used to alter my resources, not my temperament. But in these present woes, on the contrary, along with Fortune everything has failed me. Furthermore, old age, which is burdensome on its own, doubles my anxiety, since I am not permitted in my wretchedness, near the end of my life,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL522_153_4" id="target_note_LCL522_153_4"><sup>4</sup></a> to hope for even an honorable death.
