<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">When the year 77 opened with an interregnum in the absence of consuls to assume office (§22), and M. Lepidus (cos. 78) was threatening Rome with an army (§§10, 22) to press his demand for a second consulship and the reversal of Sulla’s reforms, including the restoration of the powers of the tribunes (§14), the senior consular L. Marcius Philippus (cos. 91; cens. 86 under the Cinnan regime) argued for the passage of a </span>senatus consultum ultimum<span class="italic"> (§22) to crush Lepidus’ revolt. Although this speech gives the impression of being paired as a counterpoint to Lepidus’s speech (fr. 49), after the fashion of the speeches assigned to Caesar and Cato in the </span>Bellum Catilinae<span class="italic"> (§§51–52), the two speeches in Book 1 of the </span>Historiae<span class="italic"> were delivered approximately one year apart and would have stood at some distance from each other in the complete text of the </span>Historiae.</p>
