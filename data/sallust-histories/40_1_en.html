<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Sertorius took no part in the excesses perpetrated in the turmoil after the victory of Cinna and Marius in 87/86 BC (Plut. </span>Sert. <span class="italic">5.6).</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Amid the civil conflict, he seeks the repute of a just and decent man.</p>
<h3><span class="bold">79</span>* 91M, 81Mc, 57D, 28K</h3>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">In 83, Sertorius opposed allowing the soldiers in the armies of the consul Scipio and Sulla to fraternize </span>(vetante Sertorio colloquia, <span class="italic">Exsuper. 7 [45Z]; Plut. </span>Sert. <span class="italic">6.3–4); cf. fr. 31.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">And when, contrary to his desire, the soldiers were given an opportunity for conversation, corruption of a few occurred, and the army was given over to Sulla.</p>
<h3><span class="bold">80</span>* 92M, 80Mc, 57D, 28K</h3>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">After the desertion of the consul Scipio’s army to Sulla in 83 (see previous fragment) and the election of Cn. Carbo and the younger Marius (cf. fr. 32) to the consulship of 82, Sertorius expressed the view that “unless decisive resistance was offered to Sulla, all would be lost and the war effort would fail” (</span>cui nisi obviam iretur, actum iam ac debellatum foret, <span class="italic">Exsuper. 8 [50Z]).</span></p>
<blockquote><p>and unless resistance was offered to him in a like manner [equalling Sulla’s purposeful valor]</p></blockquote>
<h3><span class="bold">81</span>* 93M, 82Mc, 59D, K</h3>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Possibly words uttered by Sertorius in indirect discourse to win the support of the Spaniards, by alluding to his long-standing connection with the region (see fr. 76). Servius, to whom we owe this fragment, states that the words were used metaphorically </span>(ad laudem . . . non ad veritatem).</p>
<p>that Spain was his ancient native land</p>
