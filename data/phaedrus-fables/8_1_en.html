The Ass the Lion Go Hunting</span></h3>
<p>A man devoid of courage imposes upon strangers by cutting a figure with self-praise, but those who know him laugh at him.</p>
<p>A lion who chose to go hunting in company with an ass concealed him in the bushes and told him to frighten the wild animals with his bray, which would be strange to them. He himself would be waiting for them when they fled. Hereupon Long-Ears on a sudden roared his loudest with might and main, which threw the beasts into a panic, surprised by the novelty of it. They in terror dashed for their familiar exits, but were overpowered by the lion’s horrendous charge. The latter, when he was tired of killing, summoned the ass and told him to turn off the bray. Then the presumptuous fool said: “How about it? What do you think of my vocal performance?” “It was superb,” said the lion, “so much so that, if I hadn’t known your real mettle and how genuine an ass you are, I should have fled in terror like the others.”</p>
