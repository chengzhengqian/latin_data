Aesop and the Farmer</span></h3>
<p>One who has learned by experience is commonly believed to be a surer prophet than a soothsayer, but the reason for this is not told; it will gain currency now for the first time, thanks to my fable.</p>
<p>The ewes of a certain man who kept flocks gave birth to lambs with human heads. Being greatly alarmed at this prodigy and in deep dejection, he hastened to consult the soothsayers. One of them replied that this thing had reference to the owner’s life, and that he must avert the danger by the sacrifice of a victim; another declared the meaning to be that his wife was an adulteress and his children spurious, but this omen could be dispelled at the cost of a larger sacrificial victim. Why say more? They all had different opinions and they increased the man’s anxiety by the addition of greater anxiety. Aesop happened to be standing by, an old man of keen discernment, whom nature could never deceive; said he: “If you wish to take proper measures to avert this portent, farmer, give wives to your shepherds.”</p>
