Prometheus Again</span></h3>
<p>Someone else asked him what natural cause had produced tribads and effeminate males. The old man explained: “The same Prometheus, author of our common clay (which is broken as soon as it clashes with Fortune), had all day long been fashioning separately those natural parts which the sense of shame causes to be hidden by our clothing, that he might presently apply them to the proper bodies, when, quite unexpectedly, he was invited out to dinner by Bacchus. There he absorbed a great deal of nectar into his veins and returned home late in the evening with wavering steps. Then, with sleepy head and drunken fumbling, he fastened female parts on bodies of masculine sex and masculine parts on females. Hence lust now gratifies itself with a perverted pleasure.”</p>

The Bearded She-Goats</span></h3>
<p>When the she-goats had obtained, by application to Jupiter, the favour of a beard, the male goats were very unhappy about it and began to express their indignation that women had attained unto a dignity equal with their own. “Let them,” said Jupiter, “enjoy their empty glory and usurp your badge of service, so long as they are not your peers in stoutheartedness.”</p>
