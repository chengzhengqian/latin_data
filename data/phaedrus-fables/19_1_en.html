The Frogs Dread the Battle of the Bulls</span></h3>
<p>Poor folk suffer when the mighty quarrel.</p>
<p>A frog looking out from a marsh upon a combat between two bulls, exclaimed: “Alas, what great destruction is verging upon us!” Being asked by another frog why he said this, since those bulls were contending for the sovereignty of the herd and, as cattle, lived their lives at a distance from the frogs, he replied: “Granted that their range is remote from ours, and that their species is different, nevertheless, whichever of them is driven from the lordship of the meadow, and takes to flight, will come to the secret recesses of our marsh and will tread us down and crush us with his hard hoofs. Thus their fury has something to do with our own safety.”</p>

The Kite and the Doves</span></h3>
<p>He who entrusts himself to a scoundrel for protection is looking for help, but what he finds is total ruin.</p>
<p>When the doves had often fled from a certain kite and escaped death by the swiftness of their wings the bird of prey turned to treacherous negotiation, using these wily words with which to trick the peaceful clan: “Why do you prefer to live a life of anxiety rather than to make a treaty and choose me as your king? I would keep you safe from every wrong.”
