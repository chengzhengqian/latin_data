<p>One day an eagle carried off a fox’s cubs and put them in her nest as food for her fledglings to tear. The mother fox followed her and began to entreat her not to bring so great a grief upon her, a pitiable sufferer. The eagle regarded her with contempt, feeling safe from attack in her high place. The fox then snatched a firebrand from an altar and ringed the tree with fire, mixing a potion of grief for her foe which threatened the loss of her own brood. The eagle, in order to rescue her young from the danger of death, turned suppliant and restored to the fox her young ones unharmed.</p>

The Ass Insults The Boar</span></h3>
<p>Fools, in their efforts to raise a silly laugh, often inflict gross insults upon others and thereby stir up grave danger for themselves.</p>
<p>An ass on meeting a boar said: “Greetings, brother.” The boar, feeling insulted, spurned the salutation and asked why he chose to utter such a falsehood. The ass extended his yard and said: “If you mean to say that there is no likeness between us, I can assure you that <span class="italic">this</span> is very much like your snout.” The boar was inclined to attack, like a thoroughbred, but he suppressed his anger and said: “Revenge would be easy for me, but I don’t want to soil myself with such ignoble blood.”</p>
