not according to birth, but according to merit. Since another had forestalled me from being first in this field, I did my best to keep him from being the unique representative as well as the first, the only thing left that I could do. This is not envy, but emulation. Now if Latium shall look with favour upon my work she will have more authors to set against those of Greece; but if Jealousy chooses to disparage my efforts she will not, for all that, take away from me the consciousness of deserving praise. If my efforts reach cultivated ears, and if the readerâ€™s judgment sees evidence of poetic skill in my fables, then my good fortune dispels all grievances. But if, on the contrary, my learned toil falls foul of those pettifoggers, spawned by Nature in an ill-omened hour, whose only talent is to snap at their betters, then I shall steel my mind to endure the banishment decreed by Fate, till Fortune at length becomes ashamed of her verdict.</p>
