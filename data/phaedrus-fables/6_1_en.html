The Fox Before the Tragic Actor’s Mask</span></h3>
<p>A fox, after looking by chance at a tragic actor’s mask, remarked: “O what a majestic face is here, but it has no brains!”</p>
<p>This is a twit for those to whom Lady Luck has granted rank and renown, but denied them common sense.</p>

The Wolf and the Crane</span></h3>
<p>He who wants to serve rascals and be duly paid for it makes two mistakes: first, he helps the undeserving, and, secondly, he enters into a deal from which he cannot emerge without loss to himself.</p>
<p>A bone that he had gobbled stuck in a wolf’s throat. When the pain was too much for him he went about offering pay to one and another as an inducement if they would remove the offending object. At length a crane accepted, on the strength of a solemn oath. She mortgaged her neck full length in the wolf’s throat and performed a successful operation on him with great danger to herself. In return she demanded her fee according to contract, but the wolf retorted: “You ungrateful thing! Your head was in my mouth and you got it out intact, and now you stipulate that I am to pay you a bonus.”</p>
