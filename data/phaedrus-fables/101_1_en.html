Aesop and the Victorious Athlete</span></h3>
<h3>How boasting may sometimes be checked</h3>
<p>Once when the wise Phrygian saw that the victor in an athletic contest was too much inclined to boast about it, he asked him whether his opponent had been a man of greater strength than himself. “Don’t say that,” replied the athlete, “my strength proved to be much greater.” “Well then, you simpleton,” said Aesop, “what honour have you earned, if, being the stronger, you prevailed over a weaker man? You might be tolerated, if you were telling us that you overcame by skill a man who was superior to you in bodily strength.”</p>

The Ass and the Lyre</span></h3>
<h3>How genius is often lost through the accidents of fortune</h3>
<p>An ass saw a lyre lying in a meadow. He went up to it and tried the strings with his hoof; they sounded at his touch. “A pretty thing, on my faith,” said he, “but it has ended in failure, because I am ignorant of the art. If only someone of greater skill had found this, he might have charmed all ears with notes divine.”</p>
<p>Thus men of genius are often lost to fame through the accidents of fortune.</p>
