<p>A jackdaw, puffed up with empty pride, picked up some feathers that had fallen from a peacock and adorned himself with them. Next, scorning his own kinfolk, he pushed his way into a handsome flock of peacocks. But they stripped the brazen bird of those feathers and pecked him till he took to flight. Being thus roughly handled, the saddened jackdaw attempted to return to his own tribe; but, on being driven away by them also, he bore the burden of an ugly disgrace. Then one of those jackdaws whom he had previously despised remarked: “If you had been content with our station in life and had been willing to take what nature gave you, you would neither have experienced that first humiliation nor would your misfortune have felt the sting of our rebuff.”</p>
