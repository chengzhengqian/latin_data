The Old Dog and the Hunter</span></h3>
<p>A dog who had been bold and swift against all wild beasts, and had always so satisfied his master, began to grow feeble under the burden of years. One day when thrown into combat with a bristly boar he seized it by the ear, but owing to his decayed teeth his jaws lost their grip on the prey. The hunter was grieved at this and scolded the dog. But old Spartan replied: “It was not my spirit that failed you but my strength; praise me for what I was, if you condemn me now for what I am.”</p>
