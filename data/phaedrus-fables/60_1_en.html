oxen, beasts of burden, and farming equipment; to the drinker, a cellar full of casks of old wine, a luxuriously furnished house, and charming little gardens. When she was about to distribute to each the things thus marked out for them, and the people generally approved, since they knew the girls, Aesop suddenly stood forth in the midst of the crowd and exclaimed: “Oh, if their buried father still were conscious, how it would grieve him that the men of Athens could not interpret his will!” Then, when asked about it, he explained how they had all gone astray: “Give the house and the fine furniture, along with the lovely gardens and the old wines, to the spinner of wool, who lives in the country; assign the garments, the pearls, the attendants, and so on, to her who spends her life in dissipation; and as for the fields, the farmhouse, and the sheep along with the shepherds, give these to the meretricious girl. Not one of them will be able to endure the possession of what is alien to her taste. The ugly daughter will sell the wardrobe in order to provide herself with wine; the meretricious daughter will dispose of the farm land in order to buy fine clothes; and she who delights in flocks and is given to the spinning of wool will hand over her luxurious house for any price. Thus no one will have possession of what has been bequeathed to her, and they will severally bestow upon their mother the sum specified from the money received in exchange for the things they have sold.”</p>
