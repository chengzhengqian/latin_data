The Horse and the Wild Boar</span></h3>
<p>A wild boar in wallowing muddied the shallow water where a horse was accustomed to quench his thirst. The result was a quarrel between them. He of the sounding hoof, enraged at the beast, sought the help of a man, and, after taking him up on his back, returned, elated, against his enemy. When the knight with his weapons had killed this enemy he is said to have spoken as follows to the horse: “I am very glad to have brought you help in response to your entreaties; for I have captured a prize, and have come to know how useful you are.” And so he compelled the horse in spite of himself to submit to the reins. Then, in deep dejection, the horse said to himself: “I was a fool; while looking for revenge in a small matter, I have found slavery for myself.”</p>
<p>This fable will serve to warn hot-tempered men that it is better to suffer an injury with impunity than to put one’s self in the power of another.</p>
