<h3><span class="ac">Author’s Prologue</span></h3>
<p>That which is Aesopic in kind is confined to instructive examples; nor is anything else aimed at in fables than that the mistakes of mortals may be corrected, and that one may sharpen his wits by a close application to them. Accordingly, whatever jesting invention may appear in the course of my telling the old stories, provided that it catches the ear and serves its purpose, should be approved on its own merits, not by the weight of the author’s reputation. I shall indeed take every care to preserve the spirit of the famous old man; but if I choose to insert something of my own, in order that the variety of expression in details may please the taste, I would have you, Reader, take it in good part, provided that my brevity be a suitable recompense for the taking of that liberty. But lest my praise of this brevity be too wordy, listen to the reason why you ought to say no to the greedy, but to the modest even proffer that for which they have not asked.</p>
