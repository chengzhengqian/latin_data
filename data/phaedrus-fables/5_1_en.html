The Cow, the She-Goat, the Sheep, and the Lion</span></h3>
<p>To go shares with the mighty is never a safe investment. This little fable bears witness to my statement.</p>
<p>A cow, a she-goat, and a sheep, patient sufferer when wronged, went into partnership with a lion in the forest. When they had captured a stag of mighty bulk the lion made four portions and spoke as follows: “I take the first portion by virtue of my title, since I am addressed as king; the second portion you will assign to me because I am a partner; then, since I am superior to you in strength, the third portion will come my way; and it will be too bad for anyone who meddles with the fourth.” Thus all the booty was carried off by ruthlessness alone.</p>

The Frogs Complain Against The Sun</span></h3>
<p>Aesop saw a large crowd at the wedding of his neighbour, a thief, and at once began this fable:</p>
<p>Once upon a time, when the Sun was minded to take a wife, the frogs raised their clamour to the stars. Jove, disturbed by the noise, asked what they had to complain about. Then up spoke a denizen of the pond and said: “Even now, when he is the only one of his kind, he dries up all the ponds and causes us poor creatures to die in waterless abodes. What, pray, will happen when he procreates?”</p>
