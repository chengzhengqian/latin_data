What The Ass Said to the Old Shepherd</span></h3>
<p>A change of sovereignty brings to the poor nothing more than a change in the name of their master. The truth of this is shown by the following little tale.</p>
<p>A timorous old man was pasturing an ass in a meadow. Alarmed by the sudden war cry of enemy soldiers approaching, he urged the ass to flee for fear of capture. But the stubborn beast replied: “I ask you, are you assuming that the conqueror will load me with two packs at a time?” “No,” said the old man. “Then,” said the ass, “what difference does it make to me whose slave I am, so long as I carry only one pack at a time?”</p>
