The Peacock Complains to Juno about His Voice</span></h3>
<p>A peacock came to Juno complaining with injured pride that she had not given him the tuneful voice of a nightingale, whose song was admired by all who heard it, while he himself was laughed to scorn the moment he uttered a sound. Then to console him the goddess said: “But in beauty you surpass the nightingale; you surpass her in size. The brilliance of the emerald glitters on your neck, you spread a tail bedecked with jewels and gaily painted feathers.” “But what is the use of giving me a silent beauty if I am humiliated by my voice?” “It is by the will of the Fates that your respective lots have been assigned; to you beauty, strength to the eagle, to the nightingale melody, to the raven prophecy, unfavorable omens to the crow. All these are contented with their own particular gifts; strive not for that which has not been given to you, lest your hope be deluded and relapse into self-pity.”</p>
