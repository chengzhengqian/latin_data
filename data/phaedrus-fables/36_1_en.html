The Panther and the Shepherds</span></h3>
<p>Those who are scorned usually pay in the same coin.</p>
<p>Once a panther inadvertently fell into a pit. The country people saw her there. Some of them brought clubs, others piled stones on her; still others felt sorry for her, as being likely to die, though no one harmed her, and these tossed bread to her that she might keep herself alive. Night came on and the men went home unconcerned, thinking that they would find her dead on the following day. But the panther, having recruited her failing strength, with a quick leap freed herself from the pit and hastened to her lair at a swift pace. After a few days she sallied forth again, slaughtered the sheep, killed the shepherds themselves, and laid everything waste in the exercise of her violent and savage fury. Hereupon even those who had spared the beast began to be afraid for themselves; they made no complaint about lost property but only begged for their lives. But she said to them: “I remember who attacked me with stones, and who gave me bread. As for you, cease to be afraid; I return as an enemy only to those who injured me.”</p>
