If anyone hereafter shall be deceived by his own suspicions, and, by rashly appropriating to himself the moral that belongs to all alike, shall expose his own bad conscience, none the less I hope that he will pardon me. For in fact it is not my intention to brand individuals, but to display life itself and the ways of men and women.</p>
<p>Perhaps someone will say that I have undertaken a weighty task. If Aesop the Phrygian, if Anacharsis
the Scythian, could, by the exercise of their inborn talents, establish an everlasting fame, why should I, who am nearer by birth to the literary land of Greece, through sleepy indolence fail to uphold my country’s fame?
