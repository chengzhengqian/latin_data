The Poet to Particulo</span></h3>
<p>There are still many themes left over that I might treat, and I have on hand an abundant variety of subjects; but witticisms, though pleasing in moderation, are offensive in excess. Therefore, Particulo, most honoured sir, you may approve, if not of my talent, at least of my brevity, since your name is bound to live in my writings as long as Latin literature is valued. This brevity of mine deserves all the more to be commended, in proportion as long-winded poets are a greater nuisance.</p>
