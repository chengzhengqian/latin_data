<h3>Not our past but our present fortune should be considered</h3>
<p>A butterfly saw a wasp flying about near by. “Ah,” said he, “how unjust is my lot!

Phaedrus thinks of himself in the likeness of the wasp; he has been despised in the past, but now he has a sting, in his satire.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL436_415_a').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
