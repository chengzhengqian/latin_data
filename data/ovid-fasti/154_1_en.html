without any city walls: scattered kine pastured on either bank; and I, the Tiber, whom the nations now both know and fear, was then a thing to be despised even by cattle. You often hear mention of the name of Arcadian Evander<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL253_309_a" id="target_note_LCL253_309_a"><sup>a</sup></a>: he came from far and churned my waters with his oars.
