with unnumbered fish. That force first stripped man of his savage garb; from it he learned decent attire and personal cleanliness. A lover was the first, they say, to serenade by night the mistress who denied him entrance, while he sang at her barred door, and to win the heart of a coy maid was eloquence indeed; every man then pleaded his own cause. This goddess has been the mother of a thousand arts; the wish to please has given birth to many inventions that were unknown before. And shall any man dare rob this goddess of the honour of giving her name to the second month? Far from me be such a frenzy. Besides, while everywhere the goddess is powerful and her temples are thronged with worshippers, she possesses yet more authority in our city. Venus, Ο Roman, bore arms for thy Troy, what time she groaned at the spear wound in her dainty hand<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL253_197_a" id="target_note_LCL253_197_a"><sup>a</sup></a>; and by a Trojan’s verdict she defeated two heavenly goddesses.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL253_197_b" id="target_note_LCL253_197_b"><sup>b</sup></a> Ah would that they had not remembered their defeat!

In spring the landscape glistens; soft is the soil in spring; now the corn pushes its blades through the cleft ground; now the vine-shoot protrudes its buds in the swelling bark. Lovely Venus deserves the lovely season and is attached, as usual, to her dear Mars: in spring she bids the curved ships fare across her natal seas and fear no more the threats of winter.</p>
