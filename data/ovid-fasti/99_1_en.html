<p><sup>133</sup> Duly do ye worship the goddess, ye Latin mothers and brides, and ye, too, who wear not the fillets and long robe.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL253_199_a" id="target_note_LCL253_199_a"><sup>a</sup></a> Take off the golden necklaces from the marble neck of the goddess<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL253_199_b" id="target_note_LCL253_199_b"><sup>b</sup></a>; take off her gauds; the goddess must be washed from top to toe.
