that there are two Bears, of which the Sidonians steer by Cynosura,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL253_129_a" id="target_note_LCL253_129_a"><sup>a</sup></a> while the Grecian mariner keeps his eye on Helice<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL253_129_b" id="target_note_LCL253_129_b"><sup>b</sup></a>? and that the signs which the brother travels through in a long year the horses of the sister traverse in a single month<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL253_129_c" id="target_note_LCL253_129_c"><sup>c</sup></a>? The stars ran their courses free and unmarked throughout the year; yet everybody agreed that they were gods. Heaven’s gliding ensigns were beyond their reach, not so their own, to lose which was a great crime. Their ensigns were of hay, but as deep reverence was paid to hay as now you see paid to the eagles. A long pole carried the hanging bundles (<span class="italic">maniplos</span>); from them the private (<span class="italic">maniplaris</span>) soldier takes his name. Hence through ignorance and lack of science they reckoned lustres, each of which was too short by ten months. A year was counted when the moon had returned to the full for the tenth time: that number was then in great honour, whether because that is the number of the fingers by which we are wont to count, or because a woman brings forth in twice five months, or because the numerals increase up to ten, and from that we start a fresh round. Hence Romulus divided the hundred senators into ten groups, and instituted ten companies of spearmen (<span class="italic">hastati</span>); and just so many companies there were of first-line men (<span class="italic">principes</span>), and also of javelin-men (<span class="italic">pilani</span>); and so too with the men who served on horses furnished by the state. Nay, Romulus assigned just the same number of divisions to the tribes, the Titienses, the Ramnes, as they are called, and the Luceres. Therefore in his arrangement of the year he kept the familiar number. That is the period for which a sad wife mourns for her husband.</p>
