<p><sup>135</sup> If you would convince yourself that the Kalends of March were really the beginning of the year, you may refer to the following proofs: the laurel branch of the flamens, after remining in its place the whole year, is removed (on that day), and fresh leaves are put in the place of honour; then the king’s door is green with the tree of Phoebus, which is set at it; and at thy portal, Old Chapel of the Wards, the same thing is done;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL253_131_a" id="target_note_LCL253_131_a"><sup>a</sup></a> the withered laurel is withdrawn from the Ilian<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL253_131_b" id="target_note_LCL253_131_b"><sup>b</sup></a> hearth, that Vesta also may make a brave show, dressed in fresh leaves. Besides ’tis said that a new fire is lighted in her secret shrine, and the rekindled flame gains strength.
