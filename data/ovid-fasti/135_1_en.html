The reason for the epithet<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL253_271_a" id="target_note_LCL253_271_a"><sup>a</sup></a> applied to them is that they guard all things by their eyes. They also stand for us, and preside over the City walls, and they are present and bring us aid. But a dog, carved out of the same stone, used to stand before their feet. What was the reason for its standing with the Lar? Both guard the house: both are faithful to their master: cross-roads are dear to the god,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL253_271_b" id="target_note_LCL253_271_b"><sup>b</sup></a> crossroads are dear to dogs: the Lar and Diana’s pack give chase to thieves; and wakeful are the Lares, and wakeful too are dogs. I sought for the images of the twin gods, but by the force of yearlong time they had decayed. In the City there are a thousand Lares, and the Genius of the chief, who handed them over to the public; the parishes worship the three divinities.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL253_271_c" id="target_note_LCL253_271_c"><sup>c</sup></a></p>

There is a natural knoll, which gives its name to the place; they call it the Rock<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL253_271_e" id="target_note_LCL253_271_e"><sup>e</sup></a>; it forms a good part of the hill. On it Remus took his stand in vain, what time, birds of the Palatine, ye did vouchsafe the first omens to his brother. There, on the gentle slope of the ridge, the Senate founded a temple which abhors the eyes of males. It was dedicated by an heiress of the ancient name of the Clausi, who in her virgin body had never known a man:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL253_271_f" id="target_note_LCL253_271_f"><sup>f</sup></a> Livia restored it, that she might imitate her husband and follow him in everything.</p>
