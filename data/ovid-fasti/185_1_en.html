the City and retired to Tibur<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL253_371_a" id="target_note_LCL253_371_a"><sup>a</sup></a>: once upon a time Tibur was a place of exile! The hollow flute was missed in the theatre, missed at the altars; no dirge accompanied the bier on the last march. At Tibur there was a certain man who had been a slave, but had long been free, a man worthy of any rank. In his country place he made ready a banquet and invited the tuneful throng; they gathered to the festal board. It was night, and their eyes and heads swam with wine, when a messenger arrived with a made-up tale, and thus he spoke (to the freedman): ‘Break up the banquet without delay, for see here comes the master of thy rod<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL253_371_b" id="target_note_LCL253_371_b"><sup>b</sup></a>!’ Immediately the guests bestirred their limbs, reeling with heady wine; their shaky legs or stood or slipped.
