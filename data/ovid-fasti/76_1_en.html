<p><sup>429</sup> The Nones of March have only one mark<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL253_153_a" id="target_note_LCL253_153_a"><sup>a</sup></a> in the calendar, because they think that on that day the temple of Veiovis was consecrated in front of the two groves.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL253_153_b" id="target_note_LCL253_153_b"><sup>b</sup></a> When Romulus surrounded the grove with a high stone wall, “Take refuge here,” said he, “whoe’er thou art; thou shalt be safe.” Ο from how small a beginning the Roman took his rise!
