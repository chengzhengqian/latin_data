<p><sup>617</sup> The next day received its name of Caristia from dear (<span class="italic">cari</span>) kinsfolk. A crowd of near relations comes to meet the family gods. Sweet it is, no doubt, to recall our thoughts to the living soon as they have dwelt upon the grave and on the dear ones dead and gone; sweet, too, after so many lost, to look upon those of our blood who are left, and to count kin with them. Come none but the innocent! Far, far from here be the unnatural brother, and the mother who is harsh to her own offspring, he whose father lives too long, he who reckons up his mother’s years, and the unkind mother-in-law who hates and maltreats her daughter-in-law. Here is no place for the brothers, scions of Tantalus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL253_103_a" id="target_note_LCL253_103_a"><sup>a</sup></a> for Jason’s wife,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL253_103_b" id="target_note_LCL253_103_b"><sup>b</sup></a> for her who gave to husbandmen the toasted seeds,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL253_103_c" id="target_note_LCL253_103_c"><sup>c</sup></a> for Procne and her sister,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL253_103_da" id="target_note_LCL253_103_da"><sup>d</sup></a> for Tereus, cruel to them both, and for him, whoe’er he be, who amasses wealth by crime. Give incense to the family gods, ye virtuous ones (on that day above all others Concord is said to lend her gentle presence); and offer food, that the Lares, in their girt-up robes, may feed at the platter presented to them as a pledge of the homage that they love. And now, when dank night invites to slumber calm, fill high the wine-cup for the prayer and say, “Hail to you! hail to thee, Father of thy Country, Caesar the Good!” and let good speech attend the pouring of the wine.</p>

In the end, Procne become a nightingale, Philomela a swallow, and Tereus a hoopoe.
