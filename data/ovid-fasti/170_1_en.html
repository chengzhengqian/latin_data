some part than to another, and the universe would not have the earth as its central weight. There stands a globe hung by Syracusan art in closed air, a small image of the vast vault of heaven, and the earth is equally distant from the top and bottom.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL253_341_a" id="target_note_LCL253_341_a"><sup>a</sup></a> That is brought about by its round shape. The form of the temple is similar: there is no projecting angle in it; a dome protects it from the showers of rain.</p>
<p><sup>283</sup> you ask why the goddess is tended by virgin ministers. Of that also I will discover the true causes. They say that Juno and Ceres were born of Ops by Saturn’s seed; the third daughter was Vesta. The other two married; both are reported to have had offspring; of the three one remained, who refused to submit to a husband. What wonder if a virgin delights in a virgin minister and allows only chaste hands to touch her sacred things? Conceive of Vesta as naught but the living flame, and you see that no bodies are born of flame. Rightly, therefore, is she a virgin who neither gives nor takes seeds, and she loves companions in her virginity.</p>
<p><sup>295</sup> Long did I foolishly think that there were images of Vesta: afterwards I learned that there are none under her curved dome. An undying fire is hidden in that temple; but there is no effigy of Vesta nor of the fire. The earth stands by its own power; Vesta is so called from standing by power (<span class="italic">vi stando</span>); and the reason of her Greek name may be similar.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL253_341_b" id="target_note_LCL253_341_b"><sup>b</sup></a> But the hearth (<span class="italic">focus</span>) is so named from the flames, and because it fosters (<span class="italic">fovet</span>) all things; yet formerly it stood in the first room of the house. Hence, too, I am of opinion that the vestibule took its name;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL253_341_ca" id="target_note_LCL253_341_ca"><sup>c</sup></a> it
