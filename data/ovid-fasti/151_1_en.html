he sees Romulus carrying on his shoulders the arms of the conquered leader,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL253_303_a" id="target_note_LCL253_303_a"><sup>a</sup></a> and their famous deeds inscribed beneath the statues arranged in order. He beholds, too, the name of Augustus on the front of the temple; and the building seems to him still greater, when he reads the name of Caesar. Augustus had vowed it in his youth at the time when he took up arms in duty’s cause.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL253_303_b" id="target_note_LCL253_303_b"><sup>b</sup></a> Deeds so great were worthy to inaugurate a prince’s reign. While the loyal troops stood on the one side, and the conspirators on the other, he stretched forth his hands and spoke these words: “If my father,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL253_303_c" id="target_note_LCL253_303_c"><sup>c</sup></a> Vesta’s priest, is my warrant for waging war, and I do now prepare to avenge both his divinity and hers, come, Mars, and glut the sword with knavish blood, and grant thy favour to the better cause. Thou shalt receive a temple, and shalt be called Avenger, when victory is mine.” So he vowed, and returned rejoicing from the routing of the foe. Nor is he content to have earned once for all the surname of Avenger for Mars: he tracks down the standards detained by the hands of the Parthians. These were a nation whom their plains, their horses, and their arrows rendered safe, and surrounding rivers made inaccessible. The pride of the nation had been fostered by the deaths of Crassus and his son, when soldiers, general, and standards perished together.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL253_303_d" id="target_note_LCL253_303_d"><sup>d</sup></a> The Parthians kept the Roman standards, the glory of war, and a foe was the standard-bearer of the Roman eagle. That shame would have endured till now, had not Ausonia’s empire been guarded by Caesar’s powerful arms. He put an end to the old reproach, to the disgrace of a whole generation: the recovered standards knew their true owners again.
