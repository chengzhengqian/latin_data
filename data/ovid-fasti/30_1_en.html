now it is; the month that follows January was the last of the old year.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL253_61_a" id="target_note_LCL253_61_a"><sup>a</sup></a> Thy worship too, Ο Terminus, formed the close of all the sacred rites. For the month of Janus came first because the door (<span class="italic">janua</span>) comes first; that month was nethermost which to the nether shades was consecrated. Afterwards the Decemvirs are believed to have joined together times which had been parted by a long interval.</p>
<span class="label"><span class="sc">Kal. Feb.</span> 1st</span>
<p><sup>55</sup> At the beginning of the month Saviour (<span class="italic">Sospita</span>) Juno, the neighbour of the Phrygian Mother Goddess, is said to have been honoured with new shrines. If you ask, where are now the temples which on those Kalends were dedicated to the goddess? tumbled down they are with the long lapse of time. All the rest had in like sort gone to wrack and ruin, had it not been for the far-seeing care of our sacred chief, under whom the shrines feel not the touch of eld; and not content with doing favours to mankind he does them to the gods. Ο saintly soul, who dost build and rebuild the temples, I pray the powers above may take such care of thee as thou of them! May the celestials grant thee the length of years which thou bestowest on them, and may they stand on guard before thy house!</p>
<p><sup>67</sup> Then, too, the grove of Alernus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL253_61_b" id="target_note_LCL253_61_b"><sup>b</sup></a> is thronged with worshippers, fast by the spot where Tiber, coming from afar, makes for the ocean waves. At Numa’s sanctuary,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL253_61_c" id="target_note_LCL253_61_c"><sup>c</sup></a> at the Thunderer’s fane upon the Capitol, and on the summit of Jove’s citadel a sheep is slain. Often, muffled in clouds, the sky discharges heavy rains, or under fallen snow the earth is hid.</p>
