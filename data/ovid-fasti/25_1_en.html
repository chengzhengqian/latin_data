Seeing me puzzled, the Muse observed, “That day is appointed by the priests. Why look for movable feasts in the calendar? And while the day of the feast may shift, the season is fixed: it is when the seed has been shown and the field fertilized.” Ye steers, take your stand with garlands on your heads at the full crib: with the warm spring your toil will return.

Ο grant unto the tender seeds unbroken increase; let not the sprouting shoot be nipped by chilly snows.
