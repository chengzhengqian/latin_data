reason why a crowd of drabs frequents these games is not hard to discover. She is none of your glum, none of your high-flown ones: she wishes her rites to be open to the common herd; and she warns us to use life’s flower, while it still blooms; for the thorn, she reminds us, is flouted when the roses have fallen away.</p>
<p><sup>355</sup> But why is it that whereas white robes are given out at the festival of Ceres, Flora is neatly clad in attire of many colours? Is it because the harvest whitens when the ears are ripe, but flowers are of every hue and every shape? She nodded assent and at the motion of her tresses the flowers dropped down, as falls the rose cast by a hand upon a table.</p>
<p><sup>361</sup> There yet remained the lights, the reason whereof escaped me; when the goddess thus removed my doubts: “Lights are thought to befit my days either because the fields do glow with purple flowers; or because neither flowers nor flames are of a dull colour, and the splendour of both attracts the eye; or because nocturnal licence befits my revels. The third reason conies nearest the truth.”</p>
<p><sup>369</sup> “There is yet a small matter about which it remains, with thy leave, to put a question.” “Thou hast my leave.” said she. “Why, instead of Libyan lionesses, are unwarlike roes and shy hares pent in thy nets<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL253_287_a" id="target_note_LCL253_287_a"><sup>a</sup></a>?” She replied that her province was not woods, but gardens and fields, where no fierce beast may come.</p>
<p><sup>375</sup> Her tale was ended, and she vanished into thin air. A fragrance lingered; you could know a goddess had been there. That Naso’s lay may bloom for aye, O strew, 1 pray thee, goddess, thy boons upon my breast!</p>
