Then to me he said, “Thou askest why an unwonted victim<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL253_259_a" id="target_note_LCL253_259_a"><sup>a</sup></a> is assigned to these rites?” Indeed, I had asked the question. “Learn the cause,” the flamen said. “There is a Dog (they call it the Icarian dog),<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL253_259_b" id="target_note_LCL253_259_b"><sup>b</sup></a> and when that constellation rises the earth is parched and dry, and the crop ripens too soon. This dog is put on the altar instead of the starry dog, and the only reason why this happens is his name.”</p>

<p><sup>943</sup> When the spouse of Tithonus has left the brother of Phrygian Assaracus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL253_259_c" id="target_note_LCL253_259_c"><sup>c</sup></a> and thrice has lifted up her radiant light in the vast firmament, there comes a goddess decked with garlands of a thousand varied flowers, and the stage enjoys a customary licence of mirth. The rites of Flora also extend into the Kalends of May. Then I will resume the theme: now a loftier task is laid upon me. O Vesta, take thy day! Vesta has been received in the home of her kinsman: so have the Fathers righteously decreed. Phoebus owns part of the house; another part has been given up to Vesta; what remains is occupied by Caesar himself. Long live the laurels of the Palatine! Long live the house wreathed with the oaken boughs! A single house holds three eternal gods.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL253_259_da" id="target_note_LCL253_259_da"><sup>d</sup></a></p>
