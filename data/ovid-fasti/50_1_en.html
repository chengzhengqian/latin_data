troop he spake aloud: “Your sister is her own enemy, and shuns that union with the supreme god which is all for her good. Pray look to her interests and to mine, for what is a great pleasure to me will be a great boon to your sister. When she flees, stop her on the edge of the bank, lest she plunge into the water of the river.” He spake.

It chanced there was a Naiad nymph, Lara by name; but her old name was the first syllable repeated twice, and that was given her to mark her failing.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL253_101_b" id="target_note_LCL253_101_b"><sup>b</sup></a> Many a time Almo<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL253_101_c" id="target_note_LCL253_101_c"><sup>c</sup></a> had said to her, “My daughter, hold thy tongue,” but hold it she did not.

She even visited Juno and, after expressing her pity for married dames, “Your husband,” quoth she, “is in love with the Naiad Juturna.” Jupiter fumed and wrenched from her the tongue she had used so indiscreetly.
