<p><sup>437</sup>Alas, how alarmed the Senate was when the temple of Vesta caught fire, and the goddess was almost buried under her own roof! Holy fires blazed, fed by wicked fires, and a profane flame was blent with a pious flame. Amazed the priestesses wept with streaming hair; fear had bereft them of bodily strength. Metellus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL253_353_b" id="target_note_LCL253_353_b"><sup>b</sup></a> rushed into their midst and in a loud voice cried, “Hasten ye to the rescue! There is no help in weeping. Take up in your virgin hands the pledges given by fate; it is not by prayers but by deed that they can be saved. Woe’s me, do ye hesitate?” said he. He saw that they hesitated and sank trembling on their knees. He took up water, and lifting up his hands, “Pardon me, ye sacred things,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL253_353_c" id="target_note_LCL253_353_c"><sup>c</sup></a>” said he, “I, a man, will enter a place where no man should set foot. If it is a crime, let the punishment of the deed fall on me! May I pay with my head the penalty, so Rome go free!” With these words he burst in. The goddess whom he carried off approved the deed and was saved by the devotion of her pontiff.</p>
<p><sup>455</sup> Ye sacred flames, now ye shine bright under Caesar’s rule; the fire is now and will continue to be on the Ilian hearths, and it will not be told that under his leadership any priestess defiled her sacred fillets, and none shall be buried in the live ground.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL253_353_d" id="target_note_LCL253_353_d"><sup>d</sup></a> That is the doom of her who proves unchaste; because she is put away in the earth which she contaminated, since Earth and Vesta are one and the same deity.</p>
