<p><sup>733</sup> When that day also has been received by Galatea in her father’s waters, and all the world is sunk in untroubled sleep, there rises above the horizon the young man blasted by the bolts of his grandsire and stretches out his hands, entwined with twin snakes.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL253_377_c" id="target_note_LCL253_377_c"><sup>c</sup></a> Familiar is the tale of Phaedra’s love, familiar, too, the wrong that Theseus did, when, too confiding, he did curse his son to death.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL253_377_d" id="target_note_LCL253_377_d"><sup>d</sup></a> Doomed by his piety, the youth was journeying to Troezen, when a bull cleft with his breast the waters in his path.
