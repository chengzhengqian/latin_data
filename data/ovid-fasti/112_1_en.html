and Didyme, and Acragas, and Tauromenum, and the Mylae,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL253_225_a" id="target_note_LCL253_225_a"><sup>a</sup></a> where are the rich pastures of the sacred kine. Next she came to Camerina, and Thapsus, and the Tempe of Helorus, and where Eryx lies for ever open to the western breeze. Already had she traversed Pelorias, and Lilybaeum, and Pachynum, the three horns of her land. And wherever she set her foot she filled every place with her sad plaints, as when the bird doth mourn her Itys lost.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL253_225_b" id="target_note_LCL253_225_b"><sup>b</sup></a> In turn she cried, now “Persephone!” now “Daughter!” She cried and shouted either name by turns; but neither did Persephone hear Ceres, nor the daughter hear her mother; both names by turns died away. And whether she spied a shepherd or a husbandman at work, her one question was, “Did a girl pass this way?” Now o’er the landscape stole a sober hue, and darkness hid the world: now the watchful dogs were hushed. Lofty Etna lies over the mouth of huge Typhoeus, whose fiery breath sets the ground aglow.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL253_225_c" id="target_note_LCL253_225_c"><sup>c</sup></a> There the goddess kindled two pine-trees to serve her as a light; hence to this day a torch is given out at the rites of Ceres. There is a cave all fretted with the seams of scolloped pumice, a region not to be approached by man or beast. Soon as she came hither, she yoked the bitted serpents to her car and roamed, unwetted, o’er the ocean waves. She shunned the Syrtes, and Zanclaean Charybdis, and you, ye Nisaean hounds,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL253_225_d" id="target_note_LCL253_225_d"><sup>d</sup></a> monsters of shipwreck; she shunned the Adriatic, stretching far and wide, and Corinth of the double seas.</p>
<p><sup>502</sup> Thus she came to thy havens, land of Attica.
