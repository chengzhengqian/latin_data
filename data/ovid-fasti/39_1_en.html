brought hither by the Pelasgians.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL253_79_a" id="target_note_LCL253_79_a"><sup>a</sup></a> You ask, Why then do the Luperci run? and why do they strip themselves and bear their bodies naked, for so it is their wont to run? The god himself loves to scamper, fleet of foot, about the high mountains, and he himself takes suddenly to flight. The god himself is nude and bids his ministers go nude: besides, raiment sorted not well with running. The Arcadians are said to have possessed their land before the birth of Jove, and that folk is older than the moon.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL253_79_b" id="target_note_LCL253_79_b"><sup>b</sup></a> Their life was like that of beasts, unprofitably
spent; artless as yet and raw was the common herd. Leaves did they use for houses, herbs for corn: water scooped up in two hollows of the hands to them was nectar. No bull panted under the weight of the bent ploughshare: no land was under the dominion of the husbandman: there was as yet no use for horses, every man carried his own weight: the sheep went clothed in its own wool. Under the open sky they lived and went about naked, inured to heavy showers and rainy winds. Even to this day the unclad ministers recall the memory of the olden custom and attest what comforts the ancients knew.</p>
<p><sup>303</sup> But to explain why Faunus should particularly eschew the use of drapery a merry tale is handed down from days of old. As chance would have it, the Tirynthian youth was walking in the company of his mistress<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL253_79_c" id="target_note_LCL253_79_c"><sup>c</sup></a>; Faunus saw them both from a high ridge. He saw and burned. “Ye mountain elves,” quoth he, “I’m done with you. Yon shall be my true flame.”
