The island, which the river hems in with its parted waters, received him whom the nymph Coronis bore to Phoebus.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL253_23_b" id="target_note_LCL253_23_b"><sup>b</sup></a> Jupiter has his share of the site.

<p><sup>295</sup> what is to stop me if I should tell also of the stars, their risings and their settings? That was part of my promise. Ah happy souls, who first took thought to know these things and scale the heavenly mansions! Well may we believe they lifted up their heads alike above the frailties and the homes of men. Their lofty natures neither love nor wine did break, nor civil business nor the toils of war; no low ambition tempted them, nor glory’s tinsel sheen, nor lust of hoarded pelf. The distant stars they brought within our ken, and heaven itself made subject to their wit. So man may reach the sky: no need that Ossa on Olympus should be piled, and that Pelion’s peak should touch the topmost stars. Under these leaders we, too, will plumb the sky and give their own days to the wandering signs.</p>
