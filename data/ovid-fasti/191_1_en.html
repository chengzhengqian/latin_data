<p><sup>795</sup> To-morrow is the birthday of the Kalends of July. Pierides, put the last touches to my undertaking. Tell me, Pierides, who associated you with him to whom his stepmother was forced to yield reluctantly.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL253_383_b" id="target_note_LCL253_383_b"><sup>b</sup></a> So I spoke, and Clio answered me thus: “Thou dost behold the monument of that famous Philip from whom the chaste Marcia is descended, Marcia who derives her name from sacrificial Ancus, and whose beauty matches her noble birth.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL253_383_ca" id="target_note_LCL253_383_ca"><sup>c</sup></a> In her the figure answers to the soul; in her we find lineage and beauty and genius all at once. Nor deem our praise of figure base; on the same ground we praise great goddesses. The mother’s sister of Caesar was once married to that Philip.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL253_383_d" id="target_note_LCL253_383_d"><sup>d</sup></a> O florious dame! O lady worthy of that sacred house!” So Clio sang. Her learned sisters chimed in; Alcides bowed assent and twanged his lyre.</p>
