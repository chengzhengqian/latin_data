Servius Sulpicius Rufus, son of Quintus, of the tribe Lemonia,
has deserved of the Republic to be honored by the
said distinctions, that the senate resolve and deem it in the
public interest that the curule aediles suspend their standing
order concerning funerals<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL507_91_7" id="target_note_LCL507_91_7"><sup>7</sup></a> insofar as concerns the funeral
of Servius Sulpicius Rufus, son of Quintus, of the
tribe Lemonia; further that the consul Gaius Pansa, assign
a space thirty feet square for a tomb in the Campus
Esquilinus, or wherever shall be thought fitting, to which
Servius Sulpicius shall be conveyed, which tomb shall belong
to him and his children and descendants with the full
legal title appertaining to a tomb by public grant.”</p>
