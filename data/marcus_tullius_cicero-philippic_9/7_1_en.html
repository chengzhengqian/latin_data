as was first erected for Lucius Sulla. For Servius had an extraordinary
love for the modesty of our ancestors and used
to criticize the extravagances of the present epoch. It is
therefore by his authority and desire as it were, just as if he
were here for me to ask his wishes, that I propose a bronze
statue on foot; and it will lessen and ease our countrymen’s
deep grief and sense of loss by the honor of a memorial.</p>
<p>And this proposal of mine, Members of the Senate,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">14</span><span class="br"></span>
must necessarily find support in the motion of Publius
Servilius, who proposed that Servius Sulpicius be voted a
public tomb, but argued against a statue. For if the death
of an envoy without bloodshed and weapons calls for no
honor, why does he propose the honor of public burial, the
greatest honor that can be conferred upon a dead man?
But if he grants Servius Sulpicius something not given to
Gnaeus Octavius, why is he opposed to giving the former
what was given to the latter? Our ancestors decreed statues
for many, but public tombs only for a few. But statues
perish by weather, physical force, or age, whereas the sanctity
of tombs is inherent in the soil itself, which no physical
force can remove or obliterate; and while other things are
destroyed by the lapse of time, tombs only grow more
sacred. Therefore, let this man, on whom no honor can be<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">15</span><span class="br"></span>
conferred beyond his deserving, be glorified by this honor
also; let us show ourselves grateful in distinguishing the
death of one to whom we can now make no other return.
Also let there be branded the criminal audacity of Marcus
Antonius as he wages a wicked war. For in these honors
paid to Servius Sulpicius there will remain for all time a
testimony to Antonius’ repudiation and rejection of the
mission.</p>
