decline to attempt with even his last breath whether he
could render any service to the Republic. So not winter’s
violence, nor snow, nor the length of the journey, nor the
roughness of the roads, nor his worsening illness held him
back; and when finally he reached the point of meeting and

outstandingly in that you both urged us to honor Servius
Sulpicius and yourself eulogized him at abundant length.
After what you have said, I should do no more than present
a motion, were it not that I feel some answer should be
given to Publius Servilius, an illustrious gentleman, who
has given it as his opinion that this honor of a statue ought
to be conferred only on an envoy killed by the sword in the
course of his mission. Now I, Members of the Senate, interpret
our ancestors’ intention to have been that the cause
of death be examined, not the manner of it. They wanted
there to be a monument to an envoy whose actual mission
had cost him his life, so that in dangerous wars people
should undertake such missions more boldly. So we
should not just look for precedents of our ancestors, but
make plain their design out of which those very precedents
arose.</p>
