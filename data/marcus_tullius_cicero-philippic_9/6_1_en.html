expertise of his in the interpretation of our laws and the
unfolding of equity. If all who at any period have had understanding
of jurisprudence in this community were
brought together in one place, there would be no comparing
them with Servius Sulpicius. For he was an expert in
justice no less than in jurisprudence. To the interpretations<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">11</span><span class="br"></span>
of statutes and the civil law he always brought flexibility
and a sense of fair play; he was not fonder of setting

Therefore he does not need the monument of a statue; he
has other and greater ones. For this statue will testify to an
honorable death, while those accomplishments of his will
be reminders of a glorious life, with the result that this

you should feel in your hearts as if he were present.
Such is his distress that no man ever grieved more for
the death of an only son than he mourns the death of his father.
Indeed I think it concerns the reputation of Servius
Sulpicius junior that he should appear to have presented
his father with the honor owed to him. To be sure, Servius
Sulpicius could have left no finer memorial than a son in
his own likeness—the likeness of his character, courage,
steadfastness, devotion, and intellect—whose grief can be
comforted by this honor from you or in no way at all.</p>

that if consciousness exists after death, he will prefer a
statue of bronze and on foot to a gilt equestrian statue such
