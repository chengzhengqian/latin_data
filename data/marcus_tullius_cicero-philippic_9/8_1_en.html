<p>[7] For which reasons I make the following motion:
â€œWhereas Servius Sulpicius Rufus, son of Quintus, of the
tribe Lemonia, in a situation of utmost difficulty for the
Republic, being afflicted by a severe and dangerous malady,
set the authority of the senate and the welfare of the
Republic before his own life and struggled against the
strength and severity of his illness in order to reach the
camp of Marcus Antonius, whither the senate had sent
him; and whereas, having almost arrived at the said camp,
overborne by the strength of his illness he lost his life at a
juncture most serious for the Republic; and whereas his
death was in harmony with a most upright and honorable
life, in the course of which Servius Sulpicius was often of
great service to the Republic both as a private citizen and
in public offices; since such a man has met his death while<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">16</span><span class="br"></span>
an envoy in the service of the Republic: that it is resolved
by the senate that a statue, on foot and made of bronze, be
erected to Servius Sulpicius on the Rostra by resolution of
this body; further that his children and descendants be entitled
to a space of five feet in any direction around the said
statue<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL507_89_5" id="target_note_LCL507_89_5"><sup>5</sup></a> to view games and gladiatorial shows, because he
met his death in the service of the Republic, and that this
reason be inscribed upon the pedestal; further that the
consuls Gaius Pansa and Aulus Hirtius, either or both, if
they see fit, direct the city quaestors<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL507_89_6" id="target_note_LCL507_89_6"><sup>6</sup></a> to let a contract for
the construction and placement on the Rostra of the said
pedestal and statue and see to it that the sum agreed be allocated
and paid to the contractor. And whereas in the past
the senate has shown its will in dignifying the funerals of
brave men, that it is resolved that on his very last day he be
borne to burial with all possible ceremony. And whereas<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">17</span><span class="br"></span>
