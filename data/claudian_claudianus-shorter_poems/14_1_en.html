strike the humble willows nor do the modest shrubs deserve the Thunderer’s angry bolt; lofty oaks and aged ashes are bis victims.</p>
<p>Instead of the suppliant’s branch plucked from Minerva’s sacred olive, instead of incense, I offer thee this poem. Have mercy on thy servant. Restore me, even me, to my former state, heal my cruel wounds, bid life and honour return to me. Do thou, who didst overthrow my fortune, build it up again. Telephus came back cured by the magic of Achilles.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL136_201_1" id="target_note_LCL136_201_1"><sup>1</sup></a> The same hand dealt death and healing—an enemy restoring him to health by the assuagement of the very pains he had inflicted.</p>
<p>But if neither my prayers nor my tears can soften thee, spurn the Muses with thy foot and take away my unlucky decorations, deprive me of my rank, cast me aside who was once thy companion. A noteworthy victory this thou hast won over a poor poet; redoubtable indeed the spoils that will grace such a triumph. Let a fellow-countryman’s power overwhelm his wretched fellows.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL136_201_2" id="target_note_LCL136_201_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Be my fate told to our common fatherland and to Pharos, known of all who sail the distant seas, and let Father Nile raise his weeping head from out the flood and mourn my cruel case along the banks of all his seven mouths.</p>
