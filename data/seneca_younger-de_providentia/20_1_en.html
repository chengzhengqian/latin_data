<p>uphill and downhill must he go, be tossed about, and guide his bark through stormy waters; he must keep his course in spite of fortune. Much that is hard, much that is rough will befall him, but he himself will soften the one, and make the other smooth. Fire tests gold, misfortune brave men. See to what a height virtue must climb! you will find that it has no safe road to tread:</p>
<p class="lineGroup">
<span class="line">The way is steep at first, and the coursers strain</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">To climb it, fresh in the early morn. They gain</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">The crest of heaven at noon; from here I gaze</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Adown on land and sea with dread amaze,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">And oft my heart will beat in panic fear.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">The roadway ends in sharp descent—keep here</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">A sure control; ’twill happen even so</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">That Tethys, stretching out her waves below,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Will often, while she welcomes, be affright</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">To see me speeding downward from the height.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL214_41_a" id="target_note_LCL214_41_a"><sup>a</sup></a></span><span class="linebreak"></span>

<p>Having heard the words, that noble youth replied, “I like the road, I shall mount; even though I fall, it will be worth while to travel through such sights.” But the other did not cease from trying to strike his bold heart with fear:</p>
<p class="lineGroup">
<span class="line">And though you may not miss the beaten track,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Nor, led to wander, leave the zodiac,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Yet through the Bull’s fierce horns, the Centaur’s bow</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">And raging Lion’s jaws you still must go.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL214_41_b" id="target_note_LCL214_41_b"><sup>b</sup></a></span><span class="linebreak"></span>

<p>In reply to this he said, “Harness the chariot you offered; the very things that you think affright me urge me on. I long to stand aloft where even the Sun-god quakes with fear.” The groveller and the coward will follow the safe path: virtue seeks the heights.</p>
<p>“But why,” you ask, “does God sometimes allow evil to befall good men?” Assuredly he does not.</p>
