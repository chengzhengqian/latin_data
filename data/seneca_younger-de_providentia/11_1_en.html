Surely the human race has not come so completely under the sway of vice as to cause a doubt whether, if Fate should give the choice, more men would rather be born a Regulus than a Maecenas; or if there should be one bold enough to say that he would rather have been born a Maecenas than a Regulus, the fellow, although he may not admit it, would rather have been born a Terentia<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL214_23_a" id="target_note_LCL214_23_a"><sup>a</sup></a>!</p>
