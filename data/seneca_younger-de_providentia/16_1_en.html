In each, his staunchest member is the one that he has exercised. By enduring ills the mind attains contempt for the endurance of them; you will know what this can accomplish in our own case, if you will observe how much the peoples that are destitute and, by reason of their want, more sturdy, secure by toil. Consider all the tribes whom Roman civilization does not reach—I mean the Germans and all the nomad tribes that assail us along the Danube. They are oppressed by eternal winter and a gloomy sky, the barren soil grudges them support, they keep off the rain with thatch or leaves, they range over ice-bound marshes, and hunt wild beasts for food. Are they unhappy, do you think? There is no unhappiness for those whom habit has brought back to nature.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL214_33_a" id="target_note_LCL214_33_a"><sup>a</sup></a> For what they begin from necessity becomes gradually a pleasure. They have no homes and no restingplaces except those which weariness allots for the day; their food is mean and must be got by the hand; terrible harshness of climate, bodies unclothed,—such for countless tribes is the life which seems to you so calamitous! Why, then, do you wonder that good men are shaken in order that they may grow strong? No tree becomes rooted and sturdy unless many a wind assails it. For by its very tossing it tightens its grip and plants its roots more securely; the fragile trees are those that have grown in a sunny valley. It is, therefore, to the advantage even of good men, to the end that they may be unafraid, to live constantly amidst alarms </p><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL214_33_a"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL214_33_a" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">a</sup>Submission to the course of nature was a fundamental Stoic doctrine.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL214_33_a').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
