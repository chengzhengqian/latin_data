<p>while I make lament, and to the gods (though their witness has availed me naught) yet as I die, in my last hour, I raise my cry. You, ye winds and breezes, yes you, I will call to witness!

But, Minos, I thought that it would be my countrymen who would inflict this abominable treatment upon me, if some mischance first revealed our alliance, when their city walls were breached and I, cruel one, attacked their shrines with fire; and if you were victorious, I thought that the stars would sooner change their courses than I feared you would do such things to me, your captive. Now, now it is wickedness that has conquered all.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL064_475_42" id="target_note_LCL064_475_42">
