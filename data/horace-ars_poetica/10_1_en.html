the flower and fervour of youth, a dame of rank or a bustling nurse, a roaming trader or the tiller of a verdant field, a Colchian or an Assyrian, one bred at Thebes or at Argos.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL194_461_a" id="target_note_LCL194_461_a"><sup>a</sup></a></p>
<p><sup>119</sup>Either follow tradition or invent what is selfconsistent. If haply, when you write, you bring back to the stage the honouring of Achilles,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL194_461_b" id="target_note_LCL194_461_b"><sup>b</sup></a> let him be impatient, passionate, ruthless, fierce; let him claim that laws are not for him, let him ever make appeal to the sword. Let Medea be fierce and unyielding, Ino tearful, Ixion forsworn, Io a wanderer, Orestes sorrowful. If it is an untried theme you entrust to the stage, and if you boldly fashion a fresh character, have it kept to the end even as it came forth at the first, and have it self-consistent.</p>
<p><sup>123</sup>It is hard to treat in your own way what is common: and you are doing better in spinning into acts a song of Troy than if, for the first time, you were giving the world a theme unknown and unsung. In ground open to all you will win private rights,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL194_461_c" id="target_note_LCL194_461_c"><sup>c</sup></a> if you do not linger along the easy and open pathway, if you do not seek to render word for word as a slavish translator, and if in your copying you do not leap into the narrow well, out of which either shame or the laws of your task will keep you from stirring

A poet may make this his own by originality in the handling. Commentators are divided as to whether <span class="italic">communia</span> (1. 128) is identical with <span class="italic">publica materies</span> or not. The language is in the domain of law and as <span class="italic">res communes</span>, things common to all mankind, as the air and sea, differ from <span class="italic">res publicae</span>, things which belong to all citizens of a state, as its roads and theatres, so here <span class="italic">communia</span> covers a larger field than <span class="italic">publica</span>, and denotes characteristics which are common among mankind. These may be compared to the general truths (τὰ καθόλου) of Aristotle (<span class="italic">Poet</span>, ix.), as distinguished from particular ones (ἕκαστον). In Horace it is obvious that <span class="italic">communia</span> does not apply to <span class="italic">lliacum carmen</span>, which does, however, come under the <span class="italic">publica materies</span> of the poet.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL194_461_c').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
