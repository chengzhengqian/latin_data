<p><sup>438</sup>If you ever read aught to Quintilius,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL194_487_b" id="target_note_LCL194_487_b"><sup>b</sup></a> he would say: “Pray correct this and this.” If, after two or three vain trials, you said you could not do better, he would bid you blot it out, and return the ill-shaped verses to the anvil.
