so the poet who often defaults, becomes, methinks, another Choerilus, whose one or two good lines cause laughter and surprise; and yet I also feel aggrieved, whenever good Homer “nods,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL194_481_a" id="target_note_LCL194_481_a"><sup>a</sup></a> but when a work is long, a drowsy mood may well creep over it.</p>
<p><sup>361</sup>A poem is like a picture: one strikes your fancy more, the nearer you stand; another, the farther away. This courts the shade, that will wish to be seen in the light, and dreads not the critic insight of the judge. This pleased but once; that, though ten times called for, will always please.</p>
<p><sup>366</sup>O you elder youth, though wise yourself and trained to right judgement by a father’s voice, take to heart and remember this saying, that only some things rightly brook the medium and the bearable. A lawyer and pleader of middling rank falls short of the merit of eloquent Messalla, and knows not as much as Aulus Cascellius, yet he has a value. But that poets be of middling rank, neither men nor gods nor booksellers ever brooked. As at pleasant banquets an orchestra out of tune, an unguent that is thick, and poppy-seeds served with Sardinian honey,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL194_481_b" id="target_note_LCL194_481_b"><sup>b</sup></a> give offence, because the feast might have gone on without them: so a poem, whose birth and creation are for the soul’s delight, if in aught it falls short of the top, sinks to the bottom. He who cannot play a game, shuns the weapons of the Campus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL194_481_c" id="target_note_LCL194_481_c"><sup>c</sup></a> and, if unskilled in ball or quoit or hoop, remains aloof, lest the crowded circle break out in righteous laughter. Yet the man who knows not how dares to frame verses. Why not? He is free, even free-born, nay, is rated at the fortune of a knight, and stands clear from every blemish.</p>
