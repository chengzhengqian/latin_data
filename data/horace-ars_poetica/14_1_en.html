could you expect of an unlettered throng just freed from toil, rustic mixed up with city folk, vulgar with nobly-born? So to the early art the flute-player added movement and display, and, strutting o’er the stage, trailed a robe in train. So, too, to the sober lyre new tones were given, and an impetuous style brought in an unwonted diction; and the thought, full of wise saws and prophetic of the future, was attuned to the oracles of Delphi.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL194_469_a" id="target_note_LCL194_469_a"><sup>a</sup></a></p>

But it will be fitting so to seek favour for your laughing, bantering Satyrs, so to pass from grave to gay, that no god, no hero, who shall be brought upon the stage, and whom we have just beheld in royal gold and purple, shall shift with vulgar speech into dingy hovels, or, while shunning the ground, catch at clouds and emptiness. Tragedy, scorning to babble trivial verses, will, like a matron bidden to dance on festal days, take her place in the saucy Satyrs’ circle with some little shame.

It was so called, however, because the singers were satyrs, dressed in goat-skins. Satyric drama, the subject of this passage, is closely connected with tragedy, and must not be handled as comedy. It came as a fourth play after a tragic trilogy. Horace treats this form as if it had developed out of tragedy, whereas in fact tragedy is an offshoot from it (see <span class="italic">e.g</span>. Barnett, <span class="italic">The Greek Drama</span>, p. 11).
