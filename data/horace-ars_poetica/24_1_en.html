then if, like a fowler with his eyes upon blackbirds, he fall into a well<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL194_489_a" id="target_note_LCL194_489_a"><sup>a</sup></a> or pit, despite his far-reaching cry, “Help, O fellow-citizens!” not a soul will care to pull him out. And if one should care to lend aid and let down a rope, “How do you know,” I’ll say, “but that he threw himself in on purpose, and does not wish to be saved?” and I’ll tell the tale of the Sicilian poet’s end. Empedocles, eager to be thought a god immortal, coolly leapt into burning Aetna. Let poets have the right and power to destroy themselves. Who saves a man against his will does the same as murder him. Not for the first time has he done this, nor if he is pulled out will he at once become a human being and lay aside his craving for a notable death. Nor is it very clear how he comes to be a verse-monger. Has he defiled ancestral ashes or in sacrilege disturbed a hallowed plot<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL194_489_b" id="target_note_LCL194_489_b"><sup>b</sup></a>? At any rate he is mad, and, like a bear, if he has had strength to break the confining bars of his cage, he puts learned and unlearned alike to flight by the scourge of his recitals. If he catches a man, he holds him fast and reads him to death—a leech that will not let go the skin, till gorged with blood.</p>
