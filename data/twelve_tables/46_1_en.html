<p>[Sidonius: During that very time almost, if I may speak Board-of-Ten-wise,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL329_515_a" id="target_note_LCL329_515_a"><sup>a</sup></a> a law about thirty years’ limitation of time had been proclaimed.]</p>

<p>Gaius: The reason for employing (in <span class="italic">mancipatio</span>) copper (or bronze) and a scales is the customary use at one time of a currency of copper pieces only, these being called ‘asses!’ ‘bars’ (or‘units’), ‘two-pound bars,’ ‘half-bars,’ ‘quarters,’ no gold or silver piece being in use at all, as we can understand from the <span class="italic">Law of the Twelve Tables</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL329_515_b" id="target_note_LCL329_515_b"><sup>b</sup></a>; and the force and power of these pieces rested not in their number but in their weight. * * * The ‘asses’ were each a pound of copper;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL329_515_c" id="target_note_LCL329_515_c"><sup>c</sup></a> and ‘two-pound asses’〈were each two pounds〉, which is the reason why the ‘double as’ was called ‘dupondius’ so to speak ‘two in weight Or’ two-pound bar,’ a name which is still retained in use. Again, the ‘half-as’ and the ‘quarter-as’ were of course defined by weighing in the balance according to their fractional part of a pound * * *. At one time a person paying money did not count this but weighed it. That is why slaves to whom administration of money is entrusted have been given the name ‘dispensatores,’ ‘outweighers.’</p>
