<p>Gaius: Action ‘under solemn deposit’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL329_433_c" id="target_note_LCL329_433_c"><sup>c</sup></a> was the general, form of action; for legal procedure, on all matters in which any other method of procedure had not been provided by law, was conducted ‘under solemn deposit’ . . . And the penal sum in a suit under solemn depost was either five hundred pieces or fifty pieces; that is to say, five hundred as-pieces was the sum when the object of dispute under solemn deposit was valued at one thousand in bronze or more, but fifty pieces when less. For such is the purport of a provision<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL329_433_d" id="target_note_LCL329_433_d"><sup>d</sup></a> which had been made in the <span class="italic">Law of the Twelve Tables.</span> But where the controversy concerned the liberty of a human being, a provision of the same <span class="italic">Law,</span> even though the slave might be very highly valued, nevertheless ordained that fifty pieces be the solemn deposit under which the dispute should be undertaken;
