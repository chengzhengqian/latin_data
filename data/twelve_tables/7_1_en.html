<p><span class="italic">Rights of creditors</span>:</p>
<p>Gellius: Those who have been judged liable for an acknowledged and unpaid debt were granted thirty days in which to find the money for discharging the obligation; and these days the Board of Ten<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL329_437_c" id="target_note_LCL329_437_c"><sup>c</sup></a> called’ iusti, ‘legitimate, as perhaps you might say a kind of’ iustitium ‘(vacation in legal activity); that is, a certain interval and cessation in judicial proceedings between parties; during those days no legal action could be taken amongst any of them. Then, after the limit, if the debtors had not discharged the debt, they were summoned to the [praetor’s]<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL329_437_d" id="target_note_LCL329_437_d"><sup>d</sup></a> court and by him were made over to the persons to whom they were condemned to be adjudged, and they were bound in stocks or fetters. For this, I think, is the meaning of the words of the <span class="italic">Law—</span></p>

Thus the thirty days’ grace are to date from the time when debtor or any other kind of defendant was dealt with legally in civic suit, when debtor or other defendant may have either confessed his debt or other fault, in a magistrates ‘court, whereupon no trial before a <span class="italic">index</span> was necessary, or been found later by the <span class="italic">index</span> to be liable for his fault.
