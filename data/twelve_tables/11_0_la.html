<span class="label">Succession</span>
<p>With regard to Roman wills and guardianship, the following points should here be noted, (i) At one time a father had no power over the disposal of his property after death; it passed to those who had been in his <span class="italic">patria potestas</span>; all the children had equal rights; the grandchildren, if their father was dead, counted as testator’s children. In the earliest times all these inheritors held the property in common, being called <span class="italic">consortes,</span> and they were testator’s <span class="italic">sui heredes</span> (‘his own heirs’; ‘family heirs’; ‘self-successors’—a <span class="italic">suus heres,</span> mention of whom was necessary in a legal will, even when disinherited therein, was a person whom testator has named in his will as <span class="italic">meus heres</span>) a term used later of first successors to an intestate. But in quite early times any of the <span class="italic">consortes</span> could ask for a division of the inheritance, being then said <span class="italic">erctum ciere,</span> ‘to summon to a fencing off’ (see below, item 10 of this Table). Note the difference between <span class="italic">heres</span> and <span class="italic">legatarius</span>: after legal disposal of property by will was instituted, every valid will had to mention the <span class="italic">heres</span> or the <span class="italic">heredes,</span> who were beneficiaries and executors; a <span class="italic">legatarius</span> was a person to whom a <span class="italic">heres</span> must deliver something conferred by the testator, (ii) The kinds of will or <span class="italic">testamentum</span> referred to below in the <span class="italic">Twelve Tables</span> would be the two oldest forms of public will, one sanctioned in</p>

<p>Gaius, <span class="italic">Inst.,</span> I, 144–5: Veteres . . . voluerunt feminas, etsi perfectae aetatis sint, propter animi levitatem in tutela esse . . . (145) exceptis virginibus Vestalibus, quas etiam veteres in honorem sacerdotii liberas esse voluerunt. Itaque etiam Lege XII Tabularum cautum est.</p>
