<p>that it was a crown earned by the slaves or the horses which is said by the law to be won through his chattel has been doubted by no one.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL329_503_a" id="target_note_LCL329_503_a"><sup>a</sup></a></p>
<p>Cicero: A garland won by valour may, by an ordinance of the <span class="italic">Law</span> (<span class="italic">of the Twelve Tables</span>), be deemed to have been laid with impunity on the man who won it and on his father.</p>
<span class="label">8–11</span>
<p>Cicero: Further, it was because it had become a common practice, I suppose, <sup>8</sup>to make more than one funeral for one man and to make and spread more than one bier for him that it was sanctioned by a law that this also should not occur. And although in this law stands the prohibition—</p>
<p>and person must not add gold,</p>
<p>nevertheless see what kindly feeling is shown by the exception<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL329_503_b" id="target_note_LCL329_503_b"><sup>b</sup></a> made by another law—</p>
<p class="lineGroup">
<span class="line indent2"><sup>9</sup>But him whose teeth shall have been fastened</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent3">together with gold, if person shall bury or</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent3">burn him along with that gold, it shall be with</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent3">impunity.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p>
<p>. . . Besides this there are two laws about tombs, of which one makes protection for buildings which belong to private owners, the other for the tombs themselves. <sup>10</sup>For the provision which says: No new pyre or personal burning-mound must be erected nearer than 60 feet to another person’s buildings without consent of owner—seems to suggest fear of disastrous fire. <sup>11</sup>But the provision which says: ‘the forum<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL329_503_c" id="target_note_LCL329_503_c"><sup>c</sup></a> (that is, the entrance-chamber of a tomb) and burning-place<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL329_503_d" id="target_note_LCL329_503_d"><sup>d</sup></a> must not be acquired by usucapio or long usage’—protects the rights of tombs.</p>
<p>These are the provisions which we find in the <span class="italic">Twelve Tables,</span> and they are certainly in accordance with nature, which is the standard of law. All our other rules rest on custom.</p>
<p><span class="italic">Other enactments of Sacred Law are included by modern scholars in Table XII.</span></p>
