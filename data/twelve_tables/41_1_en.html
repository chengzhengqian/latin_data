<p><span class="italic">Intermarriage of patricians and plebeians</span>:</p>
<p>Cicero: When the Board of Ten had put into writing, using the greatest fairness and wisdom, ten tables of laws, they caused to be elected in their stead, for the next year, another Board of Ten, whose good faith and justice have not been praised to a like extent. . . . When they had added two tables of unfair laws, they ordained, by a very inhuman law, that intermarriage, which is usually permitted even between peoples of separate States, should not take place between our plebeians and our patricians.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Intercalation of the Calendar</span>:</p>
<p>Macrobius: Tuditanus in his third book of <span class="italic">Magistracies</span> records that that Board of Ten, who added two tables to the existing ten, brought before the people a bill concerning intercalating into the calendar.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL329_505_aa" id="target_note_LCL329_505_aa"><sup>a</sup></a></p>

<p>Cicero: In these books (sc. <span class="italic">on the ‘Republic</span>’) there is one point of history which you call in question, about Gnaeus Flavius, son of Annius. He did not flourish before the Boards of Ten . . . What good then did he do by publishing the calendar? <a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL329_505_b" id="target_note_LCL329_505_b"><sup>b</sup></a> It is thought that this table was kept hidden at one time in order that the days deemed favourable for official legal business might be available at the request of a few people only.</p>

After each regular intercalation, the matter was entrusted to the pontifices, who tended to intercalate further at will. Thus there was a tendency for the calendar to fall into disorder; and the <span class="italic">Tables</span> may have tried to put this right. Besides this tradition of some step taken by the <span class="italic">Twelve Tables,</span> we have a tradition about a previous effort made by a lex Pinaria of 472, which dealt with <span class="italic">intercalatio.</span> Cf. also next note.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL329_505_aa').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL329_505_bb"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL329_505_bb" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">b</sup>but tradition maintains also that it was Flavius, about the year 304 <span class="sc">b.c.,</span> much later than the Twelve Tables, who published the fasti. (Cic, <span class="italic">pro Mur.,</span> 11, 25; Liv., IX, 46, 5; Macrob., S., I, 15, 9; Plin., <span class="italic">N.H.,</span> XXXIII, 17; Val. Max., II, 5, 2; Diod. Sic, XX, 36.) The <span class="italic">tabula</span> which Cic. here says had been kept hidden would not it seems be a Table of the <span class="italic">Twelve,</span> but a table of <span class="italic">dies fasti.</span> But note that Livy (VI, 1) tells us that when, after the invasion of the Gauls in 390 (387?) <span class="sc">b.c.,</span> the <span class="italic">Twelve Tables</span> were looked up, the pontifices suppressed the enactments which referred to <span class="italic">sacra,</span> being desirous of keeping a hold on the populace. Schoell’s attribution of actual fixtures of <span class="italic">dies fasti</span> (restored from the extant ‘Julian Fasti’) to the <span class="italic">Twelve Tables,</span> Table XI (which he believed to consist wholly of <span class="italic">dies fasti</span>) is, however, not acceptable. All we can say is that the <span class="italic">Twelve Tables</span> seem to have contained, possibly in connexion with intercalation as indicated above, a statute concerning <span class="italic">dies fasti,</span> whatever may have been the fate of this statute afterwards. This statement of Cicero implies that in some fashion at least the <span class="italic">Twelve Tables</span> published <span class="italic">dies fasti</span> (that is to say, a list of days on which the magistrate’s court would be open) which had been until their time in the hands of the pontifices;</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL329_505_bb').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
