<p>Paulus: Both mancipation and surrender in court<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL329_459_a" id="target_note_LCL329_459_a"><sup>a</sup></a> are procedures confirmed by the <span class="italic">Law of the Twelve Tables.</span></p>

<p>Justinian: Articles which have been sold and handed over<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL329_459_b" id="target_note_LCL329_459_b"><sup>b</sup></a> are not acquired by a buyer otherwise than when he has paid the price to the seller or has satisfied him in some other way, that is, by providing a guarantor or a security. This is certainly laid down by a provision in the <span class="italic">Law of the Twelve Tables;</span> yet it may be rightly said to be brought about by international law, that is, by natural law.</p>

<p>Ulpian: A person<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL329_459_c" id="target_note_LCL329_459_c"><sup>c</sup></a> who has been ordained a free man under this condition, namely, if he has bestowed a sum of 10,000 pieces on the heir, though he has been alienated by the heir, shall win his freedom by giving the money to the purchaser; and this is ordained by the <span class="italic">Law of the Twelve Tables.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL329_459_d" id="target_note_LCL329_459_d"><sup>d</sup></a></span></p>

Perhaps the ruling after all refers to handing over of <span class="italic">res</span> conveyed by <span class="italic">mancipatio,</span> for which see pp. 428–9.
