<p>Cicero: To aim or throw a missile is an act of the will; to strike a person whom you did not wish to, an act of chance. Hence comes that well-known substitution of a ram<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL329_493_ba" id="target_note_LCL329_493_ba"><sup>b</sup></a> in your actions at law, ‘if missile has sped from hand, and holder has not aimed it.’</p>

<p><span class="italic">Poisoning</span>:</p>
<p>Gaius: Whoever uses the term ‘venenum,’ drug, should add some expression to show whether it be noxious or beneficial; for ‘medicamenta,’ medicines, also are included in ‘venena.’</p>
<span class="label">26</span>
<p><span class="italic">Nocturnal meetings not permitted</span>:</p>
<p>Porcius Latro: We learn in the <span class="italic">Twelve Tables</span> that provision was made that no person shall hold meetings by night in the city.</p>
<span class="label">27</span>
<p><span class="italic">Associations permitted</span>:</p>
<p>Gaius: ‘Associates’ are persons who belong to the same ‘collegium,’ guild, for which the Greeks use the term ἑταιρία. These are granted by a law (<span class="italic">of the Twelve Tables</span>) the right to pass any binding rule they like for themselves, provided that they cause no violation of public law. But this law appears to have been taken over from a law of Solon.</p>
