Nexum</span>: on the special meaning of this various opinions are held. Down to about 326 <span class="sc">b.c.</span> there were persons called <span class="italic">nexi</span> (‘bound’) who were debtors made (by the procedure <span class="italic">per aes et libram</span> ‘by copper and scales’ as in <span class="italic">mancipatio</span>) bondsmen to their creditors (Varro, <span class="italic">L.L.,</span> VII, 105; Gaius, <span class="italic">Inst.,</span> Ill, 173–5). Probably <span class="italic">nexum</span> was (i) any legal bond, to which the ceremony <span class="italic">per aes et libram</span> came in time to be attached; (ii) particularly the bond by which a debtor incurred a debt; (iii) self-mancipation of debtor by debtor to creditor to be the latter’s bondsman (<span class="italic">nexus</span>) in order to escape judgment for unpaid debt and with prospect of release when the debt was paid.
