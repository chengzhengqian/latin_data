<p><span class="italic">Frauds by patrons</span>:</p>
<p>Servius, on ‘fraud contrived against client’ in Virgil: This comes from the <span class="italic">Law of the Twelve Tables,</span> in which are written the following words—</p>
<p class="lineGroup">
<span class="line indent2"><sup>21</sup>If patron shall have defrauded client, he must</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent3">be solemnly forfeited.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL329_491_a" id="target_note_LCL329_491_a"><sup>a</sup></a></span><span class="linebreak"></span>

<p><span class="italic">Duties of witnesses</span>:</p>
<p>Gellius: Moreover the expression ‘confessi aeris’ (that is, debt of which admission has been made) is in the <span class="italic">Twelve Tables</span> written in these words: (<span class="italic">see Table III above,</span> pp. 436–7) . . . Likewise from the same <span class="italic">Tables</span> comes the following—</p>
<p class="lineGroup">
<span class="line indent2"><sup>22</sup>Whosoever shall have allowed himself to be</span><span class="linebreak"></span>

<p><span class="italic">Penalty for false witness</span>:</p>
<p>Gellius: Or do you think, Favorinus, that, if ever that memorable penalty derived from the <span class="italic">Twelve Tables</span> for false witness had not become obsolete, and if, now too as formerly, a person who had been found guilty of giving false witness, were hurled down from the Tarpeian Rock, liars in giving testimony would have been as many as we now see?</p>
