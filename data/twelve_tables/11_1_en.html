<span class="label"><span class="italic">Guardianship</span></span>
<p>the <span class="italic">comitia calata</span> (part of the <span class="italic">c. curiata</span>) at one of its two meetings every year, the other, <span class="italic">testamentum in procinctu,</span> made by soldiers in military array (<span class="italic">procinctus</span> is ‘a girding up’). The third form of will (a private one <span class="italic">per aes et libram</span> or mancipatory will—cf. pp. 428–9, 446 by which testator mancipated his estate at a nominal sum to a friend for disposal after testator’s death) was apparently instituted later than the <span class="italic">Twelve Tables.</span> In the first form of will the <span class="italic">comitia</span> at least witnessed the will if it did not also ratify it by vote. It is doubtful whether in this form of will a <span class="italic">heres</span> was appointed or whether merely particular legacies were dealt with; if a <span class="italic">heres</span> was appointed, then it probably meant that there was no natural descendant who would be the successor in any case. See Jolowicz, <span class="italic">Historical Introduction,</span> 125–134. From <span class="italic">Dig.</span> XXXVIII, 6, 1, pr. we learn that testamentary succession preceded intestacy in the code, (iii) Guardianship and guardians were <span class="italic">tutela</span> and <span class="italic">tutores</span> respectively where the incapacity was due to youth or to female sex, <span class="italic">cura</span> or <span class="italic">curatio,</span> and <span class="italic">curatores</span> respectively when the wards were lunatics or spendthrifts. <span class="italic">Tutela</span> and <span class="italic">cura</span> existed only over people who were (except for the <span class="italic">tutela</span> or <span class="italic">cura</span>) <span class="italic">sui iuris,</span> their own masters. Cf. H. Lévy-Bruhl, in <span class="italic">Studi Solazzi,</span> 318–323; <span class="italic">Rev. Hist, de droit français et étranger,</span> 1946–7, 142.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Status of women; their property</span>:</p>
<p>Gaius: Our ancestors have seen fit that females, by reason of levity in disposition, should remain in guardianship<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL329_445_a" id="target_note_LCL329_445_a"><sup>a</sup></a> even when they have attained their majority. . . . We except the Vestal Virgins; even our ancestors saw fit, out of respect for the Virgins’ priesthood, that these should be free from control; and so there was also a provision made to this effect in the <span class="italic">Law of the Twelve Tables.</span></p>
