<p>Justinian: Inheritances of persons who die intestate fall first, by the <span class="italic">Law of the Twelve Tables,</span> to self-successors.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL329_449_a" id="target_note_LCL329_449_a"><sup>a</sup></a></p>
<p>Justinian: Both sexes perform equally the function of nature in perpetuating mankind, and by the ancient <span class="italic">Law of the Twelve Tables</span> all were called equally to succession by an ancestor intestate on decease.</p>
<p>Ulpian: If there be no self-successors, the inheritances of free-born persons who have died intestate belong to blood-relations<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL329_449_b" id="target_note_LCL329_449_b"><sup>b</sup></a> . . . if these likewise be lacking, to the nearest of the remaining agnate relations,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL329_449_c" id="target_note_LCL329_449_c"><sup>c</sup></a> that is, kinsmen by blood who are of the male sex and trace their descent through males of the same family; for that is the provision laid down in the following law of the <span class="italic">Twelve Tables—</span></p>
