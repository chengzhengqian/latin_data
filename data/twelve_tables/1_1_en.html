<p>Porphyrio, on ‘And may I call you to witness?’ in Horace: The adversary of the bore in this satire asks Horace if he will allow him to call the poet to witness, his intention being to lay hands on the bore and haul him away to the praetor’s court on the ground that he has not answered a recognisance. On this matter . . . there was a provision made in the <span class="italic">Law of the Twelve Tables</span> in the following words:—<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL329_425_a" id="target_note_LCL329_425_a"><sup>a</sup></a></p>
<p class="lineGroup">
<span class="line indent2"><sup>1</sup>If plaintiff summons defendant to court,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL329_425_b" id="target_note_LCL329_425_b"><sup>b</sup></a> he shall</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">go. If he does not go, plaintiff shall call</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">witness thereto. Then only shall he take</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">defendant by force.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p>
<p>Thus ‘antestari’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL329_425_c" id="target_note_LCL329_425_c"><sup>c</sup></a> means ‘ante-testari’; that is to say, ‘ante quam manus iniciat,’ before he lays hand on him.</p>
