<p>Gaius: Again, the convey able possessions of a woman who was under the guardianship of agnates at one time could not rightfully be acquired by ‘usucapio’ or long usage save such possessions as had been delivered up by her with a guardian’s sanction; and there had been a provision made to this effect by the <span class="italic">Law of the Twelve Tables.</span></p>

The much discussed law cited next from Ulpian, although the later Romans interpreted the words <span class="italic">uti legassit</span> very widely, should probably not be taken as giving unrestricted freedom in making a will. Normally a testator having a family would use words and formulas under advice of a legal expert; these as stated by <span class="italic">testator</span> were to be respected. The enactment may refer to the third form of will indicated in the notice to Table V, given above, pp. 444–5, but the view is generally taken that that form was instituted later than the <span class="italic">Tables.</span> This enactment shows well how great was the need felt for interpretation of the <span class="italic">Tables’</span> wording.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL329_447_aa').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL329_447_b"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL329_447_b" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">b</sup><span class="italic">lēgo</span> in its old sense ‘give direction’ or ‘order.’</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL329_447_b').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL329_447_c"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL329_447_c" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">c</sup><span class="italic">Pecunia</span> may, if we omit <span class="italic">familia</span> here, mean all the objects possessed.
