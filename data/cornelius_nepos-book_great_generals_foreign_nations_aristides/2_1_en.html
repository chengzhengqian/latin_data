Until then, indeed, the Lacedaemonians had held the lead on land and sea, but at that time the arrogance of Pausanias and the justice of Aristides led almost all the Greek cities to seek alliance with the Athenians and choose them as their leaders against the barbarians.</p>
<p><span class="bold">3.</span> In order to repel the Persians more easily, if by any chance they should attempt to renew the war, Aristides was appointed to determine how much money each state should contribute for the purpose of building fleets and raising armies; and in accordance with his decision four hundred and sixty talents were deposited each year at Delos.
