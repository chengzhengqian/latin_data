<p>XVIII. Before you establish an orchard, enclose<span class="marginNote right">How to form an orchard.</span> the extent of land which you wish to have, either with a wall or with a ditch, so that there may be no access to it until the seedlings are reaching maturity,
not only to cattle but also to human beings, except through the entrance. For if the tops be frequently broken off by hand or gnawed off by cattle, they are spoilt forever. It is more practical to arrange the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> trees according to their different kinds, chiefly in order to prevent the weak being overwhelmed by the stronger, since trees are not of the same strength or size and do not grow uniformly. Land which is suitable for vines is also suitable for fruit-trees.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL408_387_a" id="target_note_LCL408_387_a"><sup>a</sup></a></p>
<p>XIX. A year before you wish to establish an<span class="marginNote right">How to make planting-holes.</span> orchard, dig planting-holes; then they will be softened by sun and rain and what you plant will quickly take
root. If, however, you wish to plant the seedlings in the same year as you have made the planting-holes,
dig the latter at least two months beforehand and afterwards fill them with straw and set fire to it. The broader and more open you make the planting-holes, the more luxuriant and abundant will be the fruit. The planting-holes ought to resemble an oven,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> being wider at the bottom than at the top, in order that the roots may spread more widely and that less cold in winter and less heat in summer may enter through the narrow aperture; also on sloping ground the earth which is heaped into the hole is not washed away by the rains. Plant the trees at wide intervals,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span>
