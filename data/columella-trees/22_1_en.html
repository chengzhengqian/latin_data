The husbandmen of today generally observe the beginning of the spring season about March 1st.

It is well to<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span> mark all the small trees with ochre before you transplant them, in order that, when they are planted, they may face the same quarter of the sky towards which they had looked in the nursery-bed; otherwise they
