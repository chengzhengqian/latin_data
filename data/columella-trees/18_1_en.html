quicker they will thrive. But any vines which are planted on slopes must be trenched in such a way that pools may be formed on the higher ground next the stem, and ridges raised to a greater height on the lower ground, so as to contain more water and mud. An old vineyard must not be trenched, lest the roots<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span> which it has on the surface may dry up, nor must it be ploughed, lest the roots be broken off. You should dig it frequently and deeply to a uniform depth and strew the ground with dung or chaff alone before the winter, or else manure it after trenching round the vine itself on the surface only.</p>

Cover the bunches of grapes which face south or west with their own tendrils, so that they may not be burnt by the sun.</p>

dig and stir up the dust after midday. This is the best way of protecting the grapes both from sun and from fog. Clayey ground ought not to be ploughed
