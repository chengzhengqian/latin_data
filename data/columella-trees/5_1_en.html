should cut with a very sharp pruning-knife near a joint, so that the section has a rounded surface, in such a way as not to damage the “eye,” and you should immediately smear it with ox-dung. You should then fix the shoot upright in earth which has been well trenched and manured, in such a way that not less than four “eyes” are hidden. It will be enough<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span> to leave the distance of one foot each way between the plants. When they have taken root, they should be repeatedly trimmed back, so that they do not have to give nourishment to more shoots than they ought. Also they should be dug round as often as possible and they should not be touched by any iron tool. In the twenty-fourth month they should be cut back, and they should be transplanted after the thirty-sixth month.</p>

The flavour can be ascertained, as we described in our first book, if you soak the earth in water and taste the water when the earth has gone to the bottom. Sandy soil under which there is sweet moisture is the most suitable for vines. Similar soil under which there is tufa is excellent; earth which has been heaped up after being brought from elsewhere is equally beneficial. Gravel, too, which has sweet clay underneath it, suits vines; but any soil which is split during the summer is useless for vines and trees. The soil under the surface feeds the vine
