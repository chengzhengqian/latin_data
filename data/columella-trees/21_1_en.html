quickly and do not touch it with the knife for three years. When thirty-six months are completed, you will shape the tree for receiving the vine and lop off the superfluous branches and leave every alternate bough so as to form a sort of ladder, and you will prune the tree every other year. In the sixth year, if the tree seems now to be firmly established, you will “wed” the vine to it in the following way. Leave a space of one foot from the base of the tree, then, having made a furrow four feet long and three feet deep and two and a half feet wide, you will allow it to be buffeted by the weather for at least two months. Then about March 1st take from the nursery a vine not<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span> less than ten feet long and spread it out flat and prop it up and attach it to the tree. In the following year do not prune it, but in the third year reduce it to a single rod and leave only a few “eyes,” so it may not creep up to a great height before it has gained strength. Then when it has attained an ample growth, distribute the firm-wood shoots over every “story” of the tree, in such a way, however, as not to burden the vine, but so as to allow the shoots which are reliable and very strong to grow freely. You must be just as careful in binding up a vine which is supported on a tree as in pruning it; for it is on this that the strength of the fruit chiefly depends, and a vine which has been attached to a tree with firm ties and in suitable places lasts longer. Therefore, every year you should supplement the pruning by seeing that the ties are renewed and the vine trained over suitable branches.</p>
