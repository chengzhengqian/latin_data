dried up by the sun and that by taking up the moisture which the earth supplies, it may in a better manner send out firm-wood shoots. But a vine which is of a bad kind and unfruitful and of which the upper parts are meagre and rotten, if its roots are put sufficiently deep in the ground, will undergo engrafting very successfully, provided that the lower part, after having been dug round and stripped bare, is cut off next to the ground so that it does not stand out above it when soil has been heaped upon it.</p>
<p>VII. There are three kinds of propagation chiefly<span class="marginNote right">On the propagation of vines.</span> in use: one in which a rod which has sprung from the mother-vine is planted in a furrow, a second in which the mother-vine itself is laid down flat and distributed branch by branch over a number of props, and a third in which the vine is cleft into two or three parts according to the number of different rows over which it has to be trained. The last method is very slow in thriving, because the vine, being divided up, loses its inner pith. Since we have suggested several methods, we will show how each should be carried out.</p>
<p>When you wish to press down a rod from the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> mother-vine into the ground, you should make a planting-hole measuring four feet each way so that the layer is not damaged by the roots of another vine. Then you should leave four “eyes,” extending to the bottom of the planting-hole, that roots may spring from them; scrape the rest of the rod, that is, the part nearest to the mother-vine, so that it may not produce superfluous shoots. The<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> parts which lie in the other direction, and should project above the ground, you should not allow to have more than two or at most three “eyes.” Pare
