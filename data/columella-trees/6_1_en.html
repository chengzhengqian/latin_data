Moderately loose soil is best for vines; but soil which lets the rain through or, on the other hand, retains it for a long time near the surface, must be avoided. The most beneficial is that which is moderately loose near the surface and dense round the roots. On mountains and slopes vines only thrive with difficulty but produce wine of a lasting and excellent flavour. Vines which grow on damp, flat ground are very strong but produce wine of a weak flavour which does not keep. Since we have now given instructions about vine-plants and conditions of soil, we will now discuss the different kinds of vines.</p>
<p>IV. Vines take a great delight in trees, because<span class="marginNote right">On sites for vineyards.</span> they naturally have an upward tendency; also in that position they grow more abundant firm-wood and ripen their fruit evenly. This kind of vine we call a “tree-vine” and we will speak of it at greater length in its proper place. There are generally three types of vine in use; that which is trained on a trellis, that which spreads along the ground, and thirdly that which is in use among the Carthaginians and stands by itself like a tree. The last type as<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> compared with the trellised vine is in some respects inferior, in others superior. The trellised vine is more open to the air and bears its fruit higher up and ripens it more evenly, but its culture is more difficult; its arrangement is such that the plough can be used round it and it attains a greater degree of fruitfulness,
because it can be given more frequent attention and at less cost. However, the type which spreads directly along the ground produces a large quantity
