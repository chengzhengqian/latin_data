dealt at length with vineyards, let us now give directions about trees used for supporting them.</p>
<p>XVI. The poplar is the tree chiefly used for supporting<span class="marginNote right">How to form plantations of trees to support the vines.</span> the vine, and next to it the elm, and then
the ash-tree. The maple is not approved of by most people, because it has not a suitable leaf. The kind
of elm which the country folk call Atinian,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL408_381_a" id="target_note_LCL408_381_a"><sup>a</sup></a> is the noblest and most luxuriant and has an abundance of foliage. It is chiefly to be planted in rich soil but can also be planted in moderately rich ground. If places which are rough and waterless have to be planted with trees, neither the poplars nor the elms are so suitable as mountain-ashes; these are wild ash-trees but with slightly, however, broader leaves than the other ash-trees,
and their leaves are not inferior to those produced by elms. Goats and sheep, indeed, have a<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> greater liking for their leaves than any other.</p>
<p>He, therefore, who wishes to establish a plantation of trees for supporting vines, should make planting-holes
measuring four feet each way a year before the trees are planted. Then about March 1st he should plant an elm, and a poplar or a mountain-ash in the same planting-hole, so that if the elm should fail, the poplar or the mountain-ash may take its place; if, however, both trees have lived, one should be taken up and planted elsewhere. Trees for supporting vines are best arranged at intervals of forty feet; for then both the trees themselves and the vine trained upon them will thrive better and produce better fruit; crops, too, which are grown in the plantation will suffer less harm from the shade. Dig frequently round the supporting tree which you<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> have planted, so that it may reach maturity more
