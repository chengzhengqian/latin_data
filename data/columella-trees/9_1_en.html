will allow the branches to grow freely, as you do with a tree, and be careful that it takes a circular shape with as round a form as possible; for, besides having a pleasing appearance when so arranged, it is also subjected to less strain, since, being stabilized by being equally balanced on all sides, it rests upon itself. It will be enough, if, when first the branches are allowed to grow, one “eye” is left on each shoot, so that the vine may not be overweighted at first. After this pruning, when you have chosen which<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> shoots you are going to leave, you should dig up the vineyard deeply and uniformly with mattocks, or if it has been laid out with sufficiently wide spaces, you should plough it.</p>
<p>From the 15th of October you should begin to trench the vineyard and so have it trenched before mid-winter. During the winter do not cultivate the vines, unless you wish to trace the roots which make their appearance during the trenching; for that will be the best time to cut them back, but in such a way as not to damage the stem of the vine but preferably leave about an inch from the mother-tree
and so cut back the root. If the root is pared away more closely, besides the fact that it wounds and therefore harms the vine, more roots also make their way out from the actual scar. Thus it is best<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span> that a small portion of the root should be left and that thus the furthest parts, which the country folk call the “summer roots”, should be cut back. These, when thus cut back, dry up and do not hamper the vines any more. The shoots can also be cut during the winter, with the additional advantage that, having been destroyed by the cold, they are less likely to grow again. When the trenching is finished,
