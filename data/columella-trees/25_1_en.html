deposit small bundles of twigs of the thickness of a manâ€™s arm on the right and left of them reaching to the bottom of the planting-hole, so as to project a little above the ground, so that you may supply the root with water without much trouble. Plant trees and seedlings with roots in the autumn about October 15th; but set cuttings or branches in the spring before the trees begin to bud. But to prevent the caterpillar from causing trouble to fig-tree plants, bury in the bottom of the planting-hole a cutting from a mastic-tree so that the top of it faces downwards.</p>
<p>XXI. Do not plant a fig-tree in cold weather; it<span class="marginNote right">When the fig-tree should be planted.</span> likes places exposed to the sun, pebbly, gravelly and sometimes even stony. In this sort of ground it quickly thrives, if you have made roomy and suitable planting-holes. The several kinds of fig-trees, even if they differ in flavour and habit, yet are planted in one way but in dissimilar positions according to the difference of soil. In cold districts and where the weather is wet in autumn you should plant early fig-trees, so that you may gather the fruit before the rain comes; in warm places you should plant late winter fig-trees. But if you wish to make a fig-tree ripen late, though it does not naturally do so, shake down the fruit while the little figs are small; it will then produce a second crop and put off its ripening until late winter. Sometimes, too, when the trees<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> begin to bear leaves, it is beneficial to cut off the uppermost tops of the fig-tree with a very sharp knife; the trees will then become stronger and more prolific.
