<p>XXIII. It is right to plant the pomegranate in the<span class="marginNote right">How to plant pomegranate-trees.</span> spring up to April 1st. If it bears fruit which is bitter and not sweet enough this will be remedied by the following method: moisten the roots with sow-dung
and human ordure and stale human urine. This
will both render the tree fertile and during the first years cause the fruit to have a vinous taste, and afterwards, too, makes it sweet and its kernels soft. We ourselves have mixed just a little laser from Cyrene<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL408_395_a" id="target_note_LCL408_395_a"><sup>a</sup></a> with wine and thus smeared the uppermost tops of the trees. This has remedied the tartness of the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> fruit. To prevent pomegranates from bursting on the trees, the approved remedy is to place three stones at the very root of the tree when you plant it; if however, you have already planted it, sow squill near the roots of the tree.

may be fruitful when they have now come to maturity, trench deeply round them and split the trunk close to the very root and in the fissure insert a wedge of pitch-pine and leave it there; then, when the trenching has been filled in, scatter ashes over the soil.</p>
