than four inches. In doing so take into account the size of the tree and the quality of the bark. When<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span> you have put in all the scions that the tree will stand, bind the tree with elm-bark or osiers. Next with well-worked clay mixed with chaff daub the whole of the wound and the space between the grafts so that the scions project two inches, and put moss on the top of the clay and bind it on so that rain may not penetrate. If the tree which you wish to engraft is small,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">6</span><span class="br"></span> cut it off near the ground so that it projects a foot and a half above the soil; then, after cutting it down, carefully smooth the wound and split the stock in the middle a little way with a sharp knife, so that there is a cleft three inches deep in it. Then insert a wedge in this cleft as far as it will allow and thrust down into it scions which have been pared away on both sides in such a way as to make the bark of the scion exactly meet the bark of the tree. When you have carefully fitted in the scions, pull out the wedge; then bind and daub the tree in the manner described above. Next heap up earth round the tree right up to the graft itself; this will give the best protection from wind and heat.</p>
<p>The third kind of grafting, being the most delicate,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">7</span><span class="br"></span> is not suited to every kind of tree. Generally speaking those trees admit of this kind of grafting which have moist, juicy and strong bark, like the fig-tree; for this yields a great abundance of milky juice and has a stout bark, and so a graft can be very successfully inserted by the following method. You should<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">8</span><span class="br"></span> seek out young and healthy branches on the tree from which you wish to take your grafts, and you should look on them for a bud which has the appearance of being good and gives a sure promise of producing
