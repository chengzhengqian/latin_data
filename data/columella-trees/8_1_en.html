By this method the vines will become accustomed to strike their roots downwards. The stones give the roots space into which they can creep and in winter they keep away the water while they provide moisture in the summer; the grape-skins force the vines to put forth their roots. Since we have given directions about the way in which the vines should be planted, we will now give instructions about their cultivation.</p>

The country folk call this second shoot the “guardian.” Then next year, when you prune the vine, you should leave the better rod on each plant and remove the others.

If, however, you wish the vine to stand by itself, you
