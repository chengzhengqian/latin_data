with lees of oil and pour it over the roots together with human ordure: this makes the fruit more abundant and the inner part of the fig more attractive in appearance and fuller.</p>
<p>XXII. You should plant the almond-tree, since it<span class="marginNote right">How to plant nut-trees.</span> is the first nut-tree to blossom, when the constellation of the Bear rises on about Feb. 1st. It requires warm, hard and dry ground; for if you plant it in places which differ from this kind of nature, it immediately rots. Before you set a nut-tree, you should soak it in honey-water which should not be too sweet; it will then, when it comes to maturity, produce fruit of a pleasanter flavour, and meanwhile it will grow better and quicker. Place three nuts so<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> as to form a triangle and make the sharper end point downwards, because it is from there that it puts out its roots, and let the nuts be at least a handâ€™s breadth away from one another, and an apex<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL408_393_a" id="target_note_LCL408_393_a"><sup>a</sup></a> of the triangle face towards the west. Every nut sends out one root which creeps forth in a single stem; when the root reaches the bottom of the planting-hole,
it is checked by the hardness of the ground and is bent back and, extending like the branches of a tree, it puts forth other roots.</p>
<p>You can make an almond and a hazel into Tarentine nuts in the following manner. In the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> planting-hole in which you intend to sow the nut place fine soil to a depth of half a foot and throw in there fennel-seed. When the fennel has grown up, split it and secrete in the pith of it an almond or a filbert without its shell, and then cover it over with earth. Do this before March 1st or even between March 7th and 15th. You should plant the walnut, pine-nut and chestnut at the same time of year.</p>
