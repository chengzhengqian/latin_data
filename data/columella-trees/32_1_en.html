kind of tree. That we may not weary our readers<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> with too long a discourse, we will submit, as it were, a single example by following which anyone can graft any kind of scion upon any kind of tree.</p>
<p>Dig a trench measuring four feet each way at such<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> a distance from an olive-tree that the ends of the branches of the olive-tree can reach it; then plant a small fig-tree in the trench, and be careful that it grows strong and healthy. After three or five years, when it has made enough growth, bend down the branch of the olive-tree which seems to be the healthiest, and bind it to the stock of the fig-tree. Then remove the rest of the small branches and leave only those tops which you wish to engraft; next cut the fig-tree and smooth off the wound and split it in the middle with a wedge. Then pare the tops of the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span> olive, as they still adhere to the mother-tree, on both sides and fit them into the cleft in the fig-tree, and take away the wedge and carefully tie them to the fig-tree, so that no force may tear them away. After an interval of three years the fig-tree will coalesce with the olive-tree, and, finally, in the fourth year, when they have become properly united, you will cut off the olive-branches from the mother-tree as though they were the small branches of a layer. This is the way in which any kind of scion is grafted on any kind of tree.</p>
