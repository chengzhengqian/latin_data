<p>IX. There is another kind of grafting which produces<span class="marginNote right">How bunches of grapes may have berries of different kinds.</span> bunches of grapes in which berries of different
kinds and flavours and colours are found. It is carried out in the following manner: Take four or five or, if you like, even more rods of different kinds
and, after arranging them carefully and uniformly in a bunch, tie them together and then insert them, packed closely together, in an earthenware pipe or a horn, so that they project a little way at both ends; loosen the parts which project and then place them in a planting-hole and cover them with well-manured soil, and water them until they produce “eyes.” After two or three years, when the rods have<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> cohered and formed a unity, you will break up the pipe and cut the vine with a saw about the middle of the stem, where it shall seem to have formed the closest mass, and smooth off the cut; then heap over it fine soil, so as to cover the cut to a depth of three inches. From the stock thus formed, when it has put forth stalks, allow the two best to grow and discard the rest; in this manner bunches of grapes will grow of the kind which we have suggested.</p>
<p>You should split a mallet-shoot in such a way that<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> the “eves” may not be hurt, and scrape away all the pith; then bind it closely together as it was before in such a way as not to damage the “eyes,” and then plant it in well-manured earth and water it. When it begins to put forth stalks, dig round it frequently and deeply. When the vine has come to full growth it will produce grapes without pips.</p>
