that they may put forth firm-wood from the upper part of the rod. Then eventually after three years lop the rod away from the mother-vine and train to its own stake the part which you have cut away from the mother-vine and form it into a separate vine. Gradually fill up in a minimum of three years the planting-hole in which the layer is; cut away the surface roots and dig the ground frequently.</p>
<p>VIII. When you wish to engraft a vine, cut off<span class="marginNote right">How to make vines yield plentifully by grafting.</span> fruit-bearing shoots of the best quality from a mother-vine at the time when they begin to put forth “eyes” and when the wind is in the south. A shoot which you are using as a graft should be taken from the top of the vine and be round with a large number of good knots in it. Then leave the three soundest knots and below the third “eye” pare away a space of two inches with a very fine knife on both sides without damaging the pith so as to form a wedge. Then make a cut in the vine which<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> you are going to engraft and smooth off the wound, and then make clefts and insert in them the shoots which you have got ready up to the point at which they have been pared down, in such a way that the bark of the slip meets the bark of the vine evenly all round. Any graft which you have put in, you should carefully bind with a withy or the bark of an elm, and you should smear the cut with well-kneaded
clay mixed with chaff and bind it, so that neither water nor wind can penetrate into it; then put moss outside the clay and bind it round. This<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> provides moisture and does not allow it to dry up. Below the insertion and the binding make a slight wound with a sharp pruning-knife on both sides of the vine, so that the moisture may flow out from these
