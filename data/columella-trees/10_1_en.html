every third year before the winter comes, it will be advisable to have put not less than two <span class="italic">sextarii</span> of soaked manure, but not pigeon-dung, round the roots of the vines; but if you put more than a <span class="italic">hemina,</span> it will harm the vines. When winter is over, you should dig round the ground which you have trenched. Before the spring equinox, which<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span> occurs on March 25th, you should level the soil which has been trenched. After April 13th you should heap the soil round the vine; then in the summer you should hoe the ground as often as possible. Five labourers can trench a <span class="italic">iugerum</span> of vineyard in a day, and the same number can dig it up, and three can hoe it. Four labourers can prune a <span class="italic">iugerum</span> of a thriving and well-established vineyard, and six can tie up the vines in a day. When the vines<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">6</span><span class="br"></span> grow upon trees no definite calculation of this kind can be made beforehand, because the varying size of the trees does not allow a fixed calculation in terms of labourers. Some people are of opinion that a vine which has been transplanted should not be pruned during the next year but should be cleared in the following year and one of the rods, which we allow to grow, cut back to the third “eye”: then in the third year, if the vine has thrived properly, it should be allowed to grow at one more “eye,” and in the fourth year two “eyes” should be added at the next pruning, and finally in the fifth year the vine should be placed upon the trellis. This same method of culture we have ourselves tried and approved.</p>
<p>VI. Do not cut back an old vine, if it has roots on the surface; otherwise you will find even the new vine, which will grow from the cut, of no use, since its roots float, as it were, on the surface of the ground, and you
