vine; for water, as soon as it is allowed to stagnate, causes the vine to decay and breeds worms and other creatures which eat into the firm-wood. But make your cuts round, for then they scar over more quickly. Cut away all shoots which are too broad,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> or old, or badly grown, or twisted; but allow those to grow which are young and fruitful and sometimes a suitable off-shoot, if the part of the vine which is above ground is not thriving well, and conserve the branches. Finish the pruning as quickly as possible. Shoots which are old and dry and cannot be cut away with a pruning-knife, you should pare away with a sharp axe. On land which is lean and dry you should prune a weak vine before the shortest day, and come back about Feb. 1st to any part of the vineyard which you have not pruned. Between Dec. 13th and Jan. 13th it is not advisable that a vine or a tree should be touched with the knife. When you prune a vine,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> make the cut between two “eyes”; for if you make it near the “eye” itself, it will suffer and will not put forth firm-wood. The scar should always face downwards; it will then not suffer from water or the sun’s heat and will catch the moisture in the right way. On rich soil and in a thriving vineyard you should leave more “eyes” and top branches, but fewer on poor soil. Whenever you find a branch lacking on a vine, take a sharp pruning-knife and strike deeply on the spot with the point once or twice to the depth of about an inch. However long a branch may be, take care not to remove it entirely unless it is quite dried up.</p>
