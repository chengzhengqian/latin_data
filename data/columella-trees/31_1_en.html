Also choose the healthiest branch on the tree which you wish to use for grafting and make an incision, enclosing the same dimensions as before, and remove the bark from the firm-wood then apply the “eye” which you have taken from the other tree to the space which you have laid bare, so that the scutcheon fits into the part which you have cut round. Having done this, bind the bud well all round in such a<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">9</span><span class="br"></span> way as not to damage it; then daub the edges and the ties round them with clay, leaving a space where the “eye” may bud without hindrance. If the firm-wood in which you have inserted the graft has any shoots and branches, above it cut everything away, so that there may be nowhere to which the sap may be drawn away and benefit another part rather than the graft. After the twenty-first day unbind the scutcheon. This kind of grafting is very successful with the olive-tree also.
