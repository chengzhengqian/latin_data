cuts rather than overflow from the actual graft; for too much moisture is harmful and does not allow the slips which have been engrafted to take hold. Some of the ancients think that a hole ought to be bored in the vine and then the slips put in after being smoothly pared away; but we have carried out the same process by a better method. For the old-fashioned auger creates sawdust and therefore burns the part which it perforates and, being burnt, it rarely ever takes hold of the slips which are inserted. We, on the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span> other hand, have adapted what we call the Gaulish auger for this kind of grafting. This makes a hollow without causing burning, because it produces shavings instead of saw-dust. So when we have cleaned out the hole which has been bored, we insert the slips after they have been pared on every side and then daub them round. This kind of graft thrives very readily. You should, then, have the grafting of your vines completed about the equinox. Engraft moist places from a white grape, dry places from a black.</p>
<p>You should water vines which produce very little<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span> fruit with sharp vinegar mixed with ashes and daub the stock itself with the same ashes. But if the vines do not bring to maturity the fruit which they display, but the grapes dry up before they grow mellow, they will be corrected by the following method: when the berries have reached the size of pulse, cut down the vine to the very root and daub the cut with sharp vinegar and similarly with stale urine mixed with earth, and water the roots with the same mixture, and dig round frequently. This method will cause the growth of firm-wood branches, and it is these which bear the fruit.</p>
