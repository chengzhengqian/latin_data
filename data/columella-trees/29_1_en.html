method of these graftings, we will also set forth another which we have discovered.</p>
<p>You should engraft all other trees as soon as they<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> begin to put forth buds and when the moon is waxing, but the olive-tree about the spring equinox and until April 13th. See that the tree from which you intend to graft and are going to take scions for grafting is young and fruitful and has frequent knots and, as soon as the buds begin to swell, choose from among the small branches which are a year old those which face the sunâ€™s rising and are sound and have the thickness of the little finger. The scions should<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> be forked. You should cut the tree, into which you wish to insert the scion, carefully with a saw in the part which is most healthy and free from scars, and you will take care not to damage the bark. Then, when you have cut away part of the tree, smooth over the wound with a sharp iron instrument; then put in a kind of wedge of iron or bone between the bark and firm-wood to a depth of not less than three inches, but do so gently, so as not to damage or break the bark. Afterwards with a sharp pruning-knife pare down the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span> scions, which you wish to insert, at the bottom end of them to the depth to which you have inserted the wedge but in such a way as not to damage the pith or the bark on the other side. When you have got the scions ready, pull out the wedge and immediately push down the scions into the holes which have been formed by driving in the wedge between the bark and the firm-wood. Put in the scions by inserting the ends where you have pared them down and in such a way that they stand out six inches from the tree. Fix two or three little branches as grafts in one tree, provided that the space between them is not less
