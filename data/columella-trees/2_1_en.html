put into the ground cannot be guaranteed to possess noble qualities, since it is doubtful whether the vendor took pains in the selection of seeds. Again, a plant which is brought from a distance arrives not properly acclimatized to our soil, and, therefore, being an alien from a foreign land, thrives only with difficulty. It is, therefore, best to make a nursery<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span> in the same ground in which you are going to plant your vine or at any rate in the close neighbourhood. The nature of the ground is of great importance. For if you are going to cover hill-sides with vines or trees to support vines, you must take care that your nursery is placed in a very dry spot and that the vine may then become accustomed, as it were, from infancy, to only a small amount of moisture; otherwise, when you transplant it from a moist to a dry place, being deprived of its former nourishment it will fade away. On the other hand, if you possess flat, marshy lands,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span> it will be best to make your nursery too on similar ground and accustom the vine to a generous amount of moisture; for when it is transplanted from dry to watery ground, it is certain to rot away. It will be enough if the actual flat and juicy land which you choose for your nursery is turned over with a trenching-spade,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL408_345_a" id="target_note_LCL408_345_a"><sup>a</sup></a> which the country people call a “two-foot-and-a-half.” Trenching of this kind goes to a depth of more than a foot and a half but less than two feet. A <span class="italic">iugerum</span> of land can be turned up in one day by fifty labourers: but you will need sixty<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">6</span><span class="br"></span> labourers to trench a hill and sloping ground which measures a <span class="italic">iugerum</span> if you trench it to a depth of not less than two feet; or, if you wish to make your nursery in the actual place where you intend to plant
