of wine but not of a good quality. It is best to plant vines in well-trenched ground, but it is sometimes and in some localities better to set them in furrows; sometimes also they are put into planting-holes. But, as I have already said, a <span class="italic">iugerum</span> can be trenched in a day to a depth of three feet by eighty labourers, whereas<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> one labourer in the same time digs a furrow in the earth two feet deep and seventy feet long. One labourer in a day makes eighteen three-foot planting-holes, that is, measuring three feet in each dimension; or, if one wishes to plant the vines less closely, a single labourer can make twelve four-foot planting-holes,
that is to say, measuring four feet each way, or twenty measuring two feet each way. Care, however, must be taken that in dry and sloping ground the vines are planted deeper than on damp, level ground. Also, if we are going to plant out a vineyard in planting-holes or furrows, it will be best to make our planting-holes or furrows a year beforehand.</p>
<p>In a vineyard which is planted very closely, the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span> vines are planted with five feet between them in every direction; but if more widely, at intervals of seven or eight feet. The widest space ever allowed, in order that a plough may be easily used, is fixed at ten feet. This arrangement of the vines certainly takes up a greater extent of ground but it produces the strongest and most abundant fruit. When you are putting in the seedlings, you should dig the bottom of the planting-hole or furrow with hoes and make it soft. You should see that the vine which you are planting faces east when it is fastened to the support. In the bottom of the planting-hole you should place stones about five pounds in weight in such a way as not to press upon the vine but so as to
