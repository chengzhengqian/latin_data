away the other “eyes” which are hidden in the ground except the four lowest, so that the vine may not put forth roots on the surface. Propagated in this manner the vine will quickly thrive, and in the third year will be separated from the mother-vine. But if you wish to lay the vine itself on the ground,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span> carefully dig round it near the root, so as not to damage it, and train it along the ground without breaking off the root. When you have put it in position and have seen how far it can reach, you will make a single furrow into which to lower the entire vine; you will then make branches, as it were, leading out of the furrow along which the vine may be spread out as each rod has required, and then you will cover the whole over with earth. But if the vine<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span> has very little firm-wood and will have to be trained to several different rows and cannot reach the stakes to which it is being conducted without being divided, you will be careful to cleave it with the sharpest possible pruning-knife at the point where it forks and also with a sharp instrument smooth off the cut, if it seems to be unevenly cleft at any point. Thus separated it will be possible to distribute it over several rows.</p>
<p>The following method of propagation too which we<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">6</span><span class="br"></span> have discovered has its advantages, if at any time a vine is missing in a row and the rod which has been pressed into the bottom of the planting-hole is not tall enough to be pressed back and set up above ground. Do not be concerned at its shortness but press down and cover up the rod, of whatever kind it be, the top of which reaches the bottom of the planting-hole; then allow the “eyes” which are nearest to the mother-vine itself to grow freely, so
