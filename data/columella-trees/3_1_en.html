your vineyard, you will need eighty labourers to trench a <span class="italic">iugerum</span> to the depth of three feet, provided, however, that no stones or tufa or other more difficult material causes obstruction. For the latter task it is quite uncertain how many labourers the work may require; but we are now speaking of ground which consists of nothing but soil.</p>
<p>II. When the trenching is finished, in the month of<span class="marginNote right">On the choice of vine-seeds and plants.</span> February or the early part of March, you must choose your plants. The best are those which are gathered from vines which have been marked; for
he who is anxious to make good nurseries, about the time of the vintage, marks those vines which have brought large, sound fruit to maturity, with red ochre mixed with vinegar, so that it may not be washed off by the rain. This he does not merely one year, but inspects the same vines at three or even more successive vintages to see if they continue to be fruitful; for it is thus clear that the fruit is the result of the generous quality of the vines and not due to the productivity of any particular year. If the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> vines follow the same course for several vintages, plants taken from such will produce an abundance of good wine. For grapes of whatever kind they are which come to maturity sound and unspoiled, provide wine of a far better flavour than those which are forced on by the heat or some other cause.</p>
<p>III.

Those taken from the “loins” of the vine are considered the best, next those taken from the “shoulders,”
and third those taken from the top of the vine. These take root very quickly and are more prolific, but they also grow old more rapidly. I do not hold
