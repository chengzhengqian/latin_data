the water mix it with chaff. Gut shrub-trefoil which you wish to dry about the month of September, when the seed begins to grow large; then keep it in the sun for a few hours until it withers; then dry it in the shade, and so store it.</p>
<p>XXIX. Plant the willow and the broom when the<span class="marginNote right">The cultivation of willows, broom and reeds.</span> moon is waxing about March 1st. The willow requires a damp situation, the broom one which is dry; both, however, can be conveniently planted
round a vineyard, because they produce bands suitable for tying up vine-shoots.</p>
<p>Reeds are best planted by means of roots which some people call bulbs, others “eyes”. As soon as you have trenched the ground for the second time with a double mattock, cut off the root of the reed with a sharp pruning-knife and set it when rain is threatening. Some people lay whole plants of reeds<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> flat on the ground, because a plant when thus laid out puts forth reeds from all its knots, but this method generally produces a reed which is frail, thin and low-growing. That method of planting is better which we explained to you before; but it is a good plan every year, as soon as you have cut the reeds, to dig up the ground deeply and uniformly and thus to water it.</p>
<p>XXX. He who intends to grow the violet should<span class="marginNote right">How to grow violets and roses.</span> form flower-beds of soil which has been well manured and trenched to the depth of at least a foot. Next he should have plants of a year’s growth set in little trenches a foot deep made before March 1st. Seeds,
on the other hand, of violet, like the other plants that are pot-herbs, are sown in beds at two seasons, spring or autumn. It is cultivated in the same manner as all the other pot-herbs by weeding, hoeing and also by watering from time to time.</p>
