for a patron after losing the dispute? Really, I was a

look around myself a hundred times when I saw
it. As for that crook, there’s a place among the myrtle<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">65</span><span class="br"></span>
trees, from there he ambushed me. I know it as surely
as I know that I’m standing here: I’ve lost the booty I
caught, unless I prepare some countercounsel similar to
myself.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL328_409_6" id="target_note_LCL328_409_6"><sup>6</sup></a> I’ll stand here and watch if I can see any friend.
