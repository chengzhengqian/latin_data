<p><span class="italic">Three more fragments are attested, but it is unclear if they
belong to our play and if so, where they fit. In fr. i, Porphyry
(ad Hor. carm. 1.38.7) attests a neuter form of the noun for
“myrtle tree,” but without giving any context; as he also quotes
from the Vidularia in this passage, the neuter form could come
from here as well. Fr. ii comes
from the palimpsest (folio 485–
86, part of a bifolio), and even though it cannot be excluded that
the letters belong to a lost part of the Cistellaria, they are more
likely to be part of our play. Fr. iii is ascribed to the Aulularia
by Nonius (523 L.), but that play contains no pimp. Leo assigned
the fragment to the Vidularia, although it could also
come from a play outside the Varronian canon or from a different
writer altogether.</span></p>

lioness gives birth only once in her life, and to only one cub. This ancient
belief is obviously false, otherwise the species would become
extinct. A lioness can give birth several times during her lifespan, and
normally produces between one and four cubs per birth.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL328_415_10').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
